However, the reports on the effects of ALA are controversial. For this reason, the purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of 600 mg/day of ALA on the markers of oxidative stress (OxS) and inflammation and RAGE in older adults with T2DM. A quasiexperimental study was carried out with a sample of 135 sedentary subjects (98 women and 37 men) with a mean age of 64 +/- 1 years, who all had T2DM. The sample was divided into three groups: (i) experimental group (EG) with 50 subjects, (ii) placebo group (PG) with 50 subjects, and control group (CG) with 35 subjects. We obtained the following measurements in all subjects (pre- and posttreatment): glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), 8-isoprostane, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total antioxidant status (TAS), and inflammatory (CRP, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) markers. Regarding the effect of ALA on HbA1c, a decrease was observed in the EG (baseline 8.9 +/- 0.2 vs. posttreatment 8.6 +/- 0.3) and the PG (baseline 8.8 +/- 0.2 vs. posttreatment 8.4 +/- 0.3) compared to the CG (baseline 8.8 +/- 0.3 vs. six months 9.1 +/- 0.3) although the difference was not statistically significant (p < 0.05). There was a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the blood concentration of 8-isoprostane in the EG and PG with respect to the CG (EG: baseline 100 +/- 3 vs. posttreatment 57 +/- 3, PG: baseline 106 +/- 7 vs. posttreatment 77 +/- 5, and CG: baseline 94 +/- 10 vs. six months 107 +/- 11 pg/mL). Likewise, a statistically significant decrease (p < 0.05) in the concentration of the RAGE was found in the EG (baseline 1636 +/- 88 vs. posttreatment 1144 +/- 68) and the PG (baseline 1506 +/- 97 vs. posttreatment 1016 +/- 82) compared to CG (baseline 1407 +/- 112 vs. six months 1506 +/- 128). A statistically significant decrease was also observed in all markers of inflammation and in the activity of SOD and GPx in the CG with respect to the EG and PG. Our findings suggest that the administration of ALA at a dose of 600 mg/day for six months has a similar effect to that of placebo on oxidative stress, inflammation, and RAGE in older adults with T2DM. Therefore, higher doses of ALA should be tried to have this effect. This trial is registered with trial registration number ISRCTN13159380.","['Mendoza-Nunez, Victor Manuel', 'Garcia-Martinez, Beatriz Isabel', 'Rosado-Perez, Juana', 'Santiago-Osorio, Edelmiro', 'Pedraza-Chaverri, Jose', 'Hernandez-Abad, Vicente Jesus']","['Mendoza-Nunez VM', 'Garcia-Martinez BI', 'Rosado-Perez J', 'Santiago-Osorio E', 'Pedraza-Chaverri J', 'Hernandez-Abad VJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9137-3405', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1815-3537', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6147-7502', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4876-0688', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6628-4411']","['Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Research Unit on Gerontology, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Hematopoiesis and Leukemia Laboratory, Research Unit on Cell Differentiation and Cancer, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Chemistry, National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City 04510, Mexico.', 'Pharmaceutical Research Laboratory, FES Zaragoza, National Autonomous University of Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190612,United States,Oxid Med Cell Longev,Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity,101479826,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Blood Glucose/metabolism', 'Blood Pressure/drug effects', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Energy Intake/physiology', 'Female', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/blood', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/blood', 'Thioctic Acid/blood/*therapeutic use']",PMC6594273,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3276958 [doi]'],epublish,Oxid Med Cell Longev. 2019 Jun 12;2019:3276958. doi: 10.1155/2019/3276958. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human NSD3 protein is encoded by the WHSC1L1 gene located in the 8p11-p12 amplicon, frequently amplified in breast and squamous lung cancer. Recently, it was demonstrated that the PWWP1 domain of NSD3 is required for the viability of acute myeloid leukemia cells. To further elucidate the relevance of NSD3 in cancer biology, we developed a chemical probe, BI-9321, targeting the methyl-lysine binding site of the PWWP1 domain with sub-micromolar in vitro activity and cellular target engagement at 1 microM. As a single agent, BI-9321 downregulates Myc messenger RNA expression and reduces proliferation in MOLM-13 cells. This first-in-class chemical probe BI-9321, together with the negative control BI-9466, will greatly facilitate the elucidation of the underexplored biological function of PWWP domains.","['Bottcher,

We assessed transcriptome data, whole-exome sequencing data and DNA methylome profiling of 520 HCC patients from two independent cohorts to identify distinct molecular traits of patients with AFP-high tumours (serum concentration > 400 ng/ml), which represents an accepted prognostic cut-off and a predictor of response to ramucirumab. Those AFP-high tumours (18% of resected cases) were characterised by significantly lower AFP promoter methylation (p < 0.001), significant enrichment of progenitor-cell features (CK19, EPCAM), higher incidence of BAP1 oncogene mutations (8.5% vs 1.6%) and lower mutational rates of CTNNB1 (14% vs 30%). Specifically, AFP-high tumours displayed significant activation of VEGF signalling (p < 0.001), which might provide the rationale for the reported benefit of ramucirumab in this subgroup of patients.","['Montal, Robert', 'Andreu-Oller, Carmen', 'Bassaganyas, Laia', 'Esteban-Fabro, Roger', 'Moran, Sebastian', 'Montironi, Carla', 'Moeini, Agrin', 'Pinyol, Roser', 'Peix, Judit', 'Cabellos, Laia', 'Villanueva, Augusto', 'Sia, Daniela', 'Mazzaferro, Vincenzo', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Llovet, Josep M']","['Montal R', 'Andreu-Oller C', 'Bassaganyas L', 'Esteban-Fabro R', 'Moran S', 'Montironi C', 'Moeini A', 'Pinyol R', 'Peix J', 'Cabellos L', 'Villanueva A', 'Sia D', 'Mazzaferro V', 'Esteller M', 'Llovet JM']",,"['Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'University of Milan and Gastrointestinal Surgery and Liver Transplantation Unit, Fondazione IRCCS, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Translational Research in Hepatic Oncology, Liver Unit, IDIBAPS, CIBERehd, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. jmllovet@clinic.cat.', 'Liver Cancer Program, Division of Liver Diseases, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. jmllovet@clinic.cat.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. jmllovet@clinic.cat.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190709,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'D99YVK4L0X (ramucirumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",PMC6738090,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41416-019-0513-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41416-019-0513-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2019 Aug;121(4):340-343. doi: 10.1038/s41416-019-0513-7.

It is a known hot spot of retroviral tagging insertion and a fusion partner of both de novo and therapy-induced mixed lineage leukemia (MLL). Of all septins, SEPT9 holds the strongest link to cancer, especially breast cancer. Murine models of breast cancer frequently exhibit SEPT9 amplification in the form of double minute chromosomes, and about 20% of human breast cancer display genomic amplification and protein over expression at the SEPT9 locus. Yet, a clear mechanism by which SEPT9 elicits tumor-promoting functions is lacking. To obtain unbiased insights on molecular signatures of SEPT9 upregulation in breast tumors, we overexpressed several of its isoforms in breast cancer cell lines. Global transcriptomic profiling supports a role of SEPT9 in invasion. Functional studies reveal that SEPT9 upregulation is sufficient to increase degradation of the extracellular matrix, while SEPT9 downregulation inhibits this process. The degradation pattern is peripheral and associated with focal adhesions (FAs), where it is coupled with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). SEPT9 overexpression induces MMP upregulation in human tumors and in culture models and promotes MMP3 secretion to the media at FAs. Downregulation of SEPT9 or chemical inhibition of septin filament assembly impairs recruitment of MMP3 to FAs. Our results indicate that SEPT9 promotes upregulation and both trafficking and secretion of MMPs near FAs, thus enhancing migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.","['Marcus, Jenna', 'Bejerano-Sagie, Michal', 'Patterson, Nicole', 'Bagchi, Susmita', 'Verkhusha, Vladislav V', 'Connolly, Diana', 'Goldberg, Gary L', 'Golden, Aaron', 'Sharma, Ved P', 'Condeelis, John', 'Montagna, Cristina']","['Marcus J', 'Bejerano-Sagie M', 'Patterson N', 'Bagchi S', 'Verkhusha VV', 'Connolly D', 'Goldberg GL', 'Golden A', 'Sharma VP', 'Condeelis J', 'Montagna C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8826-2336'],"[""Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA."", 'Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'School of Mathematics, Statistics & Applied Mathematics, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', ""Departments of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA."", 'Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'School of Mathematics, Statistics & Applied Mathematics, National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland.', 'Anatomy and Structural Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Anatomy and Structural Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Gruss Lipper Biophotonics Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA. cristina.montagna@einstein.yu.edu.', 'Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, NY, USA. cristina.montagna@einstein.yu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190708,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', '*Carcinogenesis', '*Cell Movement', 'Extracellular Matrix/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Focal Adhesions', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mammary Glands, Human/metabolism/*pathology', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Protein Isoforms/*physiology', 'Septins/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC6859949,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2018/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0844-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0844-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Jul;38(30):5839-5859. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0844-0.

Aberrant activation of this signaling network is an early driver of many sporadic human cancers. Paradoxically, sustained hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/mTORC1 pathway in nontransformed cells results in cellular senescence, which is a tumor-suppressive mechanism that must be overcome to promote malignant transformation. While oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) driven by excessive RAS/ERK signaling has been well studied, little is known about the mechanisms underpinning the AKT-induced senescence (AIS) response. Here, we utilize a combination of transcriptome and metabolic profiling to identify key signatures required to maintain AIS. We also employ a whole protein-coding genome RNAi screen for AIS escape, validating a subset of novel mediators and demonstrating their preferential specificity for AIS as compared with OIS. As proof of concept of the potential to exploit the AIS network, we show that neurofibromin 1 (NF1) is upregulated during AIS and its ability to suppress RAS/ERK signaling facilitates AIS maintenance. Furthermore, depletion of NF1 enhances transformation of p53-mutant epithelial cells expressing activated AKT, while its overexpression blocks transformation by inducing a senescent-like phenotype. Together, our findings reveal novel mechanistic insights into the control of AIS and identify putative senescence regulators that can potentially be targeted, with implications for new therapeutic options to treat PI3K/AKT/mTORC1-driven cancers.","['Chan, Keefe T', 'Blake, Shaun', 'Zhu, Haoran', 'Kang, Jian', 'Trigos, Anna S', 'Madhamshettiwar, Piyush B', 'Diesch, Jeannine', 'Paavolainen, Lassi', 'Horvath, Peter', 'Hannan, Ross D', 'George, Amee J', 'Sanij, Elaine', 'Hannan, Katherine M', 'Simpson, Kaylene J', 'Pearson, Richard B']","['Chan KT', 'Blake S', 'Zhu H', 'Kang J', 'Trigos AS', 'Madhamshettiwar PB', 'Diesch J', 'Paavolainen L', 'Horvath P', 'Hannan RD', 'George AJ', 'Sanij E', 'Hannan KM', 'Simpson KJ', 'Pearson RB']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6114-3724', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2166-4493', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5919-5090']","['Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Victorian Centre for Functional Genomics, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Synthetic and Systems Biology Unit, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged, Hungary.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, VIC, Australia.', 'John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Victorian Centre for Functional Genomics, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Division of Cancer Research, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.

We aimed to analyze the incidence and characteristics of FLT3 mutations in ALL. Amplicon-targeted next-generation sequencing of 58 genes was performed on 1571 patients (AML, n = 829; ALL, n = 742). FLT3 mutations were identified in 5.12% (38/742) of ALL patients. Four types of FLT3 mutations were disclosed, including internal tandem duplication (ITD), tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), juxtamembrane insertion and deletion (JM-INDEL), and juxtamembrane point mutation (JM-PM), which were respectively identified in 1.21, 1.89, 0.67, and 1.89% of patients. The incidence of FLT3-JM-PM (1.89 vs 0.48%, P = 0.009) and the proportion of TKD non-D835 mutations that accounted for the total TKD mutations (57.14 vs 18.18%, P = 0.013) were significantly higher in ALL when compared with AML. FLT3-JM-INDEL were mainly found in B-ALL. In addition, FLT3-JM-INDEL and FLT3-JM-PM were first reported in patients with B-ALL. Patients with FLT3 mutations besides of ITD and/or TKD had a potential response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We showed that the mutation spectrum of FLT3 gene in ALL is distinct from AML that will facilitated an in-depth understand of the pathogenesis and provide a guidance for treatment.","['Zhang, Yu', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Wang, Fang', 'Wang, Mingyu', 'Liu, Hong', 'Chen, Xue', 'Cao, Panxiang', 'Ma, Xiaoli', 'Teng, Wen', 'Zhang, Xian', 'Liu, Hongxing']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang F', 'Wang M', 'Liu H', 'Chen X', 'Cao P', 'Ma X', 'Teng W', 'Zhang X', 'Liu H']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0869-9429', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5794-5185']","['Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hebei Yanda Lu Daopei Hospital, Beijing, China. starliu@pku.edu.cn.', 'Beijing Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China. starliu@pku.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190709,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-019-0120-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-019-0120-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Feb;27(1-2):81-88. doi: 10.1038/s41417-019-0120-z.

The clinical significance of RRBP1 and its involvement in the epithelial ovarian cancer have yet to be studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of RRBP1 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and its relationship with clinical characteristics and prognosis. We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of RRBP1 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting (n=45). Immunohistochemistry and data analysis were used to examine the relationship between the expression level of RRBP1 and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of epithelial ovarian cancer. RRBP1 was highly expressed in EOC (P<0.001). The specimens were obtained from 108 patients undergoing surgery to treat epithelial ovarian cancer. RRBP1 expression was obviously related to Federation International of Gynecologie and Obstetrigue (FIGO) stage (P<0.001), histological grade (P=0.021), histological type (P=0.004), and lymph node metastasis (P=0.012) but was not related to patient age (P=0.385) or preoperative carbohydrate antigen125 (CA125) level (P=0.238). Univariate analysis showed that the prognosis of the epithelial ovarian cancer patients was related to the age of the patients, the FIGO stage, and the expression level of RRBP1 (P<0.05). Patients with higher RRBP1 expression had significantly worse overall survival (OS) (P=0.003) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P<0.001). Multivariate survival analysis proved that RRBP1 was an independent predictor of OS (P=0.003) and DFS (P<0.001). RRBP1 plays an important role in predicting the prognosis of EOC. These results show that RRBP1 is a potential target for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer.","['Ma, Jing', 'Ren, Sujing', 'Ding, Jing', 'Liu, Shuang', 'Zhu, Jiaqi', 'Ma, Rong', 'Meng, Fanling']","['Ma J', 'Ren S', 'Ding J', 'Liu S', 'Zhu J', 'Ma R', 'Meng F']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7028-1205'],"['Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China dr_mfl1979@126.com dr_marong2017@126.com.', 'Department of Gynecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, China dr_mfl1979@126.com dr_marong2017@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190723,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RRBP1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6646231,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20190656 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20190656 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 Jul 23;39(7). pii: BSR20190656. doi: 10.1042/BSR20190656.

The Nbn (mid8) allele was expressed exclusively in hematopoietic lineages (in Nbn (-/mid8vav) mice). Unlike Nbn (flox/floxvav) mice with Nbn deficiency in the bone marrow, Nbn (-/mid8vav) mice were viable. Nbn (-/mid8vav) mice hematopoiesis was profoundly defective, exhibiting reduced cellularity of thymus and bone marrow, and stage-specific blockage of B cell development. Within 6 mo, Nbn (-/mid8) mice developed highly penetrant T cell leukemias. Nbn (-/mid8vav) leukemias recapitulated mutational features of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), containing mutations in NOTCH1, TP53, BCL6, BCOR, and IKZF1, suggesting that Nbn (mid8) mice may provide a venue to examine the relationship between the Mre11 complex and oncogene activation in the hematopoietic compartment. Genomic analysis of Nbn (-/mid8vav) malignancies showed focal amplification of 9qA2, causing overexpression of MRE11 and CHK1 We propose that overexpression of MRE11 compensates for the metastable Mre11-Nbn(mid8) interaction, and that selective pressure for overexpression reflects the essential role of Nbn in promoting assembly and activity of the Mre11 complex.","['Kim, Jun Hyun', 'Penson, Alexander V', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Petrini, John H J']","['Kim JH', 'Penson AV', 'Taylor BS', 'Petrini JHJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0196-8796'],"['Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Department Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Center for Molecular Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065.', 'Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065; petrinij@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190708,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcor protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Mre11a protein, mouse)', '0 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Trp53 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases/*genetics/immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/immunology', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1/genetics/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/*genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genomic Instability/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/pathology/prevention & control', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/genetics/immunology', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/immunology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/immunology']",PMC6660787,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['1905305116 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1905305116 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Jul 23;116(30):15178-15183. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1905305116.

However, mechanistic evidence for cancer-specific alterations in XPO1 function is lacking. Here, genomic analysis of 42,793 cancers identified recurrent and previously unrecognized mutational hotspots in XPO1. XPO1 mutations exhibited striking lineage specificity, with enrichment in a variety of B-cell malignancies, and introduction of single amino acid substitutions in XPO1 initiated clonal, B-cell malignancy in vivo. Proteomic characterization identified that mutant XPO1 altered the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of hundreds of proteins in a sequence-specific manner that promoted oncogenesis. XPO1 mutations preferentially sensitized cells to inhibitors of nuclear export, providing a biomarker of response to this family of drugs. These data reveal a new class of oncogenic alteration based on change-of-function mutations in nuclear export signal recognition and identify therapeutic targets based on altered nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. SIGNIFICANCE: Here, we identify that heterozygous mutations in the main nuclear exporter in eukaryotic cells, XPO1, are positively selected in cancer and promote the initiation of clonal B-cell malignancies. XPO1 mutations alter nuclear export signal recognition in a sequence-specific manner and sensitize cells to compounds in clinical development inhibiting XPO1 function.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1325.","['Taylor, Justin', 'Sendino, Maria', 'Gorelick, Alexander N', 'Pastore, Alessandro', 'Chang, Matthew T', 'Penson, Alexander V', 'Gavrila, Elena I', 'Stewart, Connor', 'Melnik, Ella M', 'Herrejon Chavez, Florisela', 'Bitner, Lillian', 'Yoshimi, Akihide', 'Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei', 'Inoue, Daichi', 'Liu, Bo', 'Zhang, Xiao J', 'Mato, Anthony R', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Kharas, Michael G', 'Chen, Yuhong', 'Wang, Demin', 'Soni, Rajesh K', 'Hendrickson, Ronald C', 'Prieto, Gorka', 'Rodriguez, Jose A', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar']","['Taylor J', 'Sendino M', 'Gorelick AN', 'Pastore A', 'Chang MT', 'Penson AV', 'Gavrila EI', 'Stewart C', 'Melnik EM', 'Herrejon Chavez F', 'Bitner L', 'Yoshimi A', 'Lee SC', 'Inoue D', 'Liu B', 'Zhang XJ', 'Mato AR', 'Dogan A', 'Kharas MG', 'Chen Y', 'Wang D', 'Soni RK', 'Hendrickson RC', 'Prieto G', 'Rodriguez JA', 'Taylor BS', 'Abdel-Wahab O']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4407-6325', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3621-4807', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2429-2370', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2238-0369', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0664-7281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1165-6991', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6433-8452', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4407-6325']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa, Spain.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Blood Research Institute, Blood Center of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Microchemistry and Proteomics Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Microchemistry and Proteomics Core Facility, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Communications Engineering, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, University of the Basque Country, Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa, Spain.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Marie-Josee and Henry R.

However, we found that when ubiquitination was blocked in several human cell lines by inhibiting the ubiquitin-activating enzyme with TAK243, there was an unexpected, large accumulation of proteins modified by SUMO2/3 chains or SUMO1, but not by several other ubiquitin-like proteins. This buildup of SUMOylated proteins was evident within 3-4 h. It required the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-conjugating enzyme, UBC9, and the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) and thus was not due to nonspecific SUMO conjugation by ubiquitination enzymes. The SUMOylated proteins accumulated predominantly bound to chromatin and were localized to PML nuclear bodies. Because blocking protein synthesis with cycloheximide prevented the buildup of SUMOylated proteins, they appeared to be newly-synthesized proteins. The proteins SUMOylated after inhibition of ubiquitination were purified and analyzed by MS. In HeLa and U2OS cells, there was a cycloheximide-sensitive increase in a similar set of SUMOylated proteins (including transcription factors and proteins involved in DNA damage repair). Surprisingly, the inhibition of ubiquitination also caused a cycloheximide-sensitive decrease in a distinct set of SUMOylated proteins (including proteins for chromosome modification and mRNA splicing). More than 80% of the SUMOylated proteins whose levels rose or fell upon inhibiting ubiquitination inhibition underwent similar cycloheximide-sensitive increases or decreases upon proteasome inhibition. Thus, when nuclear substrates of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway are not efficiently degraded, many become SUMO-modified and accumulate in PML bodies.","['Sha, Zhe', 'Blyszcz, Tamara', 'Gonzalez-Prieto, Roman', 'Vertegaal, Alfred C O', 'Goldberg, Alfred L']","['Sha Z', 'Blyszcz T', 'Gonzalez-Prieto R', 'Vertegaal ACO', 'Goldberg AL']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8997-2321'],"['Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden 2333 ZA, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden 2333 ZA, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Cell and Chemical Biology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden 2333 ZA, The Netherlands vertegaal@lumc.nl.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 alfred_goldberg@hms.harvard.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190708,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO2 protein, human)', '0 (SUMO3 protein, human)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sumoylation', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'Ubiquitins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6802522,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)33768-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.009147 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Oct 18;294(42):15218-15234. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009147.

In this study, we first evaluated the cytotoxicity on NB4 cell and found that RTS could remarkably inhibit proliferation of NB4 than arsenic trioxide. Then we figured out the QTc prolongation of RTS treatment contrasted with arsenic trioxide; results revealed that arsenic trioxide prolonged corrected QTc of mice by 20.1% and showed 1.9-fold higher cytotoxicity on H9c2 cell than RTS. On the contrary, there could not find any QTc prolongation of mice in RTS treatment. Also, arsenic trioxide elevated the intercellular calcium accumulation of H9c2 cell by 2.02-fold v.s control and RTS. HE staining and Masson's trichrome staining had shown that there was no injured section after RTS treatments. IK1 currents of rat ventricular cardiomyocytes were diminished by 45.0% after treating with arsenic trioxide while RTS showed no significance than the control group. The results above indicated that RTS could serve as an alternative arsenic agent on leukemia and had a lower risk of cardiotoxicity.","['Hai, Yang', 'Song, Peng', 'Wang, Xin', 'Zhao, Longhe', 'Xie, Qinjian', 'Li, Jianyin', 'Li, Yang', 'Li, Hongyu']","['Hai Y', 'Song P', 'Wang X', 'Zhao L', 'Xie Q', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Li H']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, 730020, China.

The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) binds regions of viral RNA containing CpGs and targets them for degradation. ZAP does not have enzymatic activity and recruits other cellular proteins to inhibit viral replication. We found that KHNYN, a protein with no previously known function, interacts with ZAP. KHNYN overexpression selectively inhibits HIV-1 containing clustered CpG dinucleotides and this requires ZAP and its cofactor TRIM25. KHNYN requires both its KH-like domain and NYN endonuclease domain for antiviral activity. Crucially, depletion of KHNYN eliminated the deleterious effect of CpG dinucleotides on HIV-1 RNA abundance and infectious virus production and also enhanced the production of murine leukemia virus. Overall, we have identified KHNYN as a novel cofactor for ZAP to target CpG-containing retroviral RNA for degradation.","['Ficarelli, Mattia', 'Wilson, Harry', 'Pedro Galao, Rui', 'Mazzon, Michela', 'Antzin-Anduetza, Irati', 'Marsh, Mark', 'Neil, Stuart Jd', 'Swanson, Chad M']","['Ficarelli M', 'Wilson H', 'Pedro Galao R', 'Mazzon M', 'Antzin-Anduetza I', 'Marsh M', 'Neil SJ', 'Swanson CM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9380-132X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3185-1073', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3368-5053', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2462-9925', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3306-5831', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6650-3634']","[""Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, University College London, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Immunology and Microbial Sciences, King's College London, London, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190709,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (KHNYN protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (ZC3HAV1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM25 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['CpG Islands/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Protein Domains', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Sequence Deletion/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism']",PMC6615859,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.46767 [doi]', '46767 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Jul 9;8. pii: 46767. doi: 10.7554/eLife.46767.,,"['MC_UU_00012/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC/PC/15068/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12018/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT098049AIA/Wellcome/International', 'MR/S000844/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MR/R50225X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0801937/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/M019756/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,"['(c) 2019, Ficarelli et al.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CpG dinucleotide', '*HIV', '*KHNYN', '*TRIM25', '*ZAP', '*human', '*immunology', '*infectious disease', '*inflammation', '*innate immunity', '*microbiology', '*virus']","['MF, HW, RP, MM, IA, MM, SN, CS No competing interests declared']",,,,,,,,,,

However, hypersensitivity to ASNase can increase the risk of leukemia relapse. Two mechanisms of ASNase hypersensitivity have been identified in mice. The existence of a pathway involving anti-ASNase IgG and Fc-gamma receptor III (Fc-gammaRIII) implies that IgG and ASNase immune complexes (ICs) could directly induce hypersensitivity. The aim of this study was to detect ASNase ICs in mice after hypersensitivity reactions and determine their role in hypersensitivity. Protein G beads were used to detect plasma ASNase ICs by flow cytometry. Anti-ASNase IgG was purified from the plasma of sensitized mice, and ASNase ICs were prepared ex vivo at various ratios of ASNase to anti-ASNase IgG. The levels of ASNase ICs detected after hypersensitivity reactions correlated with reaction severity (R(2) = 0.796; P = 0.0005). ASNase ICs prepared ex vivo required high levels of anti-ASNase IgG for formation, and binding to naive and sensitized immune cells depended on soluble anti-ASNase IgG, antigen:antibody ratio, and Fc-gammaRIII. Similarly, basophil activation by ASNase ICs depended on the antigen:antibody ratio and Fc-gammaRIII. Consistent with the ex vivo results, naive mice receiving ASNase ICs developed hypersensitivity reactions. Our data demonstrate that ASNase ICs can directly contribute to the onset and severity of ASNase hypersensitivity.-Rathod, S., Ramsey, M., DiGiorgio, D., Berrios, R., Finkelman, F. D., Fernandez, C.

Despite the original assumption that pore formation in the cell membrane is responsible for increased uptake of drugs, the molecular mechanisms behind this phenomenon are largely unknown. We treated cancer cells (MOLM-13) and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with ultrasound at three acoustic intensities (74, 501, 2079 mW/cm(2)) +/- microbubbles. We subsequently monitored the intracellular response of a number of key signaling pathways using flow cytometry or western blotting 5 min, 30 min and 2 h post-treatment. This was complemented by studies on uptake of a cell impermeable dye (calcein) and investigations of cell viability (cell count, Hoechst staining and colony forming assay). Ultrasound + microbubbles resulted in both early changes (p38 (Arcsinh ratio at high ultrasound + microbubbles: +0.5), ERK1/2 (+0.7), CREB (+1.3), STAT3 (+0.7) and AKT (+0.5)) and late changes (ribosomal protein S6 (Arcsinh ratio at low ultrasound: +0.6) and eIF2alpha in protein phosphorylation). Observed changes in protein phosphorylation corresponded to changes in sonoporation efficiency and in viability, predominantly in cancer cells. Sonoporation induced protein phosphorylation in healthy cells was pronounced (p38 (+0.03), ERK1/2 (-0.03), CREB (+0.0), STAT3 (-0.1) and AKT (+0.04) and S6 (+0.2)). This supports the hypothesis that sonoporation may enhance therapeutic efficacy of cancer treatment, without causing damage to healthy cells.","['Haugse, Ragnhild', 'Langer, Anika', 'Gullaksen, Stein-Erik', 'Sundoy, Silje Maria', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Kotopoulis, Spiros', 'McCormack, Emmet']","['Haugse R', 'Langer A', 'Gullaksen SE', 'Sundoy SM', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Kotopoulis S', 'McCormack E']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8793-3097'],"['Department of Clinical Science, The University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 65, 5021 Bergen, Norway. ragnhild.haugse@uib.no.', 'Department of Quality and Development, Hospital Pharmacies Enterprise in Western Norway, Mollendalsbakken 9, 5021 Bergen, Norway. ragnhild.haugse@uib.no.', 'Centre for Cancer Biomarkers CCBIO, Department of Clinical Science, The University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 65, Bergen 5021, Norway. ragnhild.haugse@uib.no.', 'Department of Clinical Science, The University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 65, 5021 Bergen, Norway.

Metastatic melanoma is difficult to treat and chemotherapies have limited success. Furthermore, chemotherapies lead to toxic side effects due to nonselective targeting of normal cells. Curcumin is a natural product of Curcuma longa (turmeric) and has been shown to possess anti-cancer activity. However, due to its poor bioavailability and stability, natural curcumin is not an effective cancer treatment. We tested synthetic analogs of curcumin that are more stable. One of these derivatives, Compound A, has shown significant anti-cancer efficacy in colon, leukemia, and triple-negative inflammatory breast cancer cells. However, the effects of Compound A against melanoma cells have not been studied before. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrated the efficacy of Compound A for the selective induction of apoptosis in melanoma cells and its interaction with tamoxifen, taxol, and cisplatin. We found that Compound A induced apoptosis selectively in human melanoma cells by increasing oxidative stress. The anti-cancer activity of Compound A was enhanced when combined with tamoxifen and the combination treatment did not result in significant toxicity to noncancerous cells. Additionally, Compound A did not interact negatively with the anti-cancer activity of taxol and cisplatin. These results indicate that Compound A could be developed as a selective and effective melanoma treatment either alone or in combination with other non-toxic agents like tamoxifen.","['Parashar, Krishan', 'Sood, Siddhartha', 'Mehaidli, Ali', 'Curran, Colin', 'Vegh, Caleb', 'Nguyen, Christopher', 'Pignanelli, Christopher', 'Wu, Jianzhang', 'Liang, Guang', 'Wang, Yi', 'Pandey, Siyaram']","['Parashar K', 'Sood S', 'Mehaidli A', 'Curran C', 'Vegh C', 'Nguyen C', 'Pignanelli C', 'Wu J', 'Liang G', 'Wang Y', 'Pandey S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5706-2446', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3531-5961', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7273-7154']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Whenzhou Medical University, University Town, Chashan, Wenzhou 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Whenzhou Medical University, University Town, Chashan, Wenzhou 325035, China.', 'Chemical Biology Research Center, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Whenzhou Medical University, University Town, Chashan, Wenzhou 325035, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Windsor, 401 Sunset Avenue, Windsor, ON N9B 3P4, Canada. spandey@uwindsor.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190706,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Curcumin/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Tamoxifen/pharmacology']",PMC6651075,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24132483 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24132483 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Jul 6;24(13). pii: molecules24132483. doi: 10.3390/molecules24132483.,13,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'cisplatin', 'curcumin analog', 'drug-drug interaction', 'melanoma', 'oxidative stress', 'tamoxifen', 'taxol']",,,,,,,,,,,

It has been widely used as a treatment for chronic hepatitis infections and inflammatory diseases due to its effective immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, the potential anti-cancer effects of OMT have been actively studied in various cancers. It can induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, including those of colorectal cancer, gall bladder carcinoma, and leukemia. Moreover, it reduces tumor growth in different in vivo models as well as augments the anti-cancer effects of existing chemotherapeutics on tumor cells. OMT regulates various oncogenic signaling pathways such as the Akt, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) cascades to exert its cytotoxicity against cancer cells.

As a base for future analyses, we provide a history of the Palomares incident, including the dosimetry and risk analyses carried out to date and the compensation assessments made for veterans. By law, compensation for illnesses attributed to ionizing radiation is based on maximum estimated doses and standard risk coefficients, with considerable benefit of the doubt given to claimants when there is uncertainty. In the Palomares case, alpha activity in urine fell far faster than predicted by plutonium biokinetic excretion models used at the time. Most of the measurements were taken on-site but were disqualified on the grounds that they were ""unreasonably high"" and because there was a possibility of environmental contamination. Until the end of 2013, the Air Force used low dose estimates derived from environmental measurements carried out well after the cleanup. After these estimates were questioned by Congress, the Air Force adopted higher dose estimates based on plutonium concentration measurements in urine samples collected from 26 veterans after they left Palomares. The Air Force assumed that all other cleanup veterans received lower doses and therefore assigned to them maximum organ doses based on the individual among the 26 with the lowest urine measurements. These resulting maximum organ doses appear to be sufficient to justify compensation to all Palomares veterans with lung and bone cancer and early-onset liver cancer and leukemia but not other radiogenic cancers.","['Beyea, Jan', 'von Hippel, Frank N']","['Beyea J', 'von Hippel FN']",,"['Consulting in the Public Interest, Lambertville, NJ.', 'Princeton University, Princeton, NJ.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,"['0 (Radioactive Fallout)', '53023GN24M (Plutonium)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/economics/*etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/economics/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Plutonium/*analysis/poisoning', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Radioactive Fallout/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Radiometry', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Spain', 'United States', 'Veterans/statistics & numerical data', ""Workers' Compensation/*economics/standards""]",PMC6837353,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/02/07 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/HP.0000000000001103 [doi]'],ppublish,Health Phys. 2019 Dec;117(6):625-636. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000001103.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the use of Peg-Dox in myeloid neoplasms remains poorly studied. In this study, we first tested the role of Peg-Dox in the killing of myeloid cell lines and of primary myeloid leukemia cells. Then, a Peg-Dox-based protocol was used to treat patients with myeloid neoplasms. The results showed that the Peg-Dox and Peg-Dox-based protocols had a similar killing ability in myeloid cell lines and in primary myeloid leukemia cells compared to that of conventional doxorubicin. The complete remission rate was 87.5% and 100% for patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts, respectively, after treatment with Peg-Dox. All patients developed grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity and recovered approximately 2 weeks after completing chemotherapy. No deaths or other severe complications were reported. Our results showed that Peg-Dox can be used in the treatment of myeloid neoplasms with high rates of complete remission and with mild complications.","['Zhang, Cheng', 'Yao, Han', 'Kong, Pei-Yang', 'Liu, Yao', 'Gao, Lei', 'Gao, Li', 'Ma, Ying-Ying', 'Liu, Jun', 'Tan, Xu', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Zhang C', 'Yao H', 'Kong PY', 'Liu Y', 'Gao L', 'Gao L', 'Ma YY', 'Liu J', 'Tan X', 'Zhang X']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital and State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Army Medical University, Chongqing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (liposomal doxorubicin)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Polyethylene Glycols/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",PMC6749968,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000811 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2019 Oct;30(9):948-952. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000811.,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The plus strand of the provirus is typically transcriptionally silent in freshly isolated lymphocytes, but the strong, persistently activated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response to the viral antigens indicates that the virus is not constantly latent in vivo. There is now evidence that the plus strand is transcribed in intense intermittent bursts that are triggered by cellular stress, modulated by hypoxia and glycolysis, and inhibited by polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). The minus-strand gene hbz is transcribed at a lower, more constant level but is silent in a proportion of infected cells at a given time. Viral genes in the sense and antisense strands of the provirus play different respective roles in latency and de novo infection: Expression of the plus-strand gene tax is essential for de novo infection, whereas hbz appears to facilitate survival of the infected T cell clone in vivo.","['Bangham, Charles R M', 'Miura, Michi', 'Kulkarni, Anurag', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Bangham CRM', 'Miura M', 'Kulkarni A', 'Matsuoka M']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom; email: c.bangham@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom; email: c.bangham@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom; email: c.bangham@imperial.ac.uk.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan; email: mamatsu@kumamoto-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190705,United States,Annu Rev Virol,Annual review of virology,101625721,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Virus Latency']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/07/03 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015501 [doi]'],ppublish,Annu Rev Virol. 2019 Sep 29;6(1):365-385. doi: 10.1146/annurev-virology-092818-015501.

The Interfant-06 study, comprising 18 national and international study groups, tested whether myeloid-style consolidation chemotherapy is superior to lymphoid style, the role of stem-cell transplantation (SCT), and which factors had independent prognostic value. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three risk groups were defined: low risk (LR): KMT2A germline; high risk (HR): KMT2A-rearranged and older than 6 months with WBC count 300 x 10(9)/L or more or a poor prednisone response; and medium risk (MR): all other KMT2A-rearranged cases. Patients in the MR and HR groups were randomly assigned to receive the lymphoid course low-dose cytosine arabinoside [araC], 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide (IB) or experimental myeloid courses, namely araC, daunorubicin, etoposide (ADE) and mitoxantrone, araC, etoposide (MAE). RESULTS: A total of 651 infants were included, with 6-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival of 46.1% (SE, 2.1) and 58.2% (SE, 2.0). In West European/North American groups, 6-year EFS and overall survival were 49.4% (SE, 2.5) and 62.1% (SE, 2.4), which were 10% to 12% higher than in other countries. The 6-year probability of disease-free survival was comparable for the randomized arms (ADE+MAE 39.3% [SE 4.0; n = 169] v IB 36.8% [SE, 3.9; n = 161]; log-rank P = .47). The 6-year EFS rate of patients in the HR group was 20.9% (SE, 3.4) with the intention to undergo SCT; only 46% of them received SCT, because many had early events. KMT2A rearrangement was the strongest prognostic factor for EFS, followed by age, WBC count, and prednisone response. CONCLUSION: Early intensification with postinduction myeloid-type chemotherapy courses did not significantly improve outcome for infant ALL compared with the lymphoid-type course IB. Outcome for infant ALL in Interfant-06 did not improve compared with that in Interfant-99.","['Pieters, Rob', 'De Lorenzo, Paola', 'Ancliffe, Philip', 'Aversa, Luis Alberto', 'Brethon, Benoit', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Campbell, Myriam', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'Ferster, Alina', 'Gardner, Rebecca A', 'Kotecha, Rishi Sury', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Li, Chi Kong', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Attarbaschi, Andishe', 'Peters, Christina', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Stary, Jan', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Vora, Ajay', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Pieters R', 'De Lorenzo P', 'Ancliffe P', 'Aversa LA', 'Brethon B', 'Biondi A', 'Campbell M', 'Escherich G', 'Ferster A', 'Gardner RA', 'Kotecha RS', 'Lausen B', 'Li CK', 'Locatelli F', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Peters C', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Silverman LB', 'Stary J', 'Szczepanski T', 'Vora A', 'Schrappe M', 'Valsecchi MG']",,"['Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'United Kingdom Children Cancer Study Group, London, United Kingdom.', 'GATLA, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'French Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Study Group, Paris, France.', 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', ""Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Chilean National Pediatric Oncology Group, Santiago, Chile.', 'German Cooperative Study Group for Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, Hamburg, Germany.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children Leukemia Group, Brussels, Belgium.', ""Seattle Children's Hospital and Research Institute, Seattle, WA."", ""Australian and New Zealand Children's Haematology/Oncology Group, Perth, Australia."", 'University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China."", 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', ""Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', ""St Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", 'Children Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.', ""St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Czech Working Group for Pediatric Hematology, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Polish Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group, Zabrze, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'United Kingdom Children Cancer Study Group, London, United Kingdom.', 'Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Group Germany, Kiel, Germany.', 'University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20190708,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.00261 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Sep 1;37(25):2246-2256. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.00261.

DESIGN: Nationwide observational cohort study. METHOD: Data from the Netherlands Cancer Registry on standardized incidence rates and relative survival were analysed. Mortality data was obtained from Statistics Netherlands. RESULTS: Between 1989 and 2017 the number of newly-diagnosed cancers doubled to 111,582. The standardized incidence (ESR) increased from 377 per 100,000 inhabitants in 1989 to 481 in 2011, and stabilized thereafter (459 in 2017). In 2018 the five most common types of cancer were skin cancer (excl. basal cell carcinoma, n = 21,000), breast cancer (n = 15,000), colorectal cancer (n = 14,000), lung cancer (n = 13,000) and prostate cancer (n = 13,000). The incidence of skin cancer rose the fastest (melanoma from 11 to 32 per 100,000; squamous cell carcinoma from 14 to 49 per 100,000). The largest shift to local disease (T1-T2 according to the TNM) was seen in breast cancer (from 50% to 75%). The 5-year survival improved from 50% in patients diagnosed with cancer in 1991-1996 to 65% in 2011-2016. Of the most common cancer types, survival of acute myeloid leukaemia increased the most (from 10% to 25%). The absolute number of deaths increased (from 35,000 in 1989 to 45,000 in 2017), but after standardization this decreased from 234 to 169. CONCLUSION: The incidence of cancer in absolute numbers is still increasing due to the ageing population. However, taking population demographics into account, the standardized incidence has not increased since 2011. This is related to the decrease in smoking-related cancers, amongst other things. The increase in survival is related to early detection and improved treatment. The decrease in mortality is mainly related to the decrease in lung cancer mortality in men.","['Siesling, Sabine', 'Visser, Otto', 'Aarts, Mieke J', 'Verhoeven, Rob H A', 'Aben, Katja K H', 'Dinmohamed, Avinash G', 'van Dijk, Boukje', 'van der Aa, Maaike', 'Louwman, Marieke', 'Lemmens, Valery E P P']","['Siesling S', 'Visser O', 'Aarts MJ', 'Verhoeven RHA', 'Aben KKH', 'Dinmohamed AG', 'van Dijk B', 'van der Aa M', 'Louwman M', 'Lemmens VEPP']",,"['Integraal Kankercentrum Nederland (IKNL), afd.

These CAs were mostly common in trisomy-8 (16 cases), trisomy-Y (five cases), and monosomy-7 (five cases). Furthermore, Ph- CAs were significantly associated with higher platelet count (494 x 10(9)/L vs. 326 x 10(9)/L, p = .006), and higher incidence of true clonal evolution in Ph-positive metaphase (22.9% vs. 9.1%, p = .017).

The classical variant of the disease is characterized by the BRAF V600E mutation, which is present in virtually all cases. How this mutation leads to the signs and symptoms of the disease is currently not known. Areas covered: This review explores the genetic background of HCL, especially the BRAF V600E driver mutation, but passenger mutations and their effects are also included. The clinical significance of BRAF mutations in other cancer types is discussed, as well as BRAF- induced senescence. An overview of the major forms of treatment of HCL (cytostatic drugs, specific BRAF inhibitors, B cell-specific antibodies) is given. Finally, possible mechanisms of the monocytopenia and hairy morphology so typical of this disease are discussed. Expert opinion: Although being a rare disease, HCL and its pathogenesis can yield important information about BRAF-related cancer metabolism. Many aspects of the disease are still unclear, but with the right resources, this could change. This can lead to a more efficient and specific treatment, thus leading to decreased morbidity.","['Polderdijk, Margot C E', 'Heron, Michiel', 'Kuipers, Saskia', 'Rijkers, Ger T']","['Polderdijk MCE', 'Heron M', 'Kuipers S', 'Rijkers GT']",,"['a Department of Sciences, University College Roosevelt , Middelburg , The Netherlands.', 'b Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Admiral de Ruyter Hospital , Goes , The Netherlands.', 'b Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Admiral de Ruyter Hospital , Goes , The Netherlands.', 'c Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Immunology, St Elisabeth Hospital , Tilburg , The Netherlands.', 'd Department of Hematology, Admiral de Ruyter Hospital , Goes , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Sciences, University College Roosevelt , Middelburg , The Netherlands.', 'b Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Immunology, Admiral de Ruyter Hospital , Goes , The Netherlands.', 'c Laboratory for Medical Microbiology and Immunology, St Elisabeth Hospital , Tilburg , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190712,England,Expert Rev Clin Immunol,Expert review of clinical immunology,101271248,"['0 (Cytostatic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cytostatic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Genetic Association Studies/*methods', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'Rare Diseases/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1744666X.2019.1641405 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Immunol. 2019 Aug;15(8):857-867. doi: 10.1080/1744666X.2019.1641405.

In the past 10 years, gene therapy has moved from a distant possibility, even in the minds of much of the scientific community, to being widely realized as a valuable therapeutic tool with wide-ranging potential. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved Luxturna (Spark Therapeutics Inc, Philadelphia, PA, USA), a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) 2 gene therapy for one type of Leber congenital amaurosis 2 ( 1 , 2 ). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved 3 recombinant viral vector products: Glybera (UniQure, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), an rAAV vector for lipoprotein lipase deficiency; Strimvelis (Glaxo Smith-Kline, Brentford, United Kingdom), an ex vivo gammaretrovirus-based therapy for patients with adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID); and Kymriah (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland), an ex vivo lentivirus-based therapy to engineer autologous chimeric antigen-receptor T (CAR-T) cells targeting CD19-positive cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

However, reliable flow cytometric detection of MRD strongly depends on operator skills and expert knowledge. Hence, an objective, automated tool for reliable FCM-MRD quantification, able to overcome the technical diversity and analytical subjectivity, would be most helpful. We developed a supervised machine learning approach using a combination of multiple Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) as a parametric density model. The approach was used for finding the weights of a linear combination of multiple GMMs to represent new, ""unseen"" samples by an interpolation of stored samples. The experimental data set contained FCM-MRD data of 337 bone marrow samples collected at day 15 of induction therapy in three different laboratories from pediatric patients with B-ALL for which accurate, expert-set gates existed. We compared MRD quantification by our proposed GMM approach to operator assessments, its performance on data from different laboratories, as well as to other state-of-the-art automated read-out methods. Our proposed GMM-combination approach proved superior over support vector machines, deep neural networks, and a single GMM approach in terms of precision and average F 1 -scores. A high correlation of expert operator-based and automated MRD assessment was achieved with reliable automated MRD quantification (F 1 -scores >0.5 in more than 95% of samples) in the clinically relevant range. Although best performance was found, if test and training samples were from the same system (i.e., flow cytometer and staining panel; lowest median F 1 -score 0.92), cross-system performance remained high with a median F 1 -score above 0.85 in all settings. In conclusion, our proposed automated approach could potentially be used to assess FCM-MRD in B-ALL in an objective and standardized manner across different laboratories.

The compounds bearing N,N-chelating ligands exhibit increased cytotoxic activity against human leukemia cell lines MOLT-4; up to two orders of magnitude lower IC50 values were observed compared to analogues with unsubstituted indenyl, which clearly demonstrates the strong effect of the indenyl ligand modification on the biological activity of the molybdenum(ii) compounds. The highest cytostatic potential was observed for the complex bearing 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthtoline [(eta(5)-C9H6CH2C4H3S)Mo(CO)2(Ph2phen)][BF4] with IC50 (MOLT-4) = 0.19 +/- 0.02 muM.

We have transduced anti-CD19 CAR T cells with the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) because it is a human protein with restricted normal tissue expression and has an expanding array of positron emission tomography (PET) and therapeutic radioligands. We demonstrate that CD19-tPSMA((N9del)) CAR T cells can be tracked with [(18)F]DCFPyL PET in a Nalm6 model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Methods: Stool specimens were collected from patients admitted for chemotherapy or stem cell transplant in the setting of the evaluation of diarrhea from February 2017 until November 2017. Microbiome characteristics were compared among those exposed to levofloxacin prophylaxis vs those who received BSBL antibiotics. Results: Sixty patients were included, most with acute myeloid leukemia (42%) or multiple myeloma (37%). The gut microbiome of patients with BSBL exposure had significantly reduced Shannon's alpha diversity compared with those without (median [interquartile range {IQR}], 3.28 [1.73 to 3.71] vs 3.73 [3.14 to 4.31]; P = .01). However, those with levofloxacin exposure had increased alpha diversity compared with those without (median [IQR], 3.83 [3.32 to 4.36] vs 3.32 [2.35 to 4.02]; P = .03). Levofloxacin exposure was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of dominance of non-Bacteroidetes genera compared with those without levofloxacin exposure (3 [14%] vs 15 [38%]; P = .051). Conclusions: The impact of antibiotics on the gut microbiome varies by class, and levofloxacin may disrupt the gut microbiome less than BSBLs in this patient population.","['Ziegler, Matthew', 'Han, Jennifer H', 'Landsburg, Daniel', 'Pegues, David', 'Reesey, Emily', 'Gilmar, Cheryl', 'Gorman, Theresa', 'Bink, Kristen', 'Moore, Amy', 'Kelly, Brendan J']","['Ziegler M', 'Han JH', 'Landsburg D', 'Pegues D', 'Reesey E', 'Gilmar C', 'Gorman T', 'Bink K', 'Moore A', 'Kelly BJ']",,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Healthcare Epidemiology, Infection Prevention and Control, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Healthcare Epidemiology, Infection Prevention and Control, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Healthcare Epidemiology, Infection Prevention and Control, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190531,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,PMC6602896,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/07/10 06:01,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofz252 [doi]', 'ofz252 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2019 May 31;6(7):ofz252. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofz252. eCollection 2019 Jul.,7,"['K23 AI121485/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'L30 AI120149/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI055435/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['antibiotic prophylaxis', 'hematologic neoplasms', 'levofloxacin', 'microbiota']",,,,,,['CDC Prevention Epicenters Program'],,,,,

Methods: The degree of correlation between TP53AIP1 expression and overall survival in patients with breast cancer was obtained from the online The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Six of the TP53AIP1 levels in the tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues randomly selected from 38 breast cancer patients were determined. Transgenic technology was used to enhance the expression of TP53AIP1 in breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-415 and MDA-MB-468, and to observe the effects of gene overexpression on the proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of breast cancer cells. The molecular mechanism of association between cell cycle- and apoptosis-related factors and the phosphoinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) pathway was also studied. Results: The messenger RNA and protein expression levels of TP53AIP1 in cancer tissues were significantly lower than those in the control group. TP53AIP1 overexpression inhibits cell viability. The mechanism of TP53AIP1 inhibition of proliferation and growth of breast cancer cells includes cell cycle arrest, apoptosis promotion (p < 0.01), promotion of the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 (p < 0.01), cleaved-caspase-9 (p < 0.01), B cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2)-associated X protein, and p53 (p < 0.01), and the inhibition of Bcl-2, Ki67, and PI3K/Akt pathways (p < 0.01). Conclusion: TP53AIP1 may be a novel tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer and can potentially be used as an effective target gene for the treatment of breast cancer.","['Liang, Yueyang', 'Wang, Shushu', 'Liu, Jia']","['Liang Y', 'Wang S', 'Liu J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1563-0596', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6343-8585', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1523-1018']","['Department of Breast Surgery, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Breast & Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University(Army Medical University), Chongqing, China.', ""Department of Breast & Thyroid Surgery, The First People's Hospital of Yunnan Province, Kunming, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190419,Korea (South),J Breast Cancer,Journal of breast cancer,101314183,,,,PMC6597403,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/07/10 06:01,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2018/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4048/jbc.2019.22.e21 [doi]'],epublish,J Breast Cancer. 2019 Apr 19;22(2):172-184. doi: 10.4048/jbc.2019.22.e21. eCollection 2019 Jun.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Breast neoplasms', 'Cell proliferation', 'Genes, p53']",['Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The antitumor effects of melatonin alone or combined with sorafenib were evaluated via flow cytometry and immunoblotting assays in FLT-ITD AML cells. Also, the ex vivo and in vivo models were used to test the synergistic effects of melatonin and sorafenib against leukemia with FLT3/ITD mutation. Results: Our study shows for the first time that melatonin inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in FLT3/ITD-positive leukemia cells. Mechanistically, melatonin preferentially causes overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ultimately massive cell death in FLT3-ITD AML cells. Moreover, melatonin significantly enhances the cytotoxicity induced by the FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib in AML cells with FLT3/ITD through redox modification. Importantly, combination of melatonin and sorafenib exhibited highly synergistic therapeutic activity in MV4-11 xenografts and a murine model bearing FLT3/ITD leukemia. Conclusion: This study indicates that melatonin, alone or in combination with sorafenib, has potential to improve the therapeutic outcome of AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutation that merits further investigation.","['Tian, Tian', 'Li, Jiajun', 'Li, Yizhuo', 'Lu, Yun-Xin', 'Tang, Yan-Lai', 'Wang, Hua', 'Zheng, Fufu', 'Shi, Dingbo', 'Long, Qian', 'Chen, Miao', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Hu, Yumin', 'Qin, Lijun', 'Deng, Wuguo']","['Tian T', 'Li J', 'Li Y', 'Lu YX', 'Tang YL', 'Wang H', 'Zheng F', 'Shi D', 'Long Q', 'Chen M', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Hu Y', 'Qin L', 'Deng W']",,"['Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510000, China.', 'Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center; State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China; Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou 510060, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190531,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Melatonin/*pharmacology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Biological', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sorafenib/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC6587355,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.34327 [doi]', 'thnov09p3768 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2019 May 31;9(13):3768-3779. doi: 10.7150/thno.34327. eCollection 2019.,13,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*FLT3-ITD', '*Leukemia', '*Melatonin', '*Redox modification', '*Sorafenib']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,

The two ALL subtypes considered are T-lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-T) and B-lymphoblastic leukaemia (pre-B). They exhibit various characteristics which make it difficult to distinguish between subtypes from their mature cells, lymphocytes. In a common approach, handcrafted features must be well designed for this complex domain-specific problem. With deep learning approach, handcrafted feature engineering can be eliminated because a deep learning method can automate this task through the multilayer architecture of a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this work, we implement a CNN classifier to explore the feasibility of deep learning approach to identify lymphocytes and ALL subtypes, and this approach is benchmarked against a dominant approach of support vector machines (SVMs) applying handcrafted feature engineering. Additionally, two traditional machine learning classifiers, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest are also applied for the comparison. The experiments show that our CNN classifier delivers better performance to identify normal lymphocytes and pre-B cells. This shows a great potential for image classification with no requirement of multiple preprocessing steps from feature engineering.","['Pansombut, Tatdow', 'Wikaisuksakul, Siripen', 'Khongkraphan, Kittiya', 'Phon-On, Aniruth']","['Pansombut T', 'Wikaisuksakul S', 'Khongkraphan K', 'Phon-On A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0536-0833', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2406-7002', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1833-0863', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1808-1545']","['Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Pattani 94000, Thailand.', 'Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Pattani 94000, Thailand.', 'Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Pattani 94000, Thailand.', 'Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Prince of Songkla University, Pattani 94000, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190602,United States,Comput Intell Neurosci,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,101279357,"['Intrauterine Growth Retardation, Metaphyseal Dysplasia, Adrenal Hypoplasia', 'Congenita, And Genital Anomalies']",IM,"['Adrenal Insufficiency', '*Algorithms', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Machine Learning', 'Nerve Net/*physiology', '*Neural Networks, Computer', 'Osteochondrodysplasias', 'Recognition, Psychology', 'Support Vector Machine', 'Urogenital Abnormalities']",PMC6589284,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/01/03 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/7519603 [doi]'],epublish,Comput Intell Neurosci. 2019 Jun 2;2019:7519603. doi: 10.1155/2019/7519603. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical immune regulatory factor, is dramatically down-regulated in mouse retinas during aging. To address the role of IRF3 in the retina, we examined the structure and function of retinas in young (3-4 months) and old (22-24 months) Irf3 (-/-) mice in comparison to age-matched wildtype (WT) mice. We found that IRF3 deletion resulted in impaired electroretinogram (ERG) responses and decreased retinal thickness in both young and old mice. In addition, numerous synapses of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) were found obviously extending into outer nuclear layer (ONL) in Irf3 (-/-) mice, along with a reduction of the average synapse density in the OPL. These changes suggest that IRF3 deletion may accelerate retinal senescence. In support of this hypothesis, a number of classic senescence-associated markers were found in remarkably elevated level in Irf3 (-/-) retina, including p53, p16(INK4a), inositol-requiring enzyme 1alpha (IREalpha), p-H2A.X and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Overall, our results indicate that maintenance normal IRF3 levels is necessary for retinal structure and function and suggest that IRF3 is an important regulator of retinal senescence.","['Zhang, Xi', 'Zhu, Jingyi', 'Chen, Xianjun', 'Jie-Qiong, Zhang', 'Li, Xue', 'Luo, Linlin', 'Huang, Huang', 'Liu, Wenyi', 'Zhou, Xinyuan', 'Yan, Jun', 'Lin, Sen', 'Ye, Jian']","['Zhang X', 'Zhu J', 'Chen X', 'Jie-Qiong Z', 'Li X', 'Luo L', 'Huang H', 'Liu W', 'Zhou X', 'Yan J', 'Lin S', 'Ye J']",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Institute of Immunology, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Institute of Surgery Research, Army Medical Center of PLA (Daping Hospital), Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190620,Switzerland,Front Cell Neurosci,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,101477935,,,,PMC6596281,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/07/10 06:01,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fncel.2019.00272 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Neurosci. 2019 Jun 20;13:272. doi: 10.3389/fncel.2019.00272. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERG', 'IRF3', 'retina', 'retinal thickness', 'senescence', 'synaptic ectopia']",,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with IBMFS exhibit a predisposition to developing hematological malignancy or solid tumor because of the defect in cellular and molecular hemostasis. The SAMD9 mutation causes the multisystem disorder, MIRAGE syndrome, characterized by congenital adrenal hypoplasia and loss of chromosome 7, providing a novel insight into the correlation between the germline and somatic mutations of SAMD9/SAMD9L and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with monosomy 7. Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are caused by inborn errors of the immune system. PID patients with inadequate tumor immunity are at an elevated risk of developing malignancies such as lymphoma, leukemia, and gastrointestinal cancer. Recently, monocytopenia and mycobacterial infection (MonoMAC) syndrome with the GATA2 gene mutation have been reported as PID related to bone marrow failure. Patients with MonoMAC syndrome often develop MDS and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we present the pediatric-onset IBMFS and/or PID with cancer predisposition and briefly discuss the tumorigenesis in each monogenic disease.","['Ishimura, Masataka', 'Ohga, Shouichi']","['Ishimura M', 'Ohga S']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['Bone Marrow failure syndromes'],,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*complications/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*complications/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Child', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/*complications/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.60.702 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2019;60(6):702-707. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.60.702.,6,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer predisposition', 'Familial MDS/AML', 'Inherited bone marrow failure syndrome', 'Primary immunodeficiency']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recent progress in next-generation sequencing technologies has allowed us to discover frequent mutations throughout the coding regions of MDS, MDS/MPN, and sAML, subsequently providing information on more than 60 driver genes in these diseases. As shown by many study groups recently, such driver mutations are acquired in a gene-specific fashion. DDX41 and SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations are observed in germline cells long before MDS presentation. In blood samples from healthy elderly individuals, somatic DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 mutations are detected as age-related clonal hematopoiesis and supposed to be a risk factor for hematological neoplasms. Recent reports on MDS have shown that mutations in genes such as NRAS and FLT3, designated as Type I genes, were significantly associated with leukemic evolution. Another type (Type II) of genes, including RUNX1 and GATA2, has been shown to be related to the progression from low-risk to high-risk MDS. These driver mutations are significantly concomitant during disease progression. Overall, various types of driver mutations are sequentially acquired in MDS, accounting for the heterogeneity of these disorders.","['Makishima, Hideki']",['Makishima H'],,"['Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,,"['Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*genetics']",,2019/07/10 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/07/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.60.600 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2019;60(6):600-609. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.60.600.,6,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Driver mutations', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'Secondary acute myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

Following induction chemotherapy, granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) were administered due to febrile neutropenia. A few weeks thereafter, skin eruption emerged on the palmar and dorsal surfaces of his hands, and skin biopsy confirmed Sweet syndrome. His symptoms improved with the short-term use of prednisolone. After recovering from the neutropenia, the patient received percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to unstable angina that developed after the induction chemotherapy.

This study will review the expression of ion channels in LCs and their possible function in leukemia progression. We searched relevant literature by a PubMed (2002-2019) of English-language literature using the terms ""ion channels"", ""leukemia"", ""proliferation"", ""differentiation"", ""apoptosis"", and ""migration"". Altered expression and dysfunction of ion channels can have a strong impact on hematopoietic cell and LCs physiology and signaling, which contributes to the vital processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Indeed, it can be stated that changing expression of ion channels can affect the onset and progression as well as clinical features and therapeutic responses of leukemia via inducing the maintenance of LCs. Since ion channels are membrane proteins, they can be easily accessible in LCs for understanding their influence on leukemia progression. On the other hand, ion channels can be new potential targets for chemotherapeutic agents, which may open a novel clinical and pharmaceutical field in leukemia therapy.","['Rafieemehr, H', 'Samimi, A', 'Maleki Behzad, M', 'Ghanavat, M', 'Shahrabi, S']","['Rafieemehr H', 'Samimi A', 'Maleki Behzad M', 'Ghanavat M', 'Shahrabi S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3904-5671'],"['Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, School of Paramedicine, Hamadan University of Medical Sciences, Hamadan, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Child Growth and Development Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran. sshahrabi45@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190706,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,['0 (Ion Channels)'],IM,"['Cell Movement', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/*therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction']",,2019/07/08 06:00,2020/11/18 06:00,['2019/07/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-019-02147-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-019-02147-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2020 Mar;22(3):283-293. doi: 10.1007/s12094-019-02147-2.

RESULTS: Among the analysed toxicities, infection and gastrointestinal and liver toxicities were the most common. The median follow-up was 6.8 years. Overall survival and event-free survival rates for the analysed group were lower than those reported for the group without grade >/=3 toxicity. In univariate analysis, we identified the number of toxic episodes, the risk group and remission status that had a significant impact on the outcome. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the risk group and the number of toxic episodes >/=3 to be statistically significant for the results.

The human 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) plays a central role in repairing these 8-oxoGs via the base excision repair pathway. Mounting evidence has suggested that hOGG1 polymorphisms may affect the activity of hOGG1 and serve as genomic markers for the prediction of personal susceptibility to several cancers. To determine whether the commonly examined hOGG1 rs1052133 (Ser326Cys) polymorphism is associated with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) among Taiwanese children, we genotyped the hOGG1 rs1052133 (Ser326Cys) in 266 cases and 266 controls. RESULTS: The distributions of the GG, CG and CC genotypes at the hOGG1 rs1052133 were 49.2, 39.1 and 11.7% in the control group and 48.1, 36.1 and 15.8% in the case group (p=0.3656). The combined genotypes CG+CC were not associated with increased risk of childhood ALL (odds ratio [OR]=1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.74-1.47, p=0.7947).

A number of HLA-restricted WT1 epitopes are immunogenic, allowing the in vitro induction of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from patients and healthy donors. AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of producing WT1-specific CTLs suitable for somatic cell therapy to prevent or treat relapse in children with acute myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia given haploidentical HSC transplantation (haplo-HSCT). METHODS: For WT1-specific CTL production, donor-derived either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or CD8+ lymphocytes were stimulated with WT1 peptide-loaded donor dendritic cells in the presence of interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-12. Effector cells were re-stimulated once with irradiated donor PBMCs pulsed with WT1-peptides, and then expanded in an antigen-independent way. RESULTS: WT1-specific CTLs, displaying high-level cytotoxicity against patients' leukemia blasts and negligible activity against patients' non-malignant cells, were obtained from both PBMCs and CD8+ lymphocytes. WT1-specific CTLs obtained from PBMCs showed a better expansion capacity and better anti-leukemia activity than those obtained from CD8+ lymphocytes, even though the difference was not statistically significant. In CTLs derived from PBMCs, both CD8+ and CD4+ subpopulations displayed strong anti-leukemia cytotoxic activity. DISCUSSION: Results of this pre-clinical study pave the way to a somatic cell therapy approach aimed at preventing or treating relapse in children given haplo-HSCT for WT1-positive leukemia.","['Ferulli, Federica', 'Tanzi, Matteo', 'Turin, Ilaria', 'Montini, Enrica', 'Rosti, Vittorio', 'Acquafredda, Gloria', 'Lisini, Daniela', 'Compagno, Francesca', 'Boghen, Stella', 'Licari, Amelia', 'Marseglia, Gianluigi', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Montagna, Daniela']","['Ferulli F', 'Tanzi M', 'Turin I', 'Montini E', 'Rosti V', 'Acquafredda G', 'Lisini D', 'Compagno F', 'Boghen S', 'Licari A', 'Marseglia G', 'Zecca M', 'Montagna D']",,"['Laboratory of Immunology and Transplantation, Fondazione Istituto Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Pediatric Haematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Transplantation, Fondazione Istituto Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Pediatric Haematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Center for the Study of Myelofibrosis, Research and Experimental Biotechnology Laboratory Area, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Pediatric Haematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cell Therapy Production Unit, Unita Operativa (UO) Cerebrovascular Disease, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Neurologico Carlo Besta, Milan, Italy.', 'Pediatric Haematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Haematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Department of Clinic-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinic, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Department of Clinic-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Pediatric Haematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunology and Transplantation, Fondazione Istituto Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Cell Factory, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy; Department of Clinic-Surgical, Diagnostic and Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, Italy.

This study investigated the NAT10 expression in Chinese acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and evaluated the predictive significance of NAT10 with a single-center retrospective study. METHODS: The Oncomine was used to analyze NAT10 expression in AML. We also collected bone marrow samples of 48 newly diagnosed AML patients and 20 benign individuals in our center. NAT10 mRNA expression levels were detected by real-time qPCR. Clinical data was obtained from inpatient medical records. RESULTS: Two microarrays in Oncomine showed that NAT10 was upregulated in AML. Our data revealed that AML patients had higher NAT10 expression levels than the normal controls (P < 0.01). NPM1-mutant patients had higher NAT10 mRNA levels than NPM1-wt patients. NAT10 expression level was higher in nonremission group than in overall remission group (P < 0.05). High NAT10 expression indicated a poor progression-free survival and overall survival.

PURPOSE: Case study of disparities in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHOD: Literature-based evaluation of ALL in African American (AA) and European American (EA) children. FINDINGS: AA children have a lower incidence of ALL than EA children, experience higher relapse rates, and are more likely to be diagnosed with poor prognostic indicators. Environmental risk exposures for ALL have small effect sizes; data are insufficient to determine their contribution to differences in incidence and prognosis. Differences in prevalence of gene variants associated with treatment response contribute to higher relapse rates in AA children. However, higher relapse rates were not seen in a care setting that eliminated out of pocket costs, used risk-directed therapy, and included rigorous case management. DISCUSSION: Unequal access to effective treatment contributes to ALL disparities.

Midostaurin, a multikinase inhibitor that targets FLT3, demonstrated a survival benefit in FLT3-mutated AML in combination with front-line chemotherapy. Despite this advancement, the use of FLT3 inhibitors in clinical practice is complicated by significant drug-drug interactions and uncertainty about optimal timing, duration, and sequencing of therapy. As monotherapy, the utility of FLT3 inhibitors was initially limited by incomplete and transient clinical responses and the development of acquired resistance. This led to the development of more potent and selective FLT3 inhibitors designed to overcome common resistance mechanisms. One of these second generation FLT3 inhibitors, gilteritinib, is now FDA-approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML.

In addition, B cells, including plasma cells, within the central nervous system compartment are likely to play an important role in disease progression in both relapsing and progressive MS. However, current B cell-targeting antibodies may not inhibit these, because of poor penetration into the central nervous system and often oligoclonal bands of immunoglobulin persist within the cerebrospinal fluid despite immunotherapy. Through targeting B cells and plasma cells in the CNS, it may be possible to obtain additional benefit above simple peripheral depletion of B cells. As such there are a number of inhibitors of B cell function and B cell depleting agents that have been developed for myeloma and B cell leukaemia and lymphoma, which could potentially be used off-label or as an experimental treatment for advanced (progressive) MS.","['Baker, David', 'Jacobs, Benjamin M', 'Gnanapavan, Sharmilee', 'Schmierer, Klaus', 'Giovannoni, Gavin']","['Baker D', 'Jacobs BM', 'Gnanapavan S', 'Schmierer K', 'Giovannoni G']",,"['BartsMS, Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, 4 Newark Street, London E1 2AT, United Kingdom.

Tumors with these mutations almost always acquire resistance, which also occurs in other oncogene-addicted lung cancers. However, the resistance mechanisms and treatment strategies are not fully understood. METHODS: We generated Ba/F3 cells expressing MET exon 14 mutations by retroviral gene transfer. The sensitivities of these cells to eight MET-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were determined using a colorimetric assay. In addition, using N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis, we generated resistant clones, searched for secondary MET mutations, and then examined the sensitivities of these resistant cells to different TKIs. RESULTS: Ba/F3 cells transfected with MET mutations grew in the absence of interleukin-3, indicating their oncogenic activity. These cells were sensitive to all MET-TKIs except tivantinib. We identified a variety of secondary mutations. D1228 and Y1230 were common sites for resistance mutations for type I TKIs, which bind the active form of MET, whereas L1195 and F1200 were common sites for type II TKIs, which bind the inactive form. In general, resistance mutations against type I were sensitive to type II, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: MET-TKIs inhibited the growth of cells with MET exon 14 mutations. We also identified mutation sites specific for TKI types as resistance mechanisms and complementary activities between type I and type II inhibitors against those mutations. These finding should provide relevant clinical implication for treating patients with lung cancer harboring MET exon 14 mutations.","['Fujino, Toshio', 'Kobayashi, Yoshihisa', 'Suda, Kenichi', 'Koga, Takamasa', 'Nishino, Masaya', 'Ohara, Shuta', 'Chiba, Masato', 'Shimoji, Masaki', 'Tomizawa, Kenji', 'Takemoto, Toshiki', 'Mitsudomi, Tetsuya']","['Fujino T', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Suda K', 'Koga T', 'Nishino M', 'Ohara S', 'Chiba M', 'Shimoji M', 'Tomizawa K', 'Takemoto T', 'Mitsudomi T']",,"['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, Osaka-Sayama, Japan.

The research work on the CSC has been providing a promising approach for the improvement of cancer therapies in the future. The CSCs have a close connection with the cytokines related with the T helper 17 (Th17) cell and other factors present in the tumor microenvironment, and these play a pivotal role in tumor progression and metastasis. The properties of CSCs are well defined in various type of tumor which is mainly developed by chemically and spontaneously in murine cancer model but in human defined primarily on acute myeloid leukemia, glioma, and breast cancer.

Major limitations in Doxorubicin (Dox) chemotherapy are tumor resistance and severe drug complications. Here, we combined Thymoquinone (TQ) with low concentrations of Dox and determined anticancer effects against ATL in cell culture and animal model. MAIN METHODS: HTLV-1 positive (HuT-102) and HTLV-1 negative (Jurkat) CD4+ malignant T-cell lines were treated with TQ, Dox and combinations. Viability and cell cycle effects were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Combination effects on mitochondrial membrane potential and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed. Expression levels of key cell death proteins were investigated by western blotting. A mouse xenograft model of ATL in NOD/SCID was used for testing drug effects and tumor tissues were stained for Ki67 and TUNEL. KEY FINDINGS: TQ and Dox caused greater inhibition of cell viability and increased sub-G1 cells in both cell lines compared to Dox or TQ alone. The combination induced apoptosis by increasing ROS and causing disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Pretreatment with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) or pan caspase inhibitor significantly inhibited the apoptotic response suggesting that cell death is ROS- and caspase-dependent. TQ and Dox combination reduced tumor volume in NOD/SCID mice more significantly than single treatments through enhanced apoptosis without affecting the survival of mice. SIGNIFICANCE: Our combination model offers the possibility to use up to twofold lower doses of Dox against ATL while exhibiting the same cancer inhibitory effects.","['Fatfat, Maamoun', 'Fakhoury, Isabelle', 'Habli, Zeina', 'Mismar, Rasha', 'Gali-Muhtasib, Hala']","['Fatfat M', 'Fakhoury I', 'Habli Z', 'Mismar R', 'Gali-Muhtasib H']",,"['Department of Biology, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Riad El Solh, 1107 2020, Beirut, Lebanon; Center for Drug Discovery, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biology, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Riad El Solh, 1107 2020, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biology, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Riad El Solh, 1107 2020, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biology, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Riad El Solh, 1107 2020, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Biology, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiological Sciences, American University of Beirut, Riad El Solh, 1107 2020, Beirut, Lebanon; Center for Drug Discovery, American University of Beirut, Lebanon.

IM exposure caused a concentration-dependent, irreversible, suppression of folliculogenesis, reversible decrease in sperm density and motility, decreased fecundity and fertility, but no significant change in atretic follicle abundance. We also observed IM-induced premature hatching, but no significant change in embryo-larvae survivability. However, we found significant IM-induced morphometric malformations. IM decreased expression of vegfaa and igf2a (two reproductive-, angiogenic-, and growth-related genes) in testes and ovaries. The results demonstrate IM can induce significant changes in critical reproductive endpoints and zebrafish as a suitable model organism to show effects of IM on reproduction. The findings suggest that TKI effects on reproductive success should be considered.","['Ahmadi, Nader', 'Samaee, Seyed-Mohammadreza', 'Yokel, Robert A', 'Tehrani, Aliasghar']","['Ahmadi N', 'Samaee SM', 'Yokel RA', 'Tehrani A']",,"['Aquatic Lab, Department of Food Hygiene and Quality Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University, Urmia 165, Iran.', 'Aquatic Lab, Department of Food Hygiene and Quality Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Urmia University, Urmia 165, Iran.

AIMS: In this multicenter prospective study, we investigated whether heavy + light chains (HLC: IgGkappa, IgGlambda, IgAkappa, IgAkappa, IgMkappa, IgMlambda) and IgG subclasses (IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4) could be used as novel prognostic markers of immunoparesis in 105 treatment-naive patients with CLL. RESULTS: Heavy + light chains immunoparesis of >/=1, >/=2, and >/=3 isotypes was evident in 74 (70%), 58 (55%), and 36 (34%) patients, respectively. Severe HLC immunoparesis was identified in 40 (38%) patients. Of the IgG subclasses, IgG1 and IgG2 were most frequently suppressed, affecting 46 (44%) and 36 (34%) patients, respectively; 63 (60%) patients had low levels of at least one IgG subclass. In multivariate analysis, severe HLC immunoparesis (hazard ratio [HR]: 36.5; P = .010) and SigmaFLC >/= 70 mg/L (HR: 13.2; P = .004) were the only factors independently associated with time to first treatment (TTFT). A risk model including these variables identified patients with 0, 1, and 2 risk factors and significantly different TTFT (P < .001). Patients with two factors represented an ultra-high-risk group with a median TTFT of only 1.3 months. CONCLUSION: The above findings demonstrate the potential for the use of HLC immunoparesis, together with sFLC measurements, as future prognostic biomarkers in CLL.","['Tadmor, Tamar', 'Braester, Andrei', 'Najib, Dally', 'Aviv, Ariel', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Yuklea, Mona', 'Shvidel, Lev', 'Rahimi-Levene, Naomi', 'Ruchlemer, Rosa', 'Arad, Ariela', 'Fogl, Claudia', 'Henig, Clara', 'Barak, Mira', 'Magal, Lee', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Townsend, Kelly']","['Tadmor T', 'Braester A', 'Najib D', 'Aviv A', 'Herishanu Y', 'Yuklea M', 'Shvidel L', 'Rahimi-Levene N', 'Ruchlemer R', 'Arad A', 'Fogl C', 'Henig C', 'Barak M', 'Magal L', 'Polliack A', 'Townsend K']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3435-8612', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7864-0089']","['Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Western Galilee Hospital, Nahariya, Israel.', 'Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Ziv Medical Center, Safed, Israel.', 'Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel.', 'Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Tel-Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel.', 'Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.', ""Assaf Harofeh Medical Center, Be'er Ya'akov, Israel."", 'Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Binding Site Group Ltd, Birmingham, UK.', 'Haifa and Western Galilee Laboratory, Nesher, Israel.', 'Haifa and Western Galilee Laboratory, Nesher, Israel.', 'Almog Diagnostic, Park Shoham, Israel.', 'Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Binding Site Group Ltd, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190726,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*blood', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*epidemiology/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Time-to-Treatment']",,2019/07/07 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13288 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Oct;103(4):335-341. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13288.

Therefore, the treatment must be selected based on risk stratification. However, the methods to predict the clinical outcomes of AML are insufficient. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are unable or barely able to code for proteins and have attracted remarkable interest because of their involvement in malignancies. Previous studies have proven that some lncRNAs contribute to the development and clinical outcome of AML. Our study constructed a risk stratification system for AML that will facilitate the prediction of clinical outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS We acquired the expression profiles of lncRNAs from the TCGA database to examine their role in the clinical outcomes of AML. We designed and validated a prognostic signature-based risk score system using a sample splitting approach and Cox regression analysis to elucidate the relationship between the clinical outcomes of AML and lncRNAs. RESULTS We selected 10 lncRNAs to predict the clinical outcome of AML and were able to successfully predict the survival of patients with AML using this 10-lncRNA expression signature. CONCLUSIONS We developed a 10-lncRNA expression signature to predict the clinical outcome of AML. This approach demonstrates remarkable prognostic and therapeutic potential for AML.","['Tang, Ping', 'Xie, Menghan', 'Wei, Yan', 'Xie, Xinsheng', 'Chen, Dandan', 'Jiang, Zhongxing']","['Tang P', 'Xie M', 'Wei Y', 'Xie X', 'Chen D', 'Jiang Z']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190706,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6636400,2019/07/07 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['917182 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.917182 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Jul 6;25:4999-5004. doi: 10.12659/MSM.917182.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness and low toxicity of realgar have been verified, lower than arsenic trioxide. Although the therapeutic efficacy of realgar is blocked severely by its poor insolubility in water. In our lab, we addressed this problem by obtaining realgar bioleaching solution (RBS) from microbiological leaching technique. To develop a tradition Chinese medicinal formula (TCMF) for clinical application realgar is usually used with other herbs. However, treated realgar with RBS has not been evaluated in TCMF contain realgar. In the present study we used NB4 to investigate the effects of novel Realgar-Indigo naturalis formula (FRBS) on cell proliferation and apoptosis. We used MTT assay to measure anti proliferative activity of FRBS. We further study the effects of FRBS on cell growth and apoptosis according flow cytometry, DNA fragmentation assay and Fluorescence microscopy and Western blot. The results revealed that FRBS significantly inhibited growth in a dose-dependent manner, and induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. NB4 cell inhibitory response to FRBS at 2mug ml(-1) of arsenic concentration was twofold higher, dissimilar to RIF, and induced apoptosis more effectively. Further, a higher expression of caspase-3, caspase-9 and cytochrome C from increased from FRBS.

This success has sparked the development of new cellular therapy products for numerous indications. Similar to pharmaceutical products, challenges exist at nearly every stage of process development; however, the unique nature of a cellular therapy product can present exceptional challenges that are just beginning to emerge. The purpose of this review is to explore some of the most common challenges experienced during the early phases of development of CAR T cell products and to provide suggestions for navigating these challenges. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent articles focused on CAR T cells are highlighted with special attention on aspects that relate to CAR T cell process development and clinical manufacturing. We examine the various stages of process development for CAR T cells and outline some of the obstacles that must be overcome in order to move from pre-clinical development into clinical manufacturing. As the field of CAR T cell therapy continues to grow, it is important to quickly move new CAR T cell products into and through early phase clinical trials and to ensure that the result of these trials can be adequately compared. Having laboratory and clinical investigators and GMP manufacturing facilities aligned on the numerous aspects of new product development will facilitate this process.","['Highfill, Steven L', 'Stroncek, David F']","['Highfill SL', 'Stroncek DF']",,"['Center for Cellular Engineering, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. steven.highfill@nih.gov.', 'Center for Cellular Engineering, Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Batch Cell Culture Techniques', 'Bioreactors', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Engineering/methods', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/adverse effects/*methods/standards', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Engineering/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",,2019/07/07 06:00,2020/07/25 06:00,['2019/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00529-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00529-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Aug;14(4):269-277. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00529-5.,4,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T cells', '*Cellular therapy', '*GMP manufacturing', '*Process development']",,,,,,,,,,,

CLL is an incurable disease with a heterogeneous clinical course, for which the treatment decision still relies on conventional parameters (such as clinical stage and lymphocyte doubling time). During the past 5 years, relevant advances have been made in understanding CLL biology. Indeed, substantial progress has been made in the identification of the putative cell of origin of CLL, and comprehensive studies have dissected the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape of CLL. Advances in clinical management include improvements in our understanding of the prognostic value of different genetic lesions, particularly those associated with chemoresistance and progression to highly aggressive forms of CLL, and the advent of new therapies targeting crucial biological pathways. In this Review, we discuss new insights into the genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of CLL and how these genetic insights influence clinical management and the development of new therapeutic strategies for this disease.","['Bosch, Francesc', 'Dalla-Favera, Riccardo']","['Bosch F', 'Dalla-Favera R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9241-2886'],"[""Department of Haematology, University Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Autonomous University, Barcelona, Spain. fbosch@vhio.net."", ""Laboratory of Experimental Haematology, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Barcelona, Spain. fbosch@vhio.net."", 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. fbosch@vhio.net.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Nat Rev Clin Oncol,Nature reviews.

We provide reproducible solutions to solve these issues and use orthogonal approaches to validate our results. We show how a comprehensive mutational signature analysis may provide relevant biological insights, reporting evidence of c-AID activity among unmutated CLL cases or the absence of BRCA1/BRCA2-mediated homologous recombination deficiency in a MM cohort.

These challenges are in some respects defined and, in others, uncertain due to the nascence of the field. At present, information pertaining to such post-approval challenges are scattered in various previous reviews or raised in singular papers reporting experience in working with the therapy. This systematic review is designed to evaluate and summarise the post-approval challenges for robust delivery of CAR-T therapies to inform future work on the optimisation of CAR-T delivery to patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search Medline, EMBASE (OvidSP), BIOSIS & Web of Science, Cochrane Library, ICER database, NICE Evidence Search, CEA Registry, WHOLIS WHO Library and Scopus for studies published between 2014 and the present. In addition, a Google search for grey literature such as bioprocess blog posts, opinion pieces, press releases and listed companies involved in CAR-T development annual reports will be conducted. Two authors will independently screen the titles and abstracts identified from the search and accept or reject the studies according to the study inclusion criteria and any discrepancies will be discussed and resolved. The quality of the selected literature will be assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) Systematic Review checklist and grey literature will be assessed using the Authority, Accuracy, Coverage, Objectivity, Date, Significance (AACODS) checklist. Data from eligible publications will be categorised using a flowchart and extracted using a data abstraction form. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the post-approval challenges of CAR-T therapies will be conducted based on the results attained. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The executed study will be published in a peer-reviewed journal in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The findings from this review will be used to inform the development of an optimisation model for robust delivery of CAR-T therapies using a systems engineering approach.

We have identified TSPYL5 (testis-specific Y-encoded-like protein 5) as a PML body component, co-localizing with ALT telomeres and critical for ALT(+) cell viability. TSPYL5 was described as an inhibitor of the USP7 deubiquitinase. We report that TSPYL5 prevents the poly-ubiquitination of POT1-a shelterin component-and protects POT1 from proteasomal degradation exclusively in ALT(+) cells. USP7 depletion rescued POT1 poly-ubiquitination and loss, suggesting that the deubiquitinase activates POT1 E3 ubiquitin ligase(s). Similarly, PML depletion suppressed POT1 poly-ubiquitination, suggesting an interplay between USP7 and PML to trigger POT1 degradation in TSPYL5-depleted ALT(+) cells. We demonstrate that ALT telomeres need to be protected from POT1 degradation in ALT-associated PML bodies and identify TSPYL5 as an ALT(+) cancer-specific therapeutic target.","['Episkopou, Harikleia', 'Diman, Aurelie', 'Claude, Eloise', 'Viceconte, Nikenza', 'Decottignies, Anabelle']","['Episkopou H', 'Diman A', 'Claude E', 'Viceconte N', 'Decottignies A']",,"['Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of Genomes, de Duve Institute, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of Genomes, de Duve Institute, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of Genomes, de Duve Institute, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of Genomes, de Duve Institute, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.', 'Genetic and Epigenetic Alterations of Genomes, de Duve Institute, Faculty of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels 1200, Belgium.

The selection of trastuzumab-resistant patients is a great challenge of precision oncology. The aim of this study was to identify novel epigenetic biomarkers associated to trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ BC patients. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide DNA methylation (450K array) and a transcriptomic analysis (RNA-Seq) comparing trastuzumab-sensitive (SK) and trastuzumab-resistant (SKTR) HER2+ human breast cancer cell models. The methylation and expression levels of candidate genes were validated by bisulfite pyrosequencing and qRT-PCR, respectively. Functional assays were conducted in the SK and SKTR models by gene silencing and overexpression. Methylation analysis in 24 HER2+ human BC samples with complete response or non-response to trastuzumab-based treatment was conducted by bisulfite pyrosequencing. RESULTS: Epigenomic and transcriptomic analysis revealed the consistent hypermethylation and downregulation of TGFBI, CXCL2, and SLC38A1 genes in association with trastuzumab resistance. The DNA methylation and expression levels of these genes were validated in both sensitive and resistant models analyzed. Of the genes, TGFBI presented the highest hypermethylation-associated silencing both at the transcriptional and protein level. Ectopic expression of TGFBI in the SKTR model suggest an increased sensitivity to trastuzumab treatment. In primary tumors, TGFBI hypermethylation was significantly associated with trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest for the first time an association between the epigenetic silencing of TGFBI by DNA methylation and trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ cell models. These results provide the basis for further clinical studies to validate the hypermethylation of TGFBI promoter as a biomarker of trastuzumab resistance in HER2+ breast cancer patients.","['Palomeras, Sonia', 'Diaz-Lagares, Angel', 'Vinas, Gemma', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Ferreira, Humberto J', 'Oliveras, Gloria', 'Crujeiras, Ana B', 'Hernandez, Alejandro', 'Lum, David H', 'Welm, Alana L', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Puig, Teresa']","['Palomeras S', 'Diaz-Lagares A', 'Vinas G', 'Setien F', 'Ferreira HJ', 'Oliveras G', 'Crujeiras AB', 'Hernandez A', 'Lum DH', 'Welm AL', 'Esteller M', 'Puig T']",,"['New Therapeutics Targets Lab (TargetsLab), Department of Medical Sciences, University of Girona, E-17071, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenomics, Translational Medical Oncology (Oncomet), Health Research Institute of Santiago (IDIS), University Clinical Hospital of Santiago(CHUS/SERGAS), CIBERONC, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'New Therapeutics Targets Lab (TargetsLab), Department of Medical Sciences, University of Girona, E-17071, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Medical Oncology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO), Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Girona Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBGI), E-17071, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'New Therapeutics Targets Lab (TargetsLab), Department of Medical Sciences, University of Girona, E-17071, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Pathology Department, Dr. Josep Trueta Hospital and Catalan Institute of Health (ICS), E-17071, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Epigenomics in Endocrinology and Nutrition, Health Research Institute of Santiago (IDIS), University Clinical Hospital of Santiago (CHUS/SERGAS), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'CIBER Fisiopatologia de la Obesidad y Nutricion (CIBERobn), Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Medical Oncology Department, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO), Girona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, USA.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@idibell.cat.', 'New Therapeutics Targets Lab (TargetsLab), Department of Medical Sciences, University of Girona, E-17071, Girona, Catalonia, Spain. teresa.puig@udg.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190705,England,Breast Cancer Res,Breast cancer research : BCR,100927353,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '148710-76-3 (betaIG-H3 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics/metabolism', 'Trastuzumab/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC6612099,2019/07/07 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13058-019-1160-x [doi]', '10.1186/s13058-019-1160-x [pii]']",epublish,Breast Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 5;21(1):79. doi: 10.1186/s13058-019-1160-x.,1,['P30 CA042014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*HER2+ breast cancer', '*TGFBI', '*Trastuzumab resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,

Endothelial damage secondary to radiation or chemotherapy may lead to consumption of transfused platelets but research in this field is scarce. Patients were divided into four groups: Group 1: Acute leukaemia; Group 2: Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT); Group 3: Allogenic SCT; and Group 4: patients receiving platelets prior to interventions. Blood was sampled before (baseline) and immediately after (0 h) transfusion and then at 1, 4, 8, 16 and 24 h after transfusion. The biomarkers syndecan-1, soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analysed. The plasma concentration differences between baseline and later sampling times were referred to as delta (Delta). Fifty-four platelet transfusion events were studied. All biomarkers were within the normal ranges both before and after the transfusions. The Deltasyndecan-1 increased at 0 h (p = .02), but there was no significant correlation between Deltasyndecan-1 and CCI. There was no change in any of the other biomarkers after transfusion compared to before. There were no differences between the groups and no correlations were found between CCI and C-reactive protein, Deltasyndecan-1, DeltasTM or DeltaVEGF. There were no signs of endothelial damage before or after platelet transfusions. A transient significant change in syndecan-1 immediately after platelet transfusion did not influence platelet count or platelet CCI.","['Benediktsson, S', 'Kander, T', 'Ostrowski, S R', 'Johansson, P I', 'Thomas, O D', 'Schott, U']","['Benediktsson S', 'Kander T', 'Ostrowski SR', 'Johansson PI', 'Thomas OD', 'Schott U']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2522-1259', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5404-2981', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5288-3851', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9778-5964', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2515-6581', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4190-5856']","['Medical Faculty, Institution of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'Department of Perioperative and Intensive Care, Skane University Hospital , Lund , Sweden.', 'Medical Faculty, Institution of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'Department of Perioperative and Intensive Care, Skane University Hospital , Lund , Sweden.', 'Section for Transfusion Medicine, Capital Region Blood Bank, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen , Denmark.', 'Section for Transfusion Medicine, Capital Region Blood Bank, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen , Copenhagen , Denmark.', 'Medical Faculty, Institution of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, SUS Skane University Hospital Lund , Lund , Sweden.', 'Medical Faculty, Institution of Clinical Sciences Lund, Lund University , Lund , Sweden.', 'Department of Perioperative and Intensive Care, Skane University Hospital , Lund , Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190705,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets', 'C-Reactive Protein/metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Platelet Count', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Syndecan-1/blood', 'Thrombomodulin/blood', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood']",,2019/07/07 06:00,2020/06/20 06:00,['2019/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/00365513.2019.1636403 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2019 Oct;79(6):395-403. doi: 10.1080/00365513.2019.1636403.

We investigated whether this capacity is associated with molecular genetic abnormalities, and we compared the proteomic profiles of AML cells with high and low release. AML cells were derived from 71 consecutive patients that showed an expected frequency of cytogenetic and molecular genetic abnormalities. The constitutive extracellular release of 34 soluble mediators (CCL and CXCL chemokines, interleukins, proteases, and protease regulators) was investigated for an unselected subset of 62 patients, and they could be classified into high/intermediate/low release subsets based on their general capacity of constitutive secretion. FLT3-ITD was more frequent among patients with high constitutive mediator release, but our present study showed no additional associations between the capacity of constitutive release and 53 other molecular genetic abnormalities. We compared the proteomic profiles of two contrasting patient subsets showing either generally high or low constitutive release. A network analysis among cells with high release levels demonstrated high expression of intracellular proteins interacting with integrins, RAC1, and SYK signaling. In contrast, cells with low release showed high expression of several transcriptional regulators. We conclude that AML cell capacity of constitutive mediator release is characterized by different expression of potential intracellular therapeutic targets.","['Reikvam, Hakon', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Brenner, Annette K', 'Bartaula-Brevik, Sushma', 'Gronningsaeter, Ida Sofie', 'Forthun, Rakel Brendsdal', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Reikvam H', 'Aasebo E', 'Brenner AK', 'Bartaula-Brevik S', 'Gronningsaeter IS', 'Forthun RB', 'Hovland R', 'Bruserud O']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5439-8411', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6939-8059']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020,Bergen, Norway.

The prototype of Sprouty proteins was originally identified in Drosophila melanogaster as antagonists of Breathless, the mammalian ortholog of fibroblast growth factor receptor. Usually, SPRY family members are inhibitors of RAS signaling induced by tyrosine kinases receptors and they are implicated in negative feedback processes regulating several intracellular pathways. The present study aims to investigate the role of a member of the Sprouty family, Sprouty1, as a regulator of cell proliferation and growth in patients affected by acute myeloid leukemia. Sprouty1 mRNA and protein were both significantly down-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia cells compared to the normal counterpart, but they were restored when remission is achieved after chemotherapy. Ectopic expression of Sprouty1 revealed that it plays a key role in the proliferation and apoptotic defect that represent a landmark of the leukemic cells. Our study identified Sprouty1 as negative regulator involved in the aberrant signals of adult acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, we found a correlation between Sprouty1 and FoxO3a delocalization in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients at diagnosis, suggesting a multistep regulation of RAS signaling in human cancers.","['Rosso, Valentina', 'Panuzzo, Cristina', 'Petiti, Jessica', 'Carturan, Sonia', 'Dragani, Matteo', 'Andreani, Giacomo', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Bracco, Enrico', 'Cilloni, Daniela']","['Rosso V', 'Panuzzo C', 'Petiti J', 'Carturan S', 'Dragani M', 'Andreani G', 'Fava C', 'Saglio G', 'Bracco E', 'Cilloni D']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8640-2462', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4877-3929', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4896-981X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3170-2817', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6346-4791']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, 10043 Turin, Italy. daniela.cilloni@unito.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190704,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC6678378,2019/07/07 06:00,2019/07/07 06:01,['2019/07/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8070972 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8070972 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Jul 4;8(7). pii: jcm8070972. doi: 10.3390/jcm8070972.,7,['10100/Daniela Cilloni'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FoxO3a', 'Sprouty1', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)']",,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We pooled data from two similar phase III randomised trials of ET +/- Bev (LEA and Cancer and Leukemia Group B 40503) to increase precision in estimating treatment effect. Primary end-point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end-points were overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR) and safety. Exploratory analyses were performed within subgroups defined by patients with recurrent disease, de novo disease, prior endocrine sensitivity or resistance and reported grades III-IV hypertension and proteinuria. RESULTS: The pooled sample consisted of 749 patients randomised to ET or ET + Bev. Median PFS was 14.3 months for ET versus 19 months for ET + Bev (unadjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.91; p < 0.01). ORR and CBR with ET and ET + Bev were 40 versus 61% (p < 0.01) and 64 versus 77% (p < 0.01), respectively. There was no difference in OS (HR 0.96; 95% CI 0.77-1.18; p = 0.68). PFS was superior for ET + Bev for endocrine-sensitive patients (HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.53-0.89; p = 0.004). Grade III-IV hypertension (2.2 versus 20.1%), proteinuria (0 versus 9.3%), cardiovascular (0.5 versus 4.2%) and liver events (0 versus 2.9%) were significantly higher for ET + Bev (all p < 0.01). Hypertension and proteinuria were not predictors of efficacy (interaction test p = 0.33). CONCLUSION: The addition of Bev to ET increased PFS overall and in endocrine-sensitive patients but not OS at the expense of significant additional toxicity.

'Full donor chimerism' was defined as >/=99% donor cells and three patient groups were defined: 40% with full donor chimerism (FC) in both PBMC and T-cells; 25% with mixed chimerism (MC) within both compartments and 35% with 'split' chimerism (SC) characterised by full donor chimerism within PBMC and mixed chimerism within T-cells. RESULTS: In patients with myeloid disease a pattern of mixed chimerism (MC) was associated with a one year relapse rate of 45% and a five year overall survival of 40% compared to values of 8% and 75%, and 17% and 60%, for those with SC or FC respectively. The pattern of chimerism had no impact on clinical outcome for lymphoma. CONCLUSION: The pattern of lineage-specific chimerism at 50 days after transplantation is highly predictive of clinical outcome for patients with myeloid malignancy and may help to guide subsequent clinical management.","['Kinsella, Francesca A M', 'Inman, Charlotte F', 'Gudger, Amy', 'Chan, Yuen T', 'Murray, Duncan J', 'Zuo, Jianmin', 'McIlroy, Graham', 'Nagra, Sandeep', 'Nunnick, Jane', 'Holder, Kathy', 'Wall, Kerry', 'Griffiths, Mike', 'Craddock, Charles', 'Nikolousis, Emmanouil', 'Moss, Paul', 'Malladi, Ram']","['Kinsella FAM', 'Inman CF', 'Gudger A', 'Chan YT', 'Murray DJ', 'Zuo J', 'McIlroy G', 'Nagra S', 'Nunnick J', 'Holder K', 'Wall K', 'Griffiths M', 'Craddock C', 'Nikolousis E', 'Moss P', 'Malladi R']",,"['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Heartlands Hospital, Heart of England NHS Foundation trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Heartlands Hospital, Heart of England NHS Foundation trust, Birmingham, UK.', ""West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", ""School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; West Midlands Regional Genetics Laboratory, Birmingham Women's NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK."", 'Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Heartlands Hospital, Heart of England NHS Foundation trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Centre for Clinical Haematology, Queen Elizabeth NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham, UK.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify alternative agents that act synergistically with BCR-ABL TKIs in BP-CML. Our results show that the anti-malarial agent, mefloquine augments the efficacy of TKIs in CML cell lines and primary CML cells in vitro, including those with the T315I mutation. This effect is selective as mefloquine is more effective in inducing apoptosis, inhibiting colony formation and self-renewal capacity of CD34(+) cells derived from TKI-resistant BP-CML patients than normal cord blood (CB) CD34(+) stem/progenitor cells. Notably, the combination of mefloquine and TKIs at sublethal concentrations leads to synergistic effects in CML CD34(+) cells, while sparing normal CB CD34(+) cells. We further demonstrate that the initial action of mefloquine in CML cells is to increase lysosomal biogenesis and activation, followed by oxidative stress, lysosomal lipid damage and functional impairment. Taken together, our work elucidates that mefloquine selectively augments the effects of TKIs in CML stem/progenitor cells by inducing lysosomal dysfunction.","['Lam Yi, Hui', 'Than, Hein', 'Sng, Colin', 'Cheong, May Anne', 'Chuah, Charles', 'Xiang, Wei']","['Lam Yi H', 'Than H', 'Sng C', 'Cheong MA', 'Chuah C', 'Xiang W']",,"['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore; Program in Cancer and Stem Cell Biology, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.

In this phase I dose-escalation study, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary efficacy of volasertib were determined in pediatric patients. METHODS: Patients aged 2 to <18 years with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia/advanced solid tumors (ST) without available effective treatments were enrolled-cohort C1 (aged 2 to <12 years); cohort C2 (aged 12 to <18 years). The patients received volasertib intravenously (starting dose: 200 mg/m(2) body surface area on day 1, every 14 days). The primary endpoint was the pediatric MTD for further development. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients received treatment (C1: leukemia, n = 4; ST, n = 8; C2: leukemia, n = 3; ST, n = 7). No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) occurred up to 300 mg/m(2) volasertib in C1; two patients in C2, at 250 mg/m(2) volasertib, had DLTs in cycle 1, one of which led to death; therefore, the MTD of volasertib in C2 was 200 mg/m(2) . The most common grade 3/4 adverse events (all patients) were febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia (41% each). Stable disease (SD) was the best objective response (leukemia, n = 5; ST, n = 2); the duration of SD was short in all patients, except in one with an ST. PK profiles were generally comparable across dose groups and were consistent with those in adults. CONCLUSION: The pediatric MTD/dose for further development was identified. There were no unexpected safety or PK findings; limited antitumor/antileukemic activity was demonstrated.","['Doz, Francois', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Blin, Nicolas', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Frappaz, Didier', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Fischer, Matthias', 'Stary, Jan', 'Fuertig, Rene', 'Riemann, Kathrin', 'Taube, Tillmann', 'Reinhardt, Dirk']","['Doz F', 'Locatelli F', 'Baruchel A', 'Blin N', 'De Moerloose B', 'Frappaz D', 'Dworzak M', 'Fischer M', 'Stary J', 'Fuertig R', 'Riemann K', 'Taube T', 'Reinhardt D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3684-9909', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6300-3434']","['Oncology Center SIREDO (Care Innovation and Research for Children, Adolescents and Young Adults with Cancer), Institute Curie and University Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', ""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, IRCCS (Istituto di Recovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico), Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Paediatric Haemato-immunology, Hopital Robert Debre (APHP), University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Hopital Mere-Enfant, CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Paediatric Oncology Department, Leon Berard Centre, Lyon, France.', ""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", ""Department of Experimental Paediatric Oncology, University Children's Hospital Cologne, Centre of Molecular Medicine, Medical Faculty, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."", 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Translational Medicine and Clinical Pharmacology, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.

During ""window of implantation"", uterine endometrium transforms into a receptive status to accept the embryo, thereby establishing successful embryo implantation. In this article, we aimed at investigating the role of N-glycosylation, a major modification type of glycoproteins, in the process of endometrial receptivity establishment. Results found that human uterine endometrial tissues at mid-secretory phase exhibited Lectin PHA-E+L (recognizes the branched N-glycans) positive N-glycans as measured by the Lectin fluorescent staining analysis. By utilizing in vitro implantation model, we found that de-N-glycosylation of human endometrial Ishikawa and RL95-2 cells by tunicamycin (inhibitor of N-glycosylation) and peptide-N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) impaired their receptive ability to human trophoblastic JAR cells. Meanwhile, N-glycosylation of integrin alphavbeta3 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) are found to play key roles in regulating the ECM-dependent FAK/Paxillin and LIF-induced STAT3 signaling pathways, respectively, thus affecting the receptive potentials of endometrial cells. Furthermore, in vivo experiments and primary mouse endometrial cells-embryos coculture model further verified that N-glycosylation of mouse endometrial cells contributed to the successful implantation. Our results provide new evidence to show that N-glycosylation of uterine endometrium is essential for maintaining the receptive functions, which gives a better understanding of the glycobiology of implantation.","['Yu, Ming', 'Qin, Huamin', 'Wang, Hao', 'Liu, Jianwei', 'Liu, Shuai', 'Yan, Qiu']","['Yu M', 'Qin H', 'Wang H', 'Liu J', 'Liu S', 'Yan Q']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3476-9187', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4253-4126']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Pathology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian, Liaoning, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalian Medical University, Liaoning Provincial Core Lab of Glycobiology and Glycoengineering, Dalian, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190705,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['0 (Polysaccharides)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Embryo Implantation/*physiology', 'Endometrium/*cytology', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Polysaccharides/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/physiology']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.29022 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Feb;235(2):1076-1089. doi: 10.1002/jcp.29022.

Limited data exist on the incidence and predictors of 30-day readmission after HCT. Objective: To measure the incidence of and risk factors associated with 30-day readmission following HCT in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study examined patient data from the US population-based Nationwide Readmissions Database. All adults (age >/=18 years) who underwent autologous (auto-) or allogenic (allo-) HCT in US hospitals between January 1, 2012, and November 30, 2014, were included. The analysis was performed from June 2018 to February 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was 30-day readmission rates for auto-HCT and allo-HCT. Factors associated with readmission, including baseline demographic characteristics and disease- and hospital-related characteristics (including annual case volume), were measured. Results: A total of 28356 index admissions for auto-HCT in 244 centers (191 low-volume, 38 medium-volume, and 15 high-volume centers) and 17217 index admissions for allo-HCT in 211 centers (161 low-volume, 37 medium-volume, and 13 high-volume centers) were identified during the study period. The overall 30-day readmission rates were 11.6% for auto-HCT and 24.4% for allo-HCT. The odds of readmission were significantly higher in low-volume hospitals compared with high-volume hospitals (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.69; 95% CI, 1.08-2.64 for auto-HCT and aOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09-1.82 for allo-HCT) but comparable to medium-volume hospitals (aOR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.62-1.83 for auto-HCT and aOR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.90-1.57 for allo-HCT). Other factors associated with readmission for auto-HCT included younger age (aOR for age >/=50 vs <49 years, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.98), female sex (aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.36), disease type (aOR for other vs myeloma, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.06-1.77), and Elixhauser comorbidity index score (aOR for >/=20 vs 0, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.17-1.93). For allo-HCT, factors associated with readmission included disease type (aOR for acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs acute myelogenous leukemia, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.04-1.62), insurance (aOR for Medicare vs private, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.36), and Elixhauser comorbidity index score (aOR for 1-9 vs 0, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.04-1.39). Infections, neutropenic fever, and gastrointestinal symptoms were the most common reasons for readmission for both types of HCT. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found substantial rates of readmission for both types of HCT and an inverse association between hospital HCT volume and 30-day readmission. These results may provide guidance when developing quality indicators and policies penalizing hospitals for HCT readmission.","['Dhakal, Binod', 'Giri, Smith', 'Levin, Adam', 'Rein, Lisa', 'Fenske, Timothy S', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Shah, Nirav N', 'Szabo, Aniko', ""D'Souza, Anita"", 'Pasquini, Marcelo', 'Hari, Parameswaran', 'Hamadani, Mehdi']","['Dhakal B', 'Giri S', 'Levin A', 'Rein L', 'Fenske TS', 'Chhabra S', 'Shah NN', 'Szabo A', ""D'Souza A"", 'Pasquini M', 'Hari P', 'Hamadani M']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190703,United States,JAMA Netw Open,JAMA network open,101729235,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', '*Febrile Neutropenia/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', '*Gastrointestinal Diseases/epidemiology/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', '*Hospitals/standards/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', '*Infections/epidemiology/etiology', 'Insurance, Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Patient Readmission/*statistics & numerical data', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['2737307 [pii]', '10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.6476 [doi]']",epublish,JAMA Netw Open. 2019 Jul 3;2(7):e196476. doi: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.6476.,7,,,,,,,,['JAMA Netw Open. 2019 Jul 3;2(7):e196463.

The aim of this study was to determine whether polymorphism in the analysed loci of the bovine TNF-RII gene is linked with the size of cell subpopulations naturally infected with bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) which serve important immune functions in the host. Material and Methods: Samples originated from 78 cows. Polymorphisms in the studied gene were determined by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing by capillary electrophoresis. BLV infection was diagnosed by the immunofluorescence (IMF) technique and nested PCR. Cell subpopulations were immunophenotyped with IMF. Results: Similar and non-significant differences in the average percentages of TNFalpha+/-, IgM+TNFalpha+/-, and CD11b+TNFalpha+/-cells infected with BLV were noted in individuals with various genotypes in the polymorphic sites g.-1646T > G and g. 16534T > C of the TNF-RII gene, and significant differences in the percentages of these subpopulations were observed between selected microsatellite genotypes (g.16512CA(n)). Conclusion: STR polymorphism and the number of CA dinucleotide repeats in intron 1 of the TNF-RII gene influence the frequency of TNF+, CD11b+TNF+, and IgM+TNF+ subpopulations naturally infected with BLV. Polymorphism in the gene's other two sites do not affect the size of these cell subpopulations.","['Stachura, Alicja', 'Bojarojc-Nosowicz, Barbara', 'Kaczmarczyk, Dariusz', 'Kaczmarczyk, Ewa']","['Stachura A', 'Bojarojc-Nosowicz B', 'Kaczmarczyk D', 'Kaczmarczyk E']",,"['Department of Animal Genetics, Faculty of Animal Bioengineering University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Faculty of Animal Bioengineering University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Environmental Biotechnology, Faculty of Environmental Sciences University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, 10-709 Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Animal Genetics, Faculty of Animal Bioengineering University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, 10-719 Olsztyn, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190612,Poland,J Vet Res,Journal of veterinary research,101696630,,,,PMC6598189,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2478/jvetres-2019-0032 [doi]', 'jvetres-2019-0032 [pii]']",epublish,J Vet Res. 2019 Jun 12;63(2):175-182. doi: 10.2478/jvetres-2019-0032. eCollection 2019 Jun.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BLV', 'CD11b+TNFalpha+p24+ cells', 'IgM+ TNFalpha+p24+ cells', 'cattle', 'microsatellite DNA']","['Conflict of Interest Conflict of Interests Statement: The authors declare that', 'there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,

Thus, MDR is often results in treatment failure in the clinic. In this study, we found midostaurin, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anti-leukemia drug, can antagonize ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1)-mediated MDR. Our results indicated that midostaurin has the capacity to antagonize ABCB1-mediated MDR, while no significant reversal effect was found on ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2)-mediated MDR. Our subsequent resistance mechanism studies showed that midostaurin directly inhibited the efflux function of the ABCB1 transporter without alteration of the expression level or the subcellular localization of ABCB1 transporter. In addition, midostaurin inhibited the ATPase activity of ABCB1 transporter in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, our in silico docking study predicted that midostaurin could interact with the substrate-binding sites of ABCB1 transporter. This novel finding could provide a promising treatment strategy that co-administrating midostaurin with anticancer drugs in the clinic could overcome MDR and improve the efficiency of cancer treatment.","['Ji, Ning', 'Yang, Yuqi', 'Cai, Chao-Yun', 'Wang, Jing-Quan', 'Lei, Zi-Ning', 'Wu, Zhuo-Xun', 'Cui, Qingbin', 'Yang, Dong-Hua', 'Chen, Zhe-Sheng', 'Kong, Dexin']","['Ji N', 'Yang Y', 'Cai CY', 'Wang JQ', 'Lei ZN', 'Wu ZX', 'Cui Q', 'Yang DH', 'Chen ZS', 'Kong D']",,"['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, St. John's University, Queens, NY, United States."", 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Research Center, School of Medicine, Tianjin Tianshi College, Tianyuan University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190618,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6591272,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00514 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jun 18;9:514. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00514. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ABC', 'ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter', 'chemotherapy', 'midostaurin', 'multidrug resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although chemotherapeutic approaches have been achieving successful remission for the majority of cases of childhood ALL, development of resistance to chemotherapy has been observed. Thus, new therapeutic approaches are required to improve patient's prognosis. Therefore, we investigated the anticancer potential of curcumin in ALL. We tested a panel of B-precursor ALL (B-Pre-ALL) cell lines with various translocations after treatment with different doses of curcumin. Curcumin suppresses the viability in a concentration-dependent manner in 697, REH, SupB15, and RS4;11 cells (doses from 0 to 80 muM). Curcumin induces apoptosis in B-Pre-ALL cell lines via activation of caspase-8 and truncation of BID. Curcumin treatment increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and resulted in a leaky mitochondrial membrane that led to the discharge of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, the activation of caspase 3 and the cleavage of PARP. Curcumin treatment of B-Pre-ALL cell lines induced a dephosphorylation of the constitutive phosphorylated AKT/PKB and a down-regulation of the expression of cIAP1, and XIAP. Moreover, curcumin mediates its anticancer activity by the generation of reactive oxygen species. Finally, the suboptimal doses of curcumin potentiated the anticancer activity of cisplatin. Altogether, these results suggest an important therapeutic role of curcumin, acting as a growth suppressor of B-Pre-ALL by apoptosis via inactivation of AKT/PKB and down-regulation of IAPs and activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway via generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Our interesting findings raise the possibility of considering curcumin as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of B-Pre-ALL.","['Kuttikrishnan, Shilpa', 'Siveen, Kodappully S', 'Prabhu, Kirti S', 'Khan, Abdul Quaiyoom', 'Ahmed, Eiman I', 'Akhtar, Sabah', 'Ali, Tayyiba A', 'Merhi, Maysaloun', 'Dermime, Said', 'Steinhoff, Martin', 'Uddin, Shahab']","['Kuttikrishnan S', 'Siveen KS', 'Prabhu KS', 'Khan AQ', 'Ahmed EI', 'Akhtar S', 'Ali TA', 'Merhi M', 'Dermime S', 'Steinhoff M', 'Uddin S']",,"['Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Centre for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Centre for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Dermatology Venereology, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Weill Cornell-Medicine, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Dermatology, Weill Cornell University, New York, NY, United States.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190619,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6593070,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00484 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jun 19;9:484. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00484. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['B-Pre-ALL cells', 'ROS', 'apoptosis', 'curcumin', 'signaling']",,,,,,,,,,,

Stem cells for different lineages/tissues reside in distinct niches, and are exposed to diverse oxygen concentrations. Recent studies have revealed the importance of the hypoxia signaling pathway for stem cell functions. Recent Findings: Hypoxia and HIFs contribute to maintenance of embryonic stem cells, generation of induced pluripotent stem cells, functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, and survival of leukemia stem cells. Harvest and collection of mouse bone marrow and human cord blood cells in ambient air results in fewer hematopoietic stem cells recovered due to the phenomenon of Extra PHysiologic Oxygen Shock/Stress (EPHOSS). Summary: Oxygen is an important factor in the stem cell microenvironment. Hypoxia signaling and HIFs play important roles in modeling cellular metabolism in both stem cells and niches to regulate stem cell biology, and represent an additional dimension that allows stem cells to maintain an undifferentiated status and multilineage differentiation potential.","['Huang, Xinxin', 'Trinh, Thao', 'Aljoufi, Arafat', 'Broxmeyer, Hal E']","['Huang X', 'Trinh T', 'Aljoufi A', 'Broxmeyer HE']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180430,Switzerland,Curr Stem Cell Rep,Current stem cell reports,101650643,,,,PMC6605067,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40778-018-0127-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Rep. 2018 Jun;4(2):149-157. doi: 10.1007/s40778-018-0127-7.

Currently, treatment options for patients with relapsed and refractory ALL mostly rely on immunotherapies. However, hematological cancers are commonly associated with a low immunogenicity and immune tolerance, which may contribute to leukemia relapse and the difficulties associated with the development of effective immunotherapies against this disease. We recently demonstrated that PKHB1, a TSP1-derived CD47 agonist peptide, induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) in T cell ALL (T-ALL). Cell death induced by PKHB1 on T-ALL cell lines and their homologous murine, L5178Y-R (T-murine tumor lymphoblast cell line), induced damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) exposure and release. Additionally, a prophylactic vaccination with PKHB1-treated L5178Y-R cells prevented tumor establishment in vivo in all the cases. Due to the immunogenic potential of PKHB1-treated cells, in this study we assessed their ability to induce antitumor immune responses ex vivo and in vivo in an established tumor. We first confirmed the selectivity of cell death induced by PKBH1 in tumor L5178Y-R cells and observed that calreticulin exposure increased when cell death increased. Then, we found that the tumor cell lysate (TCL) obtained from PKHB1-treated L5178YR tumor cells (PKHB1-TCL) was able to induce, ex vivo, dendritic cells maturation, cytokine production, and T cell antitumor responses. Finally, our results show that in vivo, PKHB1-TCL treatment induces tumor regression in syngeneic mice transplanted with L5178Y-R cells, increasing their overall survival and protecting them from further tumor establishment after tumor rechallenge. Altogether our results highlight the immunogenicity of the cell death induced by PKHB1 activation of CD47 as a potential therapeutic tool to overcome the low immunogenicity and immune tolerance in T-ALL.","['Martinez-Torres, Ana Carolina', 'Calvillo-Rodriguez, Kenny Misael', 'Uscanga-Palomeque, Ashanti Concepcion', 'Gomez-Morales, Luis', 'Mendoza-Reveles, Rodolfo', 'Caballero-Hernandez, Diana', 'Karoyan, Philippe', 'Rodriguez-Padilla, Cristina']","['Martinez-Torres AC', 'Calvillo-Rodriguez KM', 'Uscanga-Palomeque AC', 'Gomez-Morales L', 'Mendoza-Reveles R', 'Caballero-Hernandez D', 'Karoyan P', 'Rodriguez-Padilla C']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6183-0089', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7289-6166', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3258-5157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2014-9617', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1525-6474']","['Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL University, CNRS, Laboratoire des Biomolecules, 75005 Paris, France.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.', 'Sorbonne Universite, Ecole Normale Superieure, PSL University, CNRS, Laboratoire des Biomolecules, 75005 Paris, France.', 'Kayvisa, AG, Industriestrasse 44, 6300 Zug, Switzerland.', 'Kaybiotix, GmbH, Zugerstrasse 32, 6340 Baar, Switzerland.', 'Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Laboratorio de Inmunologia y Virologia, Mexico.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190604,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,PMC6582786,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/9852361 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 Jun 4;2019:9852361. doi: 10.1155/2019/9852361. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These immunogenic peptides originate from the genomic polymorphisms and are known as minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA). MiHA mismatches trigger the post-transplant immune response, which could manifest in both the deleterious ""graft-vs.-host"" disease and the beneficial ""graft-vs.-leukemia"" effect. Importantly, some MiHAs are considered to be promising targets for posttransplant T-cell immunotherapy of hematopoietic malignancies. This creates a demand for a robust and fast approach to genotyping MiHA-encoding polymorphisms. We report a multiplex real-time PCR method for the genotyping of 20 polymorphisms that are encoding HLA-A(*)02:01-restricted MiHAs. This method uses allele-specific primers and gene-specific hydrolysis probes. In 1 h it allows for the detection of MiHA mismatches in a donor-recipient pair without the need for electrophoresis, sequencing, or other time-consuming techniques. We validated the method with Sanger and NGS sequencing and demonstrated good performance over a wide range of DNA concentrations. We propose our protocol as a fast and accurate method of identifying mismatched MiHAs. The information on the MiHA mismatches is useful for studying the allogeneic immune response following HSCT and for selecting the targets for post-transplant T-cell therapy.","['Romaniuk, Dmitrii S', 'Postovskaya, Anna M', 'Khmelevskaya, Alexandra A', 'Malko, Dmitry B', 'Efimov, Grigory A']","['Romaniuk DS', 'Postovskaya AM', 'Khmelevskaya AA', 'Malko DB', 'Efimov GA']",,"['Laboratory for Transplantation Immunology, National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation Immunology, National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation Immunology, National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation Immunology, National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation Immunology, National Research Center for Hematology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190604,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Genomics/methods', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics', 'HLA-A Antigens/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",PMC6593292,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/10/23 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01226 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jun 4;10:1226. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01226. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AS-PCR', '*AS-qPCR', '*HSCT', '*MiHA', '*SNP genotyping', '*allele-specific primer', '*minor histocompatibility antigens', '*multiplex qPCR']",,,,,,,,,,,

Though great progresses have been made in the survival rates of childhood leukemia, the long-term health problems of long-term childhood leukemia survivors remain remarkable. In addition, the deep links between risk factors and childhood leukemia need to be elucidated. What can be done to improve the prevention and the prognosis of childhood leukemia is an essential issue. Gut microbiota, referred to as one of the largest symbiotic microorganisms that is accommodated in the gastrointestinal tract of human or animals, is found to be involved in the progression of various diseases. It is reported that microbiota may keep people in good health by participating in metabolism processes and regulating the immune system.

Based on the ABCX-model, the aim of the current study was to explore the association between family functioning, cancer appraisal and the individual adjustment of patients, parents and siblings. Methods: Participants were 60 children with leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 172 parents and 78 siblings (115 families). Time since diagnosis varied from zero to 33 months. Patients, parents and siblings completed the Family Environment Scale (FES), Perceived Stress Scale, Situation-Specific Emotional Reactions Questionnaire and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory/Maudsley Marital Questionnaire. Results: Family functioning and the appraisal of the cancer diagnosis proved to be related to patients', parents' and siblings' cancer-related emotions and quality of life post-diagnosis. In addition, family members differed in their perception of some family functioning domains, the appraisal of the cancer diagnosis, positive feelings and quality of life. Discussion: Our findings led to the conclusion that family functioning and the appraisal of the cancer diagnosis are important for the individual adjustment of patients, parents and siblings when facing a diagnosis of cancer in the child. Differences across members within one family and differences between families speak to the need of screening all family members and intervening at the level of individual as well as the family unit.","['Van Schoors, Marieke', 'De Paepe, Annick Lena', 'Norga, Koenraad', 'Cosyns, Veerle', 'Morren, Hanne', 'Vercruysse, Trui', 'Goubert, Liesbet', 'Verhofstadt, Lesley Liliane']","['Van Schoors M', 'De Paepe AL', 'Norga K', 'Cosyns V', 'Morren H', 'Vercruysse T', 'Goubert L', 'Verhofstadt LL']",,"['Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190619,Switzerland,Front Psychol,Frontiers in psychology,101550902,,,,PMC6594216,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01405 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychol. 2019 Jun 19;10:1405. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01405. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer appraisal', 'families', 'family functioning', 'individual adjustment', 'pediatric cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,

Hematological immune-mediated adverse effects from immunotherapy are rarely reported but they can cause serious harm to patients. Antibodies such as ipilimumab, nivolumab and pembrolizumab target different immune checkpoints to promote T cell anti-tumour response. In particular, pembrolizumab is an antibody that inhibits programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) to upregulate tumour suppression. In this report, we present a case of pembrolizumab-induced autoimmune hemolytic anemia and pancytopenia in a patient who was receiving pembrolizumab treatment for metastatic melanoma. This patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma in 2017. He developed symptomatic AIHA and pancytopenia after receiving 8 cycles of pembrolizumab in 2018. Pembrolizumab treatment was discontinued and he was treated with blood transfusion and prednisone. After 5 months of tapering prednisone treatment, his anemia and pancytopenia have improved toward successful recovery. Cancer patients already face an increased risk of immunosuppression with conventional chemotherapy. This case report also summarized all reported cases of PD-1 inhibitor hematological adverse effects in the treatment of oncological diseases. These incidents reflect the risk of immune-mediated hematologic adverse effects, which should be considered in all patients using immunotherapy.","['Ni, Dan', 'AlZahrani, Fatmah', 'Smylie, Michael']","['Ni D', 'AlZahrani F', 'Smylie M']",,"['Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Division of Dermatology, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Oncology Department, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190619,Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,PMC6600028,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/07/06 06:01,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000500856 [doi]', 'cro-0012-0456 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2019 Jun 19;12(2):456-465. doi: 10.1159/000500856. eCollection 2019 May-Aug.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AIHA', 'Immunotherapy', 'Metastatic melanoma', 'Pancytopenia', 'Pembrolizumab']",,,,,,,,,,,

Similar investigations in Asian populations were less. The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between ARID5B SNPs rs7089424, rs10994982, and the risk of ALL in Chinese pediatric population. METHODS: A total of 190 pediatric ALL patients and 270 controls were enrolled in this study. PCR amplification combined with mass spectrometry were used to evaluate the genotypes of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982. chi test was used in allele frequencies and genotype distributions of the SNPs for analyzing statistical differences between patients and controls. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the risk allele frequencies of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 between B-lineage ALL (B-ALL) patients and controls (rs7089424, G allele: p = 0.001; rs10994982, A allele: p = 0.000). The genotype distributions of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 were also statistically different in B-ALL patients compared with controls (rs7089424, p = 0.004; rs10994982, p = 0.001). Further analyzing the relevance of ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 genotypes to clinical risk classification of ALL showed GG genotype of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 were strikingly correlated with the medium-risk and low-risk groups of B-ALL. Finally, GG and GT genotypes of rs7089424 and AA genotype of rs10994982 seemed to be responsible for the hyperdiploid subtype susceptibility of childhood B-ALL. CONCLUSION: ARID5B rs7089424 and rs10994982 might serve as genetic susceptibility markers for B-ALL in Chinese pediatric population. Moreover, the two ARID5B SNPs are associated with the risk of B-hyperdiploid ALL, which had a better therapeutic response than other ALL subtypes.","['Tao, Ran', 'Liu, Yu-Jie', 'Liu, Li-Fang', 'Li, Wei', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Li, Hua-Mei', 'Yi, Xiao-Lian', 'Zhao, Zheng-Yan']","['Tao R', 'Liu YJ', 'Liu LF', 'Li W', 'Zhao Y', 'Li HM', 'Yi XL', 'Zhao ZY']",,"[""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", ""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Chin Med Assoc,Journal of the Chinese Medical Association : JCMA,101174817,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000038 [doi]', '02118582-201907000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Chin Med Assoc. 2019 Jul;82(7):562-567. doi: 10.1097/JCMA.0000000000000038.,7,,,,,,,,"['J Chin Med Assoc. 2019 Dec;82(12):966.

To identify drugs that target specifically BRCA2-deficient cells, we screened a chemical library containing compounds in clinical use. The top hit was chlorambucil, a bifunctional alkylating agent used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We establish that chlorambucil is specifically toxic to BRCA1/2-deficient cells, including olaparib-resistant and cisplatin-resistant ones, suggesting the potential clinical use of chlorambucil against disease which has become resistant to these drugs. Additionally, chlorambucil eradicates BRCA2-deficient xenografts and inhibits growth of olaparib-resistant patient-derived tumour xenografts (PDTXs). We demonstrate that chlorambucil inflicts replication-associated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), similarly to cisplatin, and we identify ATR, FANCD2 and the SNM1A nuclease as determinants of sensitivity to both drugs. Importantly, chlorambucil is substantially less toxic to normal cells and tissues in vitro and in vivo relative to cisplatin. Because chlorambucil and cisplatin are equally effective inhibitors of BRCA2-compromised tumours, our results indicate that chlorambucil has a higher therapeutic index than cisplatin in targeting

METHODS: A total of 213 Portuguese patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma participated in this study and were assessed with the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer's (EORTC) Questionnaire C30 (QLQ-C30), the EORTC Multiple Myeloma Module (QLQ-MY20), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Satisfaction with Social Support Scale (SSSS). RESULTS: The validated version includes 17 items presenting good global adjustment and good internal consistency. Overall, the Portuguese validation maintains the original model with the exception of three items that were excluded. The instrument also showed good reliability and good convergent and divergent validity. CONCLUSION: The Portuguese version of the EORTC Multiple Myeloma Module questionnaire seems to be a valid instrument for myeloma patients to help monitor interventions in this population focused on the promotion of quality of life.","['Graca Pereira, M', 'Ferreira, Gabriela', 'Pereira, Marta', 'Faria, Sara', 'Bacalhau, Rosario', 'Monteiro, Sara', 'Fernandes, Bruna', 'Vilaca, Margarida']","['Graca Pereira M', 'Ferreira G', 'Pereira M', 'Faria S', 'Bacalhau R', 'Monteiro S', 'Fernandes B', 'Vilaca M']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7987-2562', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0993-5614', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7176-3775', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9792-5816', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5030-5425', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1389-3851', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4349-8633']","['School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'Psychology Research Center (CIPsi), University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'Psychology Research Center (CIPsi), University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'Psychology Research Center (CIPsi), University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'School of Psychology, University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.', 'Portuguese Institute of Oncology Francisco Gentil, Lisboa, Portugal.', 'Department of Education and Psychology, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Center for Health Technology and Services Research (CINTESIS), University of Porto, Porto, Portugal.', 'Department of Education and Psychology, University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal.', 'Psychology Research Center (CIPsi), University of Minho, Braga, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20190704,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Aged', 'Anxiety/psychology', 'Depression/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*physiopathology/*psychology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Portugal', '*Quality of Life', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.13128 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2019 Sep;28(5):e13128. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13128.

Several case reports and smaller case series have been published in the medical literature, but studies on larger cohorts of children with LC are lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to better characterize the clinical features, course, and prognosis of LC in the pediatric population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of 31 patients diagnosed with LC at Boston Children's Hospital and the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. RESULTS: The number and morphology of LC lesions varied among patients, with the head and lower extremities being the most common sites of involvement. Leukemia cutis presented concomitantly with systemic leukemia in the majority of cases. Most cases of LC arose during initial leukemia episodes, rather than with relapsed leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia was the subtype most frequently associated with LC, followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Diagnosis altered treatment timing and therapeutic decisions. CONCLUSION: Children most often present concomitantly with LC and systemic leukemia. Since the morphology and distribution of LC varies, physicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for this diagnosis, as the presence of LC may change the management of systemic leukemia.","['Andriescu, Elena Corina', 'Coughlin, Carrie C', 'Cheng, Carol E', 'Prajapati, Vimal H', 'Huang, Jennifer T', 'Schmidt, Birgitta A', 'Degar, Barbara A', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Pillai, Vinodh', 'Yan, Albert C', 'Liang, Marilyn G']","['Andriescu EC', 'Coughlin CC', 'Cheng CE', 'Prajapati VH', 'Huang JT', 'Schmidt BA', 'Degar BA', 'Aplenc R', 'Pillai V', 'Yan AC', 'Liang MG']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1720-1952', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2760-1725']","['McGovern Medical School, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Dermatology, Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California.', 'Division of Dermatology, Department of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Division of Community Pediatrics, Department of Pediatrics, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Dermatology Research Institute, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', ""Department of Dermatology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Oncology, Center for Pediatric Clinical Effectiveness, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Section of Pediatric Dermatology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Departments of Pediatrics and Dermatology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Dermatology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190705,United States,Pediatr Dermatol,Pediatric dermatology,8406799,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Neoplasms/*pathology/therapy', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/02/29 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pde.13864 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dermatol. 2019 Sep;36(5):658-663. doi: 10.1111/pde.13864.

METHODS: This study included 120 hospitalized patients with hematologic malignancy. Patients who were at risk of malnutrition with NRS2002 were reevaluated with the GLIM criteria for defined malnutrition. Also, the mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), calf circumference (CC), and handgrip (HG) were measured, and albumin, C reactive protein (CRP), and total protein were recorded to assess malnutrition-related factors. RESULTS: A total of 120 patients are with lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma having a rate of 34.2%, 34.2%, and 31.6%, respectively, and risk of malnutrition with NRS2002 was established in 82% of patients. Malnutrition with GLIM criteria was seen in 25.8% of patients. The 1-year mortality rate was 41.7% (n = 50). Malnutrition was associated with higher mortality risk independently with age and duration of diagnosis (HR 3.55 (1.99-6.34), p = 0.001). Low HG (HR 0.51 (0.26-0.99), p = 0.03), low albumin (HR 0.39 (0.2-0.6), p = 0.001), and high CRP (HR 2.39 (1.36-4.20), p = 0.002) were significantly associated with increased mortality risk. In contrast, BMI, MUAC, FFMI, and CC were not associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is high with the GLIM criteria.

Being located immediately upstream of the MSH2 gene, EPCAM abnormalities can affect MSH2 and cause Lynch syndrome. Mismatch repair proteins are involved in repairing of incorrect pairing (point mutations and deletion/insertion of simple repetitive sequences, so-called microsatellites) that can arise during DNA replication. MSH2 forms heterodimers with MSH6 or MSH3 (MutSalpha, MutSbeta, respectively) and is involved in mismatch-pair recognition and initiation of repair. MLH1 forms a complex with PMS2, and functions as an endonuclease. If the mismatch repair system is thoroughly working, genome integrity is maintained completely. Lynch syndrome is a state of mismatch repair deficiency due to a monoallelic abnormality of any mismatch repair genes. The phenotype indicating the mismatch repair deficiency can be frequently shown as a microsatellite instability in tumors. Children with germline biallelic mismatch repair gene abnormalities were reported to develop conditions such as gastrointestinal polyposis, colorectal cancer, brain cancer, leukemia, etc., and so on, demonstrating the need to respond with new concepts in genetic counseling. In promoting cancer genome medicine in a new era, such as by utilizing immune checkpoints, it is important to understand the genetic and genomic molecular background, including the status of mismatch repair deficiency.","['Tamura, Kazuo', 'Kaneda, Motohide', 'Futagawa, Mashu', 'Takeshita, Miho', 'Kim, Sanghyuk', 'Nakama, Mina', 'Kawashita, Norihito', 'Tatsumi-Miyajima, Junko']","['Tamura K', 'Kaneda M', 'Futagawa M', 'Takeshita M', 'Kim S', 'Nakama M', 'Kawashita N', 'Tatsumi-Miyajima J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1087-9851'],"['Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan. tamura@life.kindai.ac.jp.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics, Gifu University Hospital, Gifu, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Genetics, Master of Science, Graduate School of Science and Engineering Research, Kindai University, Higashiosaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190704,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EPCAM protein, human)', '0 (Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule)', '0 (G-T mismatch-binding protein)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (PMS2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (Mismatch Repair Endonuclease PMS2)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/genetics', 'Child', 'Colorectal Neoplasms, Hereditary Nonpolyposis/*genetics', 'DNA Mismatch Repair/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/genetics', 'Epithelial Cell Adhesion Molecule/genetics', 'Female', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Mismatch Repair Endonuclease PMS2/genetics/metabolism', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1/genetics/metabolism', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/11/27 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-019-01494-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-019-01494-y [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2019 Sep;24(9):999-1011. doi: 10.1007/s10147-019-01494-y.

This enzyme may synthesize Forssman antigen (FORS1) of the FORS blood group system when exon 3 or 4 of the AT mRNA is deleted and/or the LeuGlyGly tripeptide at codons 266-268 of AT is replaced by GlyGlyAla. The Met69Ser/Thr substitutions also confer weak Forssman glycolipid synthase (FS) activity. In this study, we prepared the human AT derivative constructs containing any of the 20 amino acids at codon 69 with and without the GlyGlyAla substitution, transfected DNA to newly generated COS1(B3GALNT1 + A4GALT) cells expressing an enhanced level of globoside (Gb4), the FS acceptor substrate, and immunologically examined the FORS1 expression. Our results showed that all those substitution constructs at codon 69 exhibited FS activity. The combination with GlyGlyAla significantly increased the activity. The conserved methionine residue in the ABO, but not GBGT1, gene-encoded proteins may implicate its contribution to the separation of these genes in genetic evolution. Surprisingly, with increased Gb4 availability, the original human AT with the methionine residue at codon 69 was also demonstrated to synthesize FORS1, providing another molecular mechanism of FORS1 appearance in cancer of ordinary FORS1-negative individuals.","['Yamamoto, Miyako', 'Tarasco, Maria Cristina', 'Cid, Emili', 'Kobayashi, Hidetomo', 'Yamamoto, Fumiichiro']","['Yamamoto M', 'Tarasco MC', 'Cid E', 'Kobayashi H', 'Yamamoto F']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9516-1402', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5025-352X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9690-7034']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain.', 'Biologia Molecolare, Universita degli Studi di Parma, Parma, 43121, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain.', ""Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain."", 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiological Science, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hiroshima International University, Kure, Hiroshima, 737-0112, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Immunohematology and Glycobiology, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain. fyamamoto@carrerasresearch.org.', ""Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer (PMPPC), Institut d'Investigacio Germans Trias i Pujol (IGTP), Campus Can Ruti, Cami de les Escoles, Badalona, Barcelona, 08916, Spain. fyamamoto@carrerasresearch.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190704,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (antigen FORSE-1)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (GBGT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blood Group Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', '*Codon', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'N-Acetylgalactosaminyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transferases/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6609624,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-46029-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-46029-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jul 4;9(1):9717. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-46029-7.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is responsible for treatment failure and could be linked to changes in miRs expression. This work aimed to correlate the expression levels of 3 miRs, miR-21, miR-26b and miR-451, with response to TKI treatment in CML patients. miR-451 levels at diagnosis were significantly higher in patients with optimal response after 6 and 12 months of therapy. Conversely, patients without optimal response had highest levels of miR-21. miR-21 and miR-451 appear to be good biomarkers of response, able to predict optimal TKI responders (p < 0.05). Using the combined profile of both miRs, we create a predictive model of optimal response after one year of treatment.

Based on data that low levels of persistent or recurrent residual leukemia are consistently associated with an increased risk of relapse and worse long-term outcomes, its routine assessment has been recommended by some experts and consensus guidelines. In addition to providing important prognostic information, the detection of measurable residual disease may also theoretically help to determine the optimal post-remission strategy for an individual patient. However, the full therapeutic implications of measurable residual disease are uncertain and thus controversy exists as to whether it should be routinely incorporated into clinical practice. While some evidence supports the use of allogeneic stem cell transplantation or hypomethylating agents for some subgroups of patients in morphological remission but with detectable residual leukemia, the appropriate use of this information in making clinical decisions remains largely speculative at present. To resolve this pressing clinical issue, several ongoing studies are evaluating measurable residual disease-directed treatments in acute myeloid leukemia and may lead to new, effective strategies for patients in these circumstances. This review examines the common technologies used in clinical practice and in the research setting to detect residual leukemia, the major clinical studies establishing the prognostic impact of measurable residual disease in acute myeloid leukemia, and the potential ways, both now and in the future, that such testing may rationally guide therapeutic decision-making.","['Short, Nicholas J', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Short NJ', 'Ravandi F']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA fravandi@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190704,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis']",PMC6669140,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.208454 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.208454 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Aug;104(8):1532-1541. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.208454.

An active immune response generally contributes to antitumor responses and may prevent disease progression. However, chronic immune stimulation can also induce cell stress, DNA damage and contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS. The protective mechanisms against excessive immune activation are therefore an important aspect of the pathophysiology of MDS and characterizing them may help us to better understand the fine balance between protective and destabilizing inflammation in lower-risk disease. In this study we investigated the role of thrombomodulin (CD141/BDCA-3) expression, a molecule with anti-inflammatory properties, on monocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of MDS patients in different risk groups. Patient-derived classical monocytes showed high expression levels of thrombomodulin, whereas monocytes from healthy donors hardly expressed any thrombomodulin. The presence of thrombomodulin on monocytes from MDS patients correlated with lower-risk disease groups and better overall and leukemia-free survival. Using multidimensional mass cytometry, in an in-vitro setting, we showed that thrombomodulin-positive monocytes could polarize naive T cells toward cell clusters which are closer to T helper type 2 and T regulatory cell phenotypes and less likely to contribute to effective immune surveillance. In conclusion, the expression of thrombomodulin on classical monocytes is a favorable and early prognostic marker in patients with low-risk MDS and may represent a new mechanism in the protection against disproportionate immune activation.","['van Leeuwen-Kerkhoff, Nathalie', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Poddighe, Pino J', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Kordasti, Shahram', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['van Leeuwen-Kerkhoff N', 'Westers TM', 'Poddighe PJ', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Kordasti S', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']",,"['Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam UMC, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Amsterdam UMC, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', ""Comprehensive Cancer Center, King's College London and Guy's Hospital, London, UK."", 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Cancer Center Amsterdam, the Netherlands a.vandeloosdrecht@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190704,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Thrombomodulin)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Monocytes', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes', 'Thrombomodulin/genetics']",PMC7109736,2019/07/06 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.219303 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.219303 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Apr;105(4):961-971. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.219303.

The hypothesis that thrombopoietin-mimetics can increase platelet count in inherited thrombocytopenias is appealing, but evidence is scarce. We conducted a prospective, phase II clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of the oral thrombopoietin-mimetic eltrombopag in different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. We enrolled 24 patients affected by MYH9-related disease, ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia, X-linked thrombocytopenia/ Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, monoallelic Bernard-Soulier syndrome, or ITGB3-related thrombocytopenia. The average pre-treatment platelet count was 40.4 x10(9)/L. Patients received a 3- to 6-week course of eltrombopag in a dose-escalated manner. Of 23 patients evaluable for response, 11 (47.8%) achieved a major response (platelet count >100 x10(9)/L), ten (43.5%) had a minor response (platelet count at least twice the baseline value), and two patients (8.7%) did not respond. The average increase of platelet count compared to baseline was 64.5 x10(9)/L (P<0.001). Four patients with clinically significant spontaneous bleeding entered a program of long-term eltrombopag administration (16 additional weeks): all of them obtained remission of mucosal hemorrhages, with the remission persisting throughout the treatment period. Treatment was globally well tolerated: five patients reported mild adverse events and one patient a moderate adverse event. In conclusion, eltrombopag was safe and effective in increasing platelet count and reducing bleeding symptoms in different forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. Despite these encouraging results, caution is recommended when using thrombopoietinmimetics in inherited thrombocytopenias predisposing to leukemia.

HCMV reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) is triggered by IL-6 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. However, activation of the same pathway fails to reactivate HCMV in other myeloid cell types, despite this signaling axis being active in those cells. We hypothesized that IL-6-induced ERK activation initiates the changes in chromatin structure required for viral reactivation but that a concomitant signal is necessary to complete the changes in chromatin structure required for gene expression to occur. Using a differential phosphoproteomics approach in cells that do or do not support IL-6-induced viral reactivation, we identified the concomitant activation of an Src family kinase (SFK), hematopoietic cell kinase (HCK), specifically in DCs in response to IL-6. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of HCK activity indicated that HCK is required for HCMV reactivation. Furthermore, the HCK/SFK activity was linked to recruitment of the monocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (MOZ) histone acetyltransferase to the viral promoter, which promoted histone acetylation after ERK-mediated histone phosphorylation. Importantly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of MOZ activity prevented reactivation. These results provide an explanation for the selective activation of viral gene expression in DCs by IL-6, dependent on concomitant SFK and ERK signaling. They also reveal a previously unreported role for SFK activity in the regulation of chromatin structure at promoters in eukaryotic cells via MOZ histone acetyltransferase activity.","['Dupont, Liane', 'Du, Lily', 'Poulter, Madeleine', 'Choi, Stephanie', 'McIntosh, Megan', 'Reeves, Matthew B']","['Dupont L', 'Du L', 'Poulter M', 'Choi S', 'McIntosh M', 'Reeves MB']",,"['Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.', 'Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, Division of Infection and Immunity, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, Hampstead, London NW3 2PF, United Kingdom.

Relapse rates are high and toxic chemotherapies that block DNA replication and induce DNA damage lead to health problems later in life, underlining the need for improved therapies. MYC is a transcription factor that is hyperactive in a large proportion of cancers including leukemia but is difficult to target in therapy. We show that ablation of the function of the BTB/POZ domain factor Zbtb17 (Miz-1), an important cofactor of c-Myc, significantly delayed T- and B-ALL/lymphoma in mice and interfered with the oncogenic transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Leukemic cells that still emerged in this system activated DNA replication pathways that could be targeted by current chemotherapeutic drugs such as cytarabine. Acute ablation of the Miz-1 POZ domain enhanced the effect of cytarabine treatment. The combined treatment was effective in both Emu-Myc and Notch ICN-driven leukemia models and prolonged survival of tumor-bearing animals by accelerating apoptosis of leukemic cells. These observations suggest that targeting MIZ-1 could render current ALL chemotherapies more effective, with a better outcome for patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Ablation of the POZ domain of Miz-1 perturbs its interaction with c-MYC and delays the generation of T- and B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.","['Ross, Julie', 'Rashkovan, Marissa', 'Fraszczak, Jennifer', 'Joly-Beauparlant, Charles', 'Vadnais, Charles', 'Winkler, Rene', 'Droit, Arnaud', 'Kosan, Christian', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Ross J', 'Rashkovan M', 'Fraszczak J', 'Joly-Beauparlant C', 'Vadnais C', 'Winkler R', 'Droit A', 'Kosan C', 'Moroy T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8387-3653', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4284-9849']","['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Hematopoiesis and Cancer Unit, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Hematopoiesis and Cancer Unit, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Hematopoiesis and Cancer Unit, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Bioinformatic Platform, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Hematopoiesis and Cancer Unit, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aging Research Center (ARC), Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Bioinformatic Platform, Faculty of Medicine, Universite Laval, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aging Research Center (ARC), Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Jena, Germany.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Hematopoiesis and Cancer Unit, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: CNVs in 37 OSCC tissue specimens were analyzed using a high-resolution microarray, the OncoScan array. Gene expression was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in 127 OSCC and normal tissue samples. Cell function assays included cell cycle, migration, invasion and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. RESULTS: We found a novel copy number amplified region, chromosome 9p, encompassing MLLT3 via the comparison of our data set with six other OSCC genome-wide CNV data sets. MLLT3 overexpression was associated with poorer overall survival in patients with OSCC (p = .048). MLLT3 knockdown reduced cell migration and invasion. The reduced invasion ability in MLLT3-knockdown cells was rescued with double knockdown of MLLT3 and CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with ED rich carboxy-terminal domain 4 (CITED4; 21.0% vs. 61.5%). Knockdown of MLLT3 impaired disruptor of telomeric silencing-1-like (Dot1L)-associated hypermethylation in the promoter of the tumor suppressor, CITED4 (p < .001), and hence dysregulated HIF-1alpha-mediated genes (TWIST, MMP1, MMP2, VIM, and CDH1) in OSCC cells. CONCLUSION: We identified unique CNVs in tumors of Taiwanese patients with OSCC. Notably, MLLT3 overexpression is related to the poorer prognosis of patients with OSCC and is required for Dot1L-mediated transcriptional repression of CITED4, leading to dysregulation of HIF-1alpha-mediated genes. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article reports unique copy number variations in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumors of Taiwanese patients. Notably, MLLT3 overexpression is related to the poorer prognosis of patients with OSCC and is required for Dot1L-mediated transcriptional repression of CITED4, leading to dysregulation of HIF-1alpha-mediated genes.","['Wang, Chun-I', 'Kao, Huang-Kai', 'Chen, Ting-Wen', 'Huang, Yenlin', 'Cheng, Hsing-Wen', 'Yi, Jui-Shan', 'Hung, Shao-Yu', 'Wu, Chi-Sheng', 'Lee, Yun-Shien', 'Chang, Kai-Ping']","['Wang CI', 'Kao HK', 'Chen TW', 'Huang Y', 'Cheng HW', 'Yi JS', 'Hung SY', 'Wu CS', 'Lee YS', 'Chang KP']",,"['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan dr.kpchang@gmail.com yeewang0330@gmail.com.', 'Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Biological Science and Technology, National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Center for Intelligent Drug Systems and Smart Bio-devices (IDSB), National Chiao Tung University, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pathology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Ming-Chuan University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan dr.kpchang@gmail.com yeewang0330@gmail.com.', 'College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190704,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', '*DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck/*genetics/pathology', 'Transfection']",PMC6975970,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2019-0063 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0063 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2019 Dec;24(12):e1388-e1400. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0063.

METHODS: Among 1652 transplants performed for lymphoblastic and myeloid AL between 2007 and 2014, 587 patients (acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) 131, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) 456) with detailed information were analyzed aiming to identify risk factors for post-transplant relapse and for overall survival (OS) after relapse. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years was 44% (35-53%) for ALL and 32% (27-36%) for AML (p = 0.023). In ALL, risk factors for relapse were disease status different from the first complete remission (CR1) at haplo-SCT (CR2 vs CR1: HR 2.85, p = 0.011; advanced vs CR1: HR 14.28, p < 0.0001) and male donor gender (HR 3.64, p = 0.0002), while in AML, risk factors were advanced disease at haplo-SCT (advanced vs CR1: HR 3.95, p < 0.0001) and comorbidities (HCT-CI) >/= 3 (HR 1.75, p = 0.014). Transplants performed in more recent years were associated with lower relapse incidence (RI) in AML, but not in ALL (HR 0.91, p = 0.042). After relapse, median follow-up was 13 months (mos). OS at 1-year post relapse was 18%. Prognostic factors for superior OS after relapse were remission at time of haplo-SCT (CR vs advanced: HR 0.71, p = 0.028), time from transplant to relapse (>/= 5 mos vs < 5 mos: HR 0.530, p < 0.0001), and bone marrow as a stem cell source (peripheral blood (PB) vs bone marrow (BM): HR 1.473, p = 0.016). CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors for relapse after haploidentical transplantation were disease specific. Longer OS after relapse was achieved in particular by patients both in CR at haplo-SCT and relapsing more than 5 months after transplant (1-year OS 33%).","['Piemontese, Simona', 'Boumendil, Ariane', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Arcese, William', 'Koc, Yener', 'Gulbas, Zafar', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Wu, Depei', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Irrera, Giuseppe', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Houhou, Mohamed', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Piemontese S', 'Boumendil A', 'Labopin M', 'Schmid C', 'Ciceri F', 'Arcese W', 'Koc Y', 'Gulbas Z', 'Tischer J', 'Bruno B', 'Wu D', 'Blaise D', 'Beelen D', 'Irrera G', 'Ruggeri A', 'Houhou M', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']",,"['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy. piemontese.simona@hsr.it.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Universitatsklinik Augsburg, II Medizinische Klinik, Augsburg, Germany.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'University Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Israel.', 'Hematology Division-Stem Cell Transplant Unit, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Medical Park Hospitals, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, Anadolu Medical Center Hospital, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'LMU-University Hospital of Munich-Grosshadern, Medizinischen Klinik III, Munich, Germany.', 'A.O.U Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Presidio Molinette, Torino, Italy.', 'First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, 215006, Jiangsu, China.', 'Programme de Transplantation & Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Dept. of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital, 45122, Essen, Germany.', 'Centro Unico Regionale Trapianti, Alberto Neri, Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, 00165, Roma, Italy."", ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, Hopital Saint Antoine, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'ALWP office, Hopital Saint Antoine, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190704,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Societies, Medical', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC6610936,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0751-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0751-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Jul 4;12(1):68. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0751-4.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia relapse', '*Survival after relapse']",,,,,,"['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation (EBMT)']",,,,,

However, the disease driving stem cell population is not fully targeted by TKI therapy, and leukemic stem cells (LSC) capable of re-inducing the disease can persist. Single-cell RNA-sequencing technology recently identified an enriched inflammatory gene signature with TNFalpha and TGFbeta being activated in TKI persisting quiescent LSC. Here, we studied the effects of human TNFalpha antibody infliximab (IFX), which has been shown to induce anti-inflammatory effects in mice, combined with TKI treatment on LSC function. METHODS: We first performed GSEA-pathway analysis using our microarray data of murine LSK cells (lin(-); Sca-1(+); c-kit(+)) from the SCLtTA/Bcr-Abl CML transgenic mouse model. Bcr-Abl positive cell lines were generated by retroviral transduction. Clonogenic potential was assessed by CFU (colony forming unit). CML mice were treated with nilotinib or nilotinib plus infliximab, and serial transplantation experiments were performed. RESULTS: Likewise to human CML, TNFalpha signaling was specifically active in murine CML stem cells, and ectopic expression of Bcr-Abl in murine and human progenitor cell lines induced TNFalpha expression. In vitro exposure to human (IFX) or murine (MP6-XT22) TNFalpha antibody reduced clonogenic growth of CML cells. Interestingly, TNFalpha antibody treatment enhanced TKI-induced effects on immature cells in vitro. Additionally, in transplant and serial transplant experiments, using our transgenic CML mouse model, we could subsequently show that IFX therapy boosted TKI-induced effects and further reduced the proportion of malignant stem cells in vivo. CONCLUSION: TNFalpha signaling is induced in CML stem cells, and anti-inflammatory therapy enhances TKI-induced decline of LSC, confirming that successful targeting of persisting CML stem cells can be enhanced by addressing their malignant microenvironment simultaneously.","['Herrmann, Oliver', 'Kuepper, Maja Kim', 'Butow, Marlena', 'Costa, Ivan G', 'Appelmann, Iris', 'Beier, Fabian', 'Luedde, Tom', 'Braunschweig, Till', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Brummendorf, Tim H', 'Schemionek, Mirle']","['Herrmann O', 'Kuepper MK', 'Butow M', 'Costa IG', 'Appelmann I', 'Beier F', 'Luedde T', 'Braunschweig T', 'Koschmieder S', 'Brummendorf TH', 'Schemionek M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5947-3529'],"['Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'IZKF Research Group Bioinformatics Institute for Biomedical Engineering, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology Hemostaseology and Stem Cell Transplantation Faculty of Medicine, University Hospital RWTH Aachen, Pauwelsstr 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany. mschemionek@ukaachen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190704,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'B72HH48FLU (Infliximab)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infliximab/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6610865,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5871-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5871-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jul 4;19(1):658. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5871-2.,1,"['351546/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft', '691706/START Inovationsprogramm Forschung, Faculty of Medicine, University', 'Hospital RWTH Aachen']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'Inflammation', 'Infliximab', 'Leukemic stem cells', 'Mouse model', 'TNF', 'Therapy', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,

In bovine embryos the formation of the hypoblast has been partially studied, and evidence shows that MEK signalling plays a limited role in the segregation of this lineage. Here we explored the role of different signalling pathways during lineage segregation in the bovine embryo using immunofluorescence analysis of NANOG and SOX17 as readouts of epiblast and hypoblast, respectively. RESULTS: We show that SOX17 starts to be expressed in 16-32-cell stage embryos, whereas NANOG is first detected from 8-cell stage. SOX17 is first co-expressed with NANOG, but these markers become mutually exclusive by the late blastocyst stage. By assessing the expression kinetics of NANOG/SOX17 we show that inhibition of MEK signalling can eliminate SOX17 expression in bovine blastocysts, without altering NANOG expression. Modulation of WNT, PKC and LIF did not affect NANOG expression in the epiblast when used in combination with the ERK inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that SOX17 can be used as a reliable early marker of hypoblast in the bovine, and based on its expression profile we show that the hypoblast segregates in day 7 blastocysts. Furthermore, SOX17 expression is abolished using 1 muM of PD0325901, without affecting the NANOG population in the epiblast. Modulation of WNT, PKC and LIF are not sufficient to support enhanced NANOG expression in the epiblast when combined with ERK inhibitor, indicating that additional signalling pathways should be examined to determine their potential roles in epiblast expansion.","['Canizo, Jesica R', 'Ynsaurralde Rivolta, Amada E', 'Vazquez Echegaray, Camila', 'Suva, Mariana', 'Alberio, Virgilia', 'Aller, Juan F', 'Guberman, Alejandra S', 'Salamone, Daniel F', 'Alberio, Ricardo H', 'Alberio, Ramiro']","['Canizo JR', 'Ynsaurralde Rivolta AE', 'Vazquez Echegaray C', 'Suva M', 'Alberio V', 'Aller JF', 'Guberman AS', 'Salamone DF', 'Alberio RH', 'Alberio R']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6560-3919'],"['Estacion Experimental Agropecuaria Balcarce, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Balcarce, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Regulacion Genica en Celulas Madre, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Animal, FAUBA/INPA- CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Estacion Experimental Agropecuaria Mercedes, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Corrientes, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Regulacion Genica en Celulas Madre, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Quimica Biologica (IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Animal, FAUBA/INPA- CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Animal, FAUBA/INPA- CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Estacion Experimental Agropecuaria Balcarce, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Balcarce, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Regulacion Genica en Celulas Madre, Departamento de Quimica Biologica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Quimica Biologica (IQUIBICEN), CONICET-Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Departamento de Fisiologia y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Laboratorio de Biotecnologia Animal, FAUBA/INPA- CONICET, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Estacion Experimental Agropecuaria Balcarce, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Balcarce, Argentina.', 'Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Mar del Plata, Argentina.', 'School of Biosciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, LE12 5RD, UK. ramiro.alberio@nottingham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190704,England,BMC Dev Biol,BMC developmental biology,100966973,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (SOXF Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt1 Protein)', '86K0J5AK6M (mirdametinib)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Blastocyst/*cytology', 'Cattle', 'Diphenylamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*embryology', 'Germ Layers/cytology/*embryology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis', 'SOXF Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Wnt1 Protein/biosynthesis']",PMC6610975,2019/07/06 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12861-019-0193-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12861-019-0193-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Dev Biol. 2019 Jul 4;19(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s12861-019-0193-9.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine embryos', '*Epiblast', '*Hypoblast', '*LIF', '*Lineage segregation', '*NANOG', '*PD0325901', '*SOX17', '*WNT inhibitor', '*t2iGo']",,,,,,,,,,,

This work seeks to leverage existing standards in immunophenotyping cell types found in hematologic malignancies to provide an ontological representation of them to aid in data annotation and analysis for patient data. RESULTS: We have developed the Cancer Cell Ontology according to OBO Foundry principles as an extension of the Cell Ontology. We define classes in Cancer Cell Ontology by using a genus-differentia approach using logical axioms capturing the expression of cellular surface markers in order to represent types of hematologic malignancies. By adopting conventions used in the Cell Ontology, we have created human and computer-readable definitions for 300 classes of blood cancers, based on the EGIL classification system for leukemias, and relying upon additional classification approaches for multiple myelomas and other hematologic malignancies. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated a proof of concept for leveraging the built-in logical axioms of the ontology in order to classify patient surface marker data into appropriate diagnostic categories. We plan to integrate our ontology into existing tools for flow cytometry data analysis to facilitate the automated diagnosis of hematologic malignancies.","['Serra, Lucas M', 'Duncan, William D', 'Diehl, Alexander D']","['Serra LM', 'Duncan WD', 'Diehl AD']",,"['Department of Biomedical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA. lucasser@buffalo.edu.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190425,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['*Biological Ontologies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Machine Learning', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism']",PMC6509834,2019/07/06 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-019-2722-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-019-2722-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2019 Apr 25;20(Suppl 5):181. doi: 10.1186/s12859-019-2722-8.,Suppl 5,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001412/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Blood cancer', 'CCL', 'Cancer cell ontology', 'Cell ontology', 'Leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, the precise etiology of SNIP is still unknown. The objective of this study was to identify the expression pattern of speckled protein 100 (Sp100) in the malignant transformation (MT) of SNIP and its correlation with human papillomavirus (HPV)-16 and HPV-18 infections and other clinical features. This would further help in understanding the possible mechanisms for the development of SNIP. METHODS: Individual nasal mucosa specimens from 40 patients (25 males and 15 females) and 10 inferior turbinate specimens as controls were included in the present study. The samples were divided into several sections for histopathological examination, HPV DNA detection, and immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: We observed that as SNIP progressed, the Sp100 protein expression was gradually downregulated, and SP100 localization changed from nucleus to the cytoplasm. Positive rate of HPV infection in the SNIP with MT group was higher than that in the other groups, and Sp100 expression was correlated to HPV infections and SNIP with MT. However, no correlation was observed between Sp100 expression and clinical features, such as age, gender, and smoking. CONCLUSION: Positive rate of HPV infection is high in the SNIP with MT and has a correlation with Sp100 expression. In addition, the expression of Sp100 is downregulated in SNIP with MT, and Sp100 may play a role in the progression of SNIP.","['Wang, Fei', 'Zhang, Jingru', 'Wang, Hongming', 'Li, Wei']","['Wang F', 'Zhang J', 'Wang H', 'Li W']",,"['Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The First 159407Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The First 159407Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The First 159407Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology, The First 159407Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190704,United States,Ear Nose Throat J,"Ear, nose, & throat journal",7701817,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)']",IM,"['Alphapapillomavirus/*genetics', 'Antigens, Nuclear/*metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Female', 'Human papillomavirus 16/genetics', 'Human papillomavirus 18/genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasal Mucosa/metabolism/virology', 'Papilloma, Inverted/*genetics/virology', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Paranasal Sinus Neoplasms/*genetics/virology', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/*genetics/virology', 'Turbinates/metabolism/virology']",,2019/07/06 06:00,2021/08/06 06:00,['2019/07/06 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0145561319860530 [doi]'],ppublish,Ear Nose Throat J. 2021 Jan;100(1):NP21-NP25. doi: 10.1177/0145561319860530.

Marked improvement has been achieved with SCT from matched unrelated donors (MUDs) in recent years. However, there are limited data comparing the long-term outcomes (beyond 10 years) after SCT from sibling donors and MUDs in older patients with AML. We analyzed these outcomes in a large cohort of patients with AML (n=1134), age >/=50 years, who were alive and leukemia-free 2 years after SCT from matched siblings (n=848) or MUDs (n=286), with a median follow-up of 8.9 years. The median age was 56 and 58 years after SCT from siblings and MUDs, respectively (P=.005). In the sibling group, 77%, 12%, and 11% were in first complete remission (CR1), second complete remission (CR2), and active leukemia at SCT compared with 50%, 25%, and 25% in the MUD group, respectively (P < .001). Sixty-one percent of siblings and 62% of MUDs had reduced-intensity conditioning (P=.78). The 10-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) of patients surviving leukemia-free 2 years after SCT was 72% and 62%, respectively (P=.30). Multivariate analysis identified active leukemia at SCT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.86; P=.0001) or CR2 (HR, 1.51; P=.02) compared with CR1, female recipients (HR, 0.71; P=.006), adverse cytogenetics (HR, 2.52; P=.01), and prior graft-versus-host disease (HR, 1.31; P=.04) as independent factors predicting LFS. Donor and conditioning type were not significant. The cumulative incidence was 15% and 17% (P=.97) for late relapse mortality and 13% and 21% for late nonrelapse mortality, respectively (P=.15). In conclusion, long-term LFS is similar, and patients who are leukemia-free 2 years after SCT can expect favorable outcomes with both donor types.","['Shimoni, Avichai', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Byrne, Michael', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Tabrizi, Reza', 'Sengeloev, Henrik', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Cornelissen, Jan J', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shimoni A', 'Labopin M', 'Savani B', 'Byrne M', 'Volin L', 'Finke J', 'Niederwieser D', 'Ehninger G', 'Blaise D', 'Beelen D', 'Tabrizi R', 'Sengeloev H', 'Ganser A', 'Cornelissen JJ', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']",,"['Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, Israel.

Sirolimus is a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor that has proven effective in GVHD prophylaxis in combination with a calcineurin inhibitor, such as tacrolimus. The impact of sirolimus on immune reconstitution has not been comprehensively investigated in vivo thus far, however. Here we present an ancillary analysis of the randomized study BMT-CTN 0402 that examined the effect of sirolimus on immune subsets post-transplantation. We further examine the association between different lymphocyte subsets and outcomes post-transplantation in each arm. BMT-CTN 0402 was a randomized trial (n=304) comparing 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens, tacrolimus/sirolimus (Tac/Sir) and tacrolimus/methotrexate (Tac/MTX), in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome undergoing myeloablative HLA-matched HCT. There were no differences in 114-day GVHD-free survival (primary endpoint), aGVHD, cGVHD, relapse, or overall survival (OS) between the 2 arms. Of the 304 patients, 264 had available samples for the current immune reconstitution analysis. Blood samples were collected at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-HCT. Multiparameter flow cytometry was performed at the project laboratory (Esoterix Clinical Trials Services) in a blinded fashion, and results for the 2 arms were compared. Multivariable Cox regression models, treating each phenotypic parameter as a time-dependent variable, were constructed to study the impact of reconstitution on clinical outcomes. There were no significant differences in patient and transplantation characteristics between the Tac/Sir and Tac/MTX arms in this analysis. Absolute lymphocyte count and CD3(+) cell, CD4(+) cell, and conventional T cell (Tcon) counts were significantly decreased in the Tac/Sir arm for up to 3 months post-HCT, whereas CD8(+) cells recovered even more slowly (up to 6 months) in this arm. Interestingly, there was no clear difference in the absolute number of regulatory T cells (Tregs, defined as CD4(+)CD25(+) cells) between the 2 arms at any point post-HCT; however, the Treg:Tcon ratio was significantly greater in the Tac/Sir arm in the first 3 months after HCT. B lymphocyte recovery was significantly compromised in the Tac/Sir arm from 1 month to 6 months after HCT, whereas natural killer cell reconstitution was not affected in the Tac/Sir arm. In the outcomes analysis, higher numbers of CD3(+) cells, CD4(+) cells, CD8(+) cells, and Tregs were associated with better OS. Neither Treg numbers nor the Treg:Tcon ratio was correlated with GVHD. Our findings indicate that Tac/Sir has a more profound T cell suppressive effect than the combination of Tac/MTX in the early post-transplantation period, and particularly compromises the recovery of CD8(+) T cells, which have been implicated in aGVHD. Sirolimus used in vivo with tacrolimus does not appear to result in increased absolute numbers of Tregs, but might have a beneficial effect on the Treg:Tcon balance in the first 3 months after transplantation. Nonetheless, no differences in aGVHD or cGVHD between the 2 arms were observed in the parent randomized trial. Calcineurin-inhibitor free, sirolimus-containing GVHD prophylaxis strategies, incorporating other novel agents, should be investigated further to maximize the potential favorable effect of sirolimus on Treg:Tcon balance in the post-transplantation immune repertoire. Sirolimus significantly compromises B cell recovery in the first 6 months post-HCT, with potential complex effects on cGVHD that merit further study.","['Gooptu, Mahasweta', 'Kim, Haesook T', 'Howard, Alan', 'Choi, Sung W', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Cutler, Corey S']","['Gooptu M', 'Kim HT', 'Howard A', 'Choi SW', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Antin JH', 'Ritz J', 'Cutler CS']",,"['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation represents the only curative treatment option, but data on transplant outcomes are scarce. We therefore conducted a retrospective, registry-based study of adult patients allografted for BC CML, focusing on patients with active disease at transplant and pretransplant prognostic factors. One hundred seventy patients allografted for BC CML after tyrosine kinase inhibitor pretreatment between 2004 and 2016 were analyzed. Before transplant, 95 patients were in remission, whereas 75 patients had active BC. In multivariable analysis of the entire cohort, active BC at transplant was the strongest factor associated with decreased overall survival (hazrd ratio, 1.87; P=.010) and shorter leukemia-free survival (LFS; hazard ratio, 1.69; P=.017). For patients with BC in remission at transplant, advanced age (>/=45 years), lower performance status (</=80%), longer interval from diagnosis BC to transplant (>12 months), myeloablative conditioning, and unrelated donor (UD) transplant were risk factors for inferior survival. In patients with active BC, only UD transplant was significantly associated with prolonged LFS and trended toward improved overall survival. In summary, survival of patients allografted for BC CML was strongly dependent on pretransplant remission status. In patients with remission of BC, conventional prognostic factors remained the major determinants of outcome, whereas in those with active BC at transplant, UD transplant was associated with prolonged LFS in our study.","['Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Dietrich, Sascha', 'Blok, Henric-Jan', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Ayuk, Francis', 'Finke, Jurgen', 'Tischer, Johanna', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Koc, Yener', 'Sora, Federica', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Byrne, Jenny L', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Veelken, Joan Hendrik', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Schaap, Nicolaas', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Itala-Remes, Maija', 'Tholouli, Eleni', 'Arat, Mutlu', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Chalandon, Yves']","['Radujkovic A', 'Dietrich S', 'Blok HJ', 'Nagler A', 'Ayuk F', 'Finke J', 'Tischer J', 'Mayer J', 'Koc Y', 'Sora F', 'Passweg J', 'Byrne JL', 'Jindra P', 'Veelken JH', 'Socie G', 'Maertens J', 'Schaap N', 'Stadler M', 'Itala-Remes M', 'Tholouli E', 'Arat M', 'Rocha V', 'Ljungman P', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Kroger N', 'Chalandon Y']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine V; University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

Here we focused on the catalytic Jumonji domain of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) demethylase JMJD1C to screen for potential small molecular modulators from 149,519 natural products and 33,765 Chinese medicine components via virtual screening. JMJD1C Jumonji domain inhibitor 4 (JDI-4) and JDI-12 that share a common structural backbone were detected within the top 15 compounds. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that JDI-4 and JDI-12 bind to JMJD1C and its family homolog KDM3B with modest affinity. In vitro demethylation assays showed that JDI-4 can reverse the H3K9 demethylation conferred by KDM3B. In vivo demethylation assays indicated that JDI-4 and JDI-12 could induce the global increase of H3K9 methylation. Cell proliferation and colony formation assays documented that JDI-4 and JDI-12 kill MLLr AL and other malignant hematopoietic cells, but not leukemia cells resistant to JMJD1C depletion or cord blood cells. Furthermore, JDI-16, among multiple compounds structurally akin to JDI-4/JDI-12, exhibits superior killing activities against malignant hematopoietic cells compared to JDI-4/JDI-12. Mechanistically, JDI-16 not only induces apoptosis but also differentiation of MLLr AL cells. RNA sequencing and quantitative PCR showed that JDI-16 induced gene expression associated with cell metabolism; targeted metabolomics revealed that JDI-16 downregulates lactic acids, NADP(+) and other metabolites.

Several important anticancer drugs perturb this homeostasis by targeting TOP1/2, thereby generating genotoxic DNA damage. Our recent studies indicated that the oncofetal chromatin structuring high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) protein plays an important role as a DNA replication fork chaperone in coping with DNA topological ramifications that occur during replication stress, both genomewide and at fragile sites such as subtelomeres. Intriguingly, a recent large-scale clinical study identified HMGA2 expression as a sole predicting marker for relapse and poor clinical outcomes in 350 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients receiving combinatorial treatments that targeted TOP2 and replicative DNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that HMGA2 significantly enhanced the DNA supercoil relaxation activity of the drug target TOP2A and that this activator function is mechanistically linked to HMGA2's known ability to constrain DNA supercoils within highly compacted ternary complexes. Furthermore, we show that HMGA2 significantly reduced genotoxic DNA damage in each tested cancer cell model during treatment with the TOP2A poison etoposide or the catalytic TOP2A inhibitor merbarone. Taken together with the recent clinical data obtained with AML patients targeted with TOP2 poisons, our study suggests a novel mechanism of cancer chemoresistance toward combination therapies administering TOP2 poisons or inhibitors. We therefore strongly argue for the future implementation of trials of HMGA2 expression profiling to stratify patients before finalizing clinical treatment regimes.","['Ahmed, Syed Moiz', 'Droge, Peter']","['Ahmed SM', 'Droge P']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5447-738X'],"['School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190831,United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (HMGA2 Protein)', '0 (HMGA2 protein, human)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Etoposide/*toxicity', 'HMGA2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation/drug effects', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Thiobarbiturates/*toxicity', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/*toxicity']",PMC6763970,2019/07/05 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/07/05 06:00'],"['2019/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12541 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2019 Oct;13(10):2062-2078. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12541.

However, a few of the patients included in the Europe Stop Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (EURO-SKI) trial reported musculoskeletal pain shortly after stopping TKIs, considered as a withdrawal syndrome (WS). To identify factors that may predispose to TKI WS, we analysed the pharmacovigilance declarations for the 6 months after stopping TKIs in a large cohort of CML (n = 427) that combined the French patients included in the STop IMatinib 2 (STIM2; n = 224) and EURO-SKI (n = 203) trials. Among these patients, 23% (99/427) developed TKI WS after stopping imatinib (77/373; 20.4%), nilotinib (12/29; 41.4%) or dasatinib (10/25; 40%). WS concerned mainly the upper body joints, and required multiple symptomatic treatments in 30% of patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified two risk factors: duration of TKI treatment [risk ratio (RR) = 1.68 (1.02-2.74)] with a 93-month cut-off time, and history of osteoarticular symptoms [RR = 1.84 (1.04-3.28)]. These findings confirm that WS is a TKI class effect. CML patients should be carefully screened before treatment initiation to identify pre-existent osteoarticular symptoms. Moreover, before TKI discontinuation, patients should be informed of the possibility of WS, particularly after a long treatment period.","['Berger, Marc G', 'Pereira, Bruno', 'Rousselot, Philippe', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Gardembas, Martine', 'Legros, Laurence', 'Escoffre-Barbe, Martine', 'Nicolini, Franck-Emmanuel', 'Saugues, Sandrine', 'Lambert, Celine', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Giraudier, Stephane', 'Guilhot, Joelle', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Berger MG', 'Pereira B', 'Rousselot P', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Gardembas M', 'Legros L', 'Escoffre-Barbe M', 'Nicolini FE', 'Saugues S', 'Lambert C', 'Rea D', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Giraudier S', 'Guilhot J', 'Saussele S', 'Mahon FX']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1858-0587', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1633-6479', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5379-7461']","['CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, Hematologie Biologique, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique Adulte et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, Clermont-Ferrand, Cedex, France."", 'Universite Clermont Auvergne, EA 7453 CHELTER, Clermont-Ferrand, Cedex, France.', ""Delegation de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie et d'Oncologie, CH de Versailles, Le Chesnay, France."", 'Service Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Annecy Genevois, Pringy, France.', 'Service des Maladies du Sang, CHU Angers, Angers, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Paul-Brousse (AP-HP), Villejuif, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Rennes, Rennes, France."", 'Hematologie Clinique et INSERM U1052, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Hopital Estaing, Hematologie Biologique, Clermont-Ferrand Cedex, France.', ""Delegation de la Recherche Clinique et de l'Innovation, CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont-Ferrand, France."", ""Groupe Hospitalier Saint-Louis, Service d'Hematologie, Lariboisiere, Fernand-Widal (AP-HP), Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, CHRU Nancy-Brabois, Vandoeuvre, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital H.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression and clinical implication of POU5F1B in AML. MATERIAL AND METHODS The expression of the POU5F1B transcript was evaluated in 175 newly diagnosed AML patients and 39 healthy controls by use of real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). RESULTS POU5F1B was underexpressed in AML compared with controls (P<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the POU5F1B transcript level was able to differentiate AML patients from healthy individuals (AUC=0.682). In non-APL AML patients, the POU5F1Blow group had significantly higher WBC than the POU5F1Bhigh group (20.2x10(9) vs. 4.6x10(9) L(-)(1), P=0.021). Among whole-cohort AML, non-APL AML, and intermediate-risk AML, POU5F1Bhigh patients had obviously higher complete remission (CR) rates than POU5F1Blow patients (P=0.012, P=0.012 and P=0.027). In addition, Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated better overall survival (OS, P=0.019, P=0.007 and P=0.046, respectively) in POU5F1Bhigh patients compared with POU5F1Blow patients. Furthermore, in multivariate survival analysis, POU5F1B was independently associated with OS in non-APL AML patients and intermediate-risk AML as a favorable prognostic factor. CONCLUSIONS POU5F1B was frequently underexpressed in AML, and might contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of AML.","['Yi, Jing', 'Zhou, Ling-Yu', 'Yi, Yun-Yun', 'Zhu, Xin', 'Su, Xiao-Yu', 'Zhao, Qian', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun', 'Deng, Zhao-Qun']","['Yi J', 'Zhou LY', 'Yi YY', 'Zhu X', 'Su XY', 'Zhao Q', 'Lin J', 'Qian J', 'Deng ZQ']",,"[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China (mainland).', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190704,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Pseudogenes', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcriptome']",PMC6625577,2019/07/05 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/07/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['914352 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.914352 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Jul 4;25:4952-4959. doi: 10.12659/MSM.914352.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inactivity persists into survivorship, negatively influencing health and quality of life. Fatigue is one of the most prevalent symptoms during treatment yet children with increased physical activity (PA) have less fatigue. This pilot study evaluated the impact of coaching on PA and fatigue in children undergoing cancer treatment delivered by pediatric oncology nurse practitioners (NPs) during routine clinic visits. NPs used motivational interviewing during clinic visits to coach children and their families on strategies to increase PA at home. Self-report measures of PA and fatigue were completed at treatment months 2, 4, and 6. PA was also measured using actigraphy. Among 30 children ages 6 to 18 years, 7 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 11 had lymphoma, and 12 had solid tumors. Patterns of fatigue were different by disease group with trends to fatigue decreasing during treatment in the patients with ALL (p = .09) and lymphoma (p = .13) but increasing in those with solid tumors (p = .06). Self-report PA was unchanged. Actigraph measurements remained stable for the group. NPs reported time challenges in implementing coaching during the clinic visit and in providing coaching continuity.

Antibody-mediated blockade of immune checkpoint molecules PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 has had a dramatic impact upon the treatment of previously intractable cancers such as malignant melanoma, while adoptive cell therapies using chimeric antigen receptor-bearing T cells have proven highly efficacious in B cell leukemia. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms by which tumors evade or become resistant to these immunotherapies. In this regard, approaches to broaden the applicability and enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies increasingly include modulation of tumor and immune cell metabolism. In this mini-review, we highlight the most recent studies describing novel approaches and targets for the manipulation of the tumor microenvironment and T cell metabolism and describe how these approaches are being combined with current immunotherapies in preclinical studies.","['Hope, Helen Carrasco', 'Salmond, Robert J']","['Hope HC', 'Salmond RJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1807-1056'],"[""Leeds Institute of Medical Research at St James's, University of Leeds, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK."", ""Leeds Institute of Medical Research at St James's, University of Leeds, Wellcome Trust Brenner Building, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, LS9 7TF, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190709,Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'B7-H1 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,2019/07/05 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/07/05 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201848058 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2019 Aug;49(8):1147-1152. doi: 10.1002/eji.201848058.

Limited treatment options are available for scleroderma esophageal disease. Here, we discuss recent updates on the diagnosis, treatment, and characterization that have been made in patients with scleroderma esophageal disease. RECENT FINDINGS: In the past few years, novel diagnostic tools have provided insight into esophageal dysmotility in SSc patients. New drugs are being tested and might improve symptoms and quality of life in SSc patients with esophageal dysfunction. Molecular stratification methods have facilitated the identification of molecular signatures in the esophagus of SSc patients. The Friend leukemia integration 1 (Fli1) conditional knockout mouse is the first animal model to report an esophageal phenotype with SSc features. The clinical presentation in SSc patients with esophageal dysfunction is heterogeneous, complicating diagnosis and management. The improvement of diagnostic tools for esophageal symptoms and dysfunction and the use of molecular approaches in SSc mouse models and patient biopsies offer an opportunity to improve the characterization of SSc esophageal disease, which should help improve management and treatment decisions.","['Tetreault, Marie-Pier', 'Kahrilas, Peter']","['Tetreault MP', 'Kahrilas P']",,"['Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology and Hepatology Division, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 15-753 Tarry Building, 300 East Superior Street, Chicago, IL, 60611-3010, USA. marie-pier.tetreault@northwestern.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Gastroenterology and Hepatology Division, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, 15-753 Tarry Building, 300 East Superior Street, Chicago, IL, 60611-3010, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190703,United States,Curr Rheumatol Rep,Current rheumatology reports,100888970,,IM,"['Esophageal Diseases/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Gastroesophageal Reflux/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/*complications/physiopathology']",,2019/07/05 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/07/05 06:00'],"['2019/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11926-019-0841-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11926-019-0841-x [pii]']",epublish,Curr Rheumatol Rep. 2019 Jul 3;21(8):42. doi: 10.1007/s11926-019-0841-x.,8,['P01 DK117824/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Esophageal reflux monitoring', '*Esophagus', '*Functional luminal imaging probe', '*Impedance', '*Manometry', '*Systemic sclerosis']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that the transcriptional regulator PRDM16s causes oncogenic fate conversion by transforming cells fated to form platelets and erythrocytes into myeloid leukemia stem cells (LSCs). Prdm16s expression in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors (MEPs), which normally lack the potential to generate granulomonocytic cells, caused AML by converting MEPs into LSCs. Prdm16s blocked megakaryocytic/erythroid potential by interacting with super enhancers and activating myeloid master regulators, including PU.1. A CRISPR dropout screen confirmed that PU.1 is required for Prdm16s-induced leukemia. Ablating PU.1 attenuated leukemogenesis and reinstated the megakaryocytic/erythroid potential of leukemic MEPs in mouse models and human AML with PRDM16 rearrangement. Thus, oncogenic PRDM16 s expression gives MEPs an LSC fate by activating myeloid gene regulatory networks.","['Hu, Tianyuan', 'Morita, Kiyomi', 'Hill, Matthew C', 'Jiang, Yajian', 'Kitano, Ayumi', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Wang, Feng', 'Mao, Xizeng', 'Hoegenauer, Kevin A', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro', 'Martin, James F', 'Futreal, P Andrew', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Nakada, Daisuke']","['Hu T', 'Morita K', 'Hill MC', 'Jiang Y', 'Kitano A', 'Saito Y', 'Wang F', 'Mao X', 'Hoegenauer KA', 'Morishita K', 'Martin JF', 'Futreal PA', 'Takahashi K', 'Nakada D']",,"['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and.', ""Texas Heart Institute, Baylor St Luke's Medical Center, Houston, TX."", 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Program in Developmental Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190703,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (PRDM16 protein, human)', '0 (Prdm16 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC6695560,2019/07/05 06:00,2020/01/24 06:00,['2019/07/05 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)46183-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2018888255 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Aug 15;134(7):614-625. doi: 10.1182/blood.2018888255.

The safety and feasibility of posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) in this setting have been reported recently, but no study has compared the outcomes of PTCY vs ATG in 9/10 MMUD transplants. Using the registry data of the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, we performed a matched-pair analysis comparing those 2 strategies in a 9/10 MMUD setting. Ninety-three patients receiving PTCY were matched with 179 patients receiving ATG. A significantly lower incidence of severe acute GVHD was observed with PTCY compared with ATG. Recipients of the former also showed higher leukemia-free survival and GVHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS). When performing a subgroup analysis including patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells, being in complete remission, or receiving the same associated immunosuppressive agents, superiority of PTCY over ATG was confirmed. Similar to the haploidentical setting, use of PTCY is an effective anti-GVHD prophylaxis in the 9/10 MMUD transplant. Use of PTCY may also provide better outcomes in long-term disease control.

Although truncated STAT3beta was originally postulated to act as a dominant-negative form of STAT3alpha, it has been shown to have various STAT3alpha-independent regulatory functions. Recently, STAT3beta gained attention as a powerful antitumorigenic molecule in cancer. Deregulated STAT3 signaling is often found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); however, the role of STAT3beta in AML remains elusive. Therefore, we analyzed the STAT3beta/alpha messenger RNA (mRNA) expression ratio in AML patients, where we observed that a higher STAT3beta/alpha mRNA ratio correlated with a favorable prognosis and increased overall survival. To gain better understanding of the function of STAT3beta in AML, we engineered a transgenic mouse allowing for balanced Stat3beta expression. Transgenic Stat3beta expression resulted in decelerated disease progression and extended survival in PTEN- and MLL-AF9-dependent AML mouse models. Our findings further suggest that the antitumorigenic function of STAT3beta depends on the tumor-intrinsic regulation of a small set of significantly up- and downregulated genes, identified via RNA sequencing. In conclusion, we demonstrate that STAT3beta plays an essential tumor-suppressive role in AML.","['Aigner, Petra', 'Mizutani, Tatsuaki', 'Horvath, Jaqueline', 'Eder, Thomas', 'Heber, Stefan', 'Lind, Karin', 'Just, Valentin', 'Moll, Herwig P', 'Yeroslaviz, Assa', 'Fischer, Michael J M', 'Kenner, Lukas', 'Gyorffy, Balazs', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Grebien, Florian', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Casanova, Emilio', 'Stoiber, Dagmar']","['Aigner P', 'Mizutani T', 'Horvath J', 'Eder T', 'Heber S', 'Lind K', 'Just V', 'Moll HP', 'Yeroslaviz A', 'Fischer MJM', 'Kenner L', 'Gyorffy B', 'Sill H', 'Grebien F', 'Moriggl R', 'Casanova E', 'Stoiber D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0932-2052', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3398-0442', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6438-9068', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9638-4026', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2184-1338', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4289-2281', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0918-9463', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7992-5361', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8824-0767']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Physiology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Physiology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Computational Systems Biochemistry Group, Max Planck Institute for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany.', 'Institute of Physiology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Clinical Institute of Pathology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Unit of Pathology of Laboratory Animals, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, Institute of Enzymology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Animal Breeding and Genetics, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria; and.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Physiology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Pharmacology, Department Pharmacology, Physiology and Microbiology, Karl Landsteiner University of Health Sciences, Krems, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*etiology/metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Prognosis', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6616266,2019/07/05 06:00,2020/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/05 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018026385 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018026385 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 9;3(13):1989-2002. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018026385.,13,,,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: For 191 such specimens, incidental histological findings after haematopathologist re-review were tabulated. Cases suspicious for lymphoid malignancy underwent molecular analysis for immunoglobulin heavy and kappa light chain rearrangement. Follow-up was obtained on selected cases. In five cases (3%), the spleen was sampled but not mentioned in the original microscopic report; all were normal on re-review. Otherwise, most (171 of 186, 92%) were initially diagnosed as normal, with 160 (94%) remaining so on re-review. Findings on re-review not initially described (n = 11, 6%) included four cases with splenic morphology suspicious for possible leukaemia/lymphoma involvement. Additional findings included abscess formation, foamy macrophages, necrotising granulomas and simple cysts. Fifteen spleens were initially diagnosed as abnormal; the histopathological process was confirmed in all, including non-necrotising granulomas, cysts, Gamna-Gandy bodies, foamy macrophages, involvement by pancreatic neoplasm and involvement by known chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Molecular analysis was performed on the five cases of known/suspected lymphoma and two were positive for monoclonal gene rearrangement, including the known CLL and a previously undiagnosed case with similar immunophenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Incidental splenic findings are not uncommon in pancreatosplenectomy specimens. While most are of limited clinical significance, low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders may go undetected if the spleen is overlooked. We recommend careful observation of splenic findings in these specimens, with a low threshold for haematopathological consultation when in doubt.","['Patel, Nisha', 'Evans, Andrew G', 'Rothberg, Paul G', 'Gonzalez, Raul S']","['Patel N', 'Evans AG', 'Rothberg PG', 'Gonzalez RS']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5526-4220'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190905,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidental Findings', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreas/pathology/surgery', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/*pathology/surgery', 'Splenic Neoplasms/diagnosis/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13948 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2019 Nov;75(5):746-754. doi: 10.1111/his.13948.

Tumour cells with metastatic potential may demonstrate a high telomerase activity, allowing cells to escape from the inhibition of cell proliferation due to shortened telomeres. Determination of telomerase expression was performed with the use of PCR ELISA in samples isolated from bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) infected cows. Telomerase activity was found in almost all investigated samples. The relative telomerase activity (RTA) was higher in infected cows than in healthy animals and the differences were statistically significant (alpha=0.05). In blood lymphocytes of BLV-infected cows the mean values of telomerase expression determined in real-time PCR were 3534.12 copies, in the healthy group there were 1010.10 copies and these differences were also statistically significant. For telomere length evaluation the Telomere PNA/FITC FISH and Telomere PNA/FITC FISH for flow cytometry were used. The mean fluorescence intensity of telomere sequences calculated on the surface of interphase nuclei of leukaemic blood lymphocytes was lower than that in the control animals and the difference was statistically significant. The mean length of telomeres in BLV- infected and healthy cows was 31.63 +/- 12.62 and 38.4 +/- 4.03, (p=0.112), respectively.","['Szczotka, M', 'Kocki, J', 'Iwan, E', 'Pluta, A']","['Szczotka M', 'Kocki J', 'Iwan E', 'Pluta A']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, National Veterinary Research Institute, Al.

A historical example.,234-240,10.23749/mdl.v110i3.7995 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Benzene is a highly flammable, highly volatile liquid aromatic hydrocarbon. It has been used in many industrial processes as a solvent or a starting material. At the beginning of the twentieth century, it was very widely used in the workplace, especially in printing and in the shoe manufacturing and rubber industries. Although benzene was first recognized to cause aplastic anemia, its association with leukemia has been investigated only since the 1930s. In 1963, Italy was one of the first countries in the world to adopt a law to ban benzene as a solvent in work activities. OBJECTIVES: This study analyzed the contribution of the Clinica del Lavoro in Milan, Italy, to studies of the relationship between exposure to benzene and leukemia. METHODS: Scientific literature and historical sources on benzene and leukemia in the twentieth century were reviewed, and interviews with a first-hand witness of that period were conducted. RESULTS: By 1928, several scholars had reported anecdotal cases of leukemia among workers exposed to benzene. Enrico Vigliani was the first to collect all of these cases and to try to conduct statistical analysis on these data, in order to support the association between benzene and leukemia. In the 1960s, Vigliani and Alessandra Forni showed that benzene could cause chromosome aberrations in the bone marrow that could produce leukemic clones. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these studies and the subsequent regulations which banned benzene, exposure conditions changed in the workplace in the last few decades. The resulting low concentrations have prompted researchers to investigate new exposure biomarkers and to study any related health problems.","['Belingheri, Michael', 'Fustinoni, Silvia', 'De Vito, Giovanni', 'Porro, Alessandro', 'Riva, Michele Augusto']","['Belingheri M', 'Fustinoni S', 'De Vito G', 'Porro A', 'Riva MA']",,"['School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy. michael.belingheri@unimib.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190628,Italy,Med Lav,La Medicina del lavoro,0401176,"['0 (Solvents)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['*Benzene/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Italy', '*Leukemia/chemically induced', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Solvents', 'Workplace']",PMC7812544,2019/07/04 06:00,2019/09/05 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.23749/mdl.v110i3.7995 [doi]'],epublish,Med Lav. 2019 Jun 28;110(3):234-240. doi: 10.23749/mdl.v110i3.7995.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venetoclax can cause reduction in B-lymphocyte counts as an on-target effect. The purpose of this analysis is to quantify the relationship between venetoclax exposure and B-lymphocyte levels to inform dosing of venetoclax in healthy subjects. Data were pooled from 10 studies in healthy subjects with venetoclax doses ranging from 10 mg to 400 mg and food ranging from fasting to high-fat meals. Venetoclax pharmacokinetics (PK) was characterized in 203 subjects using a population approach, as implemented in NONMEM version 7.3 (Icon Development Solutions, Ellicott City, MD, USA). A semimechanistic pharmacodynamic (PD) model with a linear drug effect was fit to the B-lymphocyte data to determine the exposure-response relationship. The population PK and PD model described the observed data adequately. The 200 and 400 mg doses were shown to reduce the B-lymphocyte levels by 24% (15-35%) and 38% (25-54%), respectively. B-lymphocytes recovered to normal levels within an average of 48 (21-64) days and 59 (30-66) days, respectively, with 200 and 400 mg doses. Venetoclax can be safely administered in healthy subjects. The PK-PD model characterized the relationship between venetoclax exposure and reduction in B-lymphocytes and will help design future venetoclax studies in healthy subjects.","['Dave, Nimita', 'Gopalakrishnan, Sathej', 'Mensing, Sven', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Dave N', 'Gopalakrishnan S', 'Mensing S', 'Salem AH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9261-1583'],"['AbbVie, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'AbbVie, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'AbbVie, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'AbbVie, North Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190807,United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6853148,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cts.12665 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2019 Nov;12(6):625-632. doi: 10.1111/cts.12665.

Preclinical, as well as clinical data have demonstrated the efficacy of tumorselective (oncolytic) viruses in hematological malignancies. In this study, we infected AML cell lines and primary AML cells from patients with measles vaccine virus either expressing GFP or armed with super cytosine deaminase, which converts the prodrug, 5fluorocytosine, into the chemotherapeutic compound, 5fluorouracil. Target cell density of the measles entry receptor, CD46, infection rates of targeted leukemic cells, tumor cell viability, and apoptotic rates were determined. We found that measles vaccine virus infected the leukemic blasts and profoundly diminished the number and viability of leukemic cells via the induction of apoptosis. The conversion of 5fluorocytosine to 5fluorouracil exerted a potent additive tumoricidal effect. This was also observed in cases when leukemic cells displayed only moderate susceptibility to the oncolytic virus and hence direct oncolysis. Taken together, in this study, we provide a first characterization of the combinatorial use of measles vaccine virus and 5fluorouracil for treatment of AML. Our approach to sitespecifically produce the active drug and combine this agent with the direct lytic effect of virotherapy may overcome present limitations and constitutes a feasible method with which to introduce 5fluorouracil in the treatment of AML.","['Maurer, Stefanie', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Smirnow, Irina', 'Lauer, Ulrich M', 'Berchtold, Susanne']","['Maurer S', 'Salih HR', 'Smirnow I', 'Lauer UM', 'Berchtold S']",,"['Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tuebingen, D72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tuebingen, D72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine VIII, University Hospital Tuebingen, D72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine VIII, University Hospital Tuebingen, D72076 Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine VIII, University Hospital Tuebingen, D72076 Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190702,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'D83282DT06 (Flucytosine)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Flucytosine/metabolism', 'Fluorouracil/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Measles virus/*genetics', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Prodrugs/*administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",PMC6615925,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2019.4835 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2019 Aug;55(2):347-358. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2019.4835.

METHODS: The authors performed a pubmed search of all articles published in English on lymphoma/leukemia of lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct. Data analyzed include prevalence, demographics, clinical presentations, treatment outcomes of primary versus secondary lacrimal involvement, and recurrence rates. RESULTS: Lymphoma/leukemia of lacrimal sac presented at a mean age of 55 years. The majority of the tumors (63%) were primary involvement of lacrimal sac, bilateral involvement being more common in secondary than primary lacrimal sac lymphoma. Epiphora (96%, 98/102), swelling in the lacrimal sac region (75%, 77/102), and acute dacryocystitis (31%) were the most frequent presenting features. Thirty-six percent of the lesions were diagnosed incidentally while performing a dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR). Among primary sac lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) (43%) was the most common sub-type followed by MALToma (24%), unclassified B-cell lymphoma (21%), lymphoid hyperplasia (5%) and 3% each small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) and NK/T cell lymphoma. Management usually involves chemotherapy and/ or radiotherapy with or without surgical resection. Successful outcomes in terms of local disease control could be achieved in all the cases; however, 15% died of the systemic disease after a mean 18 months from the time of sac involvement. Aggressive lymphomas like NK/T-cell have the worst prognosis. CONCLUSION: Lymphoproliferative involvement of lacrimal sac has a high incidence of acute dacryocystitis with a good response to chemotherapy. Epiphora in patients with leukemia/lymphoma should arouse suspicion of a lacrimal drainage involvement.","['Singh, Swati', 'Ali, Mohammad Javed']","['Singh S', 'Ali MJ']",,"['Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery Services, L.J.

Expanding acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clones not only alter stroma composition, but also actively constrain hematopoiesis, representing a significant source of patient morbidity and mortality. Recent studies revealed the surprising resistance of long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC) to elimination from the leukemic niche. Here, we examine the fate and function of residual LT-HSC in the BM of murine xenografts with emphasis on the role of AML-derived extracellular vesicles (EV). AML-EV rapidly enter HSC, and their trafficking elicits protein synthesis suppression and LT-HSC quiescence. Mechanistically, AML-EV transfer a panel of miRNA, including miR-1246, that target the mTOR subunit Raptor, causing ribosomal protein S6 hypo-phosphorylation, which in turn impairs protein synthesis in LT-HSC. While HSC functionally recover from quiescence upon transplantation to an AML-naive environment, they maintain relative gains in repopulation capacity.

Currently there are many comparable treatment options available for FL. When selecting the most optimal therapy it is important to consider possible late effects of the treatment as well as survival. Secondary haematological malignancy (SHM) is a severe late effect of treatments, but the incidence of SHMs is still largely unknown. The goal of the present study was to determine the incidence of SHMs and how therapeutic decisions interfere with this risk. The study included 1028 FL patients with a median follow-up time of 5.6 years. The 5-year risk of SHM was 1.1% and the risk was associated with multiple lines of treatment (P = 0.016). The 5-year risk of SHM was 0.5% after the first-line treatment and 1.6% after the second-line. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 6.2 (95% confidence interval 3.4-10.5) for SHM overall. This retrospective study found that the risk of SHM was low after first-line treatment in FL patients from the rituximab era. However, the risk of SHM increases with multiple lines of treatment. Therapeutic approaches should aim to achieve as long a remission as possible with first-line treatment, thereby postponing the added risk of SHM.","['Prusila, Roosa E I', 'Sorigue, Marc', 'Jauhiainen, Jyrki', 'Mercadal, Santiago', 'Postila, Aleksi', 'Salmi, Petteri', 'Tanhua, Taru', 'Tikkanen, Susanna', 'Kakko, Sakari', 'Kuitunen, Hanne', 'Pollari, Marjukka', 'Nystrand, Ilja', 'Kuusisto, Milla E L', 'Vasala, Kaija', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Korkeila, Eija', 'Karihtala, Peeter', 'Sancho, Juan-Manuel', 'Turpeenniemi-Hujanen, Taina', 'Kuittinen, Outi']","['Prusila REI', 'Sorigue M', 'Jauhiainen J', 'Mercadal S', 'Postila A', 'Salmi P', 'Tanhua T', 'Tikkanen S', 'Kakko S', 'Kuitunen H', 'Pollari M', 'Nystrand I', 'Kuusisto MEL', 'Vasala K', 'Jantunen E', 'Korkeila E', 'Karihtala P', 'Sancho JM', 'Turpeenniemi-Hujanen T', 'Kuittinen O']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8908-1542', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4741-7885']","['Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Haematology, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain.', 'Department of Applied Physics, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Haematology, ICO-Hospital Duran i Reynals, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Haematology, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Oncology, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Oncology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Siunsote - Hospital District of North Carelia, Joensuu, Finland.', 'Department of Oncology and Radiotherapy, Central Finland Central Hospital, Jyvaskyla, Finland.', 'Siunsote - Hospital District of North Carelia, Joensuu, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Oncology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Haematology, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Institut de Recerca Josep Carreras, Badalona, Spain.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Medical Research Centre and Cancer and Translational Research Unit, University of Oulu and Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Department of Oncology, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190703,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/mortality', '*Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16090 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Nov;187(3):364-371. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16090.

The reasons for that complication are only partially known. The aims of this study were to assess pulmonary function in CLS and identify (1) risk factors and (2) clinical manifestations for the impairment of airflow and lung diffusion. The study group included 74 CLS: 46 treated with chemotherapy alone (HSCT-), 28 with chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT+), and 84 healthy subjects (control group (CG)). Spirometry and diffusion limit of carbon monoxide (DLCO) tests were performed in all subjects. Ten (14%) survivors had restrictive, five (7%) had obstructive pattern, and 47 (66%) had reduced DLCO. The age at diagnosis, type of transplant, and type of conditioning regimen did not significantly affect the pulmonary function tests. The DLCO%pv were lower in CLS than in CG (p < 0.03) and in the HSCT+ than in the HSCT- survivors (p < 0.05). The pulmonary infection increased the risk of diffusion impairment (OR 5.1, CI 1.16-22.9, p = 0.019). DLCO was reduced in survivors who experienced CMV lung infection (p < 0.001). The main symptom of impaired lung diffusion was poor tolerance of exercise (p < 0.005). The lower lung diffusion capacity is the most frequent abnormality in CLS. HSCT and pulmonary infection, in particular with CMV infection, are strong risk factors for impairment of lung diffusion capacity in CLS. Clinical manifestation of DLCO impairment is poor exercise tolerance. A screening for respiratory abnormalities in CLS seems to be of significant importance.","['Wasilewska, Eliza', 'Kuziemski, Krzysztof', 'Niedoszytko, Marek', 'Kaczorowska-Hac, Barbara', 'Niedzwiecki, Maciej', 'Malgorzewicz, Sylwia', 'Jassem, Ewa']","['Wasilewska E', 'Kuziemski K', 'Niedoszytko M', 'Kaczorowska-Hac B', 'Niedzwiecki M', 'Malgorzewicz S', 'Jassem E']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5288-0586'],"['Department of Allergology and Pneumonology, Medical University of Gdansk, 7 Debinki Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland. ewasilewska@gumed.edu.pl.', 'Department of Allergology and Pneumonology, Medical University of Gdansk, 7 Debinki Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Allergology and Pneumonology, Medical University of Gdansk, 7 Debinki Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Occupational Therapy, University of Physical Education and Sport, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Occupational Therapy, University of Physical Education and Sport, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Nutrition, Medical University of Gdansk, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Allergology and Pneumonology, Medical University of Gdansk, 7 Debinki Street, 80-211, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190702,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/physiopathology/therapy', 'Lung/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Respiratory Function Tests', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",PMC6700051,2019/07/04 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03745-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03745-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Sep;98(9):2103-2110. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03745-4.

More recent efforts have utilized patient-derived xenografts; however, these are hampered by variable genetic background, inability to study early events, and practical issues with availability/reproducibility. We report here an efficient, reproducible model of T-cell leukemia in which lentiviral transduction of normal human cord blood yields aggressive leukemia that appears indistinguishable from natural disease. We utilize this synthetic model to uncover a role for oncogene-induced HOXB activation which is operative in leukemia cells-of-origin and persists in established tumors where it defines a novel subset of patients distinct from other known genetic subtypes and with poor clinical outcome. We show further that anterior HOXB genes are specifically activated in human T-ALL by an epigenetic mechanism and confer growth advantage in both pre-leukemia cells and established clones.","['Kusakabe, Manabu', 'Sun, Ann Chong', 'Tyshchenko, Kateryna', 'Wong, Rachel', 'Nanda, Aastha', 'Shanna, Claire', 'Gusscott, Samuel', 'Chavez, Elizabeth A', 'Lorzadeh, Alireza', 'Zhu, Alice', 'Hill, Ainsleigh', 'Hung, Stacy', 'Brown, Scott', 'Babaian, Artem', 'Wang, Xuehai', 'Holt, Robert A', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Karsan, Aly', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Eaves, Connie J', 'Hirst, Martin', 'Weng, Andrew P']","['Kusakabe M', 'Sun AC', 'Tyshchenko K', 'Wong R', 'Nanda A', 'Shanna C', 'Gusscott S', 'Chavez EA', 'Lorzadeh A', 'Zhu A', 'Hill A', 'Hung S', 'Brown S', 'Babaian A', 'Wang X', 'Holt RA', 'Steidl C', 'Karsan A', 'Humphries RK', 'Eaves CJ', 'Hirst M', 'Weng AP']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2518-0776', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3452-1926', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9136-9054']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Lymphoid Cancer Research, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V6T 1Z4, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V6T 1Z4, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Lymphoid Cancer Research, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada."", 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada."", 'Lymphoid Cancer Research, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada."", 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Michael Smith Laboratories, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, V6T 1Z4, BC, Canada.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada."", 'Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada. aweng@bccrc.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190702,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Models, Genetic', '*Multigene Family', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6606637,2019/07/04 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2018/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-10510-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-10510-8 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Jul 2;10(1):2913. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-10510-8.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between Shizuoka Prefectural General Hospital and Mt. Fuji Shizuoka Children's Hospital, medical stuff and information have been shared for these 4 years. And joint cardiovascular surgeries have started since 2015 autumn at Shizuoka Prefectural General Hospital. PURPOSE: The contents and the results of these joint operations were evaluated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen joint operations were performed and median age at operation was 55 years old( male 3, female 10). The original diagnosis was tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect 6, ventricular septal defect( VSD)+/-pulmonary stenosis 4, atrioventicular septal defect/two chamber right ventricle/Ebstein's anomaly 1 ( each). The procedures were pulmonary valve replacement/right ventricle out flow tract reconstruction 7, mitral valve plasty/tricuspid annuloplasty 4, Bentall 2, VSD closure 2 etc.(included multiple choices). RESULTS: There was no early mortality. One late mortality was occurred 17 months after the surgery due to acute myeloid leukemia. General conditions in other patients have been feasible and most of them were followed in Shizuoka Prefectural General Hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the joint operations were feasible in the present study. Our joint project may become more important in the future.","['Hirose, Keiichi', 'Ikai, Akio', 'Tsuneyoshi, Hiroshi', 'Mitsushita, Norie', 'Tanaka, Yasuhiko', 'Sakamoto, Hiroki', 'Sakamoto, Kisaburo']","['Hirose K', 'Ikai A', 'Tsuneyoshi H', 'Mitsushita N', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sakamoto H', 'Sakamoto K']",,"[""Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan.""]",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Kyobu Geka,Kyobu geka.

Such patients are immunocompetent, have low peripheral and brain HIV burdens, and show minimal brain neuropathology. Using the model of HIV-related memory impairment in EcoHIV-infected conventional mice, we investigated the neurobiological and cognitive consequences of efficient EcoHIV expression in the mouse brain after intracerebral infection. HIV integrated and persisted in an expressed state in brain tissue, was detectable in brain monocytic cells, and caused neuroinflammatory responses and lasting spatial, working, and associative memory impairment. Systemic antiretroviral treatment prevented direct brain infection and memory dysfunction indicating the requirement for HIV expression in the brain for disease. Similarly inoculated murine leukemia virus used as a control replicated in mouse brain but not in monocytic cells and was cognitively benign, linking the disease to HIV-specific functions. Memory impairment correlated in real time with hippocampal dysfunction shown by defective long-term potentiation in hippocampal slices ex vivo and with diffuse synaptodendritic injury in the hippocampus reflected in significant reduction in microtubule-associated protein 2 and synapsin II staining. In contrast, there was no evidence of overt neuronal loss in this region as determined by neuron-specific nuclear protein quantification, TUNEL assay, and histological observations. Our results reveal a novel capacity of HIV to induce neuronal dysfunction and memory impairment independent of neurotoxicity, distinct from the neurotoxicity of HIV infection in dementia.IMPORTANCE HIV neuropathogenesis has been attributed in large measure to neurotoxicity of viral proteins and inflammatory factors produced by infected monocytic cells in the brain. We show here that HIV expression in mouse brain causes lasting memory impairment by a mechanism involving injury to hippocampal synaptodendritic arbors and neuronal function but not overt neuronal loss in the region. Our results mirror the observation of minimal neurodegeneration in cognitively impaired HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy and demonstrate that HIV is nonneurotoxic in certain brain abnormalities that it causes. If neurons comprising the cognition-related networks survive HIV insult, at least for some time, there is a window of opportunity for disease treatment.","['Kelschenbach, Jennifer', 'He, Hongxia', 'Kim, Boe-Hyun', 'Borjabad, Alejandra', 'Gu, Chao-Jiang', 'Chao, Wei', 'Do, Meilan', 'Sharer, Leroy R', 'Zhang, Hong', 'Arancio, Ottavio', 'Potash, Mary Jane', 'Volsky, David J']","['Kelschenbach J', 'He H', 'Kim BH', 'Borjabad A', 'Gu CJ', 'Chao W', 'Do M', 'Sharer LR', 'Zhang H', 'Arancio O', 'Potash MJ', 'Volsky DJ']",,"['Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Infectious Diseases Division, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA David.Volsky@mssm.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190702,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,,IM,"['AIDS Dementia Complex/*physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Behavior, Animal', 'Cognitive Dysfunction/*physiopathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hippocampus/*pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/*complications/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Viral Load']",PMC6606797,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.00591-19 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00591-19 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2019 Jul 2;10(4). pii: mBio.00591-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00591-19.,4,"['R01 NS094146/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH104145/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA037611/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA052844/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA017618/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Kelschenbach et al.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*EcoHIV', '*HAND', '*mouse models', '*radial arm water maze', '*synaptodendritic injury']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, molecular mechanisms that maintain self-renewal in CSCs versus non-CSCs are not yet clear. Here, we report that in a transgenic mouse model of MYC-induced T-cell leukemia, MYC, maintains self-renewal in Sca1(+) CSCs versus Sca-1(-) non-CSCs. MYC preferentially bound to the promoter and activated hypoxia-inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) in Sca-1(+) cells only. Furthermore, the reprogramming factors, Nanog and Sox2, facilitated MYC regulation of HIF2alpha in Sca-1(+) versus Sca-1(-) cells. Reduced expression of HIF2alpha inhibited the self-renewal of Sca-1(+) cells; this effect was blocked through suppression of ROS by N-acetyl cysteine or the knockdown of p53, Nanog, or Sox2. Similar results were seen in ABCG2(+) CSCs versus ABCG2(-) non-CSCs from primary human T-cell lymphoma. Thus, MYC maintains self-renewal exclusively in CSCs by selectively binding to the promoter and activating the HIF2alpha stemness pathway. Identification of this stemness pathway as a unique CSC determinant may have significant therapeutic implications. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings show that the HIF2alpha stemness pathway maintains leukemic stem cells downstream of MYC in human and mouse T-cell leukemias.

To overcome this limitation, we substituted the NK homeostatic factor IL-15 in 2 phase 1/2 trials. Forty-two patients received either intravenous (IV) (NCT01385423) or subcutaneous (SC) (NCT02395822) recombinant human IL-15 (rhIL-15) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy and haploidentical NK cells. Escalating doses of rhIL-15 (0.3-1.0 mug/kg) were given on 12 consecutive days in a phase 1 trial. Of 26 patients, 36% had robust in vivo NK-cell expansion at day 14, and 32% achieved complete remission. Hypothesizing that SC dosing of rhIL-15 would be safer and better tolerated, 16 patients received 10 once per day doses of SC rhIL-15 at 2.0 mug/kg on a phase 2 trial. NK-cell expansion at day 14 was seen in 27% of the patients, and 40% achieved remission. rhIL-15 induced better rates of in vivo NK-cell expansion and remission compared with previous trials with IL-2, but it was associated with previously unreported cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after SC but not IV dosing. CRS was observed in 56% of patients given SC rhIL-15 (with concurrent neurologic toxicity in 5 of 9 patients) and was responsive to steroids and tocilizumab.

DNA methyltransferases and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenases (TETs) function has been found altered in a variety of cancer types. RESULTS: Here, we report that in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) the MYC oncogene controls the expression of TET1 and TET2 to maintain 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) patterns, which is associated with tumor cell-specific gene expression. We found that cellular senescence and tumor regression upon MYC inactivation in T-ALL was associated with genome-wide changes in 5mC and 5hmC patterns. Correlating with the changes in DNA (hydroxy)methylation, we found that T-ALL overexpress TET1, while suppressing TET2 in a MYC-dependent fashion. Consequently, MYC inactivation led to an inverse expression pattern, decreasing TET1, while increasing TET2 levels. Knockdown of TET1 or ectopic expression of TET2 in T-ALL was associated with genome-wide changes in 5mC and 5hmC enrichment and decreased cell proliferation, suggesting a tumor promoting function of TET1, and a tumor suppressing role for TET2. Among the genes and pathways controlled by TET1, we found ribosomal biogenesis and translational control of protein synthesis highly enriched. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that MYC directly deregulates the expression of TET1 and TET2 in T-ALL provides novel evidence that MYC controls DNA (hydroxy)methylation in a genome-wide fashion. It reveals a coordinated interplay between the components of the DNA (de)methylating machinery that contribute to MYC-driven tumor maintenance, highlighting the potential of specific TET enzymes for therapeutic strategies.","['Poole, Candace J', 'Lodh, Atul', 'Choi, Jeong-Hyeon', 'van Riggelen, Jan']","['Poole CJ', 'Lodh A', 'Choi JH', 'van Riggelen J']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1811-587X'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Augusta University, 1410 Laney-Walker Blvd., Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Augusta University, 1410 Laney-Walker Blvd., Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, 1410 Laney-Walker Blvd., Augusta, GA, 30912, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Augusta University, 1410 Laney-Walker Blvd., Augusta, GA, 30912, USA. jvanriggelen@augusta.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190702,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (TET1 protein, mouse)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.- (TET1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosine/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6604319,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-019-0278-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13072-019-0278-5 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2019 Jul 2;12(1):41. doi: 10.1186/s13072-019-0278-5.,1,['Institutional Research Grant #IRG14-193-01/American Cancer Society/International'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA hydroxymethylation', '*DNA methylation', '*Leukemia/lymphoma', '*MYC', '*TET1', '*TET2']",,,,,,,,,,,

Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins (BRD2, BRD3, BRD4 and BRDT) are chromatin readers essential for maintaining proper gene transcription by specifically binding acetylated lysine residues. Targeted displacement of BET proteins from chromatin, using BET inhibitors (I-BETs), is a promising therapy, especially for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and evaluation of resistance mechanisms is necessary to optimize the clinical efficacy of these drugs. RESULTS: To uncover mechanisms of intrinsic I-BET resistance, we quantified chromatin binding and displacement for BRD2, BRD3 and BRD4 after dose response treatment with I-BET151, in sensitive and resistant in vitro models of leukemia, and mapped BET proteins/I-BET interactions genome wide using antibody- and compound-affinity capture methods followed by deep sequencing. The genome-wide map of BET proteins sensitivity to I-BET revealed a bimodal pattern of binding flanking transcription start sites (TSSs), in which drug-mediated displacement from chromatin primarily affects BRD4 downstream of the TSS and prolongs the pausing of RNA Pol II. Correlation of BRD4 binding and drug-mediated displacement at RNA Pol II pause sites with gene expression revealed a differential behavior of sensitive and resistant tumor cells to I-BET and identified a BRD4 signature at promoters of sensitive coding and non-coding genes. CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence that I-BET-induced shift of Pol II pausing at promoters via displacement of BRD4 is a determinant of intrinsic I-BET sensitivity. This finding may guide pharmacological treatment to enhance the clinical utility of such targeted therapies in AML and potentially other BET proteins-driven diseases.","['Khoueiry, P', 'Ward Gahlawat, A', 'Petretich, M', 'Michon, A M', 'Simola, D', 'Lam, E', 'Furlong, E E', 'Benes, V', 'Dawson, M A', 'Prinjha, R K', 'Drewes, G', 'Grandi, P']","['Khoueiry P', 'Ward Gahlawat A', 'Petretich M', 'Michon AM', 'Simola D', 'Lam E', 'Furlong EE', 'Benes V', 'Dawson MA', 'Prinjha RK', 'Drewes G', 'Grandi P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6337-1269'],"['Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Heidelberg, Germany. pk17@aub.edu.lb.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon. pk17@aub.edu.lb.', 'Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Target Science Computational Biology, GSK Medicines Research Centre, Upper Providence, USA.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, Australia.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Genome Biology Unit, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Genomics Core Facility, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Center, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Epigenetics DPU, GSK Medicines Research Centre, Stevenage, UK.', 'Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cellzome GmbH, a GSK Company, Heidelberg, Germany. paola.x.grandi@gsk.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190702,England,Epigenetics Chromatin,Epigenetics & chromatin,101471619,"['0 (BRD2 protein, human)', '0 (BRD3 protein, human)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (GSK1210151A)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Domains', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site']",PMC6604197,2019/07/04 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/04 06:00'],"['2019/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13072-019-0286-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13072-019-0286-5 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenetics Chromatin. 2019 Jul 2;12(1):39. doi: 10.1186/s13072-019-0286-5.,1,['282510/EU (FP7 Project BLUEPRINT/282510)/International'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bromodomain proteins', '*Leukemia', '*Promoters', '*Regulatory regions', '*Sensitivity and resistance to drug treatment', '*TSS']",,,,,,,,,,,

Venoms extracted from different species have many clinical applications such as antimicrobial cardiotonics and treatment of cancer. Aim of the study; In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of venoms extracted from R. schneideri and R. marina on cancer cells and verify possible mechanism of action. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Cytotoxicity analyses was performed using the resazurin reduction assay, where different concentrations of venoms were tested against sensitive CCRF-CEM and P-gp overexpressing ADR/CEM5000 leukemia cells. Programmed cell death was investigated using the flow cytometric annexin V/propidium iodide apoptosis assay. Furthermore, we analyzed flow cytometric cell cycle analyses of CCRF-CEM cells. Effect on tubulin formation was tested using molecular docking and fluorescence microscopy of U2OS-GFP-alpha-tubulin osteosarcoma cells treated for 24h with venoms. RESULTS: Cytotoxicity assays revealed a strong activity towards wild-type CCRF-CEM cells (IC50 values of 0.202+/-0.005mug/ml and 0.18+/-0.007mug/ml for R. schneideri and R. marina, respectively) and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000cells (IC50 0.403+/-0.084mug/ml and 0.32+/-0.077mug/ml for R. schneideri and R. marina, respectively). The venoms induced apoptosis as major mechanism of cell death. The venoms induced strong G2/M cell arrest in CCRF-CEM cells. We suggested tubulin as a major target for the venoms. In silico molecular docking of the major constituents of the venoms, i.e. bufalin, marinobufagin, telocinbufagin, hellebrigenin, showed strong binding affinities to tubulin. This result was verified in vitro. The venoms dysregulated microtubule arrangement of U2OS cells expressing GFP-labeled tubulin. Toxicity predictions by QSAR methodology highlighted the toxic features of bufadienolides. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated the importance of toad venoms as source of cytotoxic compounds that may serve as lead compounds for the development of novel anticancer drugs.","['Abdelfatah, Sara', 'Lu, Xiaohua', 'Schmeda-Hirschmann, Guillermo', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Abdelfatah S', 'Lu X', 'Schmeda-Hirschmann G', 'Efferth T']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, 55128, Germany.

However, the mechanism remains unclear at present. Herein, overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was found in the bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) from B-ALL patients developing resistance to vincristine (VCR), a chemotherapeutic agent. Two B-ALL cell lines Super B15 and CCRF-SB were cocultured with BMSCs transfected with lentivirus to regulate the expression of HO-1. Silencing HO-1 expression in BMSCs increased the apoptotic rates of B-ALL cell lines induced by VCR, whereas upregulating HO-1 expression reduced the rate. Cell cycle can be arrested in the G2/M phase by VCR. In contrast, B-ALL cells were arrested in the G0/G1 phase due to HO-1 overexpression in BMSCs, which avoided damage from the G2/M phase. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in BMSCs, as a key factor in the microenvironment-associated chemoresistance, was also positively coexpressed with HO-1. VEGF secretion was markedly increased in BMSCs with HO-1 upregulation but decreased in BMSCs with HO-1 silencing. B-ALL cell lines became resistant to VCR when cultured with VEGF recombinant protein, so VEGF secretion induced by HO-1 expression may promote the VCR resistance of B-ALL cells. As to the molecular mechanism, the PI3K/AKT pathway mediated regulation of VEGF by HO-1. In conclusion, this study clarifies a mechanism by which B-ALL is induced to resist VCR through HO-1 overexpression in BMSCs, and provides a novel strategy for overcoming VCR resistance in clinical practice.","['Yu, Kunlin', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Lu, Tingting', 'Ma, Dan', 'Wei, Danna', 'Guo, Yongling', 'Cheng, Bingqin', 'Wang, Weili', 'Fang, Qin']","['Yu K', 'Wang J', 'Lu T', 'Ma D', 'Wei D', 'Guo Y', 'Cheng B', 'Wang W', 'Fang Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0311-0208'],"['Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Centre of Guizhou Province, Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang, Guizhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190702,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', '*Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Oct;120(10):17791-17810. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29046.

Sixty specimens (15 normal and 45 cataracts) were stained immunohistochemically with BCL-2 and MCL-1 markers.Results: The expression of hsa-miR-15a was significantly increased (p = 0.003) in lens epithelial cells of cataract patients compared to the control group. BCL-2 and MCL-1 expression levels were significantly decreased in cataract patients (p < 0.001). A significant increase in hsa-miR-15a expression in the cortical subtype compared to the posterior subcapsular subtype (p = 0.003) and a significant decrease in BCL-2 and MCL-1 expressions in the cortical subtype compared to the nuclear and the posterior subcapsular subtype was detected.Conclusions: The increased expression of hsa-miR-15a in lens epithelial cells of cataract patients may repress the expression of BCL-2 and MCL-1. The expression of hsa-miR-15a and the subsequent apoptosis of lens epithelial cells are part of the pathogenesis of age-related cataracts.","['Abdullah, O A', 'El Gazzar, W B', 'Salem, T I', 'Elmohamady, M N', 'Nasif, S N', 'Eltaher, S M']","['Abdullah OA', 'El Gazzar WB', 'Salem TI', 'Elmohamady MN', 'Nasif SN', 'Eltaher SM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5172-1105'],"['Departments of Medical Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Benha, Egypt.', 'Departments of Medical Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Benha, Egypt.', 'Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Benha, Egypt.', 'Ophthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Benha, Egypt.', 'Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Benha, Egypt.', 'Community Medicine and Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Benha, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190814,England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Aging/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cataract/classification/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Lens, Crystalline/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/09674845.2019.1639337 [doi]', '10.1080/09674845.2019.1639337 [pii]']",ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 2019 Oct;76(4):184-189. doi: 10.1080/09674845.2019.1639337.

Using quantitative computed tomography, we assessed the impact of ALL therapy on bone, muscle, subcutaneous, and muscle-associated (MA) fat in 12 adolescents and young adults (AYA) treated for ALL as compared to a healthy control group without ALL (n = 116). AYA had a marked loss of muscle with a gain in MA fat between ALL diagnosis and end of induction. These changes persisted throughout intensive therapy. Lower bone and muscle and higher MA fat were also observed during and after treatment in comparison to controls. Altered lower extremity tissue distribution, specifically myosteatosis and sarcopenia, may contribute to functional declines and increased risk of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular diseases.","['Mueske, Nicole M', 'Mittelman, Steven D', 'Wren, Tishya A L', 'Gilsanz, Vicente', 'Orgel, Etan']","['Mueske NM', 'Mittelman SD', 'Wren TAL', 'Gilsanz V', 'Orgel E']",,"[""Children's Orthopaedic Center, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Center for Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""Children's Orthopaedic Center, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Children's Hospital Imaging Research Program, Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", 'Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190702,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adipose Tissue/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/*pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging/drug effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscle, Skeletal/diagnostic imaging/drug effects/*pathology/radiation effects', 'Muscular Diseases/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Sarcopenia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6923569,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1623889 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Dec;60(13):3146-3153. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1623889.

AML is a heterogeneous disease with recurrent cytogenetic and genomic abnormalities that define the disease biology and pathogenesis. Classification of the disease categories and their prognostication was updated in the past 2 years to reflect the most recent advances in understanding the complex disease biology of AML. This review highlights major updates in the World Health Organization classification, including cytogenetic re-classifications, provisional entities, and updates to the European Leukemia Net (ELN) AML risk group stratification. An overview of pivotal studies that used novel sequencing techniques to define the mutational landscape of AML is also provided. In these studies, mutations are classified into subgroups based on functional pathways and are used to understand various interactions and mutual exclusivity of some mutations, suggesting important roles in disease evolution and AML pathogenesis. The complex interactions between mutations can dictate outcomes as well as possibly predict disease phenotypes after correcting for clinical variables. CONCLUSION: Genomic testing in AML using next generation sequencing has become widely available and a new standard of care for all patients.

Retrospective single-centre study.,,10.23736/S0026-4946.19.05494-X [doi],"BACKROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is seen in almost 30% of cases of cancer among children. Drop in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) and immunosuppression during chemotherapy are causing the significant increase in the risk of other complications, which can lead to prolonged hospitalization, higher costs of therapy and increased mortality. METHODS: The analysis concerned 78 patients treated for ALL at the Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology. The indications for the use of immunoglobulins, the regimen of administration, the dose and adverse reactions were analyzed. RESULTS: IVIG was used in 66 (85%) of 78 patients. The standard risk group (SR) was represented by 10 (15%) patients, intermediate (IR) - 29 (44%), and high (HR) - 27 (41%). The most common were 1 and 2-day administrations - 60% and 28%, respectively, of transfusions. The spread of the IVIG doses used ranged from 43 mg to 882 mg/kg body weight. In the SR and IR groups, preparations were transfused at the reinduction stage, while in the HR- consolidation. Among the indications for IVIG, the most common was hypogammaglobulinemia-117 (42%), neutropenia-69 (25%) and infection-62 (22%). During the implementation of 279 patterns of immunoglobulin preparations, 8 (3%) post-transfusion reactions were registered. CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of ALL patients required immunoglobulin substitution during polychemotherapy. The supply of preparations is safe, however, there are no unambiguous guidelines regarding their dosage.","['Jowik, Katarzyna', 'Marciniak-Stepak, Patrycja', 'Derwich, Katarzyna']","['Jowik K', 'Marciniak-Stepak P', 'Derwich K']",,"[""Student's Scientific Association at the Department of Pediatric Oncology Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland - katarzynajowikk@gmail.com."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Transplantology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190628,Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,,,,,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/03 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['S0026-4946.19.05494-X [pii]', '10.23736/S0026-4946.19.05494-X [doi]']",aheadofprint,Minerva Pediatr. 2019 Jun 28. pii: S0026-4946.19.05494-X. doi: 10.23736/S0026-4946.19.05494-X.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The oncogenic microRNA cluster miR-17-92 modulates multiple cellular processes, including survival, proliferation, and apoptosis. However, the role of miR-17-92 and its regulation has not yet been documented for APL. METHODS: We analyzed miR-17-92 expression in APL samples and cell lines by qRT-PCR. The expression of c-Myc was measured by western blot. Cell differentiation was assessed by measuring the surface CD11b antigen expression by flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: We observed that miR-17-92 was upregulated in APL compared with healthy donors. Furthermore, we demonstrated that expressions of c-Myc and miR-17-92 are markedly suppressed during ATRA-induced NB4 cell differentiation. Importantly, we also demonstrated that miR-17-92 is directly regulated by c-Myc during the granulocytic differentiation of APL cells. Finally, the overexpression of miR-17-5p blocks ATRA-induced differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: We report abnormal expression of the miR-17-92 cluster in APL cells, which is responsible for the differentiation block in blast cells in APL. In addition, we identified miR-17-92 as a target gene of c-Myc during ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation.","['Yu, Xibao', 'Hu, Yanyun', 'Wu, Yifan', 'Fang, Chunsheng', 'Lai, Jing', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Li, Yangqiu', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Zeng, Yixin']","['Yu X', 'Hu Y', 'Wu Y', 'Fang C', 'Lai J', 'Chen S', 'Li Y', 'Zeng C', 'Zeng Y']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0974-4036', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1333-3918']","['Department of Experimental Research, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Experimental Research, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190701,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIR17HG, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.13225 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2019 Dec;15(6):364-370. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13225.

The OS five-year survival rate remains very low. Thus, novel therapeutic protocols for the treatment of OS are needed. Several approaches targeting deregulated signaling pathways have been proposed. The antitumoral effects of polyphenols, which are naturally occurring compounds with potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, have been investigated in different tumors. Gossypol, which is a natural polyphenolic aldehyde isolated from the seeds of the cotton plant, has been shown to exert antitumoral activity in leukemia and lymphoma and in breast, head and neck, colon and prostate cancers. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of AT-101, which is the (-) enantiomer and more active form of gossypol, on the growth of human and murine OS cells in vitro and in vivo. Several clinical trials employing AT-101 have been performed, and some clinical trials are ongoing. Our results showed for the first time that AT-101 significantly inhibits OS cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner, inducing apoptosis and necrosis and partially activating autophagy. Our results demonstrated that AT-101 inhibits prosurvival signaling pathways depending on Akt, p38 MAPK and JNK. In addition, treatment with AT-101 increases the survival of OS-bearing mice. Overall, these results suggest that AT-101 is a candidate chemo-supportive molecule for the development of novel chemotherapeutic protocols for the treatment of OS.","['Masuelli, Laura', 'Benvenuto, Monica', 'Izzi, Valerio', 'Zago, Erika', 'Mattera, Rosanna', 'Cerbelli, Bruna', 'Potenza, Vito', 'Fazi, Sara', 'Ciuffa, Sara', 'Tresoldi, Ilaria', 'Lucarelli, Enrico', 'Modesti, Andrea', 'Bei, Roberto']","['Masuelli L', 'Benvenuto M', 'Izzi V', 'Zago E', 'Mattera R', 'Cerbelli B', 'Potenza V', 'Fazi S', 'Ciuffa S', 'Tresoldi I', 'Lucarelli E', 'Modesti A', 'Bei R']",,"['Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Sapienza"", 00164, Rome, Italy. laura.masuelli@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Oulu Center for Cell-Matrix Research, University of Oulu, FIN-90014, Oulu, Finland.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Sapienza"", 00164, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Medico-Surgical Sciences and Biotechnologies, Polo Pontino-Sapienza University, 04100, Latina, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Rome ""Sapienza"", 00164, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Osteoarticolar Regeneration Laboratory, IRCCS, Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli, 40136, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Translational Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", 00133, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190702,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyphenols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Bone Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Osteosarcoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Polyphenols/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-019-00827-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-019-00827-y [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2020 Jun;38(3):675-689. doi: 10.1007/s10637-019-00827-y.

METHODS: The workshop panel assigned 98 submitted cases to the category of non-acute leukemia myeloid neoplasms, of which 13 were selected for oral presentation. RESULTS: Data from both conventional karyotyping and genetic sequencing had important impact on diagnosis, classification, and prognostication. However, some cases had genetic results that appeared discordant from the morphology and/or clinical features. Thus, the workshop underscored the need for careful management of genetic data by the pathologist and clinician, in the context of other findings. CONCLUSIONS: The workshop cases highlighted the significance of genetic aberrations in the diagnosis and treatment of non-acute leukemia myeloid neoplasms. Many genetic data have already been incorporated in the most recent World Health Organization classification, and undoubtedly they will factor increasingly in future classifications.","['Hasserjian, Robert P', 'Kelley, Todd W', 'Weinberg, Olga K', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Fend, Falko']","['Hasserjian RP', 'Kelley TW', 'Weinberg OK', 'Morgan EA', 'Fend F']",,"['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.', 'Navican Genomics, Salt Lake City, UT.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pathology and Neuropathology.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Care, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['5526933 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz069 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Aug 1;152(3):302-321. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz069.,3,,,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Case report and review of literature.,249-254,,"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) represents the most common malignancy in children with an overall cure rate of 85%. Relapses occur in 20% of the cases. Commonly, extramedullary relapses (EMRs) involve central nervous system (CNS) or testes. Unusual EMRs in ALL are relatively rare reported. CASE PRESENTATION: The authors present a 24-year-old woman with ALL, who experienced three unusual EMRs. In 2007, she was diagnosed with B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL - high-risk (HR) group, and she was treated according to ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (IC-BFM) 2002HR Protocol. She entered complete remission (CR). In 2012, a vaginal wall solid mass infiltrate occurs. Biopsy concluded for EMR of ALL. Chemotherapy was restarted; the patient responded again with CR. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomographycomputed tomography (PETCT) examinations during follow-up revealed supraclavicular, mesenteric, and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathies (2014). Pathological examination of the supraclavicular lymph node showed a benign pattern: schwannoma. The patient's evolution worsened, imposing a biopsy from the retroperitoneal tumor which revealed a second EMR of ALL. Again, ALL-REZ BFM 2002 Protocol was started, followed by haploidentical mother-to-child peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). After suffering a few managed complications related to the transplant, our patient achieved CR again. In 2017, 10 years after the initial diagnosis, the patient presented for the third time an EMR (gastric wall) and eventually died due to progression of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: The patient presented an extremely aggressive type of ALL with three unusual EMRs: vaginal, retroperitoneal and gastric.","['Sava, Cristian Nicolae', 'Ritli, Ladislau', 'Balmos, Andreea Bianca', 'Iuhas, Alin Remus', 'Marian, Paula', 'Motorca, Monica Adriana', 'Lele, Laura Anca', 'Straciuc, Oreste', 'Zaha, Dana Carmen', 'Jurca, Maria Claudia', 'Niulas, Larisa', 'Negrut, Nicoleta']","['Sava CN', 'Ritli L', 'Balmos AB', 'Iuhas AR', 'Marian P', 'Motorca MA', 'Lele LA', 'Straciuc O', 'Zaha DC', 'Jurca MC', 'Niulas L', 'Negrut N']",,"['Department of Medical Disciplines, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, University of Oradea, Romania; cristian.sava2004@gmail.com; Department of Preclinical Disciplines, Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy, University of Oradea, Romania; claudiajurca70@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Romania,Rom J Morphol Embryol,Romanian journal of morphology and embryology = Revue roumaine de morphologie et embryologie,9112454,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['600119249254 [pii]'],ppublish,Rom J Morphol Embryol. 2019;60(1):249-254.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not all patients by this remission criterion achieve long-term remission and a subset relapse. This relapse is explained by the presence of measurable residual disease (MRD). Methods: We accrued 451 consecutive patients of adult AML (from March 2012 to December 2017) after informed consent. All patients received standard chemotherapy. MRD testing was done at post-induction and, if feasible, post-consolidation using 8- and later 10-color FCM. Analysis of MRD was done using a combination of difference from normal and leukemia-associated immunophenotype approaches. Conventional karyotyping and FISH were done as per standard recommendations, and patients were classified into favorable, intermediate, and poor cytogenetic risk groups. The presence of FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations was detected by a fragment length analysis-based assay. Results: As compared to Western data, our cohort of patients was younger with a median age of 35 years. There were 62 induction deaths in this cohort (13.7%), and 77 patients (17.1%) were not in morphological remission. The median follow-up was 26.0 months. Poor-risk cytogenetics and the presence of FLT3-ITD were significantly associated with inferior outcome. The presence of post-induction MRD assessment was significantly associated with adverse outcome with respect to OS (p = 0.01) as well as RFS (p = 0.004). Among established genetic subgroups, detection of MRD in intermediate cytogenetic and NPM1 mutated groups was also highly predictive of inferior outcome. On multivariate analysis, immunophenotypic MRD at the end of induction and FLT3-ITD emerged as independent prognostic factors predictive for outcome. Conclusion: This is the first data from a resource-constrained real-world setting demonstrating the utility of AML MRD as well as long-term outcome of AML. Our data is in agreement with other studies that determination of MRD is extremely important in predicting outcome. AML MRD is a very useful guide for guiding post-remission strategies in AML and should be incorporated into routine treatment algorithms.","['Patkar, Nikhil', 'Kakirde, Chinmayee', 'Bhanshe, Prasanna', 'Joshi, Swapnali', 'Chaudhary, Shruti', 'Badrinath, Yajamanam', 'Ghoghale, Sitaram', 'Deshpande, Nilesh', 'Kadechkar, Shraddha', 'Chatterjee, Gaurav', 'Kannan, Sadhana', 'Shetty, Dhanalaxmi', 'Gokarn, Anant', 'Punatkar, Sachin', 'Bonda, Avinash', 'Nayak, Lingaraj', 'Jain, Hasmukh', 'Bagal, Bhausaheb', 'Menon, Hari', 'Sengar, Manju', 'Khizer, Syed Hasan', 'Khattry, Navin', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Gujral, Sumeet', 'Subramanian, Papagudi']","['Patkar N', 'Kakirde C', 'Bhanshe P', 'Joshi S', 'Chaudhary S', 'Badrinath Y', 'Ghoghale S', 'Deshpande N', 'Kadechkar S', 'Chatterjee G', 'Kannan S', 'Shetty D', 'Gokarn A', 'Punatkar S', 'Bonda A', 'Nayak L', 'Jain H', 'Bagal B', 'Menon H', 'Sengar M', 'Khizer SH', 'Khattry N', 'Tembhare P', 'Gujral S', 'Subramanian P']",,"['Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Biostatistics, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haemato-Oncology, CyteCare Cancer Hospital, Bangalore, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Adult Haematolymphoid Disease Management Group, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Haematopathology Laboratory, ACTREC, Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190613,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6584962,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/03 06:01,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00450 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jun 13;9:450. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00450. eCollection 2019.,,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'IA/CPHI/14/1/501485/WTDBT_/DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance/India']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML MRD', 'FCM MRD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'measurable residual disease', 'real-world data AML']",,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, Dakahlia (one of the largest Egyptian governorates) was not integrated in the National Cancer Registry Program. This research aimed to acquire malignancy rates from the Oncology Center of Mansoura University, which is one of the two oncology centers present in Dakalia Governorate in Egypt. Methods: Electronic records of patients who attended the Oncology Center of Mansoura University during 2016 were accessed with permission. Analysis was performed to extract diagnostic categories (age, gender, and geographic distribution of cases). Results: Most commonly diagnosed malignancies were breast cancer which represented about 10% of cases in the Oncology Center of Mansoura University during 2016. This was followed by leukemia (3.80%), lymphoma (3.59%), and liver cancer (3.44%). Diagnoses encountered included benign and malignant tumors as well as non-tumor diagnoses.

He received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation due to high-risk hypodiploid ALL. Around the time of engraftment, he developed severe diarrhea following high-grade fever and erythema. Although methylprednisolone pulse therapy was added to tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, diarrhea progressed up to 5000~6000 ml/day and brought about hypocalcemia, hypoalbuminemia, and edema. Daily fresh frozen plasma (FFP), albumin, and calcium replacements were required to maintain blood circulation. After aGVHD was confirmed by colonoscopic biopsy, MSC therapy was administered. The patient received 8 biweekly intravenous infusions of 2x10(6) hMSCs/kg for 4 weeks, after which additional 4 weekly infusions were performed. A few weeks after initiation, diarrhea gradually resolved, and at the eighth dose of hMSC, lab data improved without replacements. MSC therapy successfully treated steroid-refractory gastrointestinal GVHD without complications. Despite life-threatening diarrhea, the regeneration potential of children and adolescents undergoing SMC therapy successfully supports restoration of gastrointestinal damage. Even with its high treatment costs, SMC therapy should be proactively considered in cases where young patients suffer from severe gastrointestinal GVHD.","['Moritani, Kyoko', 'Miyawaki, Reiji', 'Tokuda, Kiriko', 'Ochi, Fumihiro', 'Eguchi-Ishimae, Minenori', 'Tauchi, Hisamichi', 'Eguchi, Mariko', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Nagai, Kozo']","['Moritani K', 'Miyawaki R', 'Tokuda K', 'Ochi F', 'Eguchi-Ishimae M', 'Tauchi H', 'Eguchi M', 'Ishii E', 'Nagai K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4242-7008', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6998-279X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5267-3504']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime Prefectural Central Hospital, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190521,United States,Case Rep Transplant,Case reports in transplantation,101591863,,,,PMC6556259,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/03 06:01,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/7890673 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Transplant. 2019 May 21;2019:7890673. doi: 10.1155/2019/7890673. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The past decades have witnessed great progress in the core machinery orchestrating ciliary assembly. However, the upstream epigenetic cues that direct ciliogenesis remain elusive. Herein, we demonstrate that mixed-lineage leukemia protein 2 (MLL2), a histone methyltransferase, plays a negative role in ciliogenesis. RNA-sequencing analysis reveals that the expression of five actin-associated proteins is significantly downregulated in MLL2-depleted cells. Overexpression of these proteins partially rescues ciliary abnormality elicited by MLL2 depletion. Our data also show that actin dynamics is remarkably changed in MLL2-depleted cells, resulting in the impairment of cell adhesion, spreading, and motility. In addition, MLL2 depletion promotes ciliary vesicle trafficking to the basal body in an actin-related manner. Together, these results reveal that MLL2 inhibits ciliogenesis by modulating actin dynamics and vesicle transport, and suggest that alteration of MLL2 may contribute to the pathogenesis of cilium-associated diseases.","['Yang, Yang', 'Hao, Huijie', 'Wu, Xiaofan', 'Guo, Song', 'Liu, Yang', 'Ran, Jie', 'Li, Te', 'Li, Dengwen', 'Liu, Min', 'Zhou, Jun']","['Yang Y', 'Hao H', 'Wu X', 'Guo S', 'Liu Y', 'Ran J', 'Li T', 'Li D', 'Liu M', 'Zhou J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7858-8260'],"['1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '2Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong 250014 China.grid.410585.d', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '2Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong 250014 China.grid.410585.d', '1State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, Key Laboratory of Bioactive Materials of the Ministry of Education, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Protein Science, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071 China.0000 0000 9878 7032grid.216938.7', '2Shandong Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Resistance Biology, Collaborative Innovation Center of Cell Biology in Universities of Shandong, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, College of Life Sciences, Shandong Normal University, Jinan, Shandong 250014 China.grid.410585.d']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190625,England,Cell Discov,Cell discovery,101661034,,,,PMC6591415,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/03 06:01,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41421-019-0100-3 [doi]', '100 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Discov. 2019 Jun 25;5:33. doi: 10.1038/s41421-019-0100-3. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Actin', 'Cilia']",['Conflict of interestThe authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

These mutations mostly act to deregulate gene expression by various mechanisms at the level of the nucleus. By performing genome-wide epigenetic profiling of cis-regulatory elements, we found that AML encompasses different mutation-specific subclasses associated with the rewiring of the gene regulatory networks that drive differentiation into different directions away from normal myeloid development. By integrating epigenetic profiles with gene expression and chromatin conformation data, we defined pathways within gene regulation networks that were differentially rewired within each mutation-specific subclass of AML. This analysis revealed 2 major classes of AML: one class defined by mutations in signaling molecules that activate AP-1 via the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and a second class defined by mutations within genes encoding transcription factors such as RUNX1/CBFbeta and C/EBPalpha. By identifying specific DNA motifs protected from DNase I digestion at cis-regulatory elements, we were able to infer candidate transcription factors bound to these motifs. These integrated analyses allowed the identification of AML subtype-specific core regulatory networks that are required for AML development and maintenance, which could now be targeted in personalized therapies.","['Assi, Salam A', 'Bonifer, Constanze', 'Cockerill, Peter N']","['Assi SA', 'Bonifer C', 'Cockerill PN']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4410-8174'],"['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20190625,United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,,PMC6595639,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/03 06:01,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1176935119859863 [doi]', '10.1177_1176935119859863 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Inform. 2019 Jun 25;18:1176935119859863. doi: 10.1177/1176935119859863. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AP-1', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'CEBPA', 'DNA mutation', 'DNase', 'FLT3', 'RUNX1', 'gene expression', 'gene regulation', 'network', 'transcription factor']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,['Nat Genet. 2019 Jan;51(1):151-162.

Patients treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) alone experience relapse, while patients treated with ATRA and arsenic trioxide (ATO) are often relapse-free. This suggests sustained changes have been elicited by the combination therapy. To understand the lasting effects of the combination therapy, we compared the effects of ATRA and ATO on NB4 and ATRA-resistant NB4-MR2 APL cells during treatment versus post treatment termination. After treatment termination, NB4 cells treated with ATRA or ATO reverted to non-differentiated cells, while combination-treated cells remained terminally differentiated. This effect was diminished in NB4-MR2 cells. This suggests combination treatment induced more permanent changes. Combination treatment induced higher expression of target genes (e.g., transglutaminase 2 and retinoic acid receptor beta), which in NB4 cells was sustained post treatment termination. To determine whether sustained epigenetic changes were responsible, we quantified the enrichment of histone modifications by chromatin immunoprecipitation, and CpG methylation by bisulfite-pyrosequencing. While ATRA and combination treatment induced similar histone acetylation enrichment, combination treatment induced greater demethylation of target genes, which was sustained. Therefore, sustained demethylation of target genes by ATRA and ATO combination treatment is associated with lasting differentiation and gene expression changes.","['Huynh, Thomas T', 'Sultan, Mohammad', 'Vidovic, Dejan', 'Dean, Cheryl A', 'Cruickshank, Brianne M', 'Lee, Kristen', 'Loung, Chao-Yu', 'Holloway, Ryan W', 'Hoskin, David W', 'Waisman, David M', 'Weaver, Ian C G', 'Marcato, Paola']","['Huynh TT', 'Sultan M', 'Vidovic D', 'Dean CA', 'Cruickshank BM', 'Lee K', 'Loung CY', 'Holloway RW', 'Hoskin DW', 'Waisman DM', 'Weaver ICG', 'Marcato P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8709-8941'],"['Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. ian.weaver@dal.ca.', 'Department of Psychology and Neuroscience, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. ian.weaver@dal.ca.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. ian.weaver@dal.ca.', 'Brain Repair Centre, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. ian.weaver@dal.ca.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. paola.marcato@dal.ca.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada. paola.marcato@dal.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190701,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chemokine CCL2/genetics/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', 'Demethylation/*drug effects', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/drug effects', 'Transglutaminases/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC6602962,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-45982-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-45982-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jul 1;9(1):9414. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-45982-7.,1,"['MOP-130304/CIHR/Canada', 'PJT-162313/CIHR/Canada']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Signaling responses that involve TNF-alpha are context dependent and capable of stimulating pathways promoting both cell death and survival. TNF-alpha treatment has been investigated as part of a combined therapy for acute myeloid leukemia due to its modifying effects on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediated differentiation into granulocytes. To investigate the interaction between cellular differentiation and TNF-alpha, we performed RNA-sequencing on two forms of the human HL-60/S4 promyelocytic leukemia cell line treated with TNF-alpha. The ATRA-differentiated granulocytic form of HL-60/S4 cells had an enhanced transcriptional response to TNF-alpha treatment compared to the undifferentiated promyelocytes. The observed TNF-alpha responses included differential expression of cell cycle gene sets, which were generally upregulated in TNF-alpha treated promyelocytes, and downregulated in TNF-alpha treated granulocytes. This is consistent with TNF-alpha induced cell cycle repression in granulocytes and cell cycle progression in promyelocytes. Moreover, we found evidence that TNF-alpha treatment of granulocytes shifts the transcriptome toward that of a macrophage. We conclude that TNF-alpha treatment promotes a divergent transcriptional program in promyelocytes and granulocytes. TNF-alpha promotes cell cycle associated gene expression in promyelocytes. In contrast, TNF-alpha stimulated granulocytes have reduced cell cycle gene expression, and a macrophage-like transcriptional program.","['Jacobson, Elsie C', 'Jain, Lekha', 'Vickers, Mark H', 'Olins, Ada L', 'Olins, Donald E', 'Perry, Jo K', ""O'Sullivan, Justin M""]","['Jacobson EC', 'Jain L', 'Vickers MH', 'Olins AL', 'Olins DE', 'Perry JK', ""O'Sullivan JM""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6094-5490', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4876-9356', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4418-947X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2927-450X']","['Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.', 'University of New England, Portland, ME.', 'University of New England, Portland, ME.', 'Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand j.perry@auckland.ac.nz justin.osullivan@auckland.ac.nz.', 'Liggins Institute, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand j.perry@auckland.ac.nz justin.osullivan@auckland.ac.nz.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190808,England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', '*Genes, cdc', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",PMC6686940,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['g3.119.400361 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.119.400361 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2019 Aug 8;9(8):2775-2786. doi: 10.1534/g3.119.400361.,8,,,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Jacobson et al.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell cycle', '*Cytokine', '*Differentiation', '*Gene regulation', '*Leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recent works have demonstrated anticancer properties of the FDA-approved drug ribavirin, a synthetic guanosine analogue and antiviral molecule used over the past four decades for the treatment of hepatitis C. The efficacy of ribavirin in cancer has been explored through several preclinical models and ongoing clinical trials in multiple cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia, oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and metastatic breast cancer. In this review, we summarize the role of ribavirin as an antiviral medication and focus our attention on its recent use as an antitumoral agent. We highlight current knowledge of the potential use and mechanisms of action of ribavirin in cancer. Because current therapeutics for patients with cancer still fail to cure, introducing new forms of treatment is essential. Converging evidence suggests that ribavirin represents a promising addition to a generation of newly repurposed safe and effective anticancer agents.","['Casaos, Joshua', 'Gorelick, Noah L', 'Huq, Sakibul', 'Choi, John', 'Xia, Yuanxuan', 'Serra, Riccardo', 'Felder, Raphael', 'Lott, Tarik', 'Kast, Richard E', 'Suk, Ian', 'Brem, Henry', 'Tyler, Betty', 'Skuli, Nicolas']","['Casaos J', 'Gorelick NL', 'Huq S', 'Choi J', 'Xia Y', 'Serra R', 'Felder R', 'Lott T', 'Kast RE', 'Suk I', 'Brem H', 'Tyler B', 'Skuli N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5162-5903'],"['Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'IIAIGC Study Center, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Oncology, Ophthalmology, Biomedical Engineering, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. btyler@jhmi.edu.', 'Hunterian Neurosurgical Research Laboratory, Department of Neurosurgery, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Ribavirin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']","['18/7/1185 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0666 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Jul;18(7):1185-1194. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0666.,7,,,,['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

His cytogenetic analysis showed the t(9;22) translocation generating the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph), with a multiplex RT-PCR detecting an atypical fragment. Using two primers complementary to exon 10 of BCR and exon 4 of ABL1, a larger PCR product was observed, where after Sanger sequencing, an e13a3 BCR-ABL1 transcript was revealed. Given the diagnosis, the patient received 100 mg of dasatinib every other day and was then monitored by measuring both hematological and cytogenetic parameters, while his BCR-ABL1 transcripts were examined by PCR and semi-nested-PCR. According to the 2013 European Leukemia Network criteria, after six months of dasatinib the patient's response was classified as warning as he displayed 20% of Philadelphia-positive metaphases. Sequencing of the ABL1 catalytic domain did not detect point mutations. A complete cytogenetic response was achieved after one year of dasatinib. However, semi-nested-PCR confirmed the presence of the e13a3 BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript that has persisted up to the latest follow-up visit.","['Massimino, Michele', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Tirro, Elena', 'Consoli, Maria Letizia', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Puma, Adriana', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Zammit, Valentina', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'DI Raimondo, Francesco', 'Manzella, Livia']","['Massimino M', 'Stella S', 'Tirro E', 'Consoli ML', 'Pennisi MS', 'Puma A', 'Vitale SR', 'Romano C', 'Zammit V', 'Stagno F', 'DI Raimondo F', 'Manzella L']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy michedot@yahoo.it.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

About 5-10% of newly diagnosed patients in chronic-phase (CP) CML show complex additional chromosomal aberrations (ACA), that may involve one or more chromosomes in addition to 9 and 22. Data concerning the prognostic significance of ACA in CP-CML subjects at diagnosis are controversial. Furthermore, there is no evidence showing that selection of imatinib (IM) or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (2G-TKI) would be of benefit for these patients. CASE REPORT: We report the three-way complex variant translocation t(2;9;22) in a CP-CML patient. Conventional cytogenetic analysis was employed to identify the ACA. Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR was used to identify the BCR-ABL1 transcript and its levels were measured using quantitative real-time-PCR. This rare ACA t(2;9;22) in our young patient displayed primary resistance to IM, but was responsive to second-line treatment with nilotinib. CONCLUSION: CP-CML patients exhibiting this rare aberration at diagnosis may benefit from a 2G-TKI therapy compared to IM.","['Tirro, Elena', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Zammit, Valentina', 'Consoli, Maria Letizia', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Pirosa, Maria Cristina', 'Martino, Enrica', 'DI Gregorio, Sandra', 'Puma, Adriana', 'DI Raimondo, Franscesco', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Stagno, Fabio']","['Tirro E', 'Massimino M', 'Stella S', 'Zammit V', 'Consoli ML', 'Pennisi MS', 'Vitale SR', 'Romano C', 'Pirosa MC', 'Martino E', 'DI Gregorio S', 'Puma A', 'DI Raimondo F', 'Manzella L', 'Stagno F']",,"['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy ele_tir@yahoo.it.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, A.O.U.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity was analyzed by trypan blue staining, apoptosis - by Annexin V test, and oxidative stress - by the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protein-carbonyl products. RESULTS: Incubation of resveratrol in combination with the majority of anticancer drugs resulted in higher toxicity than resveratrol or drug alone. In the case of leukemic lymphocytes treated with barasertib and everolimus in the presence of resveratrol, synergistic cytotoxicity was accompanied by strong induction of apoptosis, increased levels of hydroperoxides and insignificant changes in protein-carbonyl products. None of these parameters changed in normal lymphocytes. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol is a promising supplementary compound for anticancer therapy, that may allow reduction of the therapeutic doses of barasertib and everolimus, minimizing their side-effects.","['Ivanova, Donika', 'Zhelev, Zhivko', 'Semkova, Severina', 'Aoki, Ichio', 'Bakalova, Rumiana']","['Ivanova D', 'Zhelev Z', 'Semkova S', 'Aoki I', 'Bakalova R']",,"['Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Medical Faculty, Trakia University, Stara Zagora, Bulgaria.', 'Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Institute of Biophysics and Biomedical Engineering, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Chiba, Japan.', 'Group of Quantum-state Controlled MRI, Institute for Quantum Life Science, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Chiba, Japan.', 'Group of Quantum-state Controlled MRI, Institute for Quantum Life Science, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Imaging and Theranostics, National Institute of Radiological Sciences (NIRS), Chiba, Japan bakalova.rumiana@qst.go.jp.', 'Group of Quantum-state Controlled MRI, Institute for Quantum Life Science, National Institutes for Quantum and Radiological Science and Technology (QST), Chiba, Japan.', 'Medical Faculty, Sofia University ""St. Kliment Ohridski"", Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protective Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Protective Agents/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['39/7/3745 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13523 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Jul;39(7):3745-3755. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13523.,7,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'apoptosis', 'chemotherapy', 'oxidative stress', 'resveratrol']",,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate whether amentoflavone may induce toxicity effect of bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Herein, we evaluated amentoflavone effects in a human bladder cancer cell line TSGH8301 in vitro. RESULTS: Amentoflavone caused significant cytotoxicity in TSGH8301 cells at a concentration as low as 200 muM. FAS/FASL-dependent extrinsic apoptosis and mitochondria-dependent intrinsic apoptosis were observed in amentoflavone-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner. Levels of several proapoptotic proteins, such as FAS, FAS-ligand and BAX (B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X) were increased following amentoflavone treatment. Meanwhile, anti-apoptotic MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) and cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP) protein levels were reduced. Additionally, angiogenesis and proliferation-related proteins, including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, -9, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), urokinase-type plasminogen actvator (uPA) and cyclin D1 were diminished by amentoflavone. CONCLUSION: Amentoflavone induced toxicity of bladder cancer by inhibiting tumor progression and inducing apoptosis signaling transduction.","['Chiang, Chih-Hung', 'Yeh, Ching-Yi', 'Chung, Jing Gung', 'Chiang, I-Tsang', 'Hsu, Fei-Ting']","['Chiang CH', 'Yeh CY', 'Chung JG', 'Chiang IT', 'Hsu FT']",,"['Department of Urology, Medical Research and Education, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Yuan-Shan/Su-Ao Branch, Yilan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Nursing, Cardinal Tien Junior College of Healthcare and Management, New Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Urology, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Nursing, Taipei Veteran General Hospital, Yuan-Shan/Su-Ao Branch, Yilan, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, R.O.C. sakiro920@gmail.com john740604@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C. sakiro920@gmail.com john740604@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biflavonoids)', '0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9I1VC79L77 (amentoflavone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biflavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['39/7/3641 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13512 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Jul;39(7):3641-3649. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13512.,7,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Amentoflavone', 'anti-apoptotic', 'extrinsic apoptosis', 'intrinsic apoptosis', 'metastasis']",,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the antileukemic effect of simultaneous inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), another enzyme involved in the thymidylate biosynthesis cycle, and CK2 in CCRF-CEM acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The influence of combined treatment on apoptosis and cell-cycle progression, as well as the endocellular level of DHFR protein and inhibition of CK2 were determined using flow cytometry and western blot analysis, respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the influence of silmitasertib (CX-4945), a selective inhibitor of CK2 on the expression of DHFR and TYMS genes. RESULTS: The synergistic effect was correlated with the increase of annexin V-binding cell fraction, caspase 3/7 activation and a significant reduce in the activity of CK2. An increase of DHFR protein level was observed in CCRF-CEM cells after CX-4945 treatment, with the mRNA level remaining relatively constant. CONCLUSION: The obtained results demonstrate a possibility to improve methotrexate-based anti-leukemia therapy by simultaneous inhibition of CK2. The effect of CK2 inhibition on DHFR expression suggests the important regulatory role of CK2-mediated phosphorylation of DHFR inside cells.","['Winska, Patrycja', 'Widlo, Lukasz', 'Skierka, Katarzyna', 'Krzysko, Alicja', 'Koronkiewicz, Miroslawa', 'Ciesla, Jaroslaw M', 'Ciesla, Joanna', 'Bretner, Maria']","['Winska P', 'Widlo L', 'Skierka K', 'Krzysko A', 'Koronkiewicz M', 'Ciesla JM', 'Ciesla J', 'Bretner M']",,"['Chair of Drug and Cosmetics Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland pwinska@ch.pw.edu.pl.', 'Chair of Drug and Cosmetics Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Chair of Drug and Cosmetics Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Chair of Drug and Cosmetics Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Drug Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, National Medicines Institute, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Chair of Drug and Cosmetics Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Chair of Drug and Cosmetics Biotechnology, Faculty of Chemistry, Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Phenazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'C6RWP0N0L2 (silmitasertib)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CSNK2A1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Naphthyridines/*pharmacology', 'Phenazines', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['39/7/3531 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13499 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Jul;39(7):3531-3542. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13499.,7,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'CX-4945', 'dihydrofolate reductase', 'methotrexate', 'protein kinase CK2', 'synergism']",,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to investigate the cytotoxicity of five adrenergic agonists against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), glioblastoma, promyelocytic leukemia, and normal oral mesenchymal cells (gingival fibroblast, pulp cell, periodontal ligament fibroblast) and normal epidermal keratinocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tumor-specificity (TS) was calculated by the ratio between the mean 50% cytotoxic concentration against normal cells to that of tumor cells. Internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was detected using agarose gel electrophoresis. Caspase-3 activity was measured by substrate cleavage. RESULTS: Both cytotoxicity and tumor-specificity of adrenergic agonists against OSCC cell lines was in the order of isoprenaline>dexmedetomidine> adrenaline>clonidine and phenylephrine. Isoprenaline and dexmedetomidine did not induce apoptosis markers, such as internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation, but induced a smear pattern of DNA fragmentation in OSCC cell lines. Their cytotoxicity was not reduced by pretreatment with autophagy inhibitors, or by adrenoceptors antagonists. Addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase significantly reduced the cytotoxicity of isoprenaline, but not that of dexmedetomidine. CONCLUSION: Isoprenaline and dexmedetomidine induce non-apoptotic cell death by different mechanisms.","['Uchida, Shigenori', 'Kobayashi, Katsue', 'Ohno, Seika', 'Sakagami, Hiroshi', 'Kohase, Hikaru', 'Nagasaka, Hiroshi']","['Uchida S', 'Kobayashi K', 'Ohno S', 'Sakagami H', 'Kohase H', 'Nagasaka H']",,"['Division of Dental Anesthesiology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama, Japan sashichitaru930@dent.meikai.ac.jp sakagami@dent.meikai.ac.jp.', 'Division of Dentistry for Persons with Disabilities, Department of Community Health Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Saitama Medical University International Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Meikai University Research Institute of Odontology (M-RIO), Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Dental Anesthesiology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Saitama Medical University, Faculty of Medicine, Moroyama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Adrenergic Agonists)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '67VB76HONO (Dexmedetomidine)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)', 'MN3L5RMN02 (Clonidine)', 'YKH834O4BH (Epinephrine)']",IM,"['Adrenergic Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*drug therapy', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Clonidine/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Dexmedetomidine/pharmacology', 'Epinephrine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoproterenol/pharmacology', 'Mouth Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology']",,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['39/7/3519 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13498 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Jul;39(7):3519-3529. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13498.,7,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Oral squamous carcinoma cell', 'ROS', 'adrenergic agonists', 'necrosis']",,,,,,,,,,,

In HP100 cells, DNA ladder formation and caspase-3/7 activity induced by ACR were suppressed or delayed in comparison to those in HL-60 cells. ACR-induced DNA damage occurred in the presence of Cu(II), and scavenger experiments showed that the reactive species causing DNA damage appeared to be generated from H2O2 and Cu(I). Moreover, we detected intracellular Cu(I) induced by ACR in HL-60 cells, using CopperGREEN, a fluorescent probe for detection of Cu(I) ion specifically.

However, the term targeted therapy had been used much earlier. Targeting tumor metabolism was already considered as targeted therapy, with methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil as the most successful examples. Hormone therapy is another successful type of targeted therapy. Imatinib was the first TKI for the fusion protein BCR-ABL and represented a breakthrough in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. Many other TKIs have been introduced into the clinic, but most were less specific and had multiple targets, and therefore, by definition, not targeted. However, with the introduction of TKIs developed specifically against mutations in the active site of a TK, more truly targeted TKI have been approved, such as new anaplastic lymphoma kinase - echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (ALK-EML4) inhibitors and the epidermal growth factor-T790M-targeted osimertinib.

The impact of this shared etiology on risk for second cancers in NHL survivors has not been comprehensively studied. We used US population-based cancer registry data to quantify risk of solid malignancies associated with infectious etiology among 127 044 adult 1-year survivors of the 4 most common NHL subtypes diagnosed during 2000 to 2014 (mean follow-up, 4.5-5.2 years). Compared with the general population, elevated risks for liver, stomach, and anal cancers were observed among diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) survivors (standardized incidence ratio [SIR], 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-2.31; SIR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.16-1.94; SIR, 3.71; 95% CI, 2.52-5.27, respectively) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL; SIR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.34-2.83; SIR, 2.78; 95% CI, 2.02-3.74; SIR, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.02-4.64, respectively) but not follicular lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. Anal cancer risk was particularly elevated among DLBCL survivors with HIV (SIR, 68.34; 95% CI, 37.36-114.66) vs those without (SIR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.22-3.34). The observed patterns are consistent with shared associations between these cancers and hepatitis C virus, Helicobacter pylori, and HIV, respectively. In contrast, risks for cervical and oropharyngeal/tonsil cancers were not elevated among survivors of any NHL subtype, possibly because of the lack of NHL association with human papillomavirus or population-wide screening practices (for cervical cancer).

We retrospectively analyzed 724 patients who underwent a first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) following a TBI-based conditioning regimen for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and compared the outcomes of 251 (35%) patients who received ATG (ATG group) with 473 (65%) patients who did not (non-ATG group). Median follow-up of surviving patients was 59 months (interquartile range, 28-83). The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) for non-ATG and ATG groups in the first 100 days was 33% vs 24%, respectively (P = .0098). The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was reduced significantly in the ATG group in comparison with the non-ATG group (46% vs 34%, P = .003). Using multivariate analysis, in vivo T-cell depletion (ATG group) was independently associated with a decreased incidence of grade II-IV aGVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.28; P < .001), grade III-IV aGVHD (HR, 0.21; P < .001), cGVHD (HR, 0.63; P = .02), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) (HR, 0.54; P = .02). Relapse risk, overall survival, and leukemia-free survival were similar between the 2 groups. Our results suggest that the addition of ATG to TBI-based myeloablative conditioning for allo-HCT in AML patients results in a significant reduction in aGVHD and cGVHD, translating into a significant reduction in NRM without increasing the relapse rate.","['Nagler, Arnon', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Dholaria, Bhagirathbhai', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Maertens, Johan', 'Poire, Xavier', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Remenyi, Peter', 'Bourhis, Jean Henri', 'Beguin, Yves', 'Malladi, Ram', 'Kerre, Tessa', 'Schroyens, Wilfried', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Nagler A', 'Labopin M', 'Dholaria B', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Maertens J', 'Poire X', 'Cornelissen J', 'Remenyi P', 'Bourhis JH', 'Beguin Y', 'Malladi R', 'Kerre T', 'Schroyens W', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2371-3655', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4257-5980', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2114-2844']","['Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Aviv University, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', 'European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) Acute Leukemia Working Party office and.', 'Department of Haematology and EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, HUCH Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Haematology, Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department Haematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Del-pesti Centrumkorhaz-Orszagos Hematologiai es Infektologiai Intezet, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Service, Department of Hematology, Institut de Cancerologie, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Liege, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sart-Tilman, Liege, Belgium.', 'Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Medical Centre, Edgbaston, University Hospital Birmingham National Health Service Trust, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp Edegem, Belgium.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Processing Laboratory, Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Nashville, TN; and.', 'Department of Haematology and EBMT Paris study office/CEREST-TC, Saint Antoine Hospital, INSERM UMR 938 and Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects/methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC6616257,2019/07/03 06:00,2020/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000030 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000030 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 9;3(13):1950-1960. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000030.,13,,,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multicolour flow cytometry (MCF) is a sensitive MRD method. The current approach relies on identification of blasts expressing leukaemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIP) or by blasts expressing aberrant differentiation/maturation profiles compared to that seen in normal haematopoietic precursor cells at follow-up, i.e., different from normal (DFN). However, expression of LAIP on normal myeloblasts affects the specificity of the result, and the understanding of what is normal is important. Limited published data are currently available. We report findings from 14 normal adult bone marrows. MCF was performed on the residual normal marrow specimens from 14 adults. Expression of CD15, CD11b, CD7, CD4, and CD56 on CD34+ myeloblasts was assessed. Analysis of samples was performed using 4-colour flow cytometry which was the methodology used when this work was done, and is still being used in many clinical flow laboratories worldwide. LAIP is defined by lineage infidelity or asynchronous expression of differentiation markers. The cases of normal myeloblasts with LAIP involving the markers used and above the cut-off levels for MRD detection (0.01%) varies between 43% and 100%, limiting the specificity of the results for MRD. Even if the threshold is raised to 0.1%, there will still be false positive cases using aberrant CD15 or CD7. Our work provided useful information for AML MRD determination in our laboratory. A collaborative database of LAIP on normal myeloblasts using standardised analysis should be useful to determine the optimal diagnostic cut-off for AML MRD using LAIP.","['Camburn, Anna Elinder', 'Petrasich, Michelle', 'Ruskova, Anna', 'Chan, George']","['Camburn AE', 'Petrasich M', 'Ruskova A', 'Chan G']",,"['Haematology Department, North Shore Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand.

Combination therapies offer the best chance of disease control; however, the design of successful combination strategies requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underpinning CVA21 efficacy, in particular, the role of CVA21 anti-tumor immunity. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the ability of CVA21 to induce human anti-tumor immunity, and identify the cellular mechanism responsible. METHODS: This study utilized peripheral blood mononuclear cells from i) healthy donors, ii) Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients, and iii) patients taking part in the STORM clinical trial, who received intravenous CVA21; patients receiving intravenous CVA21 were consented separately in accordance with local institutional ethics review and approval. Collectively, these blood samples were used to characterize the development of innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune responses following CVA21 treatment. RESULTS: An Initial characterization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, collected from cancer patients following intravenous infusion of CVA21, confirmed that CVA21 activated immune effector cells in patients. Next, using hematological disease models which were sensitive (Multiple Myeloma; MM) or resistant (AML) to CVA21-direct oncolysis, we demonstrated that CVA21 stimulated potent anti-tumor immune responses, including: 1) cytokine-mediated bystander killing; 2) enhanced natural killer cell-mediated cellular cytotoxicity; and 3) priming of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, with specificity towards known tumor-associated antigens. Importantly, immune-mediated killing of both MM and AML, despite AML cells being resistant to CVA21-direct oncolysis, was observed. Upon further examination of the cellular mechanisms responsible for CVA21-induced anti-tumor immunity we have identified the importance of type I IFN for NK cell activation, and demonstrated that both ICAM-1 and plasmacytoid dendritic cells were key mediators of this response. CONCLUSION: This work supports the development of CVA21 as an immunotherapeutic agent for the treatment of both AML and MM. Additionally, the data presented provides an important insight into the mechanisms of CVA21-mediated immunotherapy to aid the development of clinical biomarkers to predict response and rationalize future drug combinations.","['Muller, Louise M E', 'Holmes, Matthew', 'Michael, Joanne L', 'Scott, Gina B', 'West, Emma J', 'Scott, Karen J', 'Parrish, Christopher', 'Hall, Kathryn', 'Stable, Sina',

There remains an urgent need for novel targeted therapies to improve clinical outcomes in ovarian cancer. As a nitric oxide prodrug, JS-K is reported highly cytotoxic to human cancer cells such as acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma and breast cancer. This study is aim to investigate the influence of JS-K on proliferation and apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells and explored possible autophagy-related mechanisms, which will contribute to future ovarian cancer therapy and supply theory support that JS-K holds great promise as a novel therapeutic agent against ovarian cancer. METHODS: The cytotoxicity, extracellular ROS/RNS activity and apoptotic effect of JS-K and indicated inhibitors on ovarian cancer cells in vitro were evaluated by MTT assay, extracellular ROS/RNS assay, caspases activities assay and western blot. Further autophagy effect of JS-K and indicated inhibitors were examined by MTT assay, cell transfection, immunofluorescence analysis, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis and western blot on ovarian cancer cells in vitro. In vivo, the BALB/c-nude female mice with SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells xenograft were used to examine the efficacy of JS-K treatment on tumor growth. PCNA and p62 proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In vitro, JS-K inhibited the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, induced apoptosis and cell nucleus shrinkage, enhanced the enzymatic activity of caspase-3/7/8/9, and significantly increased the production of ROS/RNS in ovarian cancer A2780 and SKOV3 cells, these effects were attenuated by inhibition of NAC. In addition, JS-K induced autophagy-related proteins and autophagosomes changes in ovarian cancer A2780 and SKOV3 cells. In vivo, JS-K inhibited tumor growth, decreased p62 protein expression and increased the expression levels of PCNA in xenograft models which were established using SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, we demonstrated that ROS/RNS stress-mediated apoptosis and autophagy are mechanisms by which SKOV3 cells undergo cell death after treatment with JS-K in vitro.

Understanding the characteristic features of the TME as well as the interactions between cancer and TME cells has given insight into the pathogenesis of most lymphomas and contributed to identify novel therapeutic targets. Here, we summarize the preclinical data that contributed to clarifying the role of the immune cells in the TME of different types of lymphomas of B-cell origin, and explain how the understanding of the biological background has led to new clinical applications.

It also has a key role in the epigenetic regulation of tissue homeostasis and many diseases by deacetylating both histone and non-histone targets. Different studies have shown ambiguous implications of SIRT1 as both a tumor suppressor and tumor promoter. However, this contradictory role seems to be determined by the cell type and SIRT1 localization. SIRT1 upregulation has already been demonstrated in some cancer cells, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and primary colon, prostate, melanoma, and non-melanoma skin cancers, while SIRT1 downregulation was described in breast cancer and hepatic cell carcinomas. Even though new functions of SIRT1 have been characterized, the underlying mechanisms that define its precise role on DNA damage and repair and their contribution to cancer development remains underexplored. Here, we discuss the recent findings on the interplay among SIRT1, oxidative stress, and DNA repair machinery and its impact on normal and cancer cells.","['Alves-Fernandes, Debora Kristina', 'Jasiulionis, Miriam Galvonas']","['Alves-Fernandes DK', 'Jasiulionis MG']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4135-0440'],"['Department of Pharmacology, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 04039-032, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo 04039-032, Brazil. mjasiulionis@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190628,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)'],IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Sirtuin 1/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6651129,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20133153 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20133153 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 28;20(13). pii: ijms20133153. doi: 10.3390/ijms20133153.,13,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage/repair', 'SIRT1', 'cancer development', 'epigenetics']",,,,,,,,,,,

Early identification and appropriate selection of antifungal drugs is the key to successful treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 31-year-old female was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (pro-B ALL). She developed a high fever and presented with typical painful purple nodules with central necrosis formed on the upper and lower limbs during the induction chemotherapy. DIAGNOSIS: Combining clinical manifestations with results of blood culture testing and sequencing methods, it was consistent with the diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with the combination of tigecycline and antifungal agents (Liposomal Amphotericin B and Voriconazole), OUTCOMES:: The skin lesions generally healed with some scar left after treating with antifungal agents for 6 weeks. The final date of follow-up was 1.5 years later, and the patient was alive with no diseases. LESSONS: This case highlights the importance of the typical cutaneous lesions for early diagnosis and proper treatment to decrease the mortality rate of this severe infection. This patient was successfully treated with the combination of tigecycline and antifungal agents, which may be the first clinical confirmation of tigecycline that improved the effectiveness of antifungal agents against fusariosis, but it requires more studies to verify. We reviewed 62 cases from literature and analyzed using logistic regression and recognized the high-risk factor for fusariosis mortality in patients with acute leukemia was non-remission of underlying disease.","['Yu, Jieni', 'Chen, Yan', 'Fang, Jiabin', 'Zhang, Kejie']","['Yu J', 'Chen Y', 'Fang J', 'Zhang K']",,"['Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Laboratory, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Fujian Medical University Clinic Teaching Hospital, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (liposomal amphotericin B)', '70JE2N95KR (Tigecycline)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amphotericin B/*therapeutic use', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusariosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Remission Induction', 'Tigecycline/*therapeutic use', 'Voriconazole/*therapeutic use']",PMC6617023,2019/07/03 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2019/07/03 06:00'],"['2019/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016246 [doi]', '00005792-201906280-00099 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jun;98(26):e16246. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016246.,26,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TCF4 was discovered recently to be an obligatory master regulator of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. We postulated that a tissue-based assay designed to detect dual CD123 and TCF4 expression would provide a highly reliable and practical marker for BPDCN in biopsy material. We designed, optimized, and validated a dual-color TCF4/CD123 immunohistochemistry stain for use in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The performance characteristics of the TCF4/CD123 stain were evaluated in 48 confirmed BPDCN cases. TCF4/CD123 coexpression was detected reproducibly in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. In BPDCN, the TCF4/CD123 stain showed coexpression in all (48/48; 100%) cases analyzed. Cases with concurrent samples from different anatomic sites showed comparable staining characteristics. In contrast, of 464 non-BPDCN cases comprising a wide range of hematolymphoid neoplasms and cutaneous lesions that might enter in the differential diagnosis of BPDCN, we identified dual expression of TCF4 and CD123 in only 1 case of B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma. On the basis of these findings, the TCF4/CD123 dual-color immunohistochemical stain had an analytic sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99.8%. Receiver operator characteristic analysis demonstrated an area under the curve of 1.000 (95% confidence interval: 0.999-1.000). In summary, the dual-color TCF4/CD123 immunohistochemistry stain provides a robust standalone and cost-effective assay for the diagnosis of BPDCN.","['Sukswai, Narittee', 'Aung, Phyu P', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Wang, Wei', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Ortega, Victor', 'Lyapichev, Kirill', 'Nagarajan, Priyadharsini', 'Alfattal, Rasha', 'Angelova, Evgeniya', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Bhalla, Kapil', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Sukswai N', 'Aung PP', 'Yin CC', 'Li S', 'Wang W', 'Wang SA', 'Ortega V', 'Lyapichev K', 'Nagarajan P', 'Alfattal R', 'Angelova E', 'Tang Z', 'Loghavi S', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Miranda RN', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Bhalla K', 'Konopleva M', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Khoury JD']",,"['Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Pathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Pathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.', 'Departments of Hematopathology.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (TCF4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor 4)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Dendritic Cells/*chemistry/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*chemistry/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcription Factor 4/*analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/02 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAS.0000000000001316 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2019 Oct;43(10):1429-1437. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0000000000001316.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current standard for profiling the diverse genetic background comprises a combination of conventional karyotype and FISH analysis for the most common translocations, albeit with many limitations. Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) is a high throughput whole genome method that is gradually implemented in routine clinical practice, but not many studies have compared the two methods. Here we aim to investigate the added benefits of utilizing the high resolution 2x400K G3 CGH+SNP CMA platform in routine diagnostics of pediatric ALL. From the 29 bone marrow samples that were analyzed, CMA identified clinically relevant findings in 83%, while detecting chromosomal aberrations in 75% of the patients with normal conventional karyotype. The most common finding was hyperdiploidy (20%), and the most common submicroscopic aberration involved CDKN2A/B genes. The smallest aberration detected was a 9kb partial NF1 gene duplication. The prognosis of the patients when combining conventional cytogenetics and CMA was either changed or enhanced in 66% of the cases. A rare duplication possibly indicative of a cryptic ABL1-NUP214 fusion gene was found in one patient.

We investigated the risk of SPLs in five-year childhood cancer survivors using a large-scale pan-European (PanCareSurFup) cohort and evaluated variations in the risk by cancer and demographic factors. METHODS: This largest-ever assembled cohort comprises 69,460 five-year childhood cancer survivors from 12 European countries. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and absolute excess risks (AERs) were calculated. RESULTS: One hundred fifteen survivors developed an SPL including 86 myeloid leukaemias (subsequent primary myeloid leukaemias [SPMLs]), 17 lymphoid leukaemias and 12 other types of leukaemias; of these SPLs, 31 (27%) occurred beyond 20 years from the first childhood cancer diagnosis. Compared with the general population, childhood cancer survivors had a fourfold increased risk (SIR = 3.7, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.1 to 4.5) of developing leukaemia, and eight leukaemias per 100,000 person-years (AER = 7.5, 95% CI: 6.0 to 9.2) occurred in excess of that expected. The risks remained significantly elevated beyond 20 years from the first primary malignancy (SIR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.6 to 3.4). Overall, the risk ratio for SPML (SIR = 5.8, 95% CI: 4.6 to 7.1) was higher than that for other SPLs. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that beyond 20 years after childhood cancer diagnosis, survivors experience an increased risk for SPLs compared with that expected from the general population. Our findings highlight the need for awareness by survivors and their healthcare providers for potential risk related to SPL.","['Allodji, Rodrigue S', 'Hawkins, Mike M', 'Bright, Chloe J', 'Fidler-Benaoudia, Miranda M', 'Winter, David L', 'Alessi, Daniela', 'Fresneau, Brice', 'Journy, Neige', 'Morsellino, Vera', 'Bardi, Edit', 'Bautz, Andrea', 'Byrne, Julianne', 'Feijen, Elizabeth Lieke Am', 'Teepen, Jop C', 'Vu-Bezin, Giao', 'Rubino, Carole', 'Garwicz, Stanislaw', 'Grabow, Desiree', 'Gudmundsdottir, Thorgerdur', 'Guha, Joyeeta', 'Hau, Eva-Maria', 'Jankovic, Momcilo', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Kaiser, Melanie', 'Linge, Helena', 'Muraca, Monica', 'Llanas, Damien', 'Veres, Cristina', 'Ofstaas, Hilde', 'Diallo, Ibrahima', 'Mansouri, Imene', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'Skinner, Roderick', 'Terenziani, Monica', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Wiebe, Thomas', 'Sacerdote, Carlotta', 'Jakab, Zsuzsanna', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi', 'Zaletel, Lorna Zadravec', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'Michel, Gisela', 'Kremer, Leontien C M', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Haddy, Nadia', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Reulen, Raoul C']","['Allodji RS', 'Hawkins MM', 'Bright CJ', 'Fidler-Benaoudia MM', 'Winter DL', 'Alessi D', 'Fresneau B', 'Journy N', 'Morsellino V', 'Bardi E', 'Bautz A', 'Byrne J', 'Feijen ELA', 'Teepen JC', 'Vu-Bezin G', 'Rubino C', 'Garwicz S', 'Grabow D', 'Gudmundsdottir T', 'Guha J', 'Hau EM', 'Jankovic M', 'Kaatsch P', 'Kaiser M', 'Linge H', 'Muraca M', 'Llanas D', 'Veres C', 'Ofstaas H', 'Diallo I', 'Mansouri I', 'Ronckers CM', 'Skinner R', 'Terenziani M', 'Wesenberg F', 'Wiebe T', 'Sacerdote C', 'Jakab Z', 'Haupt R', 'Lahteenmaki P', 'Zaletel LZ', 'Kuehni CE', 'Winther JF', 'Michel G', 'Kremer LCM', 'Hjorth L', 'Haddy N', 'de Vathaire F', 'Reulen RC']",,"['Centre for Childhood Cancer Survivor Studies, Institute of Applied Health Research, Robert Aitken Building, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK; Cancer and Radiation Team, Center for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health, INSERM U1018, University Paris Saclay, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Polytechnic School of Abomey-Calavi (EPAC), University of Abomey-Calavi, 01 P.O.

In a Phase 1b/2, open-label study (PCYC-1129; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02195869) involving 42 patients with active cGVHD who were steroid-dependent or -refractory, the activity and safety of ibrutinib, a once-daily inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase, was demonstrated. Here we report extended follow-up for patients in this study. After a median follow-up of 26 months (range, .53 to 36.7 months), best overall response rate in the all treated population was 69% (29 of 42), with 13 patients (31%) achieving a complete response and 16 patients (38%) achieving a partial response. Sustained responses of >/=20, >/=32, and >/=44 weeks were seen in 20 (69%), 18 (62%), and 16 (55%) of the 29 responders, respectively. Of 26 patients with >/=2 involved organs, 19 (73%) showed responses in >/=2 organs. Six of 10 patients (60%) with >/=3 involved organs showed responses in >/=3 organs. Eleven of 18 patients (61%) who had sclerosis at baseline showed a sclerotic response (39% with complete response, 22% with partial response). Twenty-seven of 42 patients (64%) reached a corticosteroid dose of <.15 mg/kg/day during the study; 8 discontinued corticosteroid treatment and remained off corticosteroid at study closure. Safety findings for this updated analysis were consistent with the safety profile seen at the time of the original analysis. Common grade >/=3 adverse events (AEs) were pneumonia (n=6), fatigue (n=5), and diarrhea (n=4). The onset of new grade >/=3 AEs decreased from 71% in the first year of treatment to 25% in the second year (n=12). AEs leading to discontinuation occurred in 18 patients (43%). At a median follow-up of >2 years, ibrutinib continued to produce durable responses in patients with cGVHD who had failed previous systemic therapy. In this pretreated, high-risk population, clinically meaningful benefit and an acceptable safety profile were observed with additional follow-up for ibrutinib. These results demonstrate a substantial advance in the therapeutic management of patients with cGVHD.","['Waller, Edmund K', 'Miklos, David', 'Cutler, Corey', 'Arora, Mukta', 'Jagasia, Madan H', 'Pusic, Iskra', 'Flowers, Mary E D', 'Logan, Aaron C', 'Nakamura, Ryotaro', 'Chang, Stephen', 'Clow, Fong', 'Lal, Indu D', 'Styles, Lori', 'Jaglowski, Samantha']","['Waller EK', 'Miklos D', 'Cutler C', 'Arora M', 'Jagasia MH', 'Pusic I', 'Flowers MED', 'Logan AC', 'Nakamura R', 'Chang S', 'Clow F', 'Lal ID', 'Styles L', 'Jaglowski S']",,"['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.

CD97 is also expressed in a variety of solid cancers, particularly those with aggressive metastatic phenotypes. Here we characterize the clinical significance of CD97 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed 173 patients from the TCGA AML data set and found that CD97 was higher in cytogenetically normal patients compared with cytogenetically abnormal patients (p=0.023). High CD97 was also associated with NPM1 mutations (p=0.0033). Patients with high CD97 expression had shorter overall (median: 7.35 months vs. 24.1 months, p=0.0015) and disease-free (median DFS: 8.2 months vs. 18.2 months, p=0.017) survival. Importantly, we identified pathways involved in the leukemia stem cell interaction with the bone marrow niche, such as integrin, CXCR4, and interleukin-8, among the most upregulated signaling pathways in patients with high CD97 expression. Our results suggest that high CD97 expression is associated with poor clinical outcome and indicate a need for future functional and mechanistic studies to investigate the role of CD97 in AML.","['Vaikari, Vijaya Pooja', 'Yang, Jiawen', 'Wu, Sharon', 'Alachkar, Houda']","['Vaikari VP', 'Yang J', 'Wu S', 'Alachkar H']",,"['School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California; USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.

SNAP-23 contains a hydrophobic domain with five closely spaced cysteines which get palmitoylated, and we show that SNAP-23 cysteine mutants show differential membrane association when transfected in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells. SNAP-23 Cys(-) mutant, devoid of all five cysteines, and SNAP-23 P119A (proline to alanine) mutant, that likely interferes with palmitoylation of SNAP-23 by palmitoyl transferases are completely cytosolic. Mutating specific cysteines (Cys; C) to leucine or phenylalanine (L or F; retains hydrophobicity but lacks palmitoylation) partially decreases the membrane association of SNAP-23 which is further hampered by alanine (A; has lesser hydrophobicity, and lacks palmitoylation) mutation at C79, C80 or C83 position. Cloning a transmembrane domain MDR31-145 from multidrug resistance protein into SNAP-23 Cys(-) mutant is able to partially restore its membrane association. Regulated exocytosis studies using co-transfected human growth hormone (hGH) secretion reporter plasmid revealed that overexpression of SNAP-23 Cys(-) and P119A mutants significantly inhibits the overall extent of exocytosis from RBL mast cells, whereas expression of SNAP-23 Cys(-)-MDR31-145 fusion protein is able to restore exocytosis. These results establish that the cysteine-rich domain of SNAP-23 regulates its membrane association and thereby also regulates exocytosis from mast cells.","['Agarwal, Vasudha', 'Naskar, Pieu', 'Agasti, Suchhanda', 'Khurana, Gagandeep K', 'Vishwakarma, Poonam', 'Lynn, Andrew M', 'Roche, Paul A', 'Puri, Niti']","['Agarwal V', 'Naskar P', 'Agasti S', 'Khurana GK', 'Vishwakarma P', 'Lynn AM', 'Roche PA', 'Puri N']",,"['Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'School of Computational and Integrative Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.', 'Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States of America.', 'Cellular and Molecular Immunology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi 110067, India.

Novel techniques of purification of hematopoietic subpopulations and their functional characterization have defined individual steps of their lineage commitment. A detailed molecular map of the selective autophagy landscape governing self-renewal, maintenance, and differentiation of HSCs and their progeny during early and terminal differentiation has not yet been drawn. However, the importance of selective autophagy pathways is increasingly being recognized, as this evolutionary conserved degradation pathway is instrumental in orchestrating intracellular turnover of macromolecular complexes and organelles to meet the specific needs of various hematopoietic cells. For instance, mitophagy has clearly been demonstrated to regulate mitochondrial homeostasis in HSCs, thereby defining their metabolic fate decisions. This review focuses on the emerging evidence supporting an important role of selective autophagy in regulating normal hematopoiesis. As this has uncovered important features in malignant hematopoiesis, the review also covers aspects of selective autophagy pathways affected in the development and progression of leukemia and lymphoma. A molecular understanding of the unique requirements of selective autophagy may open new avenues for specific therapeutic intervention.","['Koschade, Sebastian E', 'Brandts, Christian H']","['Koschade SE', 'Brandts CH']",,"['Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany; German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; University Cancer Center Frankfurt (UCT), Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.

Ara-C is the clinically most relevant cytotoxic agent for AML treatment. We extend a mathematical model of myelosuppression and a pharmacokinetic model of Ara-C with different hypotheses of Ara-C's pharmacodynamic effects. We cross-validate the 12 model variations using dense WBC count measurements from 23 AML patients. Surprisingly, the prediction accuracy remains satisfactory in each of the models despite different modelling hypotheses. Therefore, we compare average clinical and calculated WBC recovery times for different Ara-C schedules as a successful methodology for model discrimination. As a result, a new hypothesis of a secondary pharmacodynamic effect on the proliferation rate seems plausible. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of treatment timing on subsequent nadir values based on personalised predictions as a possibility for influencing/controlling myelosuppression.","['Jost, Felix', 'Schalk, Enrico', 'Rinke, Kristine', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Sager, Sebastian']","['Jost F', 'Schalk E', 'Rinke K', 'Fischer T', 'Sager S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0316-7055', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1892-5098', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0283-9075']","['Institute of Mathematical Optimization, Faculty of Mathematics, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Otto-von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Mathematical Optimization, Faculty of Mathematics, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center, Otto-von-Guericke-University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Mathematical Optimization, Faculty of Mathematics, Otto-von-Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190701,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', '*Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Models, Biological']",PMC6602180,2019/07/02 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0204540 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-26085 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jul 1;14(7):e0204540. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0204540. eCollection 2019.,7,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report the development and application of a mutation-based induced-fit in silico screen to identify novel Mnk inhibitors. The Mnk1 structure was modeled by temporarily mutating an amino acid that obstructs the ATP-binding site in the Mnk1 crystal structure while carrying out docking simulations of known inhibitors. The hit compounds display activity in Mnk biochemical and cellular assays, including acute myeloid leukemia progenitors. This approach will enable further rational structure-based drug design of new Mnk inhibitors and potentially novel ways of therapeutically targeting this kinase.","['Mishra, Rama K', 'Clutter, Matthew R', 'Blyth, Gavin T', 'Kosciuczuk, Ewa M', 'Blackburn, Amy Z', 'Beauchamp, Elspeth M', 'Schiltz, Gary E', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Mishra RK', 'Clutter MR', 'Blyth GT', 'Kosciuczuk EM', 'Blackburn AZ', 'Beauchamp EM', 'Schiltz GE', 'Platanias LC']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4180-5051'],"['The Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Robert H.

In lymphoma, WB-MRI is presently not recommended, and merely serves as an alternative technique to the current standard imaging test, [(18) F]FDG-PET/CT, especially in pediatric patients. Even for lymphomas with variable FDG avidity, such as extranodal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (MALT), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), but not WB-MRI, is presently recommended, despite the high sensitivity of diffusion-weighted MRI and its ability to capture treatment response that has been reported in the literature.

Therapeutic monitoring of mercaptopurine (thiopurine) red cell metabolites to assess adherence has been available for many years. Recently a clinical laboratory improvement amendments of 1988-approved test for methotrexate with three polyglutamate residues (MTXPG3) measured in peripheral blood red cells was approved. MTXPG3 is the primary intracellular metabolite of methotrexate, and like thiopurine metabolites, is retained for the life of the red cell giving an estimate of drug exposure over time. Normative values for MTXPG3 are available for adults and children with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate monotherapy, which are not applicable for patients with ALL on maintenance. Older literature on the MTXPG3 fraction in children with ALL is limited. We examined the MTXPG3 levels from 123 samples in 76 patients with ALL on maintenance oral methotrexate and mercaptopurine that were collected for clinical care. Male individuals had significantly higher MTXPG3 levels than female individuals which was unrelated to absolute neutrophil count, age, serum creatinine, and average doses of methotrexate or mercaptopurine. The MTXPG3 5th, 10th, 90th, and 95th percentile values are 0, 8.4, 53, and 64, respectively with a median of 24.7 nmol/L. The low 5th percentile MTXPG3 reflects 6 samples from 3 patients, age 16 to 21 years that were considered poorly adherent before collecting the specimen. As with red cell thiopurine (mercaptopurine) metabolites, MTXPG3 normative values may provide useful information to monitor for poor patient adherence or methotrexate toxicity during maintenance chemotherapy in ALL.","['Kandikonda, Pooja', 'Bostrom, Bruce']","['Kandikonda P', 'Bostrom B']",,"[""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/02 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001530 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;41(6):429-432. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001530.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We estimated sex differences in survival for 18 cancers among children (0-19 years) in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 (2000-2014). We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves (log-rank P values) to characterize sex differences in survival and Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between sex and death for each cancer type. We used an inverse odds weighting method to determine whether the association between sex and death was mediated by stage of disease for solid tumors. Results: Males had worse overall survival and a higher risk of death for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.37), ependymoma (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.77), neuroblastoma (HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.09 to 1.51), osteosarcoma (HR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.08 to 1.53), thyroid carcinoma (HR = 3.25, 95% CI = 1.45 to 7.33), and malignant melanoma (HR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.33 to 2.92) (all log-rank P values < .02). The association between sex and death was mediated by stage of disease for neuroblastoma (indirect HR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.19), thyroid carcinoma (indirect HR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.03 to 1.48), and malignant melanoma (indirect HR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.49). For these six tumors, if male survival had been as good as female survival, 21% of male deaths and 13% of total deaths after these cancer diagnoses could have been avoided. Conclusions: Consideration of molecular tumor and clinical data may help identify mechanisms underlying the male excess in death after childhood cancer for the aforementioned cancers.","['Williams, Lindsay A', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Williams LA', 'Spector LG']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3842-4629'],"['Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Division of Epidemiology & Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190511,England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,PMC6580869,2019/07/02 06:00,2019/07/02 06:01,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2019/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pkz032 [doi]', 'pkz032 [pii]']",ppublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2019 Jun;3(2):pkz032. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pkz032.

The aim of this study was to define the indications and outcomes of splenectomy for benign and malign hematological disorders. Materials and Methods: One hundred and two patients with hematological disease who had splenectomy at Hacettepe University Hospital between the years of 2010 and 2018 were evaluated. Results: A total of one hundred and two patients were included in this study. The median age was 52 (20-82) years at the time of splenectomy. Most of the patients were female (57.9%). The median follow up time was 11.0 (0.03-87.9) months after splenectomy. Splenectomy was performed to diagnose thirty patients (29.4%). Seventy-two patients underwent splenectomy for the treatment of hematological disease (70.6%). Twenty-seven patients (90%) were diagnosed with various lymphomas. Two patients (6.7%) were diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia and one patient (3.3%) was diagnosed with large granular lymphocytic leukemia.

Imatinib (Gleevec), a specific targeted drug for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), was developed for inhibiting the kinase activity of the BCR-ABL fusion protein. Despite the positive clinical efficacy of imatinib, the proportion of imatinib resistance has gradually increased. The main reason for the resistance is a decrease in sensitivity to imatinib caused by mutation or amplification of the BCR-ABL gene. In response to this phenomenon, the new generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the BCR-ABL fusion protein was developed to solve the problem. However this strategy only selectively inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL protein without eliminating the BCR-ABL protein, it does not fundamentally cure the BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patients. With the accumulation of the knowledge of cellular molecular biology, it has become possible to specifically eliminate certain proteins by cellular proteases in a specific way. Therefore, the therapeutic strategy to induce the degradation of the BCR-ABL fusion protein is superior to the strategy of inhibiting its activity. The protein degradation strategy is also a solution to the TKI resistance caused by different BCR-ABL gene point mutations.

In this retrospective study, 40 (1.7%) patients with rare BCR-ABL1 transcripts were identified from a cohort of 2331 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients; 4 types of rare transcripts were identified, including e1a2 (0.9%), e19a2 (0.4%), e13a3 (0.1%), and e14a3 (0.3%). Compared to patients with the typical transcript, those with the e1a2 transcript had an inferior response to TKIs and a worse outcome. Patients with the e19a2 transcript had a high rate of early optimal response to TKIs, but most of them later lost the complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) due to BCR-ABL1 mutations, resulting in a poor prognosis. Patients with the e13a3/e14a3 transcript responded well to TKIs and had a good outcome.

Observational study.,e13122,10.1111/ecc.13122 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: To analyse clinical outcomes comparing two age groups of patients undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and to identify risk factors associated with older patients' mortality. METHODS: In this retrospective study, the medical charts of all consecutive patients admitted in one hospital for allo-HSCT were reviewed. Overall survival (OS) and other outcomes were compared between patients aged up to 55 years (YG) and older than 55 (EG). RESULTS: From January 2007 to August 2014, 111 adult patients were admitted for allo-HSCT and were included 75 in the YG and 36 in the EG group. The OS rate at D+ 100 was 84% for YG individuals in contrast to 75% in the EG (p = 0.01), and 71% vs. 50% at one year after HSCT (p = 0.01) respectively. Therapy-related mortality (TRM) rates for the YG and EG were, respectively, 14% vs. 17% (p = 0.04) at D+ 100 and 17% vs. 32% (p = 0.04) at one year. Haploidentical donor type and active disease status significantly increased mortality risk in the EG (hazard ratio 2.42; p = 0.018; and 2.04; p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: YG and EG have similar TRM rates early after allo-HSCT, but the elderly had higher TRM during the critical period from 100 days to one year.","['Chapchap, Eduardo Cerello', 'Kerbauy, Lucila Nassif', 'Esteves, Iracema', 'Belucci, Talita Rantin', 'Rodrigues, Morgani', 'Kerbauy, Fabio Rodrigues', 'de Souza Santos, Fabio Pires', 'Ribeiro, Andreza Alice Feitosa', 'Hamerschlak, Nelson']","['Chapchap EC', 'Kerbauy LN', 'Esteves I', 'Belucci TR', 'Rodrigues M', 'Kerbauy FR', 'de Souza Santos FP', 'Ribeiro AAF', 'Hamerschlak N']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5140-5310'],"['Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Dayan-Daycoval Family Hematology and Oncology Center, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20190630,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Renal Replacement Therapy/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2019/07/02 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2017/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.13122 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2019 Sep;28(5):e13122. doi: 10.1111/ecc.13122.

This phenomenon was investigated further by transcriptomic analysis of premalignant thymus from RUNX2/MYC transgenic mice. The distinctive contributions of MYC and RUNX to transcriptional control were illustrated by differential enrichment of canonical binding sites and gene ontology analyses. Pathway analysis revealed signatures of MYC, CD3, and CD28 regulation indicative of activation and proliferation, but also strong inhibition of cell death pathways. In silico analysis of discordantly expressed genes revealed Tnfsrf8/CD30, Cish, and Il13 among relevant targets for sustained proliferation and survival. Although TP53 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated, its downstream targets in growth suppression and apoptosis were largely unperturbed. Analysis of genes encoding p53 posttranslational modifiers showed significant upregulation of three genes, Smyd2, Set, and Prmt5. Overexpression of SMYD2 was validated in vivo but the functional analysis was constrained by in vitro loss of p53 in RUNX2/MYC lymphoma cell lines. However, an early role is suggested by the ability of SMYD2 to block senescence-like growth arrest induced by RUNX overexpression in primary fibroblasts.","['Hay, Jodie', 'Gilroy, Kathryn', 'Huser, Camille', 'Kilbey, Anna', 'Mcdonald, Alma', 'MacCallum, Amanda', 'Holroyd, Ailsa', 'Cameron, Ewan', 'Neil, James C']","['Hay J', 'Gilroy K', 'Huser C', 'Kilbey A', 'Mcdonald A', 'MacCallum A', 'Holroyd A', 'Cameron E', 'Neil JC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2000-2578', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4607-194X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4447-8279']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom."", 'School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Centre for Virus Research, Institute of Infection, Immunity, and Inflammation, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190630,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Smyd2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/physiology', 'Computational Biology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",PMC6772115,2019/07/02 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29143 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Oct;120(10):18332-18345. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29143.

Based on the competing endogenous RNA hypothesis, DElncRNAmicro RNA (miRNA)DEmRNA interactions were obtained by target gene prediction. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes pathway analysis of DEmRNAs in the DElncRNAmiRNADEmRNA network was performed. Expression and function analyses of DElncRNAs were performed by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) and an established viability assay, respectively. In total, 712 DE genes were identified. Significant upregulation of lncRNA deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1 (DLEU1) was revealed in GBM and a number of other types of cancer. DLEU1 interacted with 315 miRNAs and 105 DEmRNAs. The DEmRNAs were mainly enriched in tumorigenesisassociated GO terms (angiogenesis, positive regulation of cell proliferation, positive regulation of fibroblast apoptotic processes and regulation of neutrophil migration) and pathways (Hippo signaling pathway, cancer pathways, and Wnt signaling pathway). Correlation analysis revealed that mRNA TNF receptor associated factor 4 (TRAF4) was associated with DLEU1 expression. RTPCR demonstrated that the expression levels of DLEU1 and TRAF4 were increased in GBM tissues. Small interfering RNA demonstrated that silencing DLEU1 downregulated TRAF4. The viability of GBM cells was significantly decreased following RNA interference with DLEU1 and TRAF4 production. The results demonstrate that DLEU1 and TRAF4 is highly expressed in GBM tissues and promotes proliferation of GBM cells. It may act as a competing endogenous RNA and influence tumorigenesis of GBM.","['Wang, Jiancun', 'Quan, Xingyun', 'Peng, Dingting', 'Hu, Guancheng']","['Wang J', 'Quan X', 'Peng D', 'Hu G']",,"[""Department of Neurosurgery, People's Hospital of Zhangjiajie, Zhangjiajie, Hunan 427000, P.R.

Gene expression studies have been widely used to elucidate various biological processes; however, the gene expression profile of CKD is currently unclear. The present study aimed to identify diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets using renal biopsy sample data from patients with CKD. Gene expression data from 30 patients with CKD and 21 living donors were analyzed by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), in order to identify gene networks and profiles for CKD, as well as its specific characteristics, and to potentially uncover diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for patients with CKD. In addition, functional enrichment analysis was performed on coexpressed genes to determine modules of interest. Four coexpression modules were constructed from the WGCNA. The number of genes in the constructed modules ranged from 269 genes in the Turquoise module to 60 genes in the Yellow module. All four coexpression modules were correlated with CKD clinical traits (P<0.05). For example, the Turquoise module, which mostly contained genes that were upregulated in CKD, was positively correlated with CKD clinical traits, whereas the Blue, Brown and Yellow modules were negatively correlated with clinical traits. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the Turquoise module was mainly enriched in genes associated with the 'defense response', 'mitotic cell cycle' and 'collagen catabolic process' Gene Ontology (GO) terms, implying that genes involved in cell cycle arrest and fibrogenesis were upregulated in CKD. Conversely, the Yellow module was mainly enriched in genes associated with 'glomerulus development' and 'kidney development' GO terms, indicating that genes associated with renal development and damage repair were downregulated in CKD. The hub genes in the modules were acetylCoA carboxylase alpha, cyclindependent kinase 1, Wilm's tumour 1, NPHS2 stomatin family member, podocin, JunB protooncogene, AP1 transcription factor subunit, activating transcription factor 3, forkhead box O1 and vabl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1, which were confirmed to be significantly differentially expressed in CKD biopsies. Combining the eight hub genes enabled a high capacity for discrimination between patients with CKD and healthy subjects, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 1.00. In conclusion, this study provided a framework for coexpression modules of renal biopsy samples from patients with CKD and living donors, and identified several potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CKD.","['Guo, Yuhe', 'Ma, Junjie', 'Xiao, Lanyan', 'Fang, Jiali', 'Li, Guanghui', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Xu, Lu', 'Lai, Xingqiang', 'Pan, Guanghui', 'Chen, Zheng']","['Guo Y', 'Ma J', 'Xiao L', 'Fang J', 'Li G', 'Zhang L', 'Xu L', 'Lai X', 'Pan G', 'Chen Z']",,"['Department of Organ Transplantation, Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510260, P.R.

In recent years, ubiquitylation has been demonstrated to be an important biochemical reaction associated with apoptosis. To investigate the effects and interactions of the E3 ligase Fbox and WD repeat domain containing 7 (Fbw7) and MCL1 apoptosis regulator, BCL2 family member (Mcl1) in myocardial cells during oxidative stress, Cell Counting Kit8, flow cytometry, western blot, reactive oxygen species and coimmunoprecipitation assays were conducted. The current study revealed that Fbw7 may facilitate apoptosis via the Mcl1Bax pathway in oxidative stressinduced myocardial H9c2 cell injury. Mcl1 inhibits the functions of Bcl2 family members, including the mitochondrial apoptosis factor Bax, to maintain cell viability; however, the present study suggested that Fbw7 may degrade Mcl1 and impaired this process. Therefore, it may be hypothesized that Fbw7 promotes myocardial cell injury via interacting with Mcl1.","['Li, Xia', 'Zhang, Naijin', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Jia, Pengyu', 'Guo, Yuxuan', 'Tian, Yichen', 'You, Shilong', 'Wu, Shaojun', 'Sun, Yingxian']","['Li X', 'Zhang N', 'Zhang Y', 'Jia P', 'Guo Y', 'Tian Y', 'You S', 'Wu S', 'Sun Y']",,"['Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110001, P.R.

In conclusion, it is not clear whether development of AML in HCL patients is caused by mutagenic potential of the applied chemotherapy or by immune suppression/ perturbations as a characteristic of the underlying disease.","['Colovic, Natasa', 'Marisavljevic, Dragomir', 'Kraguljac-Kurtovic, Nada', 'Bogdanovic, Andrija', 'Gotic, Mirjana']","['Colovic N', 'Marisavljevic D', 'Kraguljac-Kurtovic N', 'Bogdanovic A', 'Gotic M']",,"['Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Center Bezanijska Kosa, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Clinic of Hematology, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, Serbia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20190501,Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (NCAM1 protein, human)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*complications', 'Remission Induction']",,2019/07/02 06:00,2020/08/15 06:00,['2019/07/02 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['S1029-2977-22(05)269-0 [pii]'],epublish,Arch Iran Med. 2019 May 1;22(5):269-271.,5,,,,"['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

This study aims to develop a machine learning approach to predict the diagnosis of acute leukaemia using peripheral blood (PB) images. METHODS: A set of 442 smears was analysed from 206 patients. It was split into a training set with 75% of these smears and a testing set with the remaining 25%. Colour clustering and mathematical morphology were used to segment cell images, which allowed the extraction of 2,867 geometric, colour and texture features. Several classification techniques were studied to obtain the most accurate classification method. Afterwards, the classifier was assessed with the images of the testing set. The final strategy was to predict the patient's diagnosis using the PB smear, and the final assessment was done with the cell images of the smears of the testing set. RESULTS: The highest classification accuracy was achieved with the selection of 700 features with linear discriminant analysis. The overall classification accuracy for the six groups of cell types was 85.8%, while the overall classification accuracy for individual smears was 94% as compared with the true confirmed diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method achieves a high diagnostic precision in the recognition of different types of blast cells among other mononuclear cells circulating in blood. It is the first encouraging step towards the idea of being a diagnostic support tool in the future.","['Boldu, Laura', 'Merino, Anna', 'Alferez, Santiago', 'Molina, Angel', 'Acevedo, Andrea', 'Rodellar, Jose']","['Boldu L', 'Merino A', 'Alferez S', 'Molina A', 'Acevedo A', 'Rodellar J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5162-3182', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1889-8889']","['Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Biomedical Diagnostic Center, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Biomedical Diagnostic Center, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain amerino@clinic.cat.', 'Mathematics, EEBE, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Biomedical Diagnostic Center, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Mathematics, EEBE, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Mathematics, EEBE, Technical University of Catalonia, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190629,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Cell Lineage', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Leukemia/blood/classification/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*pathology', '*Machine Learning', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods']",,2019/07/01 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/07/01 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2019-205949 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205949 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2019 Nov;72(11):755-761. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205949.

Recent molecular investigations firmly supported that TET or CEP would be a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy. Prognosis of patients with glucocorticoid resistant T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains poor; here we examined the anti-T-ALL effects of TET and CEP and the underlying mechanism by using the glucocorticoid resistant human leukemia Jurkat T cell line in vitro. TET and CEP significantly inhibited cell viabilities and induced apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner. Further investigations showed that TET or CEP not only upregulated the expression of initiator caspases such as caspase-8 and 9, but also increased the expression of effector caspases such as caspase-3 and 6. As the important markers of apoptosis, p53 and Bax were both upregulated by the treatment of TET and CEP. However, TET and CEP paradoxically increased the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and activated the survival protein NF-kappaB, leading to high expression of p-NF-kappaB. Cell cycle arrest at S phase accompanied by increase in the amounts of cyclin A2 and cyclin B1, and decrease in cylcin D1 amount in cells treated with TET or CEP will be another possible mechanism. During the process of apoptosis in Jurkat T cells, treatment with TET or CEP also increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38. The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway modification appears to play significant role in the Jurkat T cell apoptosis induced by TET or CEP. Moreover, TET and CEP seemed to downregulate the expressions of p-PI3K and mTOR in an independent way from Akt, since these two drugs strongly stimulated the p-Akt expression. These results provide fundamental insights into the clinical application of TET or CEP for the treatment of patients with relapsed T-ALL.","['Xu, Wencheng', 'Wang, Xiaoqin', 'Tu, Yuanchao', 'Masaki, Hiroshi', 'Tanaka, Sachiko', 'Onda, Kenji', 'Sugiyama, Kentaro', 'Yamada, Haruki', 'Hirano, Toshihiko']","['Xu W', 'Wang X', 'Tu Y', 'Masaki H', 'Tanaka S', 'Onda K', 'Sugiyama K', 'Yamada H', 'Hirano T']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China; Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China; Department of Nephrology, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Institute of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hubei Province Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China; Department of Nephrology, Hubei Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Wuhan, PR China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.

Up to 20% of patients obtain long-term benefit from Ld alone. The aim of this multicenter retrospective study was to identify and characterize those with good response to Ld salvage therapy, defined as progression-free survival lasting more than 24 months. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients treated with Ld in a consortium of 3 tertiary-care hospitals (Institut Catala d'Oncologia) between 2009 and 2016 were prospectively registered; 227 patients had evaluable data. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, obtaining partial response after the first therapy cycle was the main independent factor associated with progression-free survival lasting more than 24 months. Together with standard risk cytogenetics, partial response after first cycle was also independently associated with a higher rate of complete response. Previous plasma-cell dyscrasia remained as the only baseline characteristic independently associated with long-lasting responses. High-risk cytogenetics and no history of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance were the only statistically significant negative prognostic factors for overall survival. Patients who had received only one prior therapy showed a trend toward higher overall survival. CONCLUSION: If Ld is to be considered a treatment choice, at least a partial response should be obtained after the first therapy cycle to maintain double-agent therapy safely.","['Gassiot, Susanna', 'Gonzalez, Yolanda', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Motllo, Cristina', 'Clapes, Victoria', 'Maluquer, Clara', 'Ibarra, Gladys', 'Abril, Laura', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria', 'Oriol, Albert']","['Gassiot S', 'Gonzalez Y', 'Morgades M', 'Motllo C', 'Clapes V', 'Maluquer C', 'Ibarra G', 'Abril L', 'Ribera JM', 'Oriol A']",,"[""Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Departament de Medicina, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.

In this study, we used proteomics to screen differentially expressed protein profiles in NB4 cells before and after ATPR treatment in vitro. We analyzed the peptides digested from total cellular proteins by reverse phase LC-MS/MS and then performed label-free quantitative analysis. We found 27 significantly up-regulated proteins in the ATPR group compared to the control group. NCF1 was the most significantly changed protein. Immunoprecipitation and double immunofluorescent staining showed that EBP50 bind to NCF1. We further explored the potential molecular mechanism of EBP50/NCF1 complex in ATPR-induced differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest. The results showed that ATPR remarkably reduced the expression of EBP50 in vivo and in vitro. Interestingly, the reduction of EBP50 contributed to ROS release by modulating the subcellular localization of NCF1. The reduction of EBP50 also contributed to G0/G1 phase arrest by inhibiting CyclinD1, CyclinA2 and CDK4, as well as promoting the differentiation of NB4 cells by increasing the expression of CD11b. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of EBP50 restrained the effects of ATPR on differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest in NB4 cells. These results suggest that ATPR-induced differentiation and G0/G1 phase arrest in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) by repressing EBP50/NCF1 complex to promote the production of ROS, and the results from in vivo experiments were consistent with those from in vitro studies. Therefore, our finding results suggest that EBP50 may be a new target for ATPR in the treatment of APL.","['Feng, Yubin', 'Niu, Ruowen', 'Cheng, Xin', 'Wang, Ke', 'Du, Yan', 'Peng, Xiaoqing', 'Chen, Feihu']","['Feng Y', 'Niu R', 'Cheng X', 'Wang K', 'Du Y', 'Peng X', 'Chen F']",,"['The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Major Autoimmune Diseases of Anhui Province, Anhui Institute of Innovative Drugs, School of Pharmacy, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; The Key Laboratory of Anti-inflammatory and Immune Medicines, Ministry of Education, Hefei, Anhui, China.

The present study was commenced to determine whether higher HTLV-1 PVL is associated with end stage kidney disease (ESKD) in Indigenous Australians. A case-control study was conducted in Alice Springs Hospital (ASH), 1 July 2007 to 30 November 2015. Cases included all 80 Indigenous adults (>17 years) with HTLV-1c and ESKD, matched 1:1 by sex to controls with HTLV-1 who had no renal disease or other recognised disease associations of HTLV-1, and were recruited during the same period. The association between PVL and ESKD was assessed using logistic regression. Median (IQR) HTLV-1c PVL for subjects with ESKD (6.86, IQR (3.35, 8.23) log copies per 10(5) peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) (ie, 0.95; IQR, 0.03; 3.70% PBL) was significantly higher than that of the asymptomatic group (3.47; IQR (-0.04, 6.61) log copies per 10 (5) PBL (ie, 0.01; IQR, 0.00; 0.52% PBL) (asymptomatic vs ESKD, P (ranksum) < .001). Major factors associated with ESKD were diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 21.80; 95% CI, 4.84, 98.22; P < .001), hypertension (aOR, 4.16; 1.11, 15.64; P = .03), remote residence (aOR, 5.34; 95% CI, 1.17, 27.29; P = .03) and HTLV-1c PVL greater than or equal to 100 copies per 10 (5) PBL (aOR, 3.67; 95% CI, 1.36, 9.92; P = .01). Higher HTLV-1c PVL are strongly associated with inflammatory diseases. The high HTLV-1c PVL reported here may have clinical implications for people with HTLV-1 who require haemodialysis.

The vitamin K derivatives exhibit potent cytotoxicity against several cancer cell lines through ROS induction and mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated vitamin K3-inspired derivatives as potential apoptotic inducers and analyzed their mechanisms beyond apoptosis. The cytotoxicity of a panel of vitamin K3 analogs was screened against 10 doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines overexpressing ATP-binding cassette transporters (P-glycoprotein, ABCB5, BCRP) or oncogenes (DeltaEGFR) or with knockout of tumor suppressors (p53), Cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell migration, and microtubule formation were further investigated. The online tool SwissTargetPrediction was utilized for target prediction. Among the screened compounds, one vitamin K3 thio-derivative (No. 45, VKT-1) exhibited the most potent cytotoxicity specifically against both drug-sensitive and -resistant cancer cell lines. In addition, VKT-1 arrested the cells at the G2/M phase and induced apoptosis as detected by flow cytometry. As predicted by SwissTargetPrediction, VKT-1 targeted microtubule-associated tau protein. Indeed, VKT-1 dramatically inhibited cell migration and microtubule formation in vitro. In conclusion, the synthetic vitamin K3 thio-derivative (VKT-1) inhibited doxorubicin-sensitive and -resistant tumor cells by cell arrest, apoptosis induction, as well as, migration inhibition, and microtubule deterioration of U2OS-GFP-alpha-tubulin cells.","['Hegazy, Mohamed-Elamir F', 'Fukaya, Masashi', 'Dawood, Mona', 'Yan, Ge', 'Klinger, Anette', 'Fleischer, Edmond', 'Zaglool, Asmaa W', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Hegazy MF', 'Fukaya M', 'Dawood M', 'Yan G', 'Klinger A', 'Fleischer E', 'Zaglool AW', 'Efferth T']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2637-1681'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudingerweg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Chemistry of Medicinal Plants Department, National Research Centre, 33 El-Bohouth St., Dokki, Giza, 12622, Egypt.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Washington State University, Pullman, WA, 99164-6340, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudingerweg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudingerweg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'MicroCombiChem GmbH, Wiesbaden, Germany.', 'Department of Animal Wealth Development, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Zagazig University, El-Zeraa str. 114, Zagazig, 44511, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Staudingerweg 5, 55128, Mainz, Germany. efferth@uni-mainz.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190629,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Tubulin)', '723JX6CXY5 (Vitamin K 3)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Vitamin K 3/*pharmacology']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2021/06/02 06:00,['2019/06/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-019-00810-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-019-00810-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2020 Jun;38(3):650-661. doi: 10.1007/s10637-019-00810-7.

In a past decade stem cell therapy is highly emerged and displayed tremendous potential for the treatment of a wide range of diseases and disorders such as blindness and vision impairment, type I diabetes, infertility, HIV, etc. SCs are very susceptible to destruction after transplantation into the host because of the inability to sustain elevated stress conditions inside the damaged tissue/organ. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones/stress proteins expressed in response to stress (elevated temperature, harmful chemicals, ischemia, viruses, etc) inside a living cell. HSPs protect the cell from damage by assisting in the proper folding of cellular proteins. This review briefly summarises different types of HSPs, their classification, cellular functions as well as the role of HSPs in regulating SC self-renewal and survival in the transplanted host. Applications of HSP modulated SCs in regenerative medicine and for the treatment of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction (MI), osteoarthritis, ischemic stroke, spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), leukemia, hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury, Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are discussed. In order to provide potential insights in understanding molecular mechanisms related to SCs in vertebrates, correlations between HSPs and SCs in cnidarians and planarians are also reviewed. There is a need to advance research in order to validate the use of HSPs for SC therapy and establish effective treatment strategies.","['Shende, Pravin', 'Bhandarkar, Sayali', 'Prabhakar, Bala']","['Shende P', 'Bhandarkar S', 'Prabhakar B']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8144-7645'],"[""Shobhaben Pratapbhai Patel School of Pharmacy and Technology Management, SVKM's NMIMS, V.L.

Variants associated with T2D are often located in tissue-specific enhancer clusters or super-enhancers. So far, such domains have been defined through clustering of enhancers in linear genome maps rather than in three-dimensional (3D) space. Furthermore, their target genes are often unknown. We have created promoter capture Hi-C maps in human pancreatic islets. This linked diabetes-associated enhancers to their target genes, often located hundreds of kilobases away. It also revealed >1,300 groups of islet enhancers, super-enhancers and active promoters that form 3D hubs, some of which show coordinated glucose-dependent activity. We demonstrate that genetic variation in hubs impacts insulin secretion heritability, and show that hub annotations can be used for polygenic scores that predict T2D risk driven by islet regulatory variants. Human islet 3D chromatin architecture, therefore, provides a framework for interpretation of T2D genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals.","['Miguel-Escalada, Irene', 'Bonas-Guarch, Silvia',

Both proteins contain a bromodomain (BrD) adjacent to the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) catalytic domain, which serves as a promising drug target for cancers and immune system disorders. Several potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors targeting CBP BrD have been reported, but thus far small-molecule inhibitors targeting BrD outside of the BrD and extraterminal domain (BET) family are especially lacking. Here, we established and optimized a TR-FRET-based high-throughput screening platform for the CBP BrD and acetylated H4 peptide. Through an HTS assay against an in-house chemical library containing 20 000 compounds, compound DC_CP20 was discovered as a novel CBP BrD inhibitor with an IC50 value of 744.3 nM. This compound bound to CBP BrD with a KD value of 4.01 muM in the surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling revealed that DC_CP20 occupied the Kac-binding region firmly through hydrogen bonding with the conserved residue N1168. At the celluslar level, DC_CP20 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of human leukemia MV4-11 cells with an IC50 value of 19.2 muM and markedly downregulated the expression of the c-Myc in the cells. Taken together, the discovery of CBP BrD inhibitor DC_CP20 provides a novel chemical scaffold for further medicinal chemistry optimization and a potential chemical probe for CBP-related biological function research. In addition, this inhibitor may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for MLL leukemia by targeting CBP BrD protein.","['Zhang, Feng-Cai', 'Sun, Zhong-Ya', 'Liao, Li-Ping', 'Zuo, Yu', 'Zhang,

Despite becoming the standard of care in certain clinical settings, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy, a proportion of patients do not respond while others actually progress during treatment. Therefore, there is a clinical need to identify accurate predictive biomarkers and to develop novel therapeutic strategies based on ICIs. Although they have limitations, the current markers evaluated to select which patients will undergo ICI treatment are the levels of PD-L1 and the tumor mutational burden. In this paper we describe what is currently known about the dynamic interaction between the cancer cell and the immune system during carcinogenesis, with a particular focus on the description of the functions and gene alterations that preclude the host immunoresponse in NSCLC. We emphasize the deleterious gene alterations in components of the major histocompatibility complex (HLA-I or B2M) and of the response to IFNgamma (such as JAK2) which are mutually exclusive and can affect up to one fifth of the NSCLCs. The participation of other gene alterations, such as those of common oncogenes and tumor suppressors, and of the epigenetic alterations will also be discussed, in detail. Finally, we discuss the potential use of the tumor's genetic profile to predict sensitivity to ICIs.","['Saigi, Maria', 'Alburquerque-Bejar, Juan J', 'Sanchez-Cespedes, Montse']","['Saigi M', 'Alburquerque-Bejar JJ', 'Sanchez-Cespedes M']",,"['Genes and Cancer Group, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Department of Medical Oncology, Catalan Institute of Oncology (ICO), Avda Gran via, 199-203.

Here we examine 16 histone H3 genes in 434 primary AML samples and identify Q69H, A26P, R2Q, R8H and K27M/I mutations (1.6%), with higher incidence in secondary AML (9%). These mutations occur in pre-leukemic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and exist in the major leukemic clones in patients. They increase the frequency of functional HSCs, alter differentiation, and amplify leukemic aggressiveness. These effects are dependent on the specific mutation. H3K27 mutation increases the expression of genes involved in erythrocyte and myeloid differentiation with altered H3K27 tri-methylation and K27 acetylation. The functional impact of histone mutations is independent of RUNX1 mutation, although they at times co-occur. This study establishes that H3 mutations are drivers of human pre-cancerous stem cell expansion and important early events in leukemogenesis.","['Boileau, Meaghan', 'Shirinian, Margret', 'Gayden,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a retrospective analysis of outcomes of 606 patients with CLL who underwent RIC allogeneic HCT between 2008 and 2014 reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research. RESULTS: On the basis of multivariable models, disease status, comorbidity index, lymphocyte count, and white blood cell count at HCT were selected for the development of prognostic model. Using the prognostic score, we stratified patients into low-, intermediate-, high-, and very-high-risk [4-year progression-free survival (PFS) 58%, 42%, 33%, and 25%, respectively, P < 0.0001; 4-year overall survival (OS) 70%, 57%, 54%, and 38%, respectively, P < 0.0001]. We also evaluated karyotypic abnormalities together with del(17p) and found that del(17p) or >/=5 abnormalities showed inferior PFS. Using a multivariable model, we classified cytogenetic risk into low, intermediate, and high (P < 0.0001). When the prognostic score and cytogenetic risk were combined, patients with low prognostic score and low cytogenetic risk had prolonged PFS (61% at 4 years) and OS (75% at 4 years). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of patients with previously treated CLL who underwent RIC HCT, we developed a robust prognostic scoring system of HCT outcomes and a novel cytogenetic-based risk stratification system. These prognostic models can be used for counseling patients, comparing data across studies, and providing a benchmark for future interventions. For future study, we will further validate these models for patients receiving targeted therapies prior to HCT.","['Kim, Haesook T', 'Ahn, Kwang Woo', 'Hu, Zhen-Huan', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Volpe, Virginia O', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Press, Oliver', 'Pidala, Joseph', 'Hogan, William', 'Negrin, Robert', 'Devine, Steven', 'Uberti, Joseph', 'Agura, Edward', 'Nash, Richard', 'Mehta, Jayesh', 'McGuirk, Joseph', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Langston, Amelia', 'Giralt, Sergio A', 'Perales, Miguel-Angel', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Hale, Gregory A', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Marks, David I', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Ganguly, Sid', 'Bacher, Ulrike', 'Lazarus, Hillard', 'Reshef, Ran', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Inamoto, Yoshihiro', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Solh, Melhem', 'Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Ghosh, Nilanjan', 'Saad, Ayman', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Schouten, Harry C', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Pawarode, Attaphol', 'Kindwall-Keller, Tamila', 'Saba, Nakhle', 'Copelan, Edward A', 'Nathan, Sunita', 'Beitinjaneh, Amer', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Cerny, Jan', 'Grunwald, Michael R', 'Yared, Jean', 'Wirk, Baldeep M', 'Nishihori, Taiga', 'Chhabra, Saurabh', 'Olsson, Richard F', 'Bashey, Asad', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Popat, Uday', 'Sobecks, Ronald', 'Alyea, Edwin', 'Saber, Wael', 'Brown, Jennifer R']","['Kim HT', 'Ahn KW', 'Hu ZH', 'Davids MS', 'Volpe VO', 'Antin JH', 'Sorror ML', 'Shadman M', 'Press O', 'Pidala J', 'Hogan W', 'Negrin R', 'Devine S', 'Uberti J', 'Agura E', 'Nash R', 'Mehta J', 'McGuirk J', 'Forman S', 'Langston A', 'Giralt SA', 'Perales MA', 'Battiwalla M', 'Hale GA', 'Gale RP', 'Marks DI', 'Hamadani M', 'Ganguly S', 'Bacher U', 'Lazarus H', 'Reshef R', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Inamoto Y', 'Cahn JY', 'Solh M', 'Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Ghosh N', 'Saad A', 'Aljurf M', 'Schouten HC', 'Hill BT', 'Pawarode A', 'Kindwall-Keller T', 'Saba N', 'Copelan EA', 'Nathan S', 'Beitinjaneh A', 'Savani BN', 'Cerny J', 'Grunwald MR', 'Yared J', 'Wirk BM', 'Nishihori T', 'Chhabra S', 'Olsson RF', 'Bashey A', 'Gergis U', 'Popat U', 'Sobecks R', 'Alyea E', 'Saber W', 'Brown JR']",,"['Department of Data Sciences, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts. htkimc@jimmy.harvard.edu wsaber@mcw.edu.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Institute for Health and Society, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'CIBMTR (Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research), Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology's Neag Cancer Center, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, Connecticut."", 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, H.

AMG 232 was administered orally once daily for 7 days every 2 weeks (7 on/off) at 60, 120, 240, 360, 480, or 960 mg as monotherapy (arm 1) or at 60 mg with trametinib 2 mg (arm 2). Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), adverse events (AEs), pharmacokinetics, clinical and pharmacodynamic response, and expression of p53 target genes were assessed. All 36 patients received AMG 232. No DLTs occurred in arm 1, and 360 mg was the highest test dose; dose escalation was halted due to gastrointestinal AEs at higher doses. One of ten patients in arm 2 had a DLT (grade 3 fatigue); 60 mg was the highest dose tested with trametinib. Common treatment-related AEs (any grade) included nausea (58%), diarrhea (56%), vomiting (33%), and decreased appetite (25%). AMG 232 exhibited linear pharmacokinetics unaffected by coadministration with trametinib. Serum macrophage inhibitor cytokine-1 and bone marrow expression of BAX, PUMA, P21, and MDM2 increased during treatment. Of 30 evaluable patients, 1 achieved complete remission, 4 had morphologic leukemia-free state, and 1 had partial remission. Four of 13 (31%) TP53-wild-type patients and 0 of 3 (0%) TP53-mutant patients were responders. AMG 232 was associated with gastrointestinal AEs at higher doses but had acceptable pharmacokinetics, on-target effects, and promising clinical activity warranting further investigation in patients with relapsed/refractory AML.

A series of carbazoloquinones including murrayaquinone A, koeniginequinones A and B, and related analogues were therefore prepared. Palladium-catalyzed intramolecular cyclization reaction mechanism was well elucidated by DFT calculations. Treatment of the synthesized derivatives showed cytotoxicity on human leukemia HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent fashion.

Hematologic malignancies are ideally suited to targeted alpha-therapy because of easy accessibility of malignant cells in blood and bone marrow and their radiosensitivity. METHODS: A series of clinical trials were conducted to assess the safety and antileukemic effects of lintuzumab, an anti-CD33 antibody, labeled with the alpha-emitters bismuth-213 ((213)Bi) and actinium-225 ((225)Ac) in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RESULTS: Initial studies showed that (213)Bi-lintuzumab had antileukemic activity and could produce remissions after partial cytoreduction with cytarabine. A phase I trial demonstrated that a single infusion of (225)Ac-lintuzumab could be given safely at doses up to 111 kBq/kg with antileukemic activity at all dose levels studied. A second phase I study showed that 28% of older patients with untreated AML had objective responses after receiving fractionated-dose (225)Ac-lintuzumab and low-dose cytarabine. A phase II study of (225)Ac-lintuzumab monotherapy in this population produced remissions in 69% of patients receiving two fractions of 74 kBq/kg and 22% of patients receiving two 55.5-kBq/kg fractions. CONCLUSIONS: Studies with (213)Bi-lintuzumab provided proof of principle for systemically administered alpha-particle therapy. (225)Ac-lintuzumab was active against advanced AML and produced remissions in older patients with untreated AML in combination with low-dose cytarabine and as a single agent. These studies provide the rationale for development of (225)Ac-lintuzumab in combination with a variety of agents in AML and in other hematologic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome and multiple myeloma.","['Jurcic, Joseph G']",['Jurcic JG'],,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.

STUDY DESIGN: Analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Hematology, Chongqing Three Gorges Central Hospital, China, from January 2016 to January 2018. METHODOLOGY: Eighty patients with CML were randomly divided into the nilotinib group (treated with nilotinib) and the imatinib group (treated with imatinib), 40 patients in each group. The therapeutic effects of the two groups of patients were compared. RESULTS: After months of treatment, the neutrophilic granulocytes and neutrophilic metamyelocyte, serum interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) levels in nilotinib group were lower than those in imatinib group (p=0.002, p<0.001, p=0.027, p=<0.001 and p=0.001, respectively); the proportion of patients with BCR-ABLIS <10% in nilotinib group and the proportion of patients with BCR-ABLIS <0.0032% were higher than those in imatinib group (p=0.032 and 0.043, respectively). During treatment period, there was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions such as mild liver damage, nausea and vomiting, rash, musculoskeletal pain and edema between two groups (p = 0.556, 0.396, 0.576, 0.775 and 0.390, respectively).

For its oncogenic function, most MLL-fusion proteins exploit the multienzyme super elongation complex leading to elevated expression of MLL target genes. High expression of MLL target genes overwrites the normal hematopoietic differentiation program, resulting in undifferentiated blasts characterized by the capacity to self-renew. Although extensive resources devoted to increased understanding of therapeutic targets to overcome de-differentiation in ALL/AML, the inter-dependencies of targets are still not well described. The majority of inhibitors potentially interfering with MLL-fusion protein driven transformation have been characterized in individual studies, which so far hindered their direct cross-comparison. METHODS: In our study, we characterized head-to-head clinical stage inhibitors for BET, DHODH, DOT1L as well as two novel inhibitors for CDK9 and the Menin-MLL interaction with a focus on differentiation induction. We profiled those inhibitors for global gene expression effects in a large cell line panel and examined cellular responses such as inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis induction, cell cycle arrest, surface marker expression, morphological phenotype changes, and phagocytosis as functional differentiation readout. We also verified the combination potential of those inhibitors on proliferation and differentiation level. RESULTS: Our analysis revealed significant differences in differentiation induction and in modulating MLL-fusion target gene expression. We observed Menin-MLL and DOT1L inhibitors act very specifically on MLL-fused leukemia cell lines, whereas inhibitors of BET, DHODH and P-TEFb have strong effects beyond MLL-fusions. Significant differentiation effects were detected for Menin-MLL, DOT1L, and DHODH inhibitors, whereas BET and CDK9 inhibitors primarily induced apoptosis in AML/ALL cancer models. For the first time, we explored combination potential of the abovementioned inhibitors with regards to overcoming the differentiation blockage. CONCLUSION: Our findings show substantial diversity in the molecular activities of those inhibitors and provide valuable insights into the further developmental potential as single agents or in combinations in MLL-fused leukemia.","['Brzezinka, Krzysztof', 'Nevedomskaya, Ekaterina', 'Lesche, Ralf', 'Steckel, Michael', 'Eheim, Ashley L', 'Haegebarth, Andrea', 'Stresemann, Carlo']","['Brzezinka K', 'Nevedomskaya E', 'Lesche R', 'Steckel M', 'Eheim AL', 'Haegebarth A', 'Stresemann C']",,"['Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany.', 'Pharmaceuticals, Research & Development, Bayer AG, Muellerstrasse 178, 13353, Berlin, Germany. carlo.stresemann@bayer.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190628,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Maps/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism']",PMC6599250,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/06/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0749-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0749-y [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Jun 28;12(1):66. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0749-y.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*BET', '*DHODH', '*DOT1L', '*MLL-fusion', '*Menin-MLL', '*P-TEFb', '*Small molecule inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,

Although venetoclax/ABT-199 also caused cell death in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), whether it could be applied to clinical treatment needs further studies. Here, we revealed clinical implication of BCL2 overexpression in de novo adult AML, and may provide theoretical basis for targeted therapy using venetoclax. METHODS: BCL2 expression was analyzed in adult AML patients from public datasets The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and confirmed by another independent cohort from our own data. RESULTS: BCL2 expression showed up-regulated in AML patients among TCGA data and confirmed by our own data. BCL2 overexpression was correlated with FAB-M0/M1, whereas BCL2 under-expression was related to FAB-M5. However, BCL2 expression has no effect on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of AML patients (determined in BCL2(low) and BCL2(high) groups). Interestingly, in the BCL2(low) group, patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto/allo-HSCT) had significantly better OS and LFS compared with patients only received chemotherapy, whereas, no significant difference was found in OS and LFS between chemotherapy and auto/allo-HSCT patients in the BCL2(high) group. BCL2 expression was found positively correlated with HOX family gene, and negatively correlated with tumor suppressor microRNA such as miR-195, miR-497, and miR-193b. CONCLUSIONS: BCL2 overexpression identified specific FAB subtypes of AML, but it did not affect prognosis. Patients with BCL2 overexpression did not benefit from auto/allo-HSCT among whole-cohort-AML and cytogenetically normal AML.","['Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Gu, Yu', 'Ma,

BCR-ABL-driven K562 and KCL-22 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of imatinib to preliminarily test drug sensitivity. Then untreated and treated cells were analyzed for levels of BCR-ABL signaling mediators and key proteins of glycolytic cascade and oxidative phosphorylation. Effective inhibition of BCR-ABL caused a concomitant reduction of p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, phosphorylated form of STAT3 (at Tyr705 and Ser727), c-Myc and cyclin D1 along with an increase of cleaved PARP and caspase 3 at 48 h after treatment. Furthermore, a strong reduction of the hexokinase II (HKII), phosphorylated form of PKM2 (at Tyr105 and Ser37) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) was observed in response to imatinib along with a strong upregulation of mitochondrial complexes (OXPHOS). According to these findings, a significant reduction of glucose consumption and lactate secretion along with an increase of intracellular ATP levels was observed in response to imatinib. Our findings indicate that imatinib treatment of BCR-ABL-driven human leukemia cells reactivates mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation thus allowing potential co-targeting of BCR-ABL and OXPHOS.","['De Rosa, Viviana', 'Monti, Marcello', 'Terlizzi, Cristina', 'Fonti, Rosa', 'Del Vecchio, Silvana', 'Iommelli, Francesca']","['De Rosa V', 'Monti M', 'Terlizzi C', 'Fonti R', 'Del Vecchio S', 'Iommelli F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0430-5608', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5466-1213', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5132-3593']","['Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, National Research Council, 80145 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80131 Naples, Italy.', 'Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, National Research Council, 80145 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Advanced Biomedical Sciences, University of Naples ""Federico II"", 80131 Naples, Italy. delvecc@unina.it.', 'Institute of Biostructures and Bioimaging, National Research Council, 80145 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190627,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Glycolysis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/*drug effects', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism']",PMC6651622,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/30 06:00'],"['2019/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20133134 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20133134 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 27;20(13). pii: ijms20133134. doi: 10.3390/ijms20133134.,13,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'OXPHOS', 'aerobic glycolysis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is an enzootic, exogenous, and oncogenic retrovirus that causes B-cell leukosis in 1-5% of infected cattle. The current study aimed at evaluating the correlation between BLV infection and breast cancer in an Iranian population. MATERIALS AND TECHNIQUES: A total of 400 samples including 200 breast cancer-suspected tissue samples and 200 blood samples of women without breast cancer, were collected from July 2017 to October 2018 from women referred to two general hospitals in Qom Province, Iran. The nested PCR technique was performed to determine the presence of tax and gag gene of BLV in the collected samples. RESULTS: Out of 200 breast cancer-suspected tissue samples, 172 samples were malignant in terms of pathology. Other samples were reported as non-malignant and non-tumor. Based on nested PCR technique, tax and gag genes of BLV were detected in 30% and 8% of breast cancer-suspected tissue samples, respectively. The frequency of BLV in blood samples collected from women without breast cancer was 16.5% (33/200). CONCLUSION: It seems that human breast cancer and BLV infection in cattle could be associated using nested PCR technique.","['Khalilian, Mohaddeseh', 'Hosseini, Seyed Masoud', 'Madadgar, Omid']","['Khalilian M', 'Hosseini SM', 'Madadgar O']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Microbial Biotechnology, Faculty of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Microbial Biotechnology, Faculty of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shahid Beheshti University, Tehran, Iran.

However, the domain on DPY30 that regulates cancer growth is not evident, and the potential of pharmacologically targeting this chromatin modulator to inhibit cancer has not been explored. Here we have developed a peptide-based strategy to specifically target DPY30 activity. We have designed cell-penetrating peptides derived from ASH2L that can either bind to DPY30 or show defective or enhanced binding to DPY30. The DPY30-binding peptides specifically inhibit DPY30's activity in interacting with ASH2L and enhancing H3K4 methylation. Treatment with the DPY30-binding peptides significantly inhibited the growth of MLL-rearranged leukemia and other MYC-dependent hematologic cancer cells. We also revealed subsets of genes that may mediate the effect of the peptides on cancer cell growth, and showed that the DPY30-binding peptide sensitized leukemia to other types of epigenetic inhibitors. These results strongly support a critical role of the ASH2L-binding groove of DPY30 in promoting blood cancers, and demonstrate a proof-of-principle for the feasibility of pharmacologically targeting the ASH2L-binding groove of DPY30 for potential cancer inhibition.","['Shah, Kushani K', 'Whitaker, Robert H', 'Busby, Theodore', 'Hu, Jing', 'Shi, Bi', 'Wang, Zhenjia', 'Zang, Chongzhi', 'Placzek, William J', 'Jiang, Hao']","['Shah KK', 'Whitaker RH', 'Busby T', 'Hu J', 'Shi B', 'Wang Z', 'Zang C', 'Placzek WJ', 'Jiang H']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, 35294, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, 35294, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, 35294, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, 35294, United States; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Center for Public Health Genomics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA; Center for Public Health Genomics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA; Department of Public Health Sciences, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, 35294, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, Birmingham, AL, 35294, United States; Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.

With the exception of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, there are no effective treatments to cure ATL, and ATL cells often acquire resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. Accumulating evidence shows that development and maintenance of ATL requires key contributions from the viral protein, HTLV-1 basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ). In this study we found that HBZ activates expression of Heme Oxygenase 1 (HMOX-1), a component of the oxidative stress response that functions to detoxify free heme. Transcription of HMOX1 and other antioxidant genes is regulated by the small Mafs. These cellular basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factors control transcription by forming homo- or heterodimers among themselves or with other cellular bZIP factors that then bind Maf responsive elements (MAREs) in promoters or enhancers of antioxidant genes. Our data support a model in which HBZ activates HMOX1 transcription by forming heterodimers with the small Mafs that bind MAREs located in an upstream enhancer region. Consistent with this model, we found that HMOX-1 is upregulated in HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines and confers these cells with resistance to heme-induced cytotoxicity. In this context, HBZ-mediated activation of HMOX-1 expression may contribute to resistance of ATL cells to certain chemotherapeutic agents. We also provide evidence that HBZ counteracts oxidative stress caused by two other HTLV-1-encoded proteins, Tax and p13. Tax induces oxidative stress as a byproduct of driving mitotic expansion of infected cells, and p13 is believed to induce oxidative stress to eliminate infected cells that have become transformed.

A total of 212 patients from the HMA study and 92 patients from the LDAC study were included in the exposure-safety analyses. Those who received at least one dose of venetoclax and had at least one measurable response (201 and 83 in the HMA and LDAC studies, respectively) were included in the exposure-efficacy analyses. The probability of response based on International Working Group (IWG) for AML response criteria, adverse events of grade 3 or worse neutropenia or infection or a serious adverse event was modeled using logistic regression analyses to characterize the venetoclax exposure-response relationships. In combination with an HMA, increasing concentrations of venetoclax, up to those associated with a less than or equal to 400-mg once daily (QD) dose, were associated with a higher probability of response, with a trend for flat or decreasing probabilities of response thereafter. In combination with LDAC, increasing concentrations of venetoclax were associated with higher probabilities of response, with no plateau observed. Increasing concentrations of venetoclax were not associated with increasing probability of any safety event except for a slight increase in grade 3 or worse infections with HMAs; however, tolerability issues were observed at doses of greater than or equal to 800 mg QD in each study. Exposure-response analyses support the use of venetoclax 400 mg QD in combination with an HMA and 600 mg QD in combination with LDAC (ie, the next highest dose evaluated below 800 mg in each combination) to safely maximize the probability of response in elderly patients with newly diagnosed AML.","['Agarwal, Suresh', 'Gopalakrishnan, Sathej', 'Mensing, Sven', 'Potluri, Jalaja', 'Hayslip, John', 'Kirschbrown, Whitney', 'Friedel, Anna', 'Menon, Rajeev', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed']","['Agarwal S', 'Gopalakrishnan S', 'Mensing S', 'Potluri J', 'Hayslip J', 'Kirschbrown W', 'Friedel A', 'Menon R', 'Salem AH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9261-1583'],"['Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.', 'Oncology Development, Abbvie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Oncology Development, Abbvie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Genentech Inc, South San Francisco, California.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, AbbVie Deutschland GmbH & Co, Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, Abbvie Inc, North Chicago, Illinois.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190802,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Sulfonamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2646 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;37(4):464-473. doi: 10.1002/hon.2646.

However, there have been few population-based attempts to characterize differences between outcomes of SPMs in childhood cancer survivors and outcomes of first primary malignancies (FPMs). METHODS: Clinical and demographic information about childhood cancer survivors who developed SPMs and individuals with comparable FPMs was extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models comparing the overall survival (OS) of individuals with and without a history of childhood cancer. OS was evaluated both overall and for specific cancers diagnosed in 50 or more childhood cancer survivors. Models accounted for potential confounders, including sex, race, age, treatment decade, histology, and disease stage. RESULTS: Compared with individuals with FPMs (n = 1,332,203), childhood cancer survivors (n = 1409) with an SPM experienced poorer OS (HR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.72-2.02) after the study had accounted for cancer type, age, sex, race, and decade of diagnosis. A history of childhood cancer remained a poor prognostic factor for all specific cancers evaluated, including breast cancer (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.63-2.62), thyroid cancer (HR, 3.59; 95% CI, 2.08-6.19), acute myeloid leukemia (HR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.87-3.05), brain cancer (HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.72-2.55), melanoma (HR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.55-4.27), bone cancer (HR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.37-2.57), and soft-tissue sarcoma (HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.78-3.33). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with individuals without a prior cancer diagnosis, survivors of childhood cancer with an SPM experienced inferior outcomes. Survival disparities were observed for the most frequent SPMs diagnosed in childhood cancer survivors.","['Brown, Austin L', 'Arroyo, Vidal M', 'Agrusa, Jennifer E', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Gramatges, M Monica', 'Lupo, Philip J']","['Brown AL', 'Arroyo VM', 'Agrusa JE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Gramatges MM', 'Lupo PJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5802-5073', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0978-5863']","['Hematology-Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology-Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology-Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology-Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology-Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Hematology-Oncology Section, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190628,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Young Adult']",PMC6763352,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32356 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Oct 15;125(20):3623-3630. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32356.

The molecular basis of CLL remains unknown. Certain cytogenetic and molecular markers determine a bad prognosis in CLL. Fanconi anemia complementation (FANC) proteins have been related to chromosomal instability and alterations in the mechanisms of p53 activation, control of cell cycle, and apoptosis. We investigated the role of certain FANC proteins in CLL. Our data identified a group of patients with CLL with high expression of FANCA in peripheral B-CLL cells and we established its relationship with the deletion of 11q23 and a worse prognosis. When we investigated the molecular mechanisms of this bad prognosis, we observed a reduction in the expression of 2 p53 target genes, p21 and Np73, in CLL primary cells transfected with FANCA. Functional studies demonstrated an impairment of p53 by FANCA. Moreover, we obtained evidence of a cooperation between FANCA and the NEDD8-interacting protein NUB1L in the destabilization of p53. For the first time, FANCA is reported as a bad prognosis marker by a mechanism other than its role in the Fanconi anemia-breast cancer DNA repair pathway.-Bravo-Navas, S., Yanez, L., Romon, I., Pipaon, C.

The study was carried out using the comparative and descriptive methods, and the study group included mothers with ALL children hospitalised in the Paediatric Haematology Clinic of a university hospital (n = 51) and those with healthy children who applied to a family health centre (n = 53). While collecting the data, Personal Information Form, Resilience Scale for Adults, Life Satisfaction Scale, Zarit Care Burden Scale and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support Scale were used. The data were statistically analysed using the SPSS program, percentages, mean scores, standard deviations, Mann-Whitney U test and pearson correlation. For the comparison of the personal information about the mothers with ALL children and about those with healthy children, chi-square or student t test for independent groups depending on the data set was used.

It has been established that the tyrosine kinase domain of the BCR-ABL protein is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of CML. Although the first and second line inhibitors against the enzyme are available, recent studies have indicated that monotherapeutic resistance has become a great challenge. OBJECTIVE: In recent studies, the dual inhibition of BCR-ABL by Nilotinib and Asciminib has been shown to overcome drug resistance. This prompted us to investigate the dynamics behind this novel drug combination. METHODS: By the utilization of a wide range of computational tools, we defined and compared BCR-ABL's structural and dynamic characteristics when bound as a dual inhibitor system. RESULTS: Conformational ensemble analysis presented a sustained inactive protein, as the activation loop, inclusive of the characteristic Tyr257, remained in an open position due to the unassailable binding of Asciminib at the allosteric site. Nilotinib also indicated stronger binding at the catalytic site in the presence of Asciminib, thus exposing new avenues in treating Nilotinib-resistance. This was in accordance with intermolecular hydrogen bond interactions with key binding site residues GLU399, Asn259 and Thr252. CONCLUSION: The investigations carried out in this study gave rise to new possibilities in the treatment of resistance in CML, as well as assisting in the design of novel and selective inhibitors as dual anti-cancer drugs.","['Elrashedy, Ahmed A', 'Ramharack, Pritika', 'Soliman, Mahmoud E S']","['Elrashedy AA', 'Ramharack P', 'Soliman MES']",,"['Molecular Bio-Computation and Drug Design Laboratory, School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville Campus, Durban 4001, South Africa.', 'Molecular Bio-Computation and Drug Design Laboratory, School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville Campus, Durban 4001, South Africa.', 'Molecular Bio-Computation and Drug Design Laboratory, School of Health Sciences, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Westville Campus, Durban 4001, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (asciminib)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Niacinamide/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thermodynamics']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-99105 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190620120144 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(13):1642-1650. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190620120144.,13,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL1', '*CML therapy', '*Dual inhibition', '*allosteric inhibition', '*anti-cancer drugs', '*synergistic duality.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Reported rates of arrhythmia are variable in different studies. The aim of the current analysis was to evaluate the incidence of AF in a single-center cohort of patients. METHODS: This analysis was conducted at Hunter New England Local Health District, Australia between April 1, 2015 and June 30, 2017. We included all consecutive patients commenced on ibrutinib for hematological malignancies. Patients with a history of paroxysmal AF were excluded. The primary end point was incidence of AF. Time to diagnosis and management were secondary outcomes of interest. RESULTS: A total of 24 patients (age 73 +/- 9 years, males n = 16 [67%]) were commenced on ibrutinib treatment during the study period with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 21, 88%) as the main indication. During a median follow-up of 12 months, four (17%) patients were diagnosed with AF with increasing age, duration of ibrutinib treatment as associations. The median time to AF diagnosis was 9 (interquartile range [IQR]: 7-18) months. All patients were managed with a rate control strategy with beta blockers as the preferred agents. Three (75%) patients were commenced on anticoagulation for stroke prevention. During a follow-up of 18 (IQR: 17-23) months following AF onset, one patient required hospitalization for AF. There were no bleeding complications reported. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, this series noted a higher incidence of AF than previously reported. Oncologists and cardiologists need to be aware of the increased risk of AF in patients receiving ibrutinib.","['Ezad, Saad', 'Khan, Arshad A', 'Cheema, Hooria', 'Ashraf, Asma', 'Ngo, Doan T M', 'Sverdlov, Aaron L', 'Collins, Nicholas J']","['Ezad S', 'Khan AA', 'Cheema H', 'Ashraf A', 'Ngo DTM', 'Sverdlov AL', 'Collins NJ']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2539-8038'],"['Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hematology Department, Calvary Mater Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hematology Department, Calvary Mater Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Cardiovascular Department, John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190628,Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Atrial Fibrillation/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Piperidines', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Survival Rate']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.13179 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2019 Oct;15(5):e187-e190. doi: 10.1111/ajco.13179.

The disease developed after a median age of 10 years (IQR 4.9-12) from transplantation. Anemia was the most common presentation (62.5%) followed by lymphocytosis (43.7%) and thrombocytopenia (31.2%). Splenomegaly was reported in 43.7% of the patients. Eight patients (50%) who experienced severe symptoms were treated with non-specific immunosuppressive agents. Six of them (75%) had a good outcome, whereas two (25%) remained red blood cell transfusion dependent. No cases progressed to aggressive T-LGL leukemia or died of cancer at the end of follow-up.

The highest both antioxidant (25.69 mumol TE g(-1) DW) and immunomodulatory activities were observed in the sulfated polysaccharides of L. ochroleuca compared to that of P. umbilicalis and G. corneum. Sulfated polysaccharides of L. ochroleuca presented high potential anticancer activity in cell lines of human colon cancer HTC-116 (IC50 = 0.44 mg mL(-1)), human malignant melanoma G-361 (IC50 = 5.42 mg mL(-1)), breast adenocarcinoma human MCF-7 (IC50 = 8.32 mg mL(-1)), and human leukemia U-937 (IC50 = 3.72 mg mL(-1)). It is concluded that metabolites of L. ochroleuca can offer significant advantages for the pharmaceutical industry, particularly when macrophage activation is required.","['Abdala Diaz, Roberto T', 'Casas Arrojo, V', 'Arrojo Agudo, M A', 'Cardenas, C', 'Dobretsov, S', 'Figueroa, F L']","['Abdala Diaz RT', 'Casas Arrojo V', 'Arrojo Agudo MA', 'Cardenas C', 'Dobretsov S', 'Figueroa FL']",,"['Ecology Department, Faculty of Sciences, Malaga University, Campus de Teatinos s/n, CP 29071, Malaga, Spain. abdala@uma.es.', 'Ecology Department, Faculty of Sciences, Malaga University, Campus de Teatinos s/n, CP 29071, Malaga, Spain.', 'Ecology Department, Faculty of Sciences, Malaga University, Campus de Teatinos s/n, CP 29071, Malaga, Spain.', 'Biochemistry Department, Faculty of Sciences, Malaga University, Campus de Teatinos s/n, CP 29071, Malaga, Spain.', 'Department of Marine Science and Fisheries, College of Agricultural and Marine Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, PO Box 34, 123, Al Khoud, Muscat, Oman.', 'Center of Excellence in Marine Biotechnology, Sultan Qaboos University, PO Box 50, 123, Al Khoud, Muscat, Oman.', 'Ecology Department, Faculty of Sciences, Malaga University, Campus de Teatinos s/n, CP 29071, Malaga, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190627,United States,Mar Biotechnol (NY),"Marine biotechnology (New York, N.Y.)",100892712,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (interleukin-6, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology', 'Laminaria/*chemistry', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Polysaccharides/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Porphyra/*chemistry', 'RAW 264.7 Cells', 'Rhodophyta/*chemistry', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/immunology']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10126-019-09905-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10126-019-09905-x [pii]']",ppublish,Mar Biotechnol (NY). 2019 Aug;21(4):577-587. doi: 10.1007/s10126-019-09905-x.

METHODS: Intraperitoneal delivery of rAMH and ovarian post-receptor activity were assessed with immunohistochemistry and western blot. Differential follicle counts and reproductive outcomes were assessed after cyclophosphamide (Cy) administration, with/without concurrent administration of rAMH. Interference of rAMH with Cy chemotoxicity was assessed on a human breast cancer cell line and an in vivo mouse model of human leukaemia. RESULTS: rAMH reached the ovary after intraperitoneal injection and demonstrated post-receptor bioactivity. Cy administration in mice caused primordial follicle activation, as shown by a decrease in primordial follicle population accompanied by an increase in early growing follicles and granulosa cell proliferation. Co-administration of rAMH reduced follicle activation, thereby protecting the primordial follicle reserve, and improving long-term fertility and reproductive outcomes. rAMH co-administration did not interfere with the cytotoxic actions of Cy in vitro on breast cancer cell line or in vivo in a model of human leukaemia. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that rAMH is bioactive in the ovary for a limited time, and that pharmacological administration of rAMH during chemotherapy treatment reduces follicle activation and primordial follicle loss and significantly improves reproductive outcomes in a mouse model, and does not interfere with the therapeutic actions of the treatment. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether it has similar protective effects in the human ovary.","['Roness, H', 'Spector, I', 'Leichtmann-Bardoogo, Y', 'Savino, A M', 'Dereh-Haim, Sanaz', 'Meirow, Dror']","['Roness H', 'Spector I', 'Leichtmann-Bardoogo Y', 'Savino AM', 'Dereh-Haim S', 'Meirow D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5322-0424'],"['Fertility Preservation Research Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Centre, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Fertility Preservation Research Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Centre, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Fertility Preservation Research Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Centre, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sheba Medical Centre, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Fertility Preservation Research Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Centre, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Fertility Preservation Research Laboratory, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sheba Medical Centre, Ramat Gan, Israel. dror.meirow@sheba.health.gov.il.', 'Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. dror.meirow@sheba.health.gov.il.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190621,Netherlands,J Assist Reprod Genet,Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics,9206495,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '80497-65-0 (Anti-Mullerian Hormone)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Mullerian Hormone/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fertility Preservation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Ovarian Follicle/drug effects/pathology', 'Ovarian Reserve/*drug effects/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/pharmacology']",PMC6730972,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10815-019-01507-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10815-019-01507-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Assist Reprod Genet. 2019 Sep;36(9):1793-1803. doi: 10.1007/s10815-019-01507-9.

Our greater understanding of the biology of AML in elderly patients has led to the development of novel, lower-intensity treatment options. We present here a review of the most recent literature regarding therapeutic options available to older patients, as well as tools to help identify the right treatment for the right patient.

Especially, ALL treatment, with therapeutics such as asparaginase and steroids, increases the thrombotic risk by reduction in procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins. Replacement of deficient natural anticoagulants by administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) may have a preventive effect on the occurrence of VTE. Methods We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive children (</=18 years) with ALL, treated on the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) ALL-9 and ALL-10 protocols at the Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center between February 1997 and January 2012, to study the effect of FFP on VTE incidence, antithrombin and fibrinogen plasma levels, and VTE risk factors. Results In total, 18/205 patients developed VTE (8.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.9-12.7%). In all patients, VTE occurred after asparaginase administration. In total, 82/205 patients (40%) received FFP. FFP supplementation did not prevent VTE or alter plasma levels of antithrombin or fibrinogen. In the multivariate analysis, VTE occurred significantly more frequently in children >/=12 years (odds ratio [OR]: 3.89; 95% CI: 1.29-11.73) and treated according to the ALL-10 protocol (OR: 3.71; 95% CI: 1.13-12.17). Conclusion FFP supplementation does not seem to be beneficial in the prevention of VTE in pediatric ALL patients. In addition, age >/=12 years and treatment according to the DCOG ALL-10 protocol with intensive and prolonged administration of asparaginase in combination with prednisone are risk factors. There is a need for effective preventive strategies in ALL patients at high risk for VTE.","['Klaassen, Irene L M', 'Zuurbier, Charlotte C M', 'Hutten, Barbara A', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Schouten, A Y Netteke', 'Stokhuijzen, Eva', 'van Ommen, C Heleen']","['Klaassen ILM', 'Zuurbier CCM', 'Hutten BA', 'van den Bos C', 'Schouten AYN', 'Stokhuijzen E', 'van Ommen CH']",,"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Vascular Medicine, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190424,Germany,TH Open,TH open : companion journal to thrombosis and haemostasis,101715740,,,,PMC6524923,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/06/30 06:01,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1055/s-0039-1688412 [doi]', '180061 [pii]']",epublish,TH Open. 2019 Apr 24;3(2):e109-e116. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-1688412. eCollection 2019 Apr.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'fresh frozen plasma', 'pediatric', 'risk factors', 'venous thromboembolism']",,,,,,,,,,,

Second- (dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib) and third-generation (ponatinib) TKIs have been developed to be effective against BCR-ABL mutations making imatinib less effective. However, these treatments have been associated with arterial occlusive events. This review gathers clinical data and experiments about the pathophysiology of these arterial occlusive events with BCR-ABL TKIs. Imatinib is associated with very low rates of thrombosis, suggesting a potentially protecting cardiovascular effect of this treatment in patients with BCR-ABL CML. This protective effect might be mediated by decreased platelet secretion and activation, decreased leukocyte recruitment, and anti-inflammatory or antifibrotic effects. Clinical data have guided mechanistic studies toward alteration of platelet functions and atherosclerosis development, which might be secondary to metabolism impairment. Dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib affect endothelial cells and might induce atherogenesis through increased vascular permeability. Nilotinib also impairs platelet functions and induces hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia that might contribute to atherosclerosis development. Description of the pathophysiology of arterial thrombotic events is necessary to implement risk minimization strategies.","['Haguet, Helene', 'Douxfils, Jonathan', 'Chatelain, Christian', 'Graux, Carlos', 'Mullier, Francois', 'Dogne, Jean-Michel']","['Haguet H', 'Douxfils J', 'Chatelain C', 'Graux C', 'Mullier F', 'Dogne JM']",,"['University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), Department of Pharmacy, Namur, Belgium.', 'Universite catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Hematology Laboratory, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), Department of Pharmacy, Namur, Belgium.', 'QUALIblood s.a., Namur, Belgium.', 'University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), Department of Pharmacy, Namur, Belgium.', 'Universite catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Department of Hematology, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'Universite catholique de Louvain, CHU UCL Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center, Hematology Laboratory, Yvoir, Belgium.', 'University of Namur, Namur Thrombosis and Hemostasis Center (NTHC), Namur Research Institute for Life Sciences (NARILIS), Department of Pharmacy, Namur, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180214,Germany,TH Open,TH open : companion journal to thrombosis and haemostasis,101715740,,,,PMC6524858,2018/02/14 00:00,2018/02/14 00:01,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2017/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/02/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1055/s-0038-1624566 [doi]', '170017 [pii]']",epublish,TH Open. 2018 Feb 14;2(1):e68-e88. doi: 10.1055/s-0038-1624566. eCollection 2018 Jan.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'arterial thrombotic events', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,

This led to the discovery that glucocorticoids (GC) block early stages of tissue regeneration by the inappropriate activation of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We performed a microarray analysis to identify the changes in gene expression associated with beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) exposure during epimorphic fin regeneration. Oncofetal cripto-1 showed>eight-fold increased expression in BDP-treated regenerates. We hypothesized that the mis-expression of cripto-1 was essential for BDP to block regeneration. Expression of cripto-1 was not elevated in GR morphants in the presence of BDP indicating that cripto-1 induction was GR-dependent. Partial translational suppression of Cripto-1 in the presence of BDP restored tissue regeneration. Retinoic acid exposure prevented increased cripto-1 expression and permitted regeneration in the presence of BDP. We demonstrated that BDP exposure increased cripto-1 expression in mouse embryonic stem cells and that regulation of cripto-1 by GCs is conserved in mammals.,"['Garland, Michael A', 'Sengupta, Sumitra', 'Mathew, Lijoy K', 'Truong, Lisa', 'de Jong, Esther', 'Piersma, Aldert H', 'La Du, Jane', 'Tanguay, Robert L']","['Garland MA', 'Sengupta S', 'Mathew LK', 'Truong L', 'de Jong E', 'Piersma AH', 'La Du J', 'Tanguay RL']",,"['Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, United States.', 'Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, United States.', 'Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, United States.', 'Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, United States.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, the Netherlands.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences, Utrecht University, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, United States.', 'Department of Environmental and Molecular Toxicology, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190529,Ireland,Toxicol Rep,Toxicology reports,101630272,,,,PMC6584771,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/06/30 06:01,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.05.013 [doi]', 'S2214-7500(19)30095-2 [pii]']",epublish,Toxicol Rep. 2019 May 29;6:529-537. doi: 10.1016/j.toxrep.2019.05.013. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AEC, apical epithelial cap', 'BDP, beclomethasone dipropionate', 'Beclomethasone dipropionate', 'Cripto-1', 'DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide', 'EB, embryoid body', 'ECM, extracellular matrix', 'EMT, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase', 'Epimorphic regeneration', 'FGF, fibroblast growth factor', 'GC, glucocorticoid', 'GR, glucocorticoid receptor', 'Glucocorticoids', 'ISH, in situ hybridization', 'MIAME, Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment', 'MO, morpholino oligonucleotide', 'One-eyed pinhead', 'RA, retinoic acid', 'SEM, standard error of the mean', 'TGF-beta, transforming growth factor beta', 'Zebrafish', 'dpa, days post-amputation', 'dpf, days post-fertilization', 'eSC, embryonic stem cell', 'hpa, hours post-amputation', 'hpf, hours post-fertilization', 'mLIF, murine leukemia inhibitory factor', 'qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction', 'zf, zebrafish']",,,,,,,,,,,

Dramatic overexpression of NSD2 in t(4;14) multiple myeloma (MM) and an activating mutation of NSD2 discovered in acute lymphoblastic leukemia are significantly associated with altered gene activation, transcription, and DNA damage repair. The partner proteins through which NSD2 may influence critical cellular processes remain poorly defined. In this study, we utilized proximity-based labeling (BioID) combined with label-free quantitative MS to identify high confidence NSD2 interacting partners in MM cells. The top 24 proteins identified were involved in maintaining chromatin structure, transcriptional regulation, RNA pre-spliceosome assembly, and DNA damage. Among these, an important DNA damage regulator, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), was discovered. PARP1 and NSD2 have been found to be recruited to DNA double strand breaks upon damage and H3K36me2 marks are enriched at damage sites. We demonstrate that PARP1 regulates NSD2 via PARylation upon oxidative stress. In vitro assays suggest the PARylation significantly reduces NSD2 histone methyltransferase activity. Furthermore, PARylation of NSD2 inhibits its ability to bind to nucleosomes and further get recruited at NSD2-regulated genes, suggesting PARP1 regulates NSD2 localization and H3K36me2 balance. This work provides clear evidence of cross-talk between PARylation and histone methylation and offers new directions to characterize NSD2 function in DNA damage response, transcriptional regulation, and other pathways.","['Huang, Xiaoxiao', 'LeDuc, Richard D', 'Fornelli, Luca', 'Schunter, Alissa J', 'Bennett, Richard L', 'Kelleher, Neil L', 'Licht, Jonathan D']","['Huang X', 'LeDuc RD', 'Fornelli L', 'Schunter AJ', 'Bennett RL', 'Kelleher NL', 'Licht JD']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida 32608; Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular Biosciences, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular Biosciences, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular Biosciences, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular Biosciences, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida 32608.', 'Department of Chemistry and the Department of Molecular Biosciences, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Institute, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Florida Health Cancer Center, Gainesville, Florida 32608.

MSCs secrete an array of cytokines and express the LIFRbeta (leukemia inhibitory factor receptor) chain on their surface. Mutations in the gene coding for LIFRbeta lead to a syndrome with altered bone metabolism. LIFRbeta is one of the signaling receptor chains for cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLCF1), a neurotrophic factor known to modulate B and myeloid cell functions. We investigated its effect on MSCs induced to differentiate into osteocytes in vitro Our results indicate that CLCF1 binds mouse MSCs, triggers STAT1 and -3 phosphorylation, inhibits the up-regulation of master genes involved in the control of osteogenesis, and markedly prevents osteoblast generation and mineralization. This suggests that CLCF1 could be a target for therapeutic intervention with agents such as cytokine traps or blocking mAbs in bone diseases such as osteoporosis.","['Nahle, Sarah', 'Pasquin, Sarah', 'Laplante, Veronique', 'Rousseau, Francois', 'Sharma, Mukut', 'Gauchat, Jean-Francois']","['Nahle S', 'Pasquin S', 'Laplante V', 'Rousseau F', 'Sharma M', 'Gauchat JF']",,"['Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.', 'Novimmune SA, 1228 Plan-Les-Ouates, Switzerland.', 'Renal Division, Kansas City Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri 64128-2226.', 'Departement de Pharmacologie et Physiologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1J4, Canada.

PTPN2 is an important regulator of hematopoiesis and immune/inflammatory responses, as evidenced by loss-of-function mutations of PTPN2 in leukemia and lymphoma and knockout mice studies. Benzene is an environmental chemical that causes hematological malignancies, and its hematotoxicity arises from its bioactivation in the bone marrow to electrophilic metabolites, notably 1,4-benzoquinone, a major hematotoxic benzene metabolite. Although the molecular bases for benzene-induced leukemia are not well-understood, it has been suggested that benzene metabolites alter topoisomerases II function and thereby significantly contribute to leukemogenesis. However, several studies indicate that benzene and its hematotoxic metabolites may also promote the leukemogenic process by reacting with other targets and pathways. Interestingly, alterations of cell-signaling pathways, such as Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), have been proposed to contribute to benzene-induced malignant blood diseases. We show here that 1,4-benzoquinone directly impairs PTPN2 activity. Mechanistic and kinetic experiments with purified human PTPN2 indicated that this impairment results from the irreversible formation (k inact = 645 m(-1).s(-1)) of a covalent 1,4-benzoquinone adduct at the catalytic cysteine residue of the enzyme. Accordingly, cell experiments revealed that 1,4-benzoquinone exposure irreversibly inhibits cellular PTPN2 and concomitantly increases tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and expression of STAT1-regulated genes. Our results provide molecular and cellular evidence that 1,4-benzoquinone covalently modifies key signaling enzymes, implicating it in benzene-induced malignant blood diseases.","['Duval, Romain', 'Bui, Linh-Chi', 'Mathieu, Cecile', 'Nian, Qing', 'Berthelet, Jeremy', 'Xu, Ximing', 'Haddad, Iman', 'Vinh, Joelle', 'Dupret, Jean-Marie', 'Busi, Florent', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Rodrigues-Lima, Fernando']","['Duval R', 'Bui LC', 'Mathieu C', 'Nian Q', 'Berthelet J', 'Xu X', 'Haddad I', 'Vinh J', 'Dupret JM', 'Busi F', 'Guidez F', 'Chomienne C', 'Rodrigues-Lima F']",,"['Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Chinese Ministry of Education, School of Medicine and Pharmacy, Ocean University of China, Qingdao 266003, China.', 'ESPCI Paris, PSL Universite, USR 3149, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'ESPCI Paris, PSL Universite, USR 3149, CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, UMRS 1131, INSERM, F-75010 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, Institut de Recherche Saint-Louis, UMRS 1131, INSERM, F-75010 Paris, France; Service de Biologie Cellulaire, Assistance Publique des Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Hopital Saint Louis, F-75010 Paris, France.', 'Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, F-75013 Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190627,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['*Benzene/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics']",PMC6699853,2019/06/30 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)30135-6 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.008666 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Aug 16;294(33):12483-12494. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.008666.

Although the majority of congenital neutropenia patients respond to daily granulocyte colony stimulating factor, approximately 15 % do not respond to this cytokine at doses up to 50 mug/kg/day and approximately 15 % of patients will develop myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia. ""Maturation arrest,"" the failure of the marrow myeloid progenitors to form mature neutrophils, is a consistent feature of ELANE associated congenital neutropenia. As mutant neutrophil elastase is the cause of this abnormality, we hypothesized that ELANE associated neutropenia could be treated and ""maturation arrest"" corrected by a CRISPR/Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein mediated ELANE knockout. To examine this hypothesis, we used induced pluripotent stem cells from two congenital neutropenia patients and primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from four congenital neutropenia patients harboring ELANE mutations as well as HL60 cells expressing mutant ELANE We observed that granulocytic differentiation of ELANE knockout induced pluripotent stem cells and primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were comparable to healthy individuals. Phagocytic functions, ROS production, and chemotaxis of the ELANE KO (knockout) neutrophils were also normal. Knockdown of ELANE in the mutant ELANE expressing HL60 cells also allowed full maturation and formation of abundant neutrophils. These observations suggest that ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 RNP based ELANE knockout of patients' primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells followed by autologous transplantation may be an alternative therapy for congenital neutropenia.","['Nasri, Masoud', 'Ritter, Malte', 'Mir, Perihan', 'Dannenmann, Benjamin', 'Aghaallaei, Narges', 'Amend, Diana', 'Makaryan, Vahagn', 'Xu, Yun', 'Fletcher, Breanna', 'Bernhard, Regine', 'Steiert, Ingeborg', 'Hahnel, Karin', 'Berger, Jurgen', 'Koch, Iris', 'Sailer, Brigitte', 'Hipp, Katharina', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Klimiankou, Maksim', 'Bajoghli, Baubak', 'Dale, David C', 'Welte, Karl', 'Skokowa, Julia']","['Nasri M', 'Ritter M', 'Mir P', 'Dannenmann B', 'Aghaallaei N', 'Amend D', 'Makaryan V', 'Xu Y', 'Fletcher B', 'Bernhard R', 'Steiert I', 'Hahnel K', 'Berger J', 'Koch I', 'Sailer B', 'Hipp K', 'Zeidler C', 'Klimiankou M', 'Bajoghli B', 'Dale DC', 'Welte K', 'Skokowa J']",,"['Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany Julia.Skokowa@med.uni-tuebingen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190627,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",IM,"['CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Mutation', '*Neutropenia/congenital/genetics']",PMC7049355,2019/06/30 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.221804 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.221804 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Mar;105(3):598-609. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.221804.

Our aim was to establish a rapid, low cost and sensitive assay for identification of CALR gene mutations and to validate the diagnostic performance of the established assay in a patient cohort with different clinical MPN phenotypes. METHODS: One hundred five Philadelphia-negative MPN patients, including polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythaemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were initially screened for JAK2 mutations by amplification-refractory mutation system (ARMS-PCR) methodology and were further subjected to detection of CALR gene mutations by our in-house assay, a PCR based amplicon length differentiation assay (PCR-ALDA). The PCR-ALDA methodology was compared with real time PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. Furthermore, the analytical sensitivity of the assay was established. RESULTS: PCR - ALDA approach was able to detect and discriminate the pseudo-positive samples containing more than 1% CALR mutant alleles. CALR mutations were not detected in 63 Jak2 V617F positive cases in all three methods. In contrast, amongst 42 Jak2 V617F negative cases, both PCR-ALDA and Sanger sequencing coherently identified 12 CALR mutants compared to 10 CALR mutants detected by real-time PCR method. CONCLUSION: PCR-ALDA can be utilized as an easy-to-use, rapid, low cost and sensitive tool in the detection of CALR mutations in Philadelphia-negative MPN patients.","['Trung, Ngo Tat', 'Quyen, Dao Thanh', 'Hoan, Nghiem Xuan', 'Giang, Dao Phuong', 'Trang, Tran Thi Huyen', 'Velavan, Thirumalaisamy P', 'Bang, Mai Hong', 'Song, Le Huu']","['Trung NT', 'Quyen DT', 'Hoan NX', 'Giang DP', 'Trang TTH', 'Velavan TP', 'Bang MH', 'Song LH']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2056-8499'],"['Centre for Genetic Consultation and Cancer Screening, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Centre for Genetic Consultation and Cancer Screening, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Institute of Tropical Medicine, Universitatsklinikum Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Faculty of Gastroenterology, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam.', 'Vietnamese - German Center for Medical Research, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, No 1, Tran Hung Dao Street, Hai Ba Trung District, Hanoi, Vietnam. lehuusong@108-icid.com.', 'Faculty of Tropical and Infectious Diseases, 108 Institute of Clinical Medical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hanoi, Vietnam. lehuusong@108-icid.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190627,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alleles', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Female', 'Genotyping Techniques/methods', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera', 'Primary Myelofibrosis', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/economics/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential', 'Young Adult']",PMC6598322,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12881-019-0819-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12881-019-0819-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2019 Jun 27;20(1):115. doi: 10.1186/s12881-019-0819-6.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CALR mutations', '*JAK2 V617F', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, its antifibrotic activity can be associated with serosal inflammation and fluid retention. METHODS: We report a case of an adult patient who, after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, developed a GvHD treated with imatinib at low dosage, followed by multiorgan failure. Clinical examination and cardiac ultrasound were unable to clearly recognize the low cardiac output state; laboratory analysis, filling pressure, and computed tomography examination clarified the correct diagnosis. RESULTS: Low cardiac output state, secondary to pericardial effusion, is a diagnostic challenge. However, the association of four elements can help in its early recognition: increase in lactate levels and central venous pressure, associated with a low central venous saturation and a low brain natriuretic peptide level. CONCLUSIONS: Pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade is a difficult diagnosis even with ultrasound. Lactate levels, central venous pressure plus venous saturation, and brain natriuretic peptide could help in early detection.","['Vetrugno, Luigi', 'Tomasino, Serana', 'Battezzi, Alessandra', 'Parisella, Laura', 'Bernardinetti, Mattia', 'Bove, Tiziana']","['Vetrugno L', 'Tomasino S', 'Battezzi A', 'Parisella L', 'Bernardinetti M', 'Bove T']",,"['1 Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic, Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', '1 Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic, Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', '1 Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic, Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', '1 Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic, Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.', '2 Unit of Anesthesia, Intensive Care and Pain Management, University Hospital School of Medicine, Campus BioMedico of Rome, Rome, Italy.', '1 Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Clinic, Department of Medicine, University of Udine, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Tumori,Tumori,0111356,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cardiac Tamponade/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Echocardiography', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericardiocentesis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/07/03 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/0300891618794890 [doi]'],ppublish,Tumori. 2018 Dec;104(6):NP14-NP16. doi: 10.1177/0300891618794890.,6,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiac tamponade', 'central venous pressure', 'graft versus host disease']",,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the published Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report and related literature in 2013, we calculated the cancer-related mortality and potential years of life lost (PYLL) by age, sex, districts (urban or rural), to describe the patterns of life lost to cancers. The high death-risk cancers in China were lung, liver, stomach, esophageal, colorectal, breast, pancreatic, brain and nervous system, and ovarian cancers, and leukemia. Liver and esophageal cancers were more prominent among males, while breast and colorectal cancers were more prevalent among females. The most obvious differences of mortality between urban and rural areas were found in liver, esophageal, and colorectal cancers. Cancer-related mortality increased significantly after the age of 30 years, and peaking at 70-79 years. The PYLL rate of cancer in urban areas was higher than that in rural areas (21.49 vs. 19.20/1000), and significant regional and gender differences of PYLL ranks can be observed. For people aged over 60 years, cancer PYLL mainly came from lung, stomach, and esophageal cancers; for middle-aged people, it was mainly induced by liver, colorectal, and female reproductive systems' cancers; and for those under 30 years, life lost to cancer was mainly caused by leukemia and brain, nervous system cancers. Moreover, disparities in age distribution of PYLL from different regions and sexes can be found. In short, three categories of people, including those in urban areas, males and people over 60 years, were suffering from more serious cancer deaths and life lost. These variations pose considerable challenges for the Chinese health care system, and comprehensive measures are required for cancer prevention and treatment.","['Yan, Yizhong', 'Chen, Yu', 'Jia, Huaimiao', 'Liu, Jiaming', 'Ding, Yusong', 'Wang, Haixia', 'Hu, Yunhua', 'Ma, Jiaolong', 'Zhang, Xianghui', 'Li, Shugang']","['Yan Y', 'Chen Y', 'Jia H', 'Liu J', 'Ding Y', 'Wang H', 'Hu Y', 'Ma J', 'Zhang X', 'Li S']",,"['Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. erniu19880215@sina.com.', 'Department of Chronic Diseases, Shihezi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shihezi, 832002, China. tougaoshzu1@163.com.', 'Department of Chronic Diseases, Shihezi Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Shihezi, 832002, China. tougaoshzu2@163.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. liujiaming@shzu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. tougaoshzu@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases (Ministry of Education), Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. tougaoshzu@126.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. wanghaixiawza@163.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. hyh6133@sina.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. jiaojiaolong881202@163.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. michaelzhang818@163.com.', 'Department of Public Health, Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. lishugang@ymail.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Key Laboratory of Xinjiang Endemic and Ethnic Diseases (Ministry of Education), Shihezi University School of Medicine, Shihezi 832002, China. lishugang@ymail.com.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190619,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Life Expectancy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prevalence', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', '*Sex Factors', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Young Adult']",PMC6617202,2019/06/30 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/29 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph16122175 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph16122175 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Jun 19;16(12). pii: ijerph16122175. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16122175.,12,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancers', '*death', '*high risk', '*life lost', '*patterns']",,,,,,,,,,,

The study included 487 treatment-naive CLL patients with +12 from 15 academic centers; diagnosed between January 2000 and July 2016; and 816 treatment-naive patients with absence of Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) abnormalities. A cohort of 250 patients with +12 CLL followed at a single US institution was used for external validation. In patients with +12; parameters associated with worse prognosis in the multivariate model were high Lactate DeHydrogenase (LDH) and beta-2-microglobulin and unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region gene (IGHV). CLL patients with +12 and high LDH levels showed a shorter Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) (30 months vs. 65 months; p < 0.001), Treatment-Free-Survival (TFS) (33 months vs. 69 months; p < 0.001), Overall Survival (OS) (131 months vs. 181 months; p < 0.001) and greater CLL-related mortality (29% vs. 11% at 10 years; p < 0.001) when compared with +12 CLL patients with normal LDH levels. The same differences were observed in the validation cohort. These data suggest that serum LDH levels can predict PFS; TFS; OS and CLL-specific survival in CLL patients with +12.","['Autore, Francesco', 'Strati, Paolo', 'Innocenti, Idanna', 'Corrente, Francesco', 'Trentin, Livio', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Visco, Carlo', 'Coscia, Marta', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Frustaci, Anna Maria', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Morabito, Fortunato', 'Molica, Stefano', 'Falcucci, Paolo', ""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Murru, Roberta', 'Vincelli, Donatella', 'Efremov, Dimitar G', 'Ferretti, Antonietta', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Tisi, Maria Chiara', 'Reda, Gianluigi', 'Visentin, Andrea', 'Sica, Simona', 'Foa, Robin', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Laurenti, Luca']","['Autore F', 'Strati P', 'Innocenti I', 'Corrente F', 'Trentin L', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Visco C', 'Coscia M', 'Cuneo A', 'Gozzetti A', 'Mauro FR', 'Frustaci AM', 'Gentile M', 'Morabito F', 'Molica S', 'Falcucci P', ""D'Arena G"", 'Murru R', 'Vincelli D', 'Efremov DG', 'Ferretti A', 'Rigolin GM', 'Vitale C', 'Tisi MC', 'Reda G', 'Visentin A', 'Sica S', 'Foa R', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Laurenti L']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

This study examined pre-treatment plasma samples from 66 adult patients (aged 20-74) newly diagnosed with any lymphoma subtype, and 96 frequency matched population controls. We used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to compare the metabolic profile by case/control status and across the major lymphoma subtypes. We conducted univariate and multivariate analyses, and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). When compared to the controls, statistically validated models were obtained for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), multiple myeloma (MM), and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), but not follicular lymphoma (FL). The metabolomic analysis highlighted interesting differences between lymphoma patients and population controls, allowing the discrimination between pathologic and healthy subjects: Important metabolites, such as hypoxanthine and elaidic acid, were more abundant in all lymphoma subtypes. The small sample size of the individual lymphoma subtypes prevented obtaining PLS-DA validated models, although specific peculiar features of each subtype were observed; for instance, fatty acids were most represented in MM and HL patients, while 2-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminoheptanedioic acid, erythritol, and threitol characterized DLBCL and CLL. Metabolomic analysis was able to highlight interesting differences between lymphoma patients and population controls, allowing the discrimination between pathologic and healthy subjects. Further studies are warranted to understand whether the peculiar metabolic patterns observed might serve as early biomarkers of lymphoma.","['Barberini, Luigi', 'Noto, Antonio', 'Fattuoni, Claudia', 'Satta, Giannina', 'Zucca, Mariagrazia', 'Cabras, Maria Giuseppina', 'Mura, Ester', 'Cocco, Pierluigi']","['Barberini L', 'Noto A', 'Fattuoni C', 'Satta G', 'Zucca M', 'Cabras MG', 'Mura E', 'Cocco P']",,"['Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. barberini@unica.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. antonionoto@unica.it.', 'Department of Chemical and Geological Sciences, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. cfattuon@unica.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. gianninasatta@tiscali.it.', 'Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy. mzucca@unica.it.', 'Department of Hematology, A.

Here we describe a novel oral active small molecule analog of berbamine, tosyl chloride-berbamine (TCB), that efficiently eliminates MYC-positive leukemia in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, TCB potently reduced MYC protein by inhibiting CaMKIIgamma, a critical enzyme that stabilizes MYC protein, and induces apoptosis of MYC-positive leukemia cells. In vivo, oral administration of TCB markedly eliminated lethal MYC-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with well tolerability in orthotopic mouse model.

In our initial trial, the feasibility of HIDT following a MAC preparative regimen using fludarabine and 12 Gy of total-body irradiation was demonstrated in 30 patients. We now present long-term outcome results, including an additional 52 patients, now with 47 months (16 to 96) median follow-up. Median patient age was 42 (19 to 61) years. The most common diagnoses were acute myelogenous leukemia (51%) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (33%), and 39% had a high/very high disease risk index (DRI). Engraftment was universal with no cases of primary or secondary graft failure. Grade 3 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and moderate to severe chronic GVHD occurred in 17% and 23%, respectively. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 7% at 1 year and 13% at 4 years. Estimated 4-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival, and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) were 67%, 60%, and 27%, respectively. CIR was significantly higher in patients with high/very high- versus low/intermediate-risk DRI (38% versus 20%, P= .032), which led to inferior 4-year OS (50% versus 77%, P=.001). Median time to systemic immunosuppressive therapy (IST) discontinuation was 7.8 months, with 84% of patients off IST at 2 years post-transplant.

Bone marrow HSC transplantation has been considered as an ideal option for certain disorders treatment including hematologic diseases, leukemia, immunodeficiency, bone marrow failure syndrome, genetic defects such as thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, autoimmune disease, and certain solid cancers. Ex vivo proliferation of these cells prior to transplantation has been proposed as a potential solution against limited number of stem cells. In such culture process, MSCs have also been shown to exhibit high capacity for secretion of soluble mediators contributing to the principle biological and therapeutic activities of HSCs. In addition, endothelial cells have been introduced to bridge the blood and sub tissues in the bone marrow, as well as, HSCs regeneration induction and survival. Cell culture in the laboratory environment requires cell growth strict control to protect against contamination, symmetrical cell division and optimal conditions for maximum yield. In this regard, microfluidic systems provide culture and analysis capabilities in micro volume scales. Moreover, two-dimensional cultures cannot fully demonstrate extracellular matrix found in different tissues and organs as an abstract representation of three dimensional cell structure. Microfluidic systems can also strongly describe the effects of physical factors such as temperature and pressure on cell behavior.","['Derakhshani, Mehdi', 'Abbaszadeh, Hossein', 'Movassaghpour, Ali Akbar', 'Mehdizadeh, Amir', 'Ebrahimi-Warkiani, Majid', 'Yousefi, Mehdi']","['Derakhshani M', 'Abbaszadeh H', 'Movassaghpour AA', 'Mehdizadeh A', 'Ebrahimi-Warkiani M', 'Yousefi M']",,"['Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Student Research Committee, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Endocrine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University Technology of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, 2007, Australia.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Aging Research Institute, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran; Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 2008 through 2017, 285 patients were enrolled at eight centers; 262 were randomly assigned to receive clofarabine and cytarabine (Clo+AraC, n = 129) or high-dose cytarabine, daunorubicin, and etoposide (HD-ADE, n = 133) as induction I. Induction II consisted of low-dose ADE given alone or combined with sorafenib or vorinostat. Consolidation therapy comprised two or three additional courses of chemotherapy or hematopoietic cell transplantation. Genetic abnormalities and the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 22 of initial remission induction determined final risk classification. The primary end point was MRD at day 22. RESULTS: Complete remission was induced after two courses of therapy in 263 (92.3%) of the 285 patients; induction failures included four early deaths and 15 cases of resistant leukemia. Day 22 MRD was positive in 57 of 121 randomly assigned evaluable patients (47%) who received Clo+AraC and 42 of 121 patients (35%) who received HD-ADE (odds ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.03 to 3.41; P = .04). Despite this result, the 3-year event-free survival rate (52.9% [44.6% to 62.8%] for Clo+AraC v 52.4% [44.0% to 62.4%] for HD-ADE, P = .94) and overall survival rate (74.8% [67.1% to 83.3%] for Clo+AraC v 64.6% [56.2% to 74.2%] for HD-ADE, P = .1) did not differ significantly across the two arms. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the use of clofarabine with cytarabine during remission induction might reduce the need for anthracycline and etoposide in pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia and may reduce rates of cardiomyopathy and treatment-related cancer.","['Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Lacayo, Norman J', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Heym, Kenneth', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Taub, Jeffrey', 'McNeer, Jennifer', 'Degar, Barbara', 'Schiff, Deborah', 'Yeoh, Allen Eng-Juh', 'Coustan-Smith, Elaine', 'Wang, Lei', 'Triplett, Brandon', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Klco, Jeffery', 'Choi, John', 'Pounds, Stanley', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Rubnitz JE', 'Lacayo NJ', 'Inaba H', 'Heym K', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Taub J', 'McNeer J', 'Degar B', 'Schiff D', 'Yeoh AE', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Wang L', 'Triplett B', 'Raimondi SC', 'Klco J', 'Choi J', 'Pounds S', 'Pui CH']",,"[""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""2Lucile Packard Children's Hospital and Stanford Cancer Center, Palo Alto, CA."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""3Cook Children's Medical Center, Fort Worth, TX."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""4Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI."", '5University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', '6Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', ""7Rady Children's Hospital, San Diego, CA."", '8National University Health System, Singapore.', '8National University Health System, Singapore.', ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center, College of Medicine, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190627,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clofarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",PMC7001777,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.00327 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Aug 10;37(23):2072-2081. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.00327.

We have reported that a combination of vitamin D-based cell differentiation agents (doxercalciferol/carnosic acid [D2/CA]) added following the cytotoxic drug arabinocytosine (AraC) increases AML cell death (CD), a model for improved therapy of this disease. Because AraC-induced CD is known to involve reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, here we investigated if the modulation of cellular REDOX status plays a role in the enhancement of cell death (ECD) by D2/CA. Using thiol antioxidants, such as N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), we found a significant inhibition of ECD, yet this occurred in the absence of any detectable change in cellular ROS levels. In contrast, NAC reduced the vitamin D receptor (VDR) abundance and its signaling of ECD. Importantly, VDR knockdown and NAC similarly inhibited ECD without producing an additive effect. Thus, the proposed post-AraC therapy may be compromised by agents that reduce VDR levels in AML blasts.","['Wang, Xuening', 'Dawod, Alaa', 'Nachliely, Matan', 'Harrison, Jonathan S', 'Danilenko, Michael', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Wang X', 'Dawod A', 'Nachliely M', 'Harrison JS', 'Danilenko M', 'Studzinski GP']",,"['Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, State University of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey.', ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel."", ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, Connecticut.', ""Department of Clinical Biochemistry & Pharmacology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Be'er Sheva, Israel."", 'Department of Pathology, Immunology & Laboratory Medicine, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, State University of New Jersey, Newark, New Jersey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190627,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (VDR protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '3DIZ9LF5Y9 (1 alpha-hydroxyergocalciferol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['Abietanes/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Ergocalciferols/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'Vitamin D/therapeutic use']",,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28996 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2020 Jan;235(1):573-586. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28996.

However, methods of vascularization and suitable cell sources for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine have not yet been established. In this study, we developed methods for the induction of vascular endothelial cells from mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells using three-dimensional (3D) suspension culture, and fabricated cardiac cell sheets with a pre-vascularized structure by co-culture of mouse ES cell-derived endothelial cells. After induction, isolated CD31+ cells expressed several endothelial cell marker genes and exhibited the ability to form vascular network structures similar to CD31+ cells from neonatal mouse heart. Co-culture of ES cell-derived CD31+ cells with ES cell-derived cardiomyocytes and dermal fibroblasts resulted in the formation of cardiac cell sheets with microvascular network formation. In contrast, microvascular network formation was reduced in co-cultures without cardiomyocytes, suggesting that cardiomyocytes within the cell sheet might enhance vascular endothelial cell sprouting. Polymerase chain reaction array analysis revealed that the expression levels of several angiogenesis-related genes, including fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), were up-regulated in co-culture with cardiomyocytes compared with cultures without cardiomyocytes. The microvascular network in the cardiac sheets was attenuated by treatment with anti-FGF1 antibody. These results indicate that 3D suspension culture methods may be used to prepare functional vascular endothelial cells from mouse ES cells, and that cardiomyocyte-mediated paracrine effects might be important for fabricating pre-vascularized cardiac cell sheets.","['Masuda, Shinako', 'Matsuura, Katsuhisa', 'Anazawa, Mie', 'Iwamiya, Takahiro', 'Shimizu, Tatsuya', 'Okano, Teruo']","['Masuda S', 'Matsuura K', 'Anazawa M', 'Iwamiya T', 'Shimizu T', 'Okano T']",,"[""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20151027,Netherlands,Regen Ther,Regenerative therapy,101709085,,,,PMC6581788,2015/10/27 00:00,2015/10/27 00:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2015/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/10/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.reth.2015.10.002 [doi]', 'S2352-3204(15)00052-8 [pii]']",epublish,Regen Ther. 2015 Oct 27;2:6-16. doi: 10.1016/j.reth.2015.10.002. eCollection 2015 Dec.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['3D, three-dimensional', 'Acvrl1, activin receptor like 1', 'CXCR4, chemokine receptor type 4', 'Cardiac cell sheet', 'Col4a3, collagen type IV alpha 3', 'Cxcl5, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5', 'Dll4, delta-like ligand 4', 'ES cell, embryonic stem cell', 'EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein', 'Efnb2, ephrin-B2', 'Egf, epidermal growth factor', 'Endothelial cell differentiation', 'Ephb4, ephrin type-B receptor 4', 'FBS, fetal bovine serum', 'FGF1, fibroblast growth factor 1', 'Fibroblast growth factor 1', 'Flk1, fetal liver kinase 1', 'Flt1, fms-related tyrosine kinase 1', 'Gusb, glucuronidase, beta', 'KDR, kinase insert domain receptor', 'LIF, leukemia inhibitory factor', 'MACS, magnetic-activated cell sorting', 'Mdk, midkine', 'Microvascular network formation', 'Mouse embryonic stem cells', 'NEAA, non-essential amino acids', 'Notch1, Notch homolog 1', 'Nr2f2, nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group f, member 2', 'PCR, polymerase chain reaction', 'Pecam1, platelet/endothelial adhesion molecule 1', 'Pou5f1, POU class 5 homeobox 1', 'SMA, smooth muscle actin', 'TIMP2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2', 'Tgfa, transforming growth factor, alpha', 'Three-dimensional suspension culture', 'Tymp, thymidine phosphorylase', 'VE-cadherin, vascular endothelial cadherin', 'VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor', 'eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase', 'iPS cell, inducible pluripotent stem cell', 'qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR']",,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the choice of further chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) therapy in patients after acute hepatotoxicity is still a difficult question, which requires a complex individual approach based on the clinical guidelines of adverse event management. Data about the further follow-up strategy approach in patients with CML after acute toxic imatinib-induced liver injury are of concern, and at times controversial. In addition, one of the questions is about the necessity and safety of the imatinib therapy resumption after acute hepatotoxicity. In some publications, imatinib resumption without the recurrence of hepatotoxicity has been discussed; in others, imatinib resumption with the recurrence of imatinib hepatotoxicity has been mentioned. There are a few publications about the experience of administration of the second-line TKIs after acute imatinib hepatotoxicity. There are no clear data on which factors the physician's decision should be based on in patients with CML after acute toxic imatinib-induced liver injury. Imatinib should be restarted or withdrawn, when and for whom second-line therapy should be started. The physician's decision is usually based on the published data of similar cases, personal experience, and the severity of hepatotoxicity. We have discussed the clinical guidelines devoted to the peculiarities of the patient's management after acute toxic imatinib-induced hepatitis and main strategy approaches. A complex score-based decision algorithm for choosing the further strategy approach after acute toxic imatinib-induced hepatitis in patients with CML has been presented. The following parameters should be assessed: the grade of hepatotoxicity reaction, the presence of liver transplantation or imatinib-induced liver cirrhosis and its possible pathogenetic mechanism, the presence of early molecular response (EMR) to imatinib therapy defined as three-month BCR-ABL1 </=10% according to the international scale (BCR-ABL1(IS) ) or/and six-month BCR-ABL1 (IS )<1%; and the presence of the offender concomitant drug that probably caused the drug interaction with imatinib and the presence of viral hepatitis reactivation identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).","['Lopina, Nataliia', 'Dmytrenko, Iryna', 'Hamov, Dmytro', 'Lopin, Dmytro', 'Dyagil, Iryna']","['Lopina N', 'Dmytrenko I', 'Hamov D', 'Lopin D', 'Dyagil I']",,"['Internal Medicine and Endocrinology, Kharkiv National Medical University, Kharkiv, UKR.', 'Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, UKR.', 'Hematology, Cherkasy Regional Oncology Dispensary of Cherkasy Regional Council, Cherkassy, UKR.', 'Internal Medicine, SI Zaitsev V.t Institute of General and Urgent Surgery of National Academy of Medical Science of Ukraine, Kharkiv, UKR.', 'Radiation Oncohematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, UKR.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190409,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC6559390,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/06/28 06:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.4411 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2019 Apr 9;11(4):e4411. doi: 10.7759/cureus.4411.,4,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute liver failure', 'acute toxic hepatitis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myeloid leukemia second-line therapy', 'dasatinib', 'drug-induced liver disease', 'imatinib', 'nilotinib', 'ponatinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 is the etiological agent of Adult T-cell Leukemia (ATL) and of HTLV-1-Associated Myelopathy/Tropical Spastic Paraparesis (HAM/TSP), whereas HTLV-2 does not cause hematological disorders and is only sporadically associated with cases of subacute myelopathy. Both HTLV genomes encode two regulatory proteins that play a pivotal role in pathogenesis: the transactivating Tax-1 and Tax-2 proteins and the antisense proteins HBZ and APH-2, respectively. We recently reported that Tax-1 and Tax-2 form complexes with the TNF-receptor associated factor 3, TRAF3, a negative regulator of the non-canonical NF-kappaB pathway. The NF-kappaB pathway is constitutively activated by the Tax proteins, whereas it is inhibited by HBZ and APH-2. The antagonistic effects of Tax and antisense proteins on NF-kappaB activation have not yet been fully clarified. Here, we investigated the effect of TRAF3 interaction with HTLV regulatory proteins and in particular its consequence on the subcellular distribution of the effector p65/RelA protein. We demonstrated that Tax-1 and Tax-2 efficiency on NF-kappaB activation is impaired in TRAF3 deficient cells obtained by CRISPR/Cas9 editing. We also found that APH-2 is more effective than HBZ in preventing Tax-dependent NF-kappaB activation. We further observed that TRAF3 co-localizes with Tax-2 and APH-2 in cytoplasmic complexes together with NF-kappaB essential modulator NEMO and TAB2, differently from HBZ and TRAF3. These results contribute to untangle the mechanism of NF-kappaB inhibition by HBZ and APH-2, highlighting the different role of the HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 regulatory proteins in the NF-kappaB activation.","['Fochi, Stefania', 'Bergamo, Elisa', 'Serena, Michela', 'Mutascio, Simona', 'Journo, Chloe', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo', 'Bertazzoni, Umberto', 'Zipeto, Donato', 'Romanelli, Maria Grazia']","['Fochi S', 'Bergamo E', 'Serena M', 'Mutascio S', 'Journo C', 'Mahieux R', 'Ciminale V', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Zipeto D', 'Romanelli MG']",,"['Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111 - Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee ""Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale"", UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Retroviral Oncogenesis Laboratory, Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), INSERM U1111 - Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1, CNRS, Equipe Labellisee ""Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale"", UMR5308, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Universite Lyon, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Neurosciences, Biomedicine and Movement Sciences, Section of Biology and Genetics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190612,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,PMC6581700,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/06/28 06:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.01302 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Jun 12;10:1302. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.01302. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['APH-2', 'HBZ', 'HTLV', 'NF-kappaB', 'TRAF3', 'Tax']",,,,,,,,,,,

Since patients with NUDT15 or TPMT deficiency suffer severe adverse drug reactions, star (*) allele-based haplotypes have been used to predict an optimal 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) dosing. However, star allele haplotyping suffers from insufficient, inconsistent, and even conflicting designations with uncertain and/or unknown functional alleles. Gene-wise variant burden (GVB) scoring enables us to utilize next-generation sequencing (NGS) data to predict 6-MP intolerance in children with ALL. Whole exome sequencing was performed for 244 pediatric ALL patients under 6-MP treatments. We assigned star alleles with PharmGKB haplotype set translational table. GVB for NUDT15 and TPMT was computed by aggregating in silico deleteriousness scores of multiple coding variants for each gene. Poor last-cycle dose intensity percent (DIP < 25%) was considered as 6-MP intolerance, resulting therapeutic failure of ALL. DIPs showed significant differences ( p < 0.05) among NUDT15 poor (PM, n = 1), intermediate (IM, n = 48), and normal (NM, n = 195) metabolizers. TPMT exhibited no PM and only seven IMs. GVB showed significant differences among the different haplotype groups of both NUDT15 and TPMT ( p < 0.05). Kruskal-Wallis test for DIP values showed statistical significances for the seven different GVB score bins of NUDT15. GVB (NUDT15) outperformed the star allele-based haplotypes in predicting patients with reduced last-cycle DIPs at all DIP threshold levels (i.e., 5%, 10%, 15%, and 25%). In NUDT15-and-TPMT combined interaction analyses, GVB (NUDT15) (,) (TPMT) outperformed star alleles [area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) = 0.677 vs. 0.645] in specificity (0.813 vs. 0.796), sensitivity (0.526 vs. 0.474), and positive (0.192 vs. 0.164) and negative (0.953 vs. 0.947) predictive values. Overall, GVB correctly classified five more patients (i.e., one into below and four into above 25% DIP groups) than did star allele haplotypes. GVB analysis demonstrated that 6-MP intolerance in pediatric ALL can be reliably predicted by aggregating NGS-based common, rare, and novel variants together without hampering the predictive power of the conventional haplotype analysis.","['Park, Yoomi', 'Kim, Hyery', 'Choi, Jung Yoon', 'Yun, Sunmin', 'Min, Byung-Joo', 'Seo, Myung-Eui', 'Im, Ho Joon', 'Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Kim, Ju Han']","['Park Y', 'Kim H', 'Choi JY', 'Yun S', 'Min BJ', 'Seo ME', 'Im HJ', 'Kang HJ', 'Kim JH']",,"['Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Seoul National University Cancer Research Institute, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Seoul National University Cancer Research Institute, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Seoul National University Biomedical Informatics (SNUBI), Division of Biomedical Informatics, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190611,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6580331,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/06/28 06:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00654 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Jun 11;10:654. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00654. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['6-mercaptopurine', 'Nudix Hydrolase 15 (NUDT15)', 'Thiopurine S-Methyltransferase (TPMT)', 'drug toxicity', 'next-generation sequencing', 'pharmacogenetics', 'pharmacogenomics', 'variant burden']",,,,,,,,,,,

She was treated with several antifungal agents, including three triazoles. Voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole all led to hepatocellular liver injury. Voriconazole administration led to a peak alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value of 1,793 U/L (normal range, 9-59 U/L). After posaconazole and isavuconazole treatment, ALT rose over 500 U/L. The typical course of events, exclusion of differential diagnoses, and normalization of the liver function tests (LFTs) after stopping the triazoles were highly suspicious for a drug-induced liver injury (DILI). Interestingly, our patient carries a rare HLA B allele (HLA B*35:02), which occurs in less than 1% of the population and is known to be associated with minocycline-induced liver injury. Over the course of 4 months, the patient received two induction chemotherapies and afterward underwent a successful allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Her liver function recovered rapidly and favorable clinical findings concerning the aspergillosis led to a de-escalation of the antifungal treatment to prophylactic dose fluconazole. Delayed hepatotoxicity suggested a dose dependency and a cumulative effect. The question of a common pathophysiology and a cross-toxicity was raised. At the present time, only a few case reports describe cross-toxicity or its absence after rechallenge with different azoles. The pathophysiology is not well understood. Ketoconazole was found to impair rat mitochondrial function in vitro. Further investigations showed cell membrane toxicity and ATP depletion in isolated human liver cancer cells. Our case report suggests a cross-toxicity, dose-dependency, and a possible genetic predisposition of triazole-induced liver injury.","['Buhler, Tim', 'Medinger, Michael', 'Bouitbir, Jamal', 'Krahenbuhl, Stephan', 'Leuppi-Taegtmeyer, Anne']","['Buhler T', 'Medinger M', 'Bouitbir J', 'Krahenbuhl S', 'Leuppi-Taegtmeyer A']",,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Divisions of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190611,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6580185,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/06/28 06:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00645 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Jun 11;10:645. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00645. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA B*35:02', 'azole antifungal agents', 'cross-toxicity', 'drug-induced liver injury (DILI)', 'hepatotoxicity', 'isavuconazole', 'posaconazole', 'voriconazole']",,,,,,,,,,,

These agents are being investigated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to further enhance response rate as induction therapy and to improve relapse-free survival (RFS) post chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation. PD-1 and CTLA-4 are the two most actively investigated checkpoint receptors, which play a role in different stages of anti-tumor immune response. This study reviews data from ongoing phase I, II clinical trials evaluating PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors on AML patients and discusses especially efficacy and adverse events as well as prospects of these drugs in treating AML. Single anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody infusion shows rather modest clinical efficacy. While combinations of PD-1 inhibitor with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) represent encouraging outcome for relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML patients as well as for elderly patients as first-line therapy option. Adding PD-1 inhibitor to traditional induction therapy regimen is also safe and feasible. CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab exhibits specific potency in treating relapsed AML patients with extramedullary disease in later post-transplantation stage. In terms of side effects, irAEs found in these trials can mostly be appropriately managed with steroids but are occasionally fatal. More rationally designed combinational therapies are under investigation in ongoing clinical trials and will further advance our understanding of checkpoint inhibitors as well as lead us to the most appropriate application of these agents.","['Liao, Dan', 'Wang, Mengyao', 'Liao, Yi', 'Li, Jun', 'Niu, Ting']","['Liao D', 'Wang M', 'Liao Y', 'Li J', 'Niu T']",,"['Research Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Research Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Research Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Research Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Research Laboratory of Hematology, Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190606,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6562221,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/06/28 06:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00609 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Jun 6;10:609. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00609. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'checkpoint inhibitor', 'efficacy', 'immunotherapy', 'safety']",,,,,,,,,,,

Beside the heterogeneity of leukaemia, the distribution and senescence of the autologous cells from heavily pretreated patients might be further reasons for this. We performed six consecutive large-scale manufacturing processes for CD20 CAR T cells from healthy donor leukapheresis using the automated CliniMACS Prodigy(R) platform. Starting with a CD4/CD8-positive selection, a high purity of a median of 97% T cells with a median 65-fold cell expansion was achieved. Interestingly, the transduction rate was significantly higher for CD4+ compared to CD8+ T cells and reached in a median of 23%. CD20 CAR T cells showed a good specific IFN-gamma secretion after cocultivation with CD20+ target cells which correlated with good cytotoxic activity. Most importantly, 3 out of 5 CAR T cell products showed an increase in telomere length during the manufacturing process, while telomere length remained consistent in one and decreased in another process. In conclusion, this shows for the first time that beside heterogeneity among healthy donors, CAR T cell products also differ regarding cell senescence, even for cells manufactured in a standardised automated process.","['Aleksandrova, Krasimira', 'Leise, Jana', 'Priesner, Christoph', 'Melk, Anette', 'Kubaink, Fanni', 'Abken, Hinrich', 'Hombach, Andreas', 'Aktas, Murat', 'Essl, Mike', 'Burger, Iris', 'Kaiser, Andrew', 'Rauser, Georg', 'Jurk, Marion', 'Goudeva, Lilia', 'Glienke, Wolfgang', 'Arseniev, Lubomir', 'Esser, Ruth', 'Kohl, Ulrike']","['Aleksandrova K', 'Leise J', 'Priesner C', 'Melk A', 'Kubaink F', 'Abken H', 'Hombach A', 'Aktas M', 'Essl M', 'Burger I', 'Kaiser A', 'Rauser G', 'Jurk M', 'Goudeva L', 'Glienke W', 'Arseniev L', 'Esser R', 'Kohl U']",,"['Cellular Therapy Centre, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Cellular Therapy Centre, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Cellular Therapy Centre, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Clinic for Paediatric Nephrology, Hepatology and Metabolic Disorders, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Clinic for Paediatric Nephrology, Hepatology and Metabolic Disorders, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, and Dept I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'RCI, Chair Gene-Immunotherapy, University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne, University of Cologne, and Dept I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Miltenyi Biotec GmbH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'ATMP-GMP Development Unit, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Cellular Therapy Centre, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'ATMP-GMP Development Unit, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Cellular Therapy Centre, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'ATMP-GMP Development Unit, Institute of Cellular Therapeutics, Hannover Medical School (MHH), Hanover, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital and Medical Faculty, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190204,Switzerland,Transfus Med Hemother,Transfusion medicine and hemotherapy : offizielles Organ der Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Transfusionsmedizin und Immunhamatologie,101176417,,,,PMC6558326,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/06/28 06:01,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000495772 [doi]', 'tmh-0046-0047 [pii]']",ppublish,Transfus Med Hemother. 2019 Feb;46(1):47-54. doi: 10.1159/000495772.

New insights into genetic characteristics of leukemic cells have initiated the development of the chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy. This type of adoptive cell immunotherapy has been a breakthrough in the treatment of aggressive B-cell lymphoma and B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In August 2018, the European Commission has approved the first CAR T-cell products - tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah(R), Novartis) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta(R), Gilead) - for hematological neoplasms in Europe. As CAR T cells are a living drug, its benefits can last for many years. The administration of CAR T cells is a complex and costly endeavor involving cell manufacture, shipping of apheresis products, and management of novel and severe adverse reactions. The most common toxicities observed after CAR T-cell therapy are cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome. Current research focuses on improved safety and efficacy in hematological malignancies as well as the translation of CAR T-cell therapy to solid tumors.

Even with treatment such as traditional chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), many patients suffer from relapse/refractory disease, and the overall survival is dismal. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are induced by gene mutations and undergo an aberrant and poorly regulated proliferation process which is involved in the evolution, relapse, and drug-resistance of leukemia. Emerging studies demonstrate that CD123, the interleukin 3 receptor alpha (IL-3Ralpha), is highly expressed in LSCs, while not normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and associates with treatment response, minimal residual disease (MRD) detection and prognosis. Furthermore, CD123 is an important marker for the identification and targeting of LSCs for refractory or relapsed leukemia. Anti-CD123 target-therapies in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials confirm the utility of anti-CD123 neutralizing antibody-drugs, CD3xCD123 bispecific antibodies, dual-affinity retargeting (DART), and anti-CD123 chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) therapies in progress.

The relationship between HTLV-1 infection and cancer progression is controversial. HTLV-1 encodes oncogenic protein TAX1 and it is hypothesized that HTLV-1 infection is associated with breast cancer progression. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between HTLV-1 infection and clinicopathological factors in breast cancer patients. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 610 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent surgical treatment without preoperative chemotherapy at Kagoshima University Hospital between January 2001 and January 2015. Results: When patients with and without HTLV-1 infection were compared, no differences in clinicopathological factors were observed, except for age. Disease-free survival and overall survival rates did not differ between groups. Conclusions: HTLV-1-positive patients were significantly older than HTLV-1-negative patients.

Our study aims to develop a cost effective and comprehensive in-house conventional PCR method for detection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835 and NPM1 mutations and to evaluate the frequency of these mutations in patients with cytogenetically normal (CN) AML in our population. Methods: A total of 199 samples from AML patients (95 women, 104 men) were included in the study. Mutation analyses were performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene sequencing. Result: Sixty-eight patients were positive for the mutations. FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 32 patients (16.1%), followed by FLT3-D835 in 5 (2.5%) and NPM1 in 54 (27.1%). Double mutations of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD were detected in 23 cases (11.6%). Assays validation were performed using Sanger sequencing and showed 100% concordance with in house method. Conclusion: The optimized in-house PCR assays for the detection of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835 and NPM1 mutations in AML patients were robust, less labour intensive and cost effective. These assays can be used as diagnostic tools for mutation detection in AML patients since identification of these mutations are important for prognostication and optimization of patient care.","['Mat Yusoff, Yuslina', 'Abu Seman, Zahidah', 'Othman, Norodiyah', 'Kamaluddin, Nor Rizan', 'Esa, Ezalia', 'Zulkiply, Nor Amalina', 'Abdullah, Julia', 'Zakaria, Zubaidah']","['Mat Yusoff Y', 'Abu Seman Z', 'Othman N', 'Kamaluddin NR', 'Esa E', 'Zulkiply NA', 'Abdullah J', 'Zakaria Z']",,"['Haematology Unit, Cancer Research Centre, Institute for Medical Research, Jalan Pahang, 50588, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

We describe herein our structure-based design, synthesis, and evaluation of a new class of small-molecule inhibitors of the menin-MLL interaction (hereafter called menin inhibitors). Our efforts have resulted in the discovery of highly potent menin inhibitors, as exemplified by compound 42 (M-89). M-89 binds to menin with a Kd value of 1.4 nM and effectively engages cellular menin protein at low nanomolar concentrations. M-89 inhibits cell growth in the MV4;11 and MOLM-13 leukemia cell lines carrying MLL fusion with IC50 values of 25 and 55 nM, respectively, and demonstrates >100-fold selectivity over the HL-60 leukemia cell line lacking MLL fusion. The determination of a co-crystal structure of M-89 in a complex with menin provides the structural basis for their high-affinity interaction. Further optimization of M-89 may lead to a new class of therapy for the treatment of MLL leukemia.","['Aguilar, Angelo', 'Zheng, Ke', 'Xu, Tianfeng', 'Xu, Shilin', 'Huang, Liyue', 'Fernandez-Salas, Ester', 'Liu, Liu', 'Bernard, Denzil', 'Harvey, Kaitlin P', 'Foster, Caroline', 'McEachern, Donna', 'Stuckey, Jeanne', 'Chinnaswamy, Krishnapriya', 'Delproposto, James', 'Kampf, Jeff W', 'Wang, Shaomeng']","['Aguilar A', 'Zheng K', 'Xu T', 'Xu S', 'Huang L', 'Fernandez-Salas E', 'Liu L', 'Bernard D', 'Harvey KP', 'Foster C', 'McEachern D', 'Stuckey J', 'Chinnaswamy K', 'Delproposto J', 'Kampf JW', 'Wang S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8782-6950'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190622,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC7057177,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00021 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Jul 11;62(13):6015-6034. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00021.

The SHP2 is encoded by the PTPN11 gene, which is a nonreceptor (pY)-phosphatase and mutation causes JMML. The structural hierarchy of SHP2 includes protein tyrosine phosphatase domain (PTP) and Src-homology 2 domain (N-SH2 and C-SH2). Somatic mutation (E76Q) in the interface of SH2-PTP domain is the most commonly identified mutation found in up to 35% of patients with JMML. The mechanism of this mutant associated with JMML is poorly understood. Here, molecular dynamics simulation was performed on wild-type and mutant (E76Q) of SHP2 to explore the precise impact of gain-of-function on PTP's activity. Consequently, such impact rescues the SHP2 protein from autoinhibition state through losing the interface interactions of Q256/F7 and S502/Q76 or weakening interactions of Q256/R4, Q510/G60, and Q506/A72 between N-SH2 and PTP domains. The consequences of these interactions further relieve the D'E loop away from the PTP catalytic site. The following study would provide a mechanistic insight for better understanding of how individual SHP2 mutations alter the PTP's activity at the atomic level.","['Rehman, Ashfaq Ur', 'Rafiq, Humaira', 'Rahman, Mueed Ur', 'Li, Jiayi', 'Liu, Hao', 'Luo, Shenggan', 'Arshad, Taaha', 'Wadood, Abdul', 'Chen, Hai-Feng']","['Rehman AU', 'Rafiq H', 'Rahman MU', 'Li J', 'Liu H', 'Luo S', 'Arshad T', 'Wadood A', 'Chen HF']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7496-4182'],"['State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Abdul Wali Khan University , Mardan 23200 , Pakistan.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Abdul Wali Khan University , Mardan 23200 , Pakistan.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.', 'Department of Biochemistry , Abdul Wali Khan University , Mardan 23200 , Pakistan.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, Department of Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, National Experimental Teaching Center for Life Sciences and Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology , Shanghai Jiao Tong University , Shanghai 200240 , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190620,United States,J Chem Inf Model,Journal of chemical information and modeling,101230060,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Gain of Function Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics']",,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/08/19 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00353 [doi]'],ppublish,J Chem Inf Model. 2019 Jul 22;59(7):3229-3239. doi: 10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00353.

CLL DNA from either peripheral blood or bone marrow underwent next generation targeted sequencing with a 29-gene panel. Gene mutation data and concurrent clinical characteristics, such as Rai/Binet stage, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), ZAP70/CD38, karyotype and IGHV mutation, status were analysed in univariable and multivariable analyses to identify associations with TTFT. TTFT was defined as time from diagnosis to initial treatment. In univariable analyses, mutated ATM (P < 0.001), NOTCH1 (P < 0.001) and SF3B1 (P = 0.002) as well as unmutated IGHV (P < 0.001), del(11q) (P < 0.001) and trisomy 12 (P < 0.001) by hierarchal FISH and advanced Rai (P = 0.05) and Binet (P < 0.001) stages were associated with shorter TTFT. Importantly, del(17p), mutated TP53 and complex karyotype were not associated with shorter TTFT. In a reduced multivariable analysis, mutated ATM (P < 0.001) and unmutated IGHV status (P < 0.001) remained significant, showing their importance in early leukaemogenesis. High-risk prognostic markers such as del(17p), mutated TP53 and complex karyotype, were not correlated with TTFT, suggesting that these abnormalities have limited roles in early disease progression but are more important in relapsed CLL.","['Hu, Boyu', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Chen, Hsiang-Chun', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Ok, Chi Y', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Tambaro, Francesco P', 'Thompson, Philip', 'Burger, Jan', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Keating, Michael', 'Wierda, William G']","['Hu B', 'Patel KP', 'Chen HC', 'Wang X', 'Luthra R', 'Routbort MJ', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Yin CC', 'Zuo Z', 'Ok CY', 'Loghavi S', 'Tang G', 'Tambaro FP', 'Thompson P', 'Burger J', 'Jain N', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Bose P', 'Estrov Z', 'Keating M', 'Wierda WG']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9848-9497', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6822-7880', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8980-3202', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6177-7572', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0114-8384', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1623-3613', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7357-270X']","['Division of Hematology/Hematologic Malignancies, Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, UT, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'S.S.D.

However, standardization and validation in a scientifically controlled multicentre setting is still lacking. Therefore, IG/TR assay development and design, including bioinformatics, was performed within the EuroClonality-NGS working group and validated for MRD marker identification in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Five EuroMRD ALL reference laboratories performed IG/TR NGS in 50 diagnostic ALL samples, and compared results with those generated through routine IG/TR Sanger sequencing. A central polytarget quality control (cPT-QC) was used to monitor primer performance, and a central in-tube quality control (cIT-QC) was spiked into each sample as a library-specific quality control and calibrator. NGS identified 259 (average 5.2/sample, range 0-14) clonal sequences vs. Sanger-sequencing 248 (average 5.0/sample, range 0-14). NGS primers covered possible IG/TR rearrangement types more completely compared with local multiplex PCR sets and enabled sequencing of bi-allelic rearrangements and weak PCR products. The cPT-QC showed high reproducibility across all laboratories. These validated and reproducible quality-controlled EuroClonality-NGS assays can be used for standardized NGS-based identification of IG/TR markers in lymphoid malignancies.","['Bruggemann, Monika', 'Kotrova, Michaela', 'Knecht, Henrik', 'Bartram, Jack', 'Boudjogrha, Myriam', 'Bystry, Vojtech', 'Fazio, Grazia', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Giraud, Mathieu', 'Grioni, Andrea', 'Hancock, Jeremy', 'Herrmann, Dietrich', 'Jimenez, Cristina', 'Krejci, Adam', 'Moppett, John', 'Reigl, Tomas', 'Salson, Mikael', 'Scheijen, Blanca', 'Schwarz, Martin', 'Songia, Simona', 'Svaton, Michael', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Wakeman, Stephanie', 'Wright, Gary', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Gonzalez, David', 'Groenen, Patricia J T A', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth A', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Trka, Jan', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['Bruggemann M', 'Kotrova M', 'Knecht H', 'Bartram J', 'Boudjogrha M', 'Bystry V', 'Fazio G', 'Fronkova E', 'Giraud M', 'Grioni A', 'Hancock J', 'Herrmann D', 'Jimenez C', 'Krejci A', 'Moppett J', 'Reigl T', 'Salson M', 'Scheijen B', 'Schwarz M', 'Songia S', 'Svaton M', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Villarese P', 'Wakeman S', 'Wright G', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Davi F', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Gonzalez D', 'Groenen PJTA', 'Hummel M', 'Macintyre EA', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Pott C', 'Trka J', 'Darzentas N', 'Langerak AW']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7077-8422', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2741-8047', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1844-3531']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'CLIP -

Several general features including the presence of specific histone modifications are used to demarcate potentially active enhancers. Here we reveal that putative enhancers marked with H3 lysine 79 (H3K79) di or trimethylation (me2/3) (which we name H3K79me2/3 enhancer elements or KEEs) can be found in multiple cell types. Mixed lineage leukemia gene (MLL) rearrangements (MLL-r) such as MLL-AF4 are a major cause of incurable acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Using the DOT1L inhibitor EPZ-5676 in MLL-AF4 leukemia cells, we show that H3K79me2/3 is required for maintaining chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation and transcription factor binding specifically at KEEs but not non-KEE enhancers. We go on to show that H3K79me2/3 is essential for maintaining enhancer-promoter interactions at a subset of KEEs. Together, these data implicate H3K79me2/3 as having a functional role at a subset of active enhancers in MLL-AF4 leukemia cells.","['Godfrey, Laura', 'Crump, Nicholas T', 'Thorne, Ross', 'Lau, I-Jun',

However, targeting those molecules only to sites of active pathology is an obstacle to their clinical use. Because dystrophic muscles become extensively inflamed, we tested whether expressing a therapeutic transgene in leukocyte progenitors that invade muscle would provide selective, timely delivery to diseased muscle. We designed a transgene in which leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is under control of a leukocyte-specific promoter and transplanted transgenic cells into dystrophic mice. Transplantation diminishes pathology, reduces Th2 cytokines in muscle and biases macrophages away from a CD163+/CD206+ phenotype that promotes fibrosis. Transgenic cells also abrogate TGFbeta signaling, reduce fibro/adipogenic progenitor cells and reduce fibrogenesis of muscle cells. These findings indicate that leukocytes expressing a LIF transgene reduce fibrosis by suppressing type 2 immunity and highlight a novel application by which immune cells can be genetically modified as potential therapeutics to treat muscle disease.","['Welc, Steven S', 'Flores, Ivan', 'Wehling-Henricks, Michelle', 'Ramos, Julian', 'Wang, Ying', 'Bertoni, Carmen', 'Tidball, James G']","['Welc SS', 'Flores I', 'Wehling-Henricks M', 'Ramos J', 'Wang Y', 'Bertoni C', 'Tidball JG']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2353-0325', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1202-8038']","['Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular & Integrative Physiology Program, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA.', 'Molecular, Cellular & Integrative Physiology Program, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA.', 'Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA. jtidball@physci.ucla.edu.', 'Molecular, Cellular & Integrative Physiology Program, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1606, USA. jtidball@physci.ucla.edu.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA. jtidball@physci.ucla.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190626,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)']",,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred mdx', 'Muscle, Skeletal/pathology', 'Muscular Dystrophy, Animal/*therapy', 'Random Allocation', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Transgenes']",PMC6594976,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/06/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-10614-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-10614-1 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Jun 26;10(1):2788. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-10614-1.,1,"['R01 AR047721/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1AR062579/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International', 'R21AR066817/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International', 'F32AR065845/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International', 'F32AR071233/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International', 'R01 AR062579/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AR066817/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RO1AR066036/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International', 'R01 AR047855/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32AR071783/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services | NIH | National', 'Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', '(NIAMS)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detect significant allelic imbalance on the wild-type over the IGH-DUX4 haplotype in expression and epigenetic data, showing IGH-DUX4 translocation occurs on the silenced IGH allele. In vitro, this reduces the oncogenic stress of DUX4 high-level expression. Moreover, patient samples of IGH-DUX4 B-ALL have similar expression profile and IGH breakpoints as Nalm6, suggesting a common mechanism to allow optimal dosage of non-toxic DUX4 expression.","['Tian, Liqing', 'Shao, Ying', 'Nance, Stephanie', 'Dang, Jinjun', 'Xu, Beisi', 'Ma, Xiaotu', 'Li, Yongjin', 'Ju, Bensheng', 'Dong, Li', 'Newman, Scott', 'Zhou, Xin', 'Schreiner, Patrick', 'Tseng, Elizabeth', 'Hon, Ting', 'Ashby, Meredith', 'Li, Chunliang', 'Easton, John', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Zhang, Jinghui']","['Tian L', 'Shao Y', 'Nance S', 'Dang J', 'Xu B', 'Ma X', 'Li Y', 'Ju B', 'Dong L', 'Newman S', 'Zhou X', 'Schreiner P', 'Tseng E', 'Hon T', 'Ashby M', 'Li C', 'Easton J', 'Gruber TA', 'Zhang J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9921-0603', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0099-858X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9309-4752', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3350-9682']","[""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", 'Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA.', 'Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA.', 'Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA.', ""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, 38105, USA. jinghui.zhang@stjude.org.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190626,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (DUX4L1 protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genomics', 'Histones', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",PMC6594946,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-019-10637-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-019-10637-8 [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2019 Jun 26;10(1):2789. doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-10637-8.,1,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA216391/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He presented with right hemiparesis in September 2017. He had no history of hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, heart disease, or smoking. Brain MRI revealed a border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a rapidly progressing severe left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. He was initiated on clopidogrel and bosutinib instead of nilotinib. He presented with right hemiparesis once again in December 2017. Brain MRI revealed the border-zone infarction of the left cerebral hemisphere and a more progressed, severe bilateral ICA stenosis. A carotid ultrasound demonstrated iso-intense and concentrically narrowed ICA on both sides. Carotid artery stenting of the left ICA was performed in February 2018, and clopidogrel was replaced by cilostazol to provide a drug-induced rush. Carotid artery stenting of the right ICA was performed in June 2018 and cervical angiogram demonstrated that there were no residual artery stenoses in the bilateral stent. In recent years, several case reports suggest that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are associated with progressive artery stenosis and cause cerebral infarction. Brain imaging tests should be conducted to evaluate arterial stenosis progression for patients with a history of taking TKI when an arterial vascular event occurs.","['Nakaya, Akihiko', 'Ebitani, Masahiro', 'Monzen, Tatsuya', 'Nagno, Takuro', 'Saito, Futoshi', 'Yaoita, Yukihiro']","['Nakaya A', 'Ebitani M', 'Monzen T', 'Nagno T', 'Saito F', 'Yaoita Y']",,"['Department of Neurology, Subaru Health Insurance Society Ota Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Neurology, Subaru Health Insurance Society Ota Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Neurology, Subaru Health Insurance Society Ota Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Subaru Health Insurance Society Ota Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Subaru Health Insurance Society Ota Memorial Hospital.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Subaru Health Insurance Society Ota Memorial Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190627,Japan,Rinsho Shinkeigaku,Rinsho shinkeigaku = Clinical neurology,0417466,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'A74586SNO7 (Clopidogrel)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aniline Compounds/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Carotid Artery, Internal', 'Carotid Stenosis/chemically induced/surgery', 'Cerebral Infarction/*chemically induced/diagnostic imaging', 'Clopidogrel/administration & dosage', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Quinolines/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Stents']",,2019/06/28 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001222 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Shinkeigaku. 2019 Jul 31;59(7):418-424. doi: 10.5692/clinicalneurol.cn-001222.

These mutant proteins can be processed and presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex molecules as neoepitopes, allowing CD8(+) T cells to mount responses against them. For solid tumors, only an average 2% of neoepitopes predicted by algorithms have detectable endogenous antitumor T cell responses. This suggests that low mutation burden tumors, which include many pediatric tumors, are poorly immunogenic. Here, we report that pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have tumor-associated neoepitope-specific CD8(+) T cells, responding to 86% of tested neoantigens and recognizing 68% of the tested neoepitopes. These responses include a public neoantigen from the ETV6-RUNX1 fusion that is targeted in seven of nine tested patients. We characterized phenotypic and transcriptional profiles of CD8(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at the single-cell level and found a heterogeneous population that included highly functional effectors. Moreover, we observed immunodominance hierarchies among the CD8(+) TILs restricted to one or two putative neoepitopes. Our results indicate that robust antitumor immune responses are induced in pediatric ALL despite their low mutation burdens and emphasize the importance of immunodominance in shaping cellular immune responses. Furthermore, these data suggest that pediatric cancers may be amenable to immunotherapies aimed at enhancing immune recognition of tumor-specific neoantigens.","['Zamora, Anthony E', 'Crawford, Jeremy

MYC induces global changes in gene expression that contribute to cell growth, proliferation, and oncogenesis by stimulating the activity of RNA polymerases. A key feature in its ability to stimulate RNA Pol II activity is recruitment of pTEFb, an elongation factor whose catalytic core comprises CDK9/cyclin T complexes. Hence, MYC expression and function may be susceptible to CDK9 inhibition. We conducted a pre-clinical assessment of AZ5576, a selective CDK9 inhibitor, in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The in vitro and in vivo effects of AZ5576 on apoptosis, cell cycle, Mcl-1, and MYC expression were assessed by flow cytometry, immunoblotting, qPCR and RNA-Seq. We demonstrate that, in addition to depleting Mcl-1, targeting CDK9 disrupts MYC oncogenic function. Treatment with AZ5576 inhibited growth of DLBCL cell lines in vitro and in vivo, independent of cell-of-origin. CDK9 inhibition downregulated Mcl-1 and MYC mRNA transcript and protein in a dose-dependent manner. MYC-expressing cell lines demonstrated enhanced susceptibility to AZ5576. CDK9 inhibition promoted turnover of MYC protein, and decreased MYC phosphorylation at the stabilizing Ser62 residue and downregulated MYC transcriptional targets in DLBCL cells, a finding confirmed in a functional reporter assay, suggesting that CDK9 may govern MYC protein turnover, thus regulating its expression through multiple mechanisms. Our data suggest that targeting CDK9 is poised to disrupt MYC oncogenic activity in DLBCL and provide rationale for clinical development of selective CDK9 inhibitors.","['Hashiguchi, Taylor', 'Bruss, Nur', 'Best, Scott', 'Lam, Vi', 'Danilova, Olga', 'Paiva, Cody J', 'Wolf, Joelle', 'Gilbert, Erin W', 'Okada, Craig Y', 'Kaur, Prabhjot', 'Drew, Lisa', 'Cidado, Justin', 'Hurlin, Peter', 'Danilov, Alexey V']","['Hashiguchi T', 'Bruss N', 'Best S', 'Lam V', 'Danilova O', 'Paiva CJ', 'Wolf J', 'Gilbert EW', 'Okada CY', 'Kaur P', 'Drew L', 'Cidado J', 'Hurlin P', 'Danilov AV']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1748-4438'],"['Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Pathology, Portland VA Medical Center, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire.', 'IMED Oncology, AstraZeneca, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'IMED Oncology, AstraZeneca, Waltham, Massachusetts.', 'Shriners Hospital for Children, Portland, Oregon.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon. danilov@ohsu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190626,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2018/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-18-1023 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1023 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Sep;18(9):1520-1532. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1023.

Mutational information for patients still on ibrutinib is limited. We report a study aimed to provide a ""snapshot"" of the prevalence of mutations in a real-life CLL cohort still on ibrutinib after at least 3 years of treatment. Of 204 patients who initiated ibrutinib via an early-access program at 29 French Innovative Leukemia Organization (FILO) centers, 63 (31%) were still on ibrutinib after 3 years and 57 provided a fresh blood sample. Thirty patients had a CLL clone >/=0.5 x 10(9)/L, enabling next-generation sequencing (NGS); BTK and PLCG2 mutations were detected in 57% and 13% of the NGS samples, respectively. After median follow-up of 8.5 months from sample collection, the presence of a BTK mutation was significantly associated with subsequent CLL progression (P = .0005 vs no BTK mutation). Our findings support that mutational analysis should be considered in patients receiving ibrutinib who have residual clonal lymphocytosis, and that clinical trials are needed to evaluate whether patients with a BTK mutation may benefit from an early switch to another treatment.","['Quinquenel, Anne', 'Fornecker, Luc-Matthieu', 'Letestu, Remi', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Fleury, Carole', 'Lazarian, Gregory', 'Dilhuydy, Marie-Sarah', 'Nollet, Delphine', 'Guieze, Romain', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Roos-Weil, Damien', 'Willems, Lise', 'Michallet, Anne-Sophie', 'Delmer, Alain', 'Hormigos, Katia', 'Levy, Vincent', 'Cymbalista, Florence', 'Baran-Marszak, Fanny']","['Quinquenel A', 'Fornecker LM', 'Letestu R', 'Ysebaert L', 'Fleury C', 'Lazarian G', 'Dilhuydy MS', 'Nollet D', 'Guieze R', 'Feugier P', 'Roos-Weil D', 'Willems L', 'Michallet AS', 'Delmer A', 'Hormigos K', 'Levy V', 'Cymbalista F', 'Baran-Marszak F']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3666-3442', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7767-755X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1430-2574']","['Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Reims, Hopital Robert Debre, Reims, France.', 'Universite Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Unite de Formation et de Recherche (UFR) Medecine, Reims, France.', 'Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'INSERM S-1113, Strasbourg, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine, Universite de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Groupe de Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis (GHUPSSD), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny, France.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U978 INSERM, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, UFR Sante Medecine, Biologie Humaine (SMBH), Bobigny, France.', 'Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse (IUCT)-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Groupe de Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis (GHUPSSD), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny, France.', 'Groupe de Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis (GHUPSSD), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny, France.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U978 INSERM, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, UFR Sante Medecine, Biologie Humaine (SMBH), Bobigny, France.', 'CHU Bordeaux, Pessac, France.', 'CHU Tours, Tours, France.', 'CHU Clermont-Ferrand, Clermont Ferrand, France.', 'CHU Nancy, Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy, France.', 'Hopital de la Pitie-Salpetriere, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Sorbonne Universites-Universite Pierre et Marie-Curie (UPMC), Universite Paris 06, Groupe de Recherche Clinique (GRC)-11, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Cochin, AP-HP, Paris, France.', 'Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.', 'Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Reims, Hopital Robert Debre, Reims, France.', 'Universite Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Unite de Formation et de Recherche (UFR) Medecine, Reims, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) SNC5014, UMR-S1147 INSERM, Paris, France; and.', 'Faculte des Sciences Fondamentales et Biomedicales, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Groupe de Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis (GHUPSSD), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, UFR Sante Medecine, Biologie Humaine (SMBH), Bobigny, France.', 'Groupe de Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis (GHUPSSD), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny, France.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U978 INSERM, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, UFR Sante Medecine, Biologie Humaine (SMBH), Bobigny, France.', 'Groupe de Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Seine-Saint-Denis (GHUPSSD), Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Bobigny, France.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) U978 INSERM, Bobigny, France.', 'Universite Paris 13, UFR Sante Medecine, Biologie Humaine (SMBH), Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190626,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phospholipase C gamma/*genetics', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/01/24 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)46186-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000854 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Aug 15;134(7):641-644. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000854.

Our aim was to investigate an integrated Gene expression, Mirna and miRNA-mRNA Interactions (GMI) signature for improving risk stratification of AML. METHODS: We identified differentially expressed genes by pooling a large number of 861 human AML patients and 75 normal cases. We then used miRWalk to identify the functional miRNA-mRNA regulatory module. The GMI signature based random survival forest (RSF) prognosis model was developed from training data set and evaluated in independent patient cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (N = 147). Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were applied to evaluate the prognostic value of GMI signature. RESULTS: We identified 139 differentially expressed genes between normal and abnormal AML samples. We discovered the functional miRNA-mRNA regulatory module which participate in the network of cancer progression. We named 23 differentially expressed genes and 16 validated target miRNAs as the GMI signature. The RSF model-based scores separated independent patient cohorts into two groups with significantly different overall survival (C-index = 0.59, hazard ratio [HR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.11-4.03; p = 0.019). Similar results were obtained with reversed training and testing datasets (C-index = 0.58, hazard ratio [HR], 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-4.24; p = 0.038). The GMI signature score contributed more information about recurrence than standard clinical covariates. CONCLUSION: The GMI signature based RSF prognosis model not only reflects regulatory relationships from identified miRNA-mRNA module but also informs patient prognosis. While in the TCGA data set the GMI signature score contributed additional information about recurrence in comparison to standard clinical covariates, further studies are needed to determine its clinical significance.","['Shi, Mingguang', 'Xu, Guofu']","['Shi M', 'Xu G']",,"['School of Electric Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, 230009, Anhui, China. mingguang.shi@hfut.edu.cn.', 'School of Electric Engineering and Automation, Hefei University of Technology, Hefei, 230009, Anhui, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20190626,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC6595612,2019/06/28 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/06/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-019-0540-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-019-0540-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Jun 26;12(1):90. doi: 10.1186/s12920-019-0540-5.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*A GMI signature', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Random survival forest', '*The functional miRNA-mRNA regulatory module']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study evaluates the efficacy of decitabine in the management of refractory or relapsed AML. Methods: After literature search in electronic databases (Google Scholar, Embase, Ovid, and PubMed) studies were selected by following pre-determined eligibility criteria. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed to achieve effect sizes of complete remission (CR) rate, response rate (RR), and median survival after therapy. Subgroup analyses were performed with regards to use of decitabine with either epigenetics-based therapy, molecular therapy or chemotherapy. Results: Twenty studies were included (310 patients; age 55.1 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 43.8, 66.4]; 57% [52%, 63%] males). Overall RR was 46.1% [95% CI: 36.1%, 56.1%]. Overall CR rate was 23.5% [95% CI: 22.1%, 24.9%] but was 14.85% [95% CI: 3.8%, 25.9%] for decitabine with epigenetics-based therapies, 15.4% [95% CI: 6.7%, 24.0%] for decitabine with immunotherapy or molecular therapy, 34.8% [95% CI: 18.7%, 50.9%] for decitabine with chemotherapy, and 37.5% [36.4%, 38.7%] for decitabine with chemotherapy and molecular therapy. Median survival was 7.2 months [95% CI: 5.17, 9.3]. Major adverse events were neutropenia, nausea/vomiting, infections, fatigue, febrile neutropenia, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, anemia, anorexia, leukopenia, hemorrhage, and hyperglycemia.

We identified deregulated expression for ten miRNAs with miR-127, miR-136, miR-142-3p, miR-221, and miR-423-5p being down-regulated whilst let-7b, miR-29c, miR-30c, miR-193a-5p, and miR-885-5p being up-regulated in infected individuals. ROC curve analyses showed an AUC (Areas Under the ROC Curve) of 0.875 (95% CI: 0.7819-0.9581; P=.0021), 0.861 (95% CI: 0.7596-0.9754; P=.003), 0.856 (95% CI: 0.689-0.895; P=.011), and 0.849 (95% CI: 0.678-0.855; P=.017) for miR-29c, miR-30c, miR-193a-5p, and miR-885-5p respectively. Combined ROC analyses using these 4 miRNAs showed a greater AUC of 0.907 (95% CI: 0.809-1; P=.000001) indicating a robust diagnostic value of these 4 miRNAs. Our findings highlight serum miR-29c, miR-30c, miR-193a-5p and miR-885-5p as novel potential biomarkers important for HTLV-1 diagnosis.","['Fayyad-Kazan, Mohammad', 'ElDirani, Rim', 'Hamade, Eva', 'El Majzoub, Rania', 'Akl, Haidar', 'Bitar, Nizar', 'Fayyad-Kazan, Hussein', 'Badran, Bassam']","['Fayyad-Kazan M', 'ElDirani R', 'Hamade E', 'El Majzoub R', 'Akl H', 'Bitar N', 'Fayyad-Kazan H', 'Badran B']",,"['Laboratory of Cancer biology and Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Sciences-I, Lebanese University, Hadath, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Laboratory of Cancer biology and Molecular Immunology, Faculty of Sciences-I, Lebanese University, Hadath, Beirut, Lebanon.

However, the use of CAR T-cell therapy against CD19-negative hematological cancers and solid tumors has been challenging. We propose CD19-fusion proteins (CD19-FPs) to leverage the benefits of CAR19s while retargeting this validated cellular therapy to alternative tumor antigens. We demonstrate the ability of a fusion of CD19 extracellular domain (ECD) and a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) single-chain antibody fragment to retarget CAR19s to kill HER2(+) CD19(-) tumor cells. To enhance the modularity of this technology, we engineered a more robust CD19 ECD via deep mutational scanning with yeast display and flow cytometric selections for improved protease resistance and anti-CD19 antibody binding. These enhanced CD19 ECDs significantly increase, and in some cases recover, fusion protein expression while maintaining target antigen affinity. Importantly, CD19-FPs retarget CAR19s to kill tumor cells expressing multiple distinct antigens, including HER2, CD20, EGFR, BCMA, and Clec12A as N- or C-terminal fusions and linked to both antibody fragments and fibronectin ligands. This study provides fundamental insights into CD19 sequence-function relationships and defines a flexible and modular platform to retarget CAR19s to any tumor antigen.","['Klesmith, Justin R', 'Su, Lihe', 'Wu, Lan', 'Schrack, Ian A', 'Dufort, Fay J', 'Birt, Alyssa', 'Ambrose, Christine', 'Hackel, Benjamin J', 'Lobb, Roy R', 'Rennert, Paul D']","['Klesmith JR', 'Su L', 'Wu L', 'Schrack IA', 'Dufort FJ', 'Birt A', 'Ambrose C', 'Hackel BJ', 'Lobb RR', 'Rennert PD']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2908-9355', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3561-9463']","['Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science , University of Minnesota Twin Cities , 421 Washington Avenue SE , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science , University of Minnesota Twin Cities , 421 Washington Avenue SE , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science , University of Minnesota Twin Cities , 421 Washington Avenue SE , Minneapolis , Minnesota 55455 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.', 'Aleta Biotherapeutics , 27 Strathmore Road , Natick , Massachusetts 01760 , United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190715,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'Protein Engineering', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/transplantation']",,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/06/26 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00418 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2019 Aug 5;16(8):3544-3558. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.9b00418.

Pediatrics testicular MS may pose a possible diagnostic challenge, an issue that is underscored in the few testicular pediatric MS cases reported in the literature. Herein, we report a series of 5 cases of pediatric testicular MS that are evaluated at the morphologic and immunohistochemical levels with correlation with the KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement status. Three patients presented with no prior history of acute myeloid leukemia. All 5 cases showed monoblastic morphology; positive for CD33, CD43, CD68, CD163, CD4 (dim), and lysozyme; and negative for CD10, CD34, CD117, and myeloperoxidase. KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was detected in 4 of the 5 cases. In the literature, 8 more cases of pediatric testicular lymphoma were reported. Most of them showed monocytic differentiation and KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement was reported in 3 of the cases. In conclusions, testicular MS in pediatric patients shows monoblastic differentiation which may be attributed to the KMT2A (MLL) rearrangement.

However, there is now evidence of the extraordinary characterization of the different proteoforms and their interactions in a biological environment that PTM crosstalk studies can describe. Besides gene expression and phosphorylation profiling of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples, the functional combination of several PTMs that might contribute to a better understanding of the complexity of the AML proteome remains to be discovered. OBJECTIVE: By reviewing current workflows for the simultaneous enrichment of several PTMs and bioinformatics tools to analyze mass spectrometry (MS)-based data, our major objective is to introduce the PTM crosstalk field to the AML research community. RESULTS: After an introduction to PTMs and PTM crosstalk, this review introduces several protocols for the simultaneous enrichment of PTMs. Two of them allow a simultaneous enrichment of at least three PTMs when using 0.5-2 mg of cell lysate. We have reviewed many of the bioinformatics tools used for PTM crosstalk discovery as its complex data analysis, mainly generated from MS, becomes challenging for most AML researchers. We have presented several non-AML PTM crosstalk studies throughout the review in order to show how important the characterization of PTM crosstalk becomes for the selection of disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. CONCLUSION: Herein, we have reviewed the advances and pitfalls of the emerging PTM crosstalk field and its potential contribution to unravel the heterogeneity of AML. The complexity of sample preparation and bioinformatics workflows demands a good interaction between experts of several areas.","['Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Wangen, Rebecca', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Guldbrandsen, Astrid']","['Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Wangen R', 'Berven FS', 'Guldbrandsen A']",,"['Department of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 87, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, Building for Basic Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, N-5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 87, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, Building for Basic Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, N-5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Section, Haukeland University Hospital, Jonas Lies vei 65, N-5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, Building for Basic Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, N-5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'The Proteomics Unit at the University of Bergen, Department of Biomedicine, Building for Basic Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, N-5009 Bergen, Norway.', 'Computational Biology Unit, Department of Informatics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, University of Bergen, Thormohlensgt 55, N-5008 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational']",,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-98362 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867326666190503164004 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2019;26(28):5317-5337. doi: 10.2174/0929867326666190503164004.,28,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'acetylproteome', 'biomarkers', 'crosstalk', 'glycoproteome', 'mass spectrometry', 'methylproteome', 'phosphoproteome', 'post-translational modifications', 'proteoform', 'proteome', 'ubiquitinome.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to explore the expression of HPIP in endometrial cancer (EC) and its associated effects on disease. METHODS: A total of 113 EC patients at the Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital between August 2011 and September 2012 were studied for immunohistochemistry analysis. HPIP expression was detected using real-time reverse transcription PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Prognostic value of HPIP expression was examined using multivariate Cox regression analysis and Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The result of Western blotting indicated that HPIP protein expression is significantly high in normal tissues compared to EC tissues (P < 0.001). The expression of HPIP was significantly associated with FIGO stage (P < 0.001), histological grade (P < 0.001), depth of myometrial invasion (P < 0.001), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.033). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that there was a significant difference in overall survival and disease-free survival between the two groups of patients stratified by HPIP expression level (log-rank, both P = 0.002). Patients with HPIP high expression had significantly shorter median survival time than those with HPIP low expression. Moreover, results of the multivariate analysis revealed that HPIP expression was an independent prognostic factor for predicting overall survival (P = 0.015) and disease-free survival (P = 0.017) in patients with EC. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence that HPIP predicts EC progression and poor survival, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for EC.","['Cheng, Li', 'Zhao, Tingting', 'Li, Shiguo', 'Wang, Yao', 'Fei, Hui', 'Meng, Fanling']","['Cheng L', 'Zhao T', 'Li S', 'Wang Y', 'Fei H', 'Meng F']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2997-5851'],"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun-Yat sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun-Yat sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun-Yat sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Daqing Oilfield General Hospital, Daqing, Heilongjiang, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, The Seventh Affiliated Hospital, Sun-Yat sen University, Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China.', 'Department of Gynaecology, Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190626,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HCFC1R1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/metabolism/*secondary/surgery', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",PMC6805295,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22959 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2019 Oct;33(8):e22959. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22959.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in the Oncology Department of Jinnah Hospital, Lahore, over a period of 6 months. Patients aged 7-70 years diagnosed either by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for BCR-ABL or cytogenetics for Philadelphia (Ph) chromosomes and consuming different doses of imatinib for the treatment of CML were randomly selected. Skin manifestations were analyzed and recorded on a predesigned proforma by a dermatologist. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients were enrolled; 65 male (49.24%) and 67 female (50.75%). Periorbital edema was found in 48.5% of cases, and hyperpigmentaion and melasma were found in 76.5% of cases. Pruritus was diagnosed in 6.8% of cases, alopecia in 5.3% of cases, and photosensitivity in 43.9% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that imatinib is associated with many adverse cutaneous side effects which should be overcome or reduced by either decreasing the duration of treatment with imatinib or switching to other treatment options.","['Khokar, Abbas', 'Malik, Uzma', 'Butt, Ghazala', 'Naumeri, Fatima']","['Khokar A', 'Malik U', 'Butt G', 'Naumeri F']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3875-0961'],"['King Edward Medical University (KEMU)/Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'King Edward Medical University (KEMU)/Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'King Edward Medical University (KEMU)/Mayo Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan.', 'Jefferson Joint School District 251, Lahore, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190626,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (abl-bcr fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Eruptions/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pakistan/epidemiology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijd.14562 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2019 Sep;58(9):1098-1101. doi: 10.1111/ijd.14562.

We showed earlier that Bcl10 plays a role in Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodelling, independent of blood pressure. We now investigated the role of Bcl10 in Ang II-induced renal damage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Bcl10 knockout mice (Bcl10 KO) and wild-type (WT) controls were given 1% NaCl in the drinking water and Ang II (1.44 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. Additionally, Bcl10 KO or WT kidneys were transplanted onto WT mice that were challenged by the same protocol for 7 days. Kidneys of Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice developed less fibrosis and showed fewer infiltrating cells. Nevertheless, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (Ngal) and kidney injury molecule (Kim)1 expression was higher in the kidneys of Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice, indicating exacerbated tubular damage. Furthermore, albuminuria was significantly higher in Ang II-treated Bcl10 KO mice accompanied by reduced glomerular nephrin expression and podocyte number. Ang II-treated WT mice transplanted with Bcl10 KO kidney showed more albuminuria and renal Ngal, compared to WT- > WT kidney-transplanted mice, as well as lower podocyte number but similar fibrosis and cell infiltration. Interestingly, mice lacking Bcl10 in the kidney exhibited less Ang II-induced cardiac hypertrophy than controls. CONCLUSION: Bcl10 has multi-faceted actions in Ang II-induced renal damage. On the one hand, global Bcl10 deficiency ameliorates renal fibrosis and cell infiltration; on the other hand, lack of renal Bcl10 aggravates albuminuria and podocyte damage. These data suggest that Bcl10 maintains podocyte integrity and renal function.","['Marko, Lajos', 'Park, Joon-Keun', 'Henke, Norbert', 'Rong, Song', 'Balogh, Andras', 'Klamer, Samuel', 'Bartolomaeus, Hendrik', 'Wilck, Nicola', 'Ruland, Jurgen', 'Forslund, Sofia K', 'Luft, Friedrich C', 'Dechend, Ralf', 'Muller, Dominik N']","['Marko L', 'Park JK', 'Henke N', 'Rong S', 'Balogh A', 'Klamer S', 'Bartolomaeus H', 'Wilck N', 'Ruland J', 'Forslund SK', 'Luft FC', 'Dechend R', 'Muller DN']",,"['Experimental and Clinical Research Center, a cooperation of Charite -

Appropriate reaction conditions allowed obtaining the two isomers separately without separation techniques. X-ray crystallography has determined the crystal and molecular structures of the new complexes. mer-Ru(iii) (1) crystallised in the monoclinic P2(1)/n group, and fac-Ru(iii) (2, 2') in the triclinic P1[combining macron] space group. The composition of the ruthenium coordination sphere was confirmed and characterised using spectroscopic techniques (FT-IR, UV-vis and EPR), elemental analysis and mass spectrometry (MS-FAB). The structures of the complexes obtained were analysed using X-ray and other spectroscopic methods (IR and UV-vis). The electrochemical properties of the ligand and the complex compound were identified using cyclic voltammetry, determining the potential and charge of faradaic processes. Both isomers are redox active and display quasi-reversible metal centered redox processes for the Ru(iii)/Ru(ii) pair. Moreover, preliminary tests of their biological activity were performed. The cytotoxicity of these compounds has been tested for human lung carcinoma (A549), chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562), human cervix carcinoma (HeLa) cells, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MOLT-4), human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) and normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The ability to induce apoptosis has been demonstrated in caspase 3/7 activity assay. In addition, the lipophilicity of both isomers was described by a partition coefficient, log P, values of which were estimated by the shake-flask method. The interesting and promising preliminary results of the biological and chemical activities of the new octahedral mer/fac Ru(iii) complexes motivate further in vitro and in vivo studies.","['Richert, Monika', 'Walczyk, Mariusz', 'Cieslak, Marcin Janusz', 'Kazmierczak-Baranska, Julia', 'Krolewska-Golinska, Karolina', 'Wrzeszcz, Grzegorz', 'Muziol, Tadeusz', 'Biniak, Stanislaw']","['Richert M', 'Walczyk M', 'Cieslak MJ', 'Kazmierczak-Baranska J', 'Krolewska-Golinska K', 'Wrzeszcz G', 'Muziol T', 'Biniak S']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9912-3881', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6769-7426', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9628-214X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2132-2119', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5220-4430', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3467-755X']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Jurasza 2, 85-094 Bydgoszcz, Poland. monika.richert@cm.umk.pl.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Sienkiewicza 112, 90-363 Lodz, Poland. marcin@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Sienkiewicza 112, 90-363 Lodz, Poland. marcin@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Centre of Molecular and Macromolecular Studies, Polish Academy of Sciences, Sienkiewicza 112, 90-363 Lodz, Poland. marcin@cbmm.lodz.pl.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100 Torun, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemistry, Nicolaus Copernicus University in Torun, Gagarina 7, 87-100 Torun, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Dalton Trans,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",101176026,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '26D26OA393 (triphenylphosphine)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Benzothiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Electrochemical Techniques', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Ruthenium/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9dt01803d [doi]'],ppublish,Dalton Trans. 2019 Jul 16;48(28):10689-10702. doi: 10.1039/c9dt01803d.,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Due to their potential binding sites in human-protein coding genes, many studies have also linked their altered expressions in various cancer types making them tumor suppressors agents. METHODS: Moreover, each miRNA is predicted to have many mRNA targets indicating their extensive regulatory role in cell survival and developmental processes. Nowadays, diagnosis of early cancer stage development is now dependent on variable miRNA expression levels as potential oncogenic biomarkers in validating and targeting microRNAs for cancer therapy. RESULTS: As the majority of miRNA, transcripts are derived from RNA polymerase II-directed transcription, stress response could result on a general reduction in the abundance of these transcripts. Over expression of various microRNAs have lead to B cell malignancy, potentiated KrasG12Dinduced lung tumorigenesis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoproliferative disease and autoimmunity. CONCLUSION: Altered miRNA expressions could have a significant impact on the abundance of proteins, making them attractive candidates as biomarkers for cancer detection and important regulators of apoptosis.","['Roufayel, Rabih', 'Kadry, Seifedine']","['Roufayel R', 'Kadry S']",,"['Department of Science, College of Engineering and Technology, American University of the Middle East, Egaila, Kuwait.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Guelph, 50 Stone Road East, Guelph, Ontario, N1G 2W1, Canada.', 'Department of Mathematics and Computer Science, Faculty of Science, Beirut Arab University, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Microrna,"MicroRNA (Shariqah, United Arab Emirates)",101631045,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics']",PMC7366010,2019/06/27 06:00,2021/05/13 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['MIRNA-EPUB-99191 [pii]', '10.2174/2211536608666190625120127 [doi]']",ppublish,Microrna. 2020;9(2):93-100. doi: 10.2174/2211536608666190625120127.,2,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*cancer', '*leukemia', '*miRNAs', '*regulators', '*stress.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper was to document survival disparities associated with insurance status across the AYA age continuum in the United States. METHODS: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiologic, and End Results database to identify 66 556 AYA patients between 2007 and 2014 with 10 International Classification of Childhood Cancer diagnoses and calculated the Cox proportional hazard ratios of death for those with public or no insurance status compared to private insurance. The odds ratios of having a late stage of diagnosis by insurance status were also calculated. RESULTS: Insurance status was a statistically significant predictor of death for lymphoid leukemia (age 15-19, 30-34, and 35-39), acute myeloid leukemia (age 15-19 and 25-29), Hodgkin lymphoma (all ages), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (age 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39), astrocytomas (age 30-34), other gliomas (age 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39), hepatic carcinomas (age 25-29), fibrosarcomas, peripheral nerve and other fibrous tumors (age 30-34), malignant gonadal germ cell tumors (age 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39), and other and unspecified carcinomas (age 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, and 35-39), independent of stage at diagnosis. This hazard increased with age for most cancer types. Insurance status strongly predicted the odds of a metastatic cancer diagnosis for lymphoma, fibrosarcomas (age 15-19), germ cell tumors, and other carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: AYA in the US experience disparities in cancer survival based on insurance status, independent of late stage of presentation. Patients age 26-39 may be especially vulnerable to health outcomes associated with poor socioeconomic status, treatment disparities, and poor access to care.","['Colton, Meryl D', 'Goulding, DeLayna', 'Beltrami, Alina', 'Cost, Carrye', 'Franklin, Anna', 'Cockburn, Myles G', 'Green, Adam L']","['Colton MD', 'Goulding D', 'Beltrami A', 'Cost C', 'Franklin A', 'Cockburn MG', 'Green AL']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7380-1341', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4469-2358']","['University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, Colorado.', 'University of Denver, Denver, Colorado.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', ""Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', ""Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado."", 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, Colorado.', 'University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado.', ""Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190626,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Insurance Coverage/*statistics & numerical data', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'Neoplasms/classification/*mortality', 'SEER Program', 'Social Class', 'Survival Analysis', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6712520,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/08/15 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2230 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Aug;8(10):4867-4874. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2230.

It is known to decompose into 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB) under physiologic conditions. In this study, we investigate whether N-terminal valine adducts can be utilized to monitor differences in DEB formation of patients receiving treosulfan as part of the conditioning regimen for transplantation. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from a group of 14 transplant recipients and analyzed for N,N-(2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-butadiyl)valine (pyr-Val) and 2,3,4-trihydroxybutylvaline (THB-Val) adducts as biomarkers for drug uptake and metabolism before treosulfan treatment and 6 days after treatment. RESULTS: A new direct injection liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method was developed and validated prior to clinical analysis. The assay precision was determined by 3 replicate analyses on 3 individual days using control globin spiked with known amounts of pyr-Val and THB-Val. The intra- and inter-day precision coefficients of variance (CVs) and accuracy were < 10% and 15%, respectively. In clinical specimens, the means +/- SD of pyr-Val and THB-Val background were 0.29 +/- 0.10 pmol/g HB and 5.17 +/- 1.7 pmol/g HB, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These values are similar to those found previously. Treosulfan treatment leads to a significant increase in pyr-Val and THB-Val adducts in each patient (Student's t-test p <0.0001). The mean +/- SD amounts of adduct formed were 245.3 +/- 89.6 and 210 +/- 78.5 pmol/g globin for pyr-Val and THB-Val, respectively. Importantly, these results show that this direct injection method can quantitate both background and treosulfan-induced pyr-Val and THB-Val N-terminal valine globin adducts in humans.","['Boysen, Gunnar', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Danylesko, Ivetta', 'Varda-Bloom, Nira', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Boysen G', 'Shimoni A', 'Danylesko I', 'Varda-Bloom N', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8364-9881', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6126-884X']","['Department of Environmental and Occupational Health, The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72205, USA.', 'The Winthrop P.

We previously reported that use of an FRET-based drug sensitivity test at diagnosis efficiently predicts the response to treatment with imatinib or dasatinib. Here, we conducted a phase-II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of nilotinib treatment and identify useful biomarkers, including results of the FRET-based drug sensitivity test, for predicting treatment response. Data from 42 patients were used in the analysis. Major molecular response (MMR), MR4, and MR4.5 rates at 12 months were 64.3, 42.9, and 28.6%, respectively. Grade 3/4 non-hematologic adverse events occurred in 11 patients (26.2%). The dose intensity of nilotinib (> 76.44%) and halving time (HT, < 13.312 days) were identified as significant factors for MMR at 12 months. However, when we focused on patients whose dose intensity of nilotinib was > 76.44%, the FRET-based drug sensitivity test became a predictive factor of MR4 achievement at 12 months. Our study reconfirmed the efficacy and safety of nilotinib treatment in CML patients. Moreover, our results suggest that the FRET-based drug sensitivity test is an independent predictor for achievement of MR4 in patients treated with a sufficient dose intensity of nilotinib.","['Kondo, Takeshi', 'Fujioka, Mari', 'Fujisawa, Shinichi', 'Sato, Kaori', 'Tsuda, Masumi', 'Miyagishima, Takuto', 'Mori, Akio', 'Iwasaki, Hiroshi', 'Kakinoki, Yasutaka', 'Yamamoto, Satoshi', 'Haseyama, Yoshihito', 'Ando, Seisho', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Ota, Shuichi', 'Kurosawa, Mitsutoshi', 'Ohba, Yusuke', 'Teshima, Takanori']","['Kondo T', 'Fujioka M', 'Fujisawa S', 'Sato K', 'Tsuda M', 'Miyagishima T', 'Mori A', 'Iwasaki H', 'Kakinoki Y', 'Yamamoto S', 'Haseyama Y', 'Ando S', 'Shindo M', 'Ota S', 'Kurosawa M', 'Ohba Y', 'Teshima T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7455-5824'],"['Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. t-kondoh@med.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Blood Disorders Center, Aiiku Hospital, S4W25, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 064-0804, Japan. t-kondoh@med.hokudai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Cell Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory and Transfusion Medicine, Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Cancer Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Japan Labour Health and Welfare Organization, Kushiro Rosai Hospital, Kushiro, Japan.', 'Blood Disorders Center, Aiiku Hospital, S4W25, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 064-0804, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido P.W.F.A.C.

We analyze the incidence and clinical outcome of IFD in a large series of adult AML patients undergoing front-line intensive induction and consolidation chemotherapy between 2004 and 2015 in a single institution. Three antifungal prophylaxis regimens were given (2004-2005 oral fluconazole, 2006-2012 intravenous itraconazole, and 2013-2015 voriconazole). Overall, 285 patients and 589 intensive chemotherapy episodes were assessed (47%) (induction courses 47% and consolidation 53%). The median age was 51 years (range, 17-65). We observed 56 (10%) episodes of IFD. According to the EORTC 2008 criteria, IFD was classified as possible (29, 52%), probable (17, 30%), and proven (10, 18%). Possible/probable/proven IFD rate was significantly lower during HiDAC consolidation as compared to any anthracycline-containing chemotherapy courses (2% vs. 11%, P = 0.001), and under voriconazole prophylaxis as compared to itraconazole and fluconazole (6% vs. 11% vs. 15%, P = 0.007), and the multivariate analysis showed that they were independent risk factors. Patients under voriconazole prophylaxis had shorter hospitalization duration and less frequent use of empirical or directed antifungal therapy.

The ubiquity of multidimensional data has motivated the replacement of user-guided clustering with fully automated clustering. The fully automated methods are designed to make clustering more accurate, standardized and faster. However, the adoption of these methods is still limited by the lack of intuitive visualization and cluster matching methods that would allow users to readily interpret fully automatically generated clusters. To address these issues, we developed a fully automated subset identification and characterization (SIC) pipeline providing robust cluster matching and data visualization tools for high-dimensional flow/mass cytometry (and other) data. This pipeline automatically (and intuitively) generates two-dimensional representations of high-dimensional datasets that are safe from the curse of dimensionality. This new approach allows more robust and reproducible data analysis,+ facilitating the development of new gold standard practices across laboratories and institutions.","['Meehan, Stephen', 'Kolyagin, Gleb A', 'Parks, David', 'Youngyunpipatkul, Justin', 'Herzenberg, Leonore A', 'Walther, Guenther', 'Ghosn, Eliver E B', 'Orlova, Darya Y']","['Meehan S', 'Kolyagin GA', 'Parks D', 'Youngyunpipatkul J', 'Herzenberg LA', 'Walther G', 'Ghosn EEB', 'Orlova DY']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7258-906X'],"['1Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.', 'Independent Researcher, Menlo Park, CA 94025 USA.', '1Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.', '1Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.', '1Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.', '3Department of Statistics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.', ""4Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics, Lowance Center for Human Immunology, Emory Vaccine Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA."", '1Department of Genetics, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190620,England,Commun Biol,Communications biology,101719179,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cluster Analysis', '*Data Visualization', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology']",PMC6586874,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s42003-019-0467-6 [doi]', '467 [pii]']",epublish,Commun Biol. 2019 Jun 20;2:229. doi: 10.1038/s42003-019-0467-6. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Computational platforms and environments', '*Statistical methods']","['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing financial interests.

Insulin is an agonist of this pathway and a growth factor for AML cells. We characterized the effect of insulin on the phosphorylation of 10 mediators in the main track of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway in AML cells from 76 consecutive patients. The overall results showed that insulin significantly increased the phosphorylation of all investigated mediators. However, insulin effects on the pathway activation profile varied among patients, and increased phosphorylation in all mediators was observed only in a minority of patients; in other patients, insulin had divergent effects. Global gene expression profiling and proteomic/phosphoproteomic comparisons suggested that AML cells from these two patient subsets differed with regard to AML cell differentiation, transcriptional regulation, RNA metabolism, and cellular metabolism. Strong insulin-induced phosphorylation was associated with weakened antiproliferative effects of metabolic inhibitors. PI3K, Akt, and mTOR inhibitors also caused divergent effects on the overall pathway phosphorylation profile in the presence of insulin, although PI3K and Akt inhibition caused a general reduction in Akt pT308 and 4EBP1 pT36/pT45 phosphorylation. For Akt inhibition, the phosphorylation of upstream mediators was generally increased or unaltered. In contrast, mTOR inhibition reduced mTOR pS2448 and S6 pS244 phosphorylation but increased Akt pT308 phosphorylation. In conclusion, the effects of both insulin and PI3K-Akt-mTOR inhibitors differ between AML patient subsets, and differences in insulin responsiveness are associated with differential susceptibility to metabolic targeting.","['Nepstad, Ina', 'Hatfield, Kimberley Joanne', 'Gronningsaeter, Ida Sofie', 'Aasebo, Elise', 'Hernandez-Valladares, Maria', 'Hagen, Karen Marie', 'Rye, Kristin Paulsen', 'Berven, Frode S', 'Selheim, Frode', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Nepstad I', 'Hatfield KJ', 'Gronningsaeter IS', 'Aasebo E', 'Hernandez-Valladares M', 'Hagen KM', 'Rye KP', 'Berven FS', 'Selheim F', 'Reikvam H', 'Bruserud O']",,"['1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '2Department of Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '3Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '3Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '3Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', '3Department of Biomedicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 91, 5009 Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '4Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.', '1Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', '4Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190619,England,Signal Transduct Target Ther,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,101676423,,,,PMC6582141,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41392-019-0050-0 [doi]', '50 [pii]']",epublish,Signal Transduct Target Ther. 2019 Jun 19;4:20. doi: 10.1038/s41392-019-0050-0. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Gene expression analysis', '*Haematological cancer', '*Molecular biology', '*Molecular medicine']",['Competing interestsThe authors declare no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

The induction of autophagic death in tumor cells represents a new route for leukemia treatment. Our previous study showed that infection of CML cells with oncolytic viruses carrying the autophagy gene Beclin1 downregulated BCR/ABL protein expression and significantly increased the killing effect of the oncolytic viruses on CML cells via autophagy activation. However, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of BCR/ABL and Beclin1-dependent CML cell killing remain unclear. Methods: A physical interaction between BCR/ABL and Beclin1 was characterized via GST-pulldown, co-IP and dual-luciferase reporter assays. Cell proliferation was examined via CCK-8 and clone formation assays. The expression levels of the related proteins were measured via Western blotting. Autophagosomes were observed under transmission electron microscopy. Lentiviral vectors carrying Atg7/UVRAG shRNA or the Beclin1 gene were used to modulate the expression levels of the indicated genes. Immunofluorescence were performed to examine colocalization of BCR/ABL and p62/SQSTM1. CD34(+)CD38(-) cells were isolated from bone marrow samples from CML patients via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Results: In this study, we observed that Beclin1 directly interacts with BCR/ABL. Beclin1 inhibited the activity of the BCR/ABL promoter to downregulate the level of BCR/ABL protein and to promote the downstream colocalization of p62/SQSTM1 and BCR/ABL to autolysosomes for degradation via activation of the autophagy signaling pathway. In CML cell lines, primary cells and CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia stem cells, Beclin1 overexpression significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation and induced autophagy. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that autophagy induction via Beclin1 overexpression might offer new approaches for treating TKI-resistant CML and for promoting the clearance of leukemia stem cells, both of which have important clinical implications.","['Huang, Xianbo', 'Li, Ying', 'Shou, Lihong', 'Li, Li', 'Chen, Zhenzhen', 'Ye, Xiujin', 'Qian, Wenbin']","['Huang X', 'Li Y', 'Shou L', 'Li L', 'Chen Z', 'Ye X', 'Qian W']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Central Hospital of Huzhou City, Huzhou 313000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China."", ""Malignant Lymphoma Diagnosis and Therapy Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190606,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6559765,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S202442 [doi]', '202442 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Jun 6;11:5197-5208. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S202442. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'Beclin1', 'CML', 'autophagy', 'leukemia stem cell']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

New classes of drugs, such as kinase inhibitors and BCL-2 protein antagonists, have been approved for treatment of CLL patients. Despite the abovementioned therapies the disease can still be effectively treated with purine nucleoside analogs (PNA). However, some patients, for example, those with TP53 gene abnormalities, become resistant, and the other factors involved in the therapy resistance are still being investigated. This study was aimed at analyzing the possible role of microRNAs as markers predicting the outcome of chemotherapy based on PNA - fludarabine and cladribine in CLL patients. Methods: The expression of miR-21, miR-34a, miR-181a and miR-221 in previously separated leukemic cells was assessed with the use of qRQ-PCR technique at the moment of diagnosis in 40 CLL patients. In turn, apoptosis induced by fludarabine and cladribine in 24-hour cell culture was evaluated by determining the increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells of CD5+/CD19+/Cas3+ phenotype, using a flow cytometry method. Nine of the 40 studied subjects were treated with fludarabine-based regimens and were analyzed with regards to in vivo response to PNA. Results: We detected a significantly higher PNA-induced apoptosis rate in patients with high miR-34a expression in comparison to low expression ones. Interestingly, such differences were detected particularly in standard cytogenetic patients. Conclusions: These results may prove an important role of miR-34a expression as a predictor of apoptosis, even in cases when other risk factors like cytogenetic abnormalities are absent.

We aimed to find out whether variability within the TERT gene could be associated with telomere length and development of the disease in non-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Materials and methods: Telomere length, rs2736100, rs2853690, rs33954691, rs35033501 single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR-MNS16A) were assessed in patients at diagnosis. In addition, blood donors served as controls for the polymorphism studies. Results: The minor rs35033501 A variant was more frequent among CLL patients than in healthy controls (OR=3.488, p=0.039). CLL patients over 60 years of age were characterized with lower disease stage at diagnosis (p=0.001 and p=0.008, for the Rai and Binet criteria, respectively). The MNS16A VNTR-243 short allele was more frequent in patients with a low disease stage (p=0.020 and p=0.028, for the Rai and Binet staging system) and also among older patients having longer telomeres (p=0.046). Patients with Rai 0-I stage were characterized with longer telomeres than those with more advanced disease (p=0.030). This relationship was especially pronounced in patients carrying the rs2736100 C allele, independently of the criteria used, ie, Binet (p=0.048) or Rai (p=0.001). Conclusion: Our results showed that the genetic variation within the TERT gene seems to play a regulatory role in CLL and telomere length.","['Wysoczanska, Barbara', 'Dratwa, Marta', 'Gebura, Katarzyna', 'Mizgala, Jakub', 'Mazur, Grzegorz', 'Wrobel, Tomasz', 'Bogunia-Kubik, Katarzyna']","['Wysoczanska B', 'Dratwa M', 'Gebura K', 'Mizgala J', 'Mazur G', 'Wrobel T', 'Bogunia-Kubik K']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Immunogenetics and Pharmacogenetics, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw 53-114, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunogenetics and Pharmacogenetics, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw 53-114, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunogenetics and Pharmacogenetics, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw 53-114, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunogenetics and Pharmacogenetics, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw 53-114, Poland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Occupational Diseases, Hypertension and Clinical Oncology, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, 50-001, Poland.', 'Department of Haematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw 50-367, Poland.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Immunogenetics and Pharmacogenetics, Hirszfeld Institute of Immunology and Experimental Therapy, Polish Academy of Sciences, Wroclaw 53-114, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190531,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6551596,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S198313 [doi]', '198313 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 May 31;12:4309-4320. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S198313. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'human telomerase reverse transcriptase', 'single-nucleotide polymorphism', 'telomere length', 'variable number of tandem repeats']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Cell viability was assessed using sulforhodamine B assay. Cell proliferation was determined by the trypan blue dye exclusion test. Colony-forming units were assayed in methylcellulose. Apoptosis assays were carried out by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate(FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining, Hoechst 33342 staining, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Western blot. Wright-Giemsa staining, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay, CD11b and CD14 and Western blot were detected for induction of differentiation. In addition, cell-cycle phase distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blot. The combination therapy of notopterol and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on HL-60 cells was examined. Results: Notopterol obviously inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells with an IC50 value of 40.32 muM and remarkably reduced the number of colonies by 10, 20, and 40 microM. In addtion, notopterol induced the percentage of apoptotic HL-60 cells, reduced the mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased the protein expresstion of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and increased the expression of Bax, cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3, and PARP. As for cell differentiation, notopterol clearly induced chromatin condensation; increased the nucleocytoplasmic ratio, nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells, expression of CD14 and CD11b, and protein expression of c-Jun and Jun B, and decreased c-myc. Furthermore, notopterol induced the G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest as determined using flow cytometry, which may be related to the regulation of cell-cycle-related proteins p53, CDK2, CDK4, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E, and survivin. The combined use of notopterol and ATRA did not enhance the apoptotic effect as evidenced by cell viability test and Hoechst 33342. However, the combination of notopterol and ATRA enhanced the effect of inducing differentiation when compared with using either notopterol or ATRA alone, which can be evidenced by the increased nucleocytoplasmic ratio, NBT positive cells, and expression of CD14. Conclusion: This is the first time it has been demonstrated that notopterol could induce apoptosis, differentiation, and G0/G1 arrest in human AML HL-60 cells, suggesting that notopterol has potential therapeutic effects on AML. The combination application of notopterol (20 and 40 muM) and ATRA (2 muM) could augment differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Huang, Qinwan', 'Wang, Lin', 'Ran, Qian', 'Wang, Jin', 'Wang, Chengqiang', 'He, Hui', 'Li, Li', 'Qi, Hongyi']","['Huang Q', 'Wang L', 'Ran Q', 'Wang J', 'Wang C', 'He H', 'Li L', 'Qi H']",,"[""College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, People's Republic of China."", ""College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing 400716, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190606,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Coumarins)', '88206-46-6 (notopterol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Coumarins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC6560190,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S189969 [doi]', '189969 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2019 Jun 6;13:1927-1940. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S189969. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'apoptosis', 'cell growth', 'cycle arrest', 'differetiation', 'notopterol']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

To quantify methylated DNA not only in the promoter region but also in the gene body, we established a single-molecule methylation assay (SMMA). Patients and methods: We first investigated the methylation extent (expressed as methylation index [MI]) by SMMA among 28 MDS and 6 post-MDS acute myeloid leukemia patients. We then analyzed the MI in 13 AZA-treated patients. Results: Whole-blood DNA from all 34 patients had low MI values compared with healthy volunteers (P<0.0001). DNA hypomethylation in MDS patients was more evident in neutrophils (P=0.0008) than in peripheral mononuclear cells (P=0.0713). No consistent pattern of genome-wide DNA hypomethylation was found among MDS subtypes or revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) categories; however, we found that the MI was significantly increased for patients at very high risk who were separated by the new cytogenetic scoring system for IPSS-R (P=0.0398). There was no significant difference in MI before AZA, regardless of the response to AZA (P=0.8689); however, sequential measurement of MI in peripheral blood demonstrated that AZA non-responders did not have normalized MI at the time of next course of AZA (P=0.0352). Conclusion: Our results suggest that sequential SMMA of peripheral blood after AZA may represent a non-invasive monitoring marker for AZA efficacy in MDS patients.","['Asano, Michiyo', 'Ohyashiki, Junko H', 'Kobayashi-Kawana, Chiaki', 'Umezu, Tomohiro', 'Imanishi, Satoshi', 'Azuma, Kenko', 'Akahane, Daigo', 'Fujimoto, Hiroaki', 'Ito, Yoshikazu', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Asano M', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Kobayashi-Kawana C', 'Umezu T', 'Imanishi S', 'Azuma K', 'Akahane D', 'Fujimoto H', 'Ito Y', 'Ohyashiki K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Cellular Therapy, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190530,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Young Adult']",PMC6553951,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S195071 [doi]', '195071 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2019 May 30;13:1821-1833. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S195071. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['azacytidine', 'methylation index', 'myelodysplastic syndrome', 'peripheral blood']","['Prof. Dr. Kazuma Ohyashiki reports personal fees from Celegene KK personal fees', 'from Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd, during the conduct of the study; and personal fees', 'from Novartis Pharma KK, personal fees from Janssen Pharmaceutical K.K, personal', 'fees from Kirin Brewery KK, personal fees from Chugai KK, personal fees from', 'Bristrol Myere Squib KK, and personal fees from Dainipon Sumitomo, outside the', 'submitted work.

This study assessed the long-term outcome of CML patients after administration of generic imatinib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The cohort of 83 patients was divided into 2 groups depending on whether generic imatinib was applied in the front-line setting or after switching from original imatinib. The groups were compared regarding rates of optimal treatment response, adverse events, and survival. RESULTS: In the first group, at the time of switching, rates of complete cytogenetic response experienced, and major molecular response were 95% and 87.5% of patients in the front-line generic imatinib group and the group that switched from original to generic imatinib, respectively. After 24 months of treatment with generic imatinib, the rates of sustained, lost, and experienced major molecular response were 72.5%, 15%, and 12.5%, respectively. In the group treated with front-line generic imatinib at 6 months, 67.4% experienced complete cytogenetic response, while for major molecular response at 12 and 24 months, it was 58.1% and 69.8%, respectively. Estimated 5-year overall survival in the group treated with front-line generic imatinib was 86.1%, while 10-year overall survival in the group treated with second-line generic imatinib was 93.8%. CONCLUSION: Results of this study with long-term follow-up are further evidence that generic imatinib is at least noninferior to original imatinib regarding efficacy and survival, both when provided initially and as a subsequent replacement for original imatinib.","['Cojbasic, Irena', 'Macukanovic-Golubovic, Lana', 'Vucic, Miodrag', 'Cojbasic, Zarko']","['Cojbasic I', 'Macukanovic-Golubovic L', 'Vucic M', 'Cojbasic Z']",,"['Clinic of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Clinical Centre Nis, Nis, Serbia; Faculty of Medicine, University of Nis, Nis, Serbia.

The study was conducted on Boxer dogs with lymphoma diagnosed by cytology and immunocytochemistry (CD3 and CD79 alpha). During the study period, lymphoma was diagnosed in 63 Boxers; 86.8% were T-cell (based on the Kiel classification: small clear cell lymphoma, pleomorphic small cell lymphoma, pleomorphic mixed T-cell lymphoma, pleomorphic large T-cell lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/acute lymphoblastic leukaemia) and 13.2% were B-cell lymphomas (according to the Kiel classification: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, centroblastic/centroblastic polymorphic lymphoma). Overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in dogs with low-grade than with high-grade lymphoma (median OS of 6.8 and 4.7 months, respectively; P = 0.024). OS was not influenced by WHO clinical stage, WHO clinical substage, presence of splenomegaly, early administration of glucocorticoids or the time from the first presentation to the beginning of chemotherapy. There are no significant differences in clinical and laboratory parameters between low-grade and high-grade lymphomas. Boxer dogs are predisposed to T-cell lymphoma, with a predominance of high-grade tumour, especially pleomorphic, mixed small and large T-cell subtype. It is possible that Boxer dogs may respond less favourably to chemotherapy than patients of other breeds.","['Jankowska, Urszula', 'Jagielski, Dariusz', 'Czopowicz, Michal', 'Sapierzynski, Rafal']","['Jankowska U', 'Jagielski D', 'Czopowicz M', 'Sapierzynski R']",,"['Bialobrzeska Veterinary Surgery , Warsaw , Poland.', 'Bialobrzeska Veterinary Surgery , Warsaw , Poland.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epidemiology and Economics, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW) , Warsaw , Poland.', 'Division of Animal Pathomorphology, Department of Pathology and Veterinary Diagnostics and Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Warsaw University of Life Sciences (SGGW) , Nowoursynowska str. 166, 02-787 Warsaw , Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Hungary,Acta Vet Hung,Acta veterinaria Hungarica,8406376,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dog Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Poland/epidemiology']",,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/02/01 06:00,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1556/004.2019.024 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Vet Hung. 2019 Jun;67(2):224-240. doi: 10.1556/004.2019.024.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Boxer', '*T-cell lymphoma', '*cytology', '*dog', '*lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,

Multimodality treatment involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery is not effective enough to control osteosarcoma. Regorafenib, the oral multi-kinase inhibitor, has been shown to have positive efficacy on disease progression delay in chemotherapy resistant osteosarcoma patients. However anti-cancer effect and mechanism of regorafenib in osteosarcoma is ambiguous. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and molecular mechanism of regorafenib on osteosarcoma in vitro and in vivo. Human osteosarcomas U-2 OS or MG-63 were treated with regorafenib, miltefosine (protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor), or PD98059 (mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK) pathway inhibitor) for 24 or 48 h. Cell viability, apoptotic signaling transduction, tumor invasion, expression of tumor progression-associated proteins and tumor growth after regorafenib treatment were assayed by MTT 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, transwell assay, Western blotting assay and in vivo animal experiment, respectively. In these studies, we also indicated that regorafenib suppressed cell growth by prompting apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells, which is mediated through inactivation of ERK and AKT signaling pathways. After regorafenib treatment, downregulation of related genes in invasion (vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9)), proliferation (CyclinD1) and anti-apoptosis (X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1), and cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1beta-converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein (C-FLIP)) were found. Moreover, upregulation of caspase-3 and caspase-8 cleavage were also observed. In sum, we suggest that regorafenib has potential to suppress osteosarcoma progression via inactivation of AKT and ERK mediated signaling pathway.","['Pan, Po-Jung', 'Liu, Yu-Chang', 'Hsu, Fei-Ting']","['Pan PJ', 'Liu YC', 'Hsu FT']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4966-1515', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8681-4472', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2153-340X']","['Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, National Yang-Ming University Hospital, Yilan 260, Taiwan. 12105@ymuh.ym.edu.tw.', 'Department of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 112, Taiwan. 12105@ymuh.ym.edu.tw.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua 505, Taiwan. sakiro920@gmail.com.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua 500, Taiwan. sakiro920@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Sciences, Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology, Taichung 406, Taiwan. sakiro920@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, China Medical University, Taichung 404, Taiwan. kevinyc.liu@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190624,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC6616516,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8060900 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8060900 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Jun 24;8(6). pii: jcm8060900. doi: 10.3390/jcm8060900.,6,"['MOST 107-2314-B-039-068-MY2/Ministry of Science and Technology', 'RD2019-012/National Yang-Ming University Hospital']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'ERK', 'osteosarcoma', 'regorafenib']",,,,,,,,,,,

The statistical analysis allowed the identification of four genes discriminating the 2 study groups: Sushi Domain Containing 4 (SUSD4, P=0.02), T Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 1A (TCL1A, P=0.02), adhesion G protein-coupled receptor E3 (ADGRE3, P=0.01), Immunoglobulin Heavy Constant Gamma 3 (IGHG3, P=0.03).

OBJECTIVE: In the present study, 314 consecutive, allo-HSCT recipient and donor pairs were included with retrospective donor KIR-genotyping and clinical parameters analyzes. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 23.6 months, recipients with HLA-C2 group allele (rC2) showed improved (p = 0.046) OS if transplanted with KIR2DS1 positive donors (d2DS1) compared to those without one or both of this genetic attribute. Within the myeloablative conditioning (MAC) subgroup (n = 227), rC2 homozygous+d2DS1 patients (n = 14) showed a 5 years OS of 93% followed by rC2 heterozygous+d2DS1 patients (n = 48, 65%) compared to rC2 and/or d2DS1 negatives (47%, p = 0.018). Multivariate analyses indicated rC2+d2DS1 positivity as an independent predictor of OS (HR:0.47, 0.26-0.86, p = 0.014) besides donor type, presence of CMV-reactivation or chemoresistant disease. Among MAC-treated patients, the combined rC2+d2DS1 presence was associated with a markedly decreased cumulative incidence of transplant related mortality (p = 0.0045). CONCLUSION: The combination of rC2+d2DS1 may be a favorable genetic constellation in allo-HSCT with MAC potentially reducing transplant related mortality.","['Tordai, Attila', 'Bors, Andras', 'Kiss, Katalin Piroska', 'Balassa, Katalin', 'Andrikovics, Hajnalka', 'Batai, Arpad', 'Szilvasi, Aniko', 'Rajczy, Katalin', 'Inotai, Dora', 'Torbagyi, Eva', 'Lengyel, Lilla', 'Barta, Aniko', 'Remenyi, Peter', 'Masszi, Tamas']","['Tordai A', 'Bors A', 'Kiss KP', 'Balassa K', 'Andrikovics H', 'Batai A', 'Szilvasi A', 'Rajczy K', 'Inotai D', 'Torbagyi E', 'Lengyel L', 'Barta A', 'Remenyi P', 'Masszi T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6966-1622', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2322-9863']","['Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Transplantation Immunogenetics Laboratory, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Hungarian Stem Cell Donor Registry, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Transplantation Immunogenetics Laboratory, Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Haematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, South-Pest Central Hospital-National Institute of Haematology and Infectology, Budapest, Hungary.', '3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190625,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (KIR2DS1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Blood Donors', 'Female', 'HLA-C Antigens/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*drug effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6592561,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0218945 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-00087 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jun 25;14(6):e0218945. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218945. eCollection 2019.,6,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study reported novel loci as genetic markers associated with increased susceptibility to CML. The present study conducted an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to confirm that the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at these loci affect the expression of candidate CML-susceptible genes. We identified that three SNPs (rs963193, rs6931104, and rs9371517) were related to the gene expression pattern of RMND1 (Required For Meiotic Nuclear Division 1 Homolog) in both granulocytes and mononuclear cells from 83 healthy donors. Furthermore, reduced expression of RMND1 expression was noted in CML patients compared with that in healthy individuals. We used the eQTL browsing tool to assess the regulatory information on the three associated significant SNPs, out of which rs6931104 showed strong evidence of regulatory effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that A alleles of rs6931104 could significantly change the binding affinity of transcription factor (TF) RFX3 compared to the G alleles. Then, we performed in vitro experiments on BCR-ABL1-positive (BCR-ABL1+) cell lines. We found that expression of the CML-susceptible gene RMND1 is affected by the binding affinity of TF RFX3, suggesting that RFX3 plays a role in RMND1 expression. Our findings suggest potential target genes for associations of genetic susceptibility risk loci and provide further insights into the pathogenesis and mechanism of CML.","['Woo, Young Min', 'Kim, Sehwa', 'Park, Jong-Ho', 'Lee, Nan Young', 'Kim, Jong-Won', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Woo YM', 'Kim S', 'Park JH', 'Lee NY', 'Kim JW', 'Kim DDH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3381-1382', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0708-9242']","['Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Health Sciences and Technology, Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Samsung Advanced Institute for Health Sciences and Technology, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Medical Oncology & Hematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190625,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (RMND1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics']",PMC6592567,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0218968 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-08735 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jun 25;14(6):e0218968. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218968. eCollection 2019.,6,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

Independent predictors for skin cancer were male gender (p = .0001), age >/=70 years (p = .0036) and prior chemotherapy (p = .0116). There was no increase in mortality from skin cancer and neither skin cancer nor chemotherapy increased the risk for a ST.

Based on previous integrated molecular analyses suggesting the importance of the JAK-STAT pathway in ATLL, we attempted to clarify the clinicopathological significance of this pathway. Clinical and morphological findings were reviewed in 116 cases with ATLL. The nuclear localizations of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3), pSTAT5, and pSTAT6 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Targeted sequencing was undertaken on the portion of STAT3 encoding the Src homology 2 domain. Expression of pSTAT3 was observed in 43% (50/116) of ATLL cases, whereas pSTAT5 and pSTAT6 were largely undetected. Cases with the lymphoma type showed significantly less frequent pSTAT3 expression (8/45, 18%) than those with the other subtypes (41/66, 62%; P < .001). STAT3 mutations were detected in 36% (10/28) and 19% (12/64) of cases with the smoldering and aggressive types of ATLL, respectively. The correlation between STAT3 mutation and pSTAT3 expression was not significant (P = .07). Both univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that pSTAT3 expression was significantly associated with better overall survival and progression-free survival in the smoldering type of ATLL, whereas STAT3 mutation was not related to a line of clinical outcome. Collectively, our data show that only the lymphoma type showed a low prevalence of tumor cells positive for pSTAT3 expression, and raises the possibility that pSTAT3 expression is a novel biomarker to predict better prognosis in the smoldering type of ATLL.","['Morichika, Kazuho', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Kayo, Hirona', 'Uchino, Shuta', 'Nishi, Yukiko', 'Nakachi, Sawako', 'Okamoto, Shiki', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Ohshiro, Kazuiku', 'Nakazato, Iwao', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Masuzaki, Hiroaki']","['Morichika K', 'Karube K', 'Kayo H', 'Uchino S', 'Nishi Y', 'Nakachi S', 'Okamoto S', 'Morishima S', 'Ohshiro K', 'Nakazato I', 'Fukushima T', 'Masuzaki H']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1205-858X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7391-4271']","['Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Okinawa Prefectural Nanbu Medical Center and Children's Medical Center, Haebaru, Japan."", ""Department of Pathology, Okinawa Prefectural Nanbu Medical Center and Children's Medical Center, Haebaru, Japan."", 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, Hematology, Rheumatology (Second Department of Internal Medicine), Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190723,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6726676,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14114 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Sep;110(9):2982-2991. doi: 10.1111/cas.14114.

However little is known about ERG in lymphoma. Here we studied ERG in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling, real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and whole exome sequencing (WES). Approximately 30% of de novo DLBCLs (37 of 118) expressed ERG (ERG+). ERG expression showed no significant correlation with DLBCL cell-of-origin classification, patient's age, sex, nodal, or extranodal disease status, tumor expression of p53 or p63. There was no ERG rearrangement in 10 randomly selected ERG+ DLBCLs by FISH. Forty-three miRNAs showed significant differential expression between ERG+ and ERG- DLBCLs. Downregulation of miR-4638-5p was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. WES not only confirmed known gene mutations in DLBCLs but also revealed multiple novel gene mutations in POLA1, E2F1, PSMD8, AXIN1, GAB2, and GNB2L1, which occur more frequently in ERG+ DLBCLs. In conclusion, our studies demonstrated aberrant ERG expression in a subset of DLBCL, which is associated with downregulation of miR-4638-5p. In comparison with ERG-negative DLBCL, ERG+ DLBCL more likely harbors mutations in genes important in cell cycle control, B-cell receptor-mediated signaling and degradation of beta-catenin.

Studies have reported that a higher mutant allelic burden is associated with a worse prognosis. Adult patients with FLT3-ITD mutated AML treated at our institution were identified. Patients were assigned into 2 groups; patients who received idarubicin and cytarabine (IA, group one) containing induction, and who received sorafenib in addition to IA containing regimens at induction (group two). The optimal FLT3-ITD mutant allele cut-off was defined as the cut-off to divide the whole cohort with the highest statistical significance. A total of 183 patients including 104 (57%) in group one and 79 (43%) in group two were identified. The complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete hematologic recovery (CRi) for group one and group two were 85% and 99%, respectively (P = .004). The median relapse free survival (RFS) for group one and two were 12 and 45 months, respectively (P = .02). The median overall survival (mOS) was 17 months in group one, and has not been reached in group two (P = .008). The optimal FLT3-ITD mutant allele cut-off for OS was 6.9% in group one, there was no optimal cut-off in group two. On multivariate analysis, poor performance status (PS) (P = .003), sorafenib (P = .01), and presenting white blood cells (WBC) (P < .001) were independent predictors of OS. Higher FLT3-ITD allele burden is associated with a worse outcome in patients treated with IA-based chemotherapy. Addition of sorafenib to chemotherapy not only nullifies the negative prognostic impact of higher allele burden, but also improves outcome of FLT3-ITD mutated AML patients regardless of the allele burden.","['Yalniz, Fevzi', 'Abou Dalle, Iman', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Daver, Naval', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Short, Nicholas J', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Nogueras Gonzalez, Graciela M', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Yalniz F', 'Abou Dalle I', 'Kantarjian H', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia T', 'Patel K', 'Loghavi S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Sasaki K', 'Daver N', 'DiNardo C', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Short NJ', 'Yilmaz M', 'Bose P', 'Naqvi K', 'Pierce S', 'Nogueras Gonzalez GM', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3569-8632', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6520-9134', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-6453', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1670-6513', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4498-4895', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4343-5712', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8636-1071']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190624,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sorafenib/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', '*fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism']",,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/03/11 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25553 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Sep;94(9):984-991. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25553.

Accumulating evidence over the past several years has suggested that the inadequacy of many leukaemia therapies results from their failure to target the leukaemic stem cell (LSC). For this reason, the LSC population currently represents the most critical target in the treatment of myeloid malignancies. However, while LSCs are ideal targets in the treatment of these diseases, they are also the most difficult population to target. This is due to both their heterogeneity within the LSC population, and also their phenotypic similarities with normal haematopoietic stem cells. This review will highlight the current landscape surrounding LSC biology in myeloid malignancies, with a focus on altered energy metabolism, and how that knowledge is being translated into clinical advances for the treatment of chronic and acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Bencomo-Alvarez, Alfonso E', 'Rubio, Andres J', 'Gonzalez, Mayra A', 'Eiring, Anna M']","['Bencomo-Alvarez AE', 'Rubio AJ', 'Gonzalez MA', 'Eiring AM']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6533-9150'],"['Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Paul L.

We found that sensitivity of primary AML cells to cytarabine correlated with SOD2 acetylation and the ability of the drug to induce mitochondrial ROS. The SOD2 deacetylase, SIRT3, protected AML cells from chemotherapy as shown by inhibited apoptosis via inhibited drug-induced production of mitochondrial ROS. SIRT3 significantly decreased nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)/reduced NADP ratio and increased reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio. Furthermore, SIRT3 enhanced oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in AML cells under both basic and cytarabine-treated conditions. A xenograft mouse model showed that SIRT3 overexpressing AML cells and patient-derived xenograft mice bearing high SIRT3 deacetylase activity were more resistant to chemotherapy in vivo. SIRT3 inhibitor displayed synergy with cytarabine to ablate AML cells in vitro and in mouse models. Taken together, our study showed that SIRT3 is capable of reprograming mitochondrial metabolism towards OxPhos and downregulating ROS generation, which contribute to the chemoresistance of AML cells. SIRT3 can be utilized as a potential therapeutic target to improve the anti-leukaemic efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic agents for AML.","['Ma, Jiao', 'Liu, Bin', 'Yu, Dan', 'Zuo, Yong', 'Cai, Rong', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Cheng, Jinke']","['Ma J', 'Liu B', 'Yu D', 'Zuo Y', 'Cai R', 'Yang J', 'Cheng J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8097-2202'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Respiratory Medicine, The People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Shanghai, China."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Haematology, Changhai Hospital of the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Cell Biology, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190624,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (superoxide dismutase 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 3)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sirtuin 3/*physiology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6790595,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16044 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Oct;187(1):49-64. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16044.

METHOD: We present a patient who was diagnosed with acute leukemia and concomitant tuberculosis. RESULTS: The patient's therapy of leukemia had to be delayed and he had relapse of leukemia but was subsequently treated successfully for both diseases despite a prolonged culture positivity for tuberculosis. He required a prolonged course of therapy and additional secondary anti-tuberculosis therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of tuberculosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with pneumonia, persistent fever, and those with focal signs or symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis. Despite having a sensitive organism, the infection was difficult to treat, even with the addition of two second-line drugs. The standard anti-tuberculosis therapy is usually adequate, but response may be slow, and inadequate even if the organism is sensitive requiring the addition of second-line agents.","['Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A', 'Al-Khatti, Adil']","['Al-Tawfiq JA', 'Al-Khatti A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5752-2235'],"['Specialty Internal Medicine, Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare, Dhahran Health Center, P.

For decades, ""7 + 3"" remission induction therapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline, followed by consolidation therapy, has been the standard of care treatment for AML. This stagnancy in AML treatment has resulted in less than ideal treatment outcomes for AML patients, especially for elderly patients and those with unfavourable profiles. Over the past two years, six new therapeutic agents have received regulatory approval, suggesting that a number of obstacles to treating AML have been addressed and the treatment landscape for AML is finally changing. This review outlines the challenges and obstacles in treating AML and highlights the advances in AML treatment made in recent years, including Vyxeos(R), midostaurin, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, and venetoclax, with particular emphasis on combination treatment strategies. We also discuss the potential utility of new combination products such as one that we call ""EnFlaM"", which comprises an encapsulated nanoformulation of flavopiridol and mitoxantrone.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively included 52 patients with indolent CLL (26/52), aggressive CLL (8/52), and DLBCL of RS (18/52), who underwent standardized contrast-enhanced CT. In main lymphoma tissue, VOIs were generated from which CTTA features including first-, second-, and higher-order textural features were extracted. CTTA features were compared between the entire CLL group, the indolent CLL subtype, the aggressive CLL subtype, and DLBCL using a Kruskal-Wallis test. All p values were adjusted after the Bonferroni correction. ROC analyses for significant CTTA features were performed to determine cut-off values for differentiation between the groups. RESULTS: Compared with DLBCL of RS, CTTA of the entire CLL group showed significant differences of entropy heterogeneity (p < 0.001), mean intensity (p < 0.001), mean average (p = 0.02), and number non-uniformity gray-level dependence matrix (NGLDM) (p = 0.03). Indolent CLL significantly differed for entropy (p < 0.001), uniformity of heterogeneity (p = 0.02), mean intensity (p < 0.001), and mean average (p = 0.01). Aggressive CLL showed significant differences in mean intensity (p = 0.04). For differentiation between CLL and DLBCL of RS, cut-off values for mean intensity and entropy of heterogeneity were defined (e.g., 6.63 for entropy heterogeneity [aggressive CLL vs. DLBCL]; sensitivity 0.78; specificity 0.63). CONCLUSIONS: CTTA features of ultrastructure and vascularization significantly differ in CLL compared with that in DLBCL of Richter syndrome, allowing complementary to visual features for noninvasive differentiation by contrast-enhanced CT. KEY POINTS: * Richter transformation of CLL into DLBCL results in structural changes in lymph node architecture and vascularization that can be detected by CTTA. * First-order CT textural features including intensity and heterogeneity significantly differ between both indolent CLL and aggressive CLL and DLBCL of Richter syndrome. * CT texture analysis allows for noninvasive detection of Richter syndrome which is of prognostic value.","['Reinert, C P', 'Federmann, B', 'Hofmann, J', 'Bosmuller, H', 'Wirths, S', 'Fritz, J', 'Horger, M']","['Reinert CP', 'Federmann B', 'Hofmann J', 'Bosmuller H', 'Wirths S', 'Fritz J', 'Horger M']",,"['Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Str.3, 72076, Tubingen, Germany. christian.reinert@med.uni-tuebingen.de.', 'Department of Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tubingen, Liebermeisterstrasse 8, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, University Hospital Tubingen, Hoppe-Seyler-Str.3, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Neuropathology, University Hospital Tubingen, Liebermeisterstrasse 8, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Russell H.

When HCT does produce prolonged relapse-free survival, it commonly reflects graft-versus-leukemia effects mediated by donor T cells reactive with antigens on leukemic cells(4). As graft T cells have not been selected for leukemia specificity and frequently recognize proteins expressed by many normal host tissues, graft-versus-leukemia effects are often accompanied by morbidity and mortality from graft-versus-host disease(5). Thus, AML relapse risk might be more effectively reduced with T cells expressing receptors (TCRs) that target selected AML antigens(6). We therefore isolated a high-affinity Wilms' Tumor Antigen 1-specific TCR (TCRC4) from HLA-A2(+) normal donor repertoires, inserted TCRC4 into Epstein-Bar virus-specific donor CD8(+) T cells (TTCR-C4) to minimize graft-versus-host disease risk and enhance transferred T cell survival(7,8), and infused these cells prophylactically post-HCT into 12 patients ( NCT01640301 ). Relapse-free survival was 100% at a median of 44 months following infusion, while a concurrent comparative group of 88 patients with similar risk AML had 54% relapse-free survival (P = 0.002). TTCR-C4 maintained TCRC4 expression, persisted long-term and were polyfunctional. This strategy appears promising for preventing AML recurrence in individuals at increased risk of post-HCT relapse.","['Chapuis, Aude G', 'Egan, Daniel N', 'Bar, Merav', 'Schmitt, Thomas M', 'McAfee,

Clinical, cytogenetic, and mutational data are used to classify patients into risk groups with different survival, however, within-group heterogeneity is still an issue. Here, we used a robust likelihood-based survival modeling approach and publicly available gene expression data to identify a minimal number of genes whose combined expression values were prognostic of overall survival. The resulting gene expression signature (4-GES) consisted of 4 genes (SOCS2, IL2RA, NPDC1, PHGDH), predicted patient survival as an independent prognostic parameter in several cohorts of AML patients (total, 1272 patients), and further refined prognostication based on the European Leukemia Net classification. An oncogenic role of the top scoring gene in this signature, SOCS2, was investigated using MLL-AF9 and Flt3-ITD/NPM1c driven mouse models of AML. SOCS2 promoted leukemogenesis as well as the abundance, quiescence, and activity of AML stem cells. Overall, the 4-GES represents a highly discriminating prognostic parameter in AML, whose clinical applicability is greatly enhanced by its small number of genes. The newly established role of SOCS2 in leukemia aggressiveness and stemness raises the possibility that the signature might even be exploitable therapeutically.","['Nguyen, Chi Huu', 'Gluxam, Tobias', 'Schlerka, Angela', 'Bauer, Katharina', 'Grandits, Alexander M', 'Hackl, Hubert', 'Dovey, Oliver', 'Zochbauer-Muller, Sabine', 'Cooper, Jonathan L', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Stoiber, Dagmar', 'Wieser, Rotraud', 'Heller, Gerwin']","['Nguyen CH', 'Gluxam T', 'Schlerka A', 'Bauer K', 'Grandits AM', 'Hackl H', 'Dovey O', 'Zochbauer-Muller S', 'Cooper JL', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Stoiber D', 'Wieser R', 'Heller G']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4055-3841', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4337-8022', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4384-6658', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8742-5631']","['Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Science and Technology Austria, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Bioinformatics, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Hinxton, UK.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Pharmacology, Center for Physiology and Pharmacology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. rotraud.wieser@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria. rotraud.wieser@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Medicine I, Division of Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. gerwin.heller@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, Vienna, Austria. gerwin.heller@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Department for Biomedical Sciences, University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna, Vienna, Austria. gerwin.heller@meduniwien.ac.at.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190624,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (SOCS2 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*genetics']",PMC6591510,2019/06/27 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-45579-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-45579-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jun 24;9(1):9139. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-45579-0.,1,"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'P 28013/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Medline search for anemia, hemolytic, autoimmune was supplemented with keyword searches. Main exclusions were conference abstracts, animal and non-English studies, and studies with <10 cases. Of 1371 articles retrieved, 1209 were excluded based on titles and abstracts. Two authors independently reviewed 10% and 16% of abstracts and full papers, respectively.

A lower threshold for diagnosis of DAT-negative AIHA was observed in literature on chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Definitions of anemia, hemolysis, and exclusion criteria showed substantial variation. Definitions of primary/secondary cold agglutinin disease/syndrome were not consistent. Forty-three studies provided criteria for treatment response, and other than studies from 1 center, these were almost entirely unique. Other criteria were rarely defined. Only 7, 0, 3, 2, 2, and 3 studies offered definitions of warm AIHA, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, mixed AIHA, AIHA severity, disease phase, and refractory AIHA, respectively.

Although the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) imatinib (IM) and nilotinib (NI) have remarkable efficacy in managing CML, the malignancies in some patients become TKI-resistant. Here, we isolated bone marrow (BM)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from several CML patients by Ficoll-Hypaque density-gradient centrifugation for coculture with K562 and BV173 cells with or without TKIs. We used real-time quantitative PCR to assess the level of interleukin 7 (IL-7) expression in the MSCs and employed immunoblotting to monitor protein expression in the BCR/ABL, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. We also used a xenograft tumor model to examine the in vivo effect of different MSCs on CML cells. MSCs from patients with IM-resistant CML protected K562 and BV173 cells against IM- or NI-induced cell death, and this protection was due to increased IL-7 secretion from the MSCs. Moreover, IL-7 levels in the BM of patients with IM-resistant CML were significantly higher than in healthy donors or IM-sensitive CML patients. IL-7 elicited IM and NI resistance via BCR/ABL-independent activation of JAK1/STAT5 signaling, but not of JAK3/STAT5 or PI3K/AKT signaling. IL-7 or JAK1 gene knockdown abrogated IL-7-mediated STAT5 phosphorylation and IM resistance in vitro and in vivo Because high IL-7 levels in the BM mediate TKI resistance via BCR/ABL-independent activation of JAK1/STAT5 signaling, combining TKIs with IL-7/JAK1/STAT5 inhibition may have significant utility for managing CML.","['Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Tu, Huaijun', 'Yang, Yazhi', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Hu, Xianliang', 'Luo, Qidong', 'Li, Jian']","['Zhang X', 'Tu H', 'Yang Y', 'Jiang X', 'Hu X', 'Luo Q', 'Li J']",,"['Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Laboratory of Infection and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China; Graduate School of Medicine, Nanchang University, 465 Bayi Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Hematology of Jiangxi Province, Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, 1 Minde Road, Nanchang 330006, Jiangxi, China.

This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) resistance and uncover new potential therapeutic strategies to block the rapid progression of early death. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The important role of TWIST1 in APL leukemogenesis was first determined by gain- and loss-of-function assays. We then performed in vivo and in vitro experiments to explore the interaction of TWIST1 and TRIB3 and develop a potential peptide-initiated therapeutic opportunity to protect against early death and induction therapy resistance in patients with APL. RESULTS: We found that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factor TWIST1 is highly expressed in APL cells and is critical for leukemic cell survival. TWIST1 and TRIB3 were highly coexpressed in APL cells compared with other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia cells. We subsequently demonstrated that TRIB3 could bind to the WR domain of TWIST1 and contribute to its stabilization by inhibiting its ubiquitination. TRIB3 depletion promoting TWIST1 degradation reverses resistance to induction therapy and improves sensitivity to ATRA. On the basis of a detailed functional screen of synthetic peptides, we discovered a peptide analogous to the TWIST1 WR domain that specifically represses APL cell survival by disrupting the TRIB3/TWIST1 interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data not only define the essential role of TWIST1 as an EMT-TF in patients with APL but also suggest that disrupting the TRIB3/TWIST1 interaction reverses induction therapy resistance and blocks rapid progression of APL early death.See related commentary by Peeke and Gritsman, p. 6018.","['Lin, Jian', 'Zhang, Wu', 'Niu, Li-Ting', 'Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Sheng, Yan',

Although terms such as 'secondary' and 'therapy-related' have been interchangeably used to characterize these cases of ALL in a similar fashion to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it must be noted that some reported cases have not had exposure to cytotoxic therapy and hence a causal relationship between the prior malignancy and subsequent ALL is difficult to establish. Therefore, the use of the term secondary ALL to describe such cases without exposure to cytotoxic therapy is preferably avoided and will not be discussed here. ALL related to prior cytotoxic therapy (t-ALL) appears to be a distinct entity when compared to the de novo ALL, with characteristics including older age at the time of onset, female predominance and leukemia genetics enriched with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangement and chromosomes 5/7 abnormalities. Outcome of t-ALL appears inferior to de novo ALL when treated with conventional combination chemotherapy and this adverse outcome may be related to unfavorable patient factors as well as high risk genetic features of the disease itself. Additional genomic and molecular studies are needed to better characterize pathologic features of ALL arising after exposure to cytotoxic therapy in patients with prior malignancies.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Douer, Dan', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Douer D', 'Pullarkat V']",,"['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell transplantation, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA, United States of America.

In this study, we present safety and efficacy findings from an analysis of 104 patients with intermediate- and high-risk MF in a Brazilian cohort of the JUMP study who received treatment with ruxolitinib. METHODS: JUMP is a single-arm, open-label, phase IIIb, expanded-access study. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety and tolerability (frequency, duration, and severity of adverse events [AEs]) of ruxolitinib. RESULTS: All of the 104 patients received the treatment. Median duration of exposure was 35.8 months. The most common hematologic AEs were anemia (57.7), thrombocytopenia (38.5%), neutropenia (11.5%), and leukopenia (9.6%). Second malignancies (all grades) occurred in 19.2% of patients (n=20). Serious AEs were reported in 62.5% of patients (n=65). The proportions of patients with >/=50% reduction from baseline in palpable spleen length at weeks 24 and 48 were 62.7% and 69.2%, respectively. The mean change from the baseline in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)-Lymphoma total score was 10.8 [15.6%] at week 4, 12.6 [14.1%] at week 24, and 12.2 [14.3%] at week 48. The mean change from the baseline for the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue scale was 3.9 [42.8%] at week 4, 4.9 [29.9%] at week 24, and 4.7 [28%] at week 48. At week 48, the estimated progression-free survival, leukemia-free survival, and overall survival probabilities were 91%, 91% and 93%, respectively Overall, 21 deaths were observed in the present study. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest that ruxolitinib could be evaluated as a standard-of-care treatment for the MF population in need of a viable treatment option.

However, their clinical relevance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the functions of HOXB-AS3, a lncRNA located at human HOXB cluster, in the myeloid cells, and analyzed the prognostic significances in patients with AML and MDS. METHODS: shRNAs were used to downregulate HOXB-AS3 in the cell lines and the effect was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The proliferation of the cell lines was illustrated by proliferation and BrdU flow assays. Further, we retrospectively analyzed the HOXB-AS3 expression in 193 patients with AML and 157 with MDS by microarray analysis, and evaluated its clinical importance. RESULTS: Downregulation of HOXB-AS3 suppressed cell proliferation. Mechanistically, HOXB-AS3 potentiated the expressions of several key factors in cell cycle progression and DNA replication without affecting the expressions of HOX genes. In AML, patients with higher HOXB-AS3 expression had shorter survival than those with lower HOXB-AS3 expression (median overall survival (OS), 17.7 months versus not reached, P < 0.0001; median relapse-free survival, 12.9 months versus not reached, P = 0.0070). In MDS, patients with higher HOXB-AS3 expression also had adverse prognosis compared with those with lower HOXB-AS3 expression (median OS, 14.6 months versus 42.4 months, P = 0.0018). The prognostic significance of HOXB-AS3 expression was validated in the TCGA AML cohort and another MDS cohort from our institute. The subgroup analyses in MDS patients showed that higher HOXB-AS3 expressions could predict poor prognosis only in lower-risk (median OS, 29.2 months versus 77.3 months, P = 0.0194), but not higher-risk group. CONCLUSIONS: This study uncovers a promoting role of HOXB-AS3 in myeloid malignancies and identifies the prognostic value of HOXB-AS3 expression in AML and MDS patients, particularly in the lower-risk group.","['Huang, Huai-Hsuan', 'Chen, Fei-Yun', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Lin, Chien-Ting', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Yao, Ming', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Chen, Ruey-Hwa']","['Huang HH', 'Chen FY', 'Chou WC', 'Hou HA', 'Ko BS', 'Lin CT', 'Tang JL', 'Li CC', 'Yao M', 'Tsay W', 'Hsu SC', 'Wu SJ', 'Chen CY', 'Huang SY', 'Tseng MH', 'Tien HF', 'Chen RH']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Doctoral Degree Program in Translational Medicine, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Taicheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Taicheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Taicheng Stem Cell Therapy Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. hftien@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Doctoral Degree Program in Translational Medicine, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. hftien@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Doctoral Degree Program in Translational Medicine, National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. rhchen@gate.sinica.edu.tw.', 'Institute of Biological Chemistry, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan. rhchen@gate.sinica.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190624,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Replication/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC6591843,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5822-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5822-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jun 24;19(1):617. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5822-y.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'HOXB-AS3', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,

Two Holstein dairy herds (A and B), with known status of BLV infection as determined by serology, were sampled by the collection of serum and fresh milk samples. Selected samples were tested using a USDA-licensed BLV antibody ELISA kit (Bovine leukemia virus antibody test kit; VMRD, Pullman, WA) for serum. Forty-one lactating cows from each herd were sampled. Herd A was confirmed to have endemic BLV infection; herd B was confirmed to be free of BLV infection. The milk ELISA results demonstrated 100% identification of positive and negative animals compared with the serum results. The correlation of the ELISA values between serum and milk samples was 97%, which supports the use of this BLV ELISA on milk samples.","['Evermann, James F', 'DeAvila, David M', 'Parish, Steven M', 'Merritt, Catherine H', 'Noble, Katherine C', 'Srikanth, Sampath', 'Bronowski, Amanda L E']","['Evermann JF', 'DeAvila DM', 'Parish SM', 'Merritt CH', 'Noble KC', 'Srikanth S', 'Bronowski ALE']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0849-2030'],"['Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).', 'Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).', 'Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).', 'Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).', 'Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).', 'Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).', 'Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (Evermann, DeAvila, Merritt, Noble), Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences (Evermann, Parish), College of Veterinary Medicine, Washington State University, Pullman, WA.', 'Veterinary Medical Research & Development (VMRD), Pullman, WA (Srikanth, Bronowski).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190624,United States,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",9011490,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood/*chemistry', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/*veterinary', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Milk/*chemistry']",PMC6857033,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/10/16 06:00,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1040638719860487 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Diagn Invest. 2019 Jul;31(4):598-600. doi: 10.1177/1040638719860487.

Activation of NK cells depend on a fine balance between activating and inhibitory signals mediated by different receptors. In recent years, a family of paired receptors that interact with ligands of the Nectin/Nectin-like (Necl) family has attracted great interest. Two of these ligands, Necl-5 (usually termed CD155 or PVR) and Nectin-2 (CD112), frequently expressed on different types of tumor cells, are recognized by a group of receptors expressed on T and NK cells that exert opposite functions after interacting with their ligands. These receptors include DNAM-1 (CD226), TIGIT, TACTILE (CD96) and the recently described PVRIG. Whereas activation through DNAM-1 after recognition of CD155 or CD112 enhances NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against a wide range of tumor cells, TIGIT recognition of these ligands exerts an inhibitory effect on NK cells by diminishing IFN-gamma production, as well as NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. PVRIG has also been identified as an inhibitory receptor that recognizes CD112 but not CD155. However, little is known about the role of TACTILE as modulator of immune responses in humans. TACTILE control of tumor growth and metastases has been reported in murine models, and it has been suggested that it negatively regulates the anti-tumor functions mediated by DNAM-1. In NK cells from patients with solid cancer and leukemia, it has been observed a decreased expression of DNAM-1 that may shift the balance in favor to the inhibitory receptors TIGIT or PVRIG, further contributing to the diminished NK cell-mediated cytotoxic capacity observed in these patients. Analysis of DNAM-1, TIGIT, TACTILE and PVRIG on human NK cells from solid cancer or leukemia patients will clarify the role of these receptors in cancer surveillance. Overall, it can be speculated that in cancer patients the TIGIT/PVRIG pathways are upregulated and represent novel targets for checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.","['Sanchez-Correa, Beatriz', 'Valhondo, Isabel', 'Hassouneh, Fakhri', 'Lopez-Sejas, Nelson', 'Pera, Alejandra', 'Bergua, Juan M', 'Arcos, Maria Jose', 'Banas, Helena', 'Casas-Aviles, Ignacio', 'Duran, Esther', 'Alonso, Corona', 'Solana, Rafael', 'Tarazona, Raquel']","['Sanchez-Correa B', 'Valhondo I', 'Hassouneh F', 'Lopez-Sejas N', 'Pera A', 'Bergua JM', 'Arcos MJ', 'Banas H', 'Casas-Aviles I', 'Duran E', 'Alonso C', 'Solana R', 'Tarazona R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1169-8996', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8985-0295', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2926-6377']","['Immunology Unit, Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain. beatrizsanchezcorrea@gmail.com.', 'Immunology Unit, Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain. ivalhondog@gmail.com.', 'Immunology Unit, Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain. hassounehfakhri@yahoo.com.', 'Immunology Unit, Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain. nelsonj836@hotmail.com.', 'Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba (IMIBIC), 14004 Cordoba, Spain. alejandrapera@gmail.com.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, University of Cordoba, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. alejandrapera@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, 10003 Caceres, Spain. jmbergua@icloud.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, 10003 Caceres, Spain. mjarcar@yahoo.es.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, 10003 Caceres, Spain. cromacita@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, 10003 Caceres, Spain. nachocasas@hotmail.com.', 'Histology and Pathology Unit, Faculty of Veterinary, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain. esther@unex.es.', 'Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba (IMIBIC), 14004 Cordoba, Spain. corona_alonso@hotmail.com.', 'Reina Sofia University Hospital, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. corona_alonso@hotmail.com.', 'Instituto Maimonides de Investigacion Biomedica de Cordoba (IMIBIC), 14004 Cordoba, Spain. rsolana@uco.es.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Physiology and Immunology, University of Cordoba, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. rsolana@uco.es.', 'Reina Sofia University Hospital, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. rsolana@uco.es.', 'Immunology Unit, Department of Physiology, University of Extremadura, 10003 Caceres, Spain. rtarazon@unex.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190623,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6628015,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11060877 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11060877 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Jun 23;11(6). pii: cancers11060877. doi: 10.3390/cancers11060877.,6,"['SAF2017-87538-R/Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Spain', 'PI16/01615/Instituto de Salud Carlos III', 'IB16164/Consejeria de Economia e Infraestructuras, Junta de Extremadura', 'GR18085/Consejeria de Economia e Infraestructuras, Junta de Extremadura', 'SAF2017-87538-R; PI16/01615; IB16164; GR18085/European Regional Development Fund,', '""Una manera de hacer Europa""']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD112', 'CD155', 'DNAM-1', 'NK cells', 'PVRIG', 'TACTILE', 'TIGIT', 'cancer immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,

While the advent of targeted therapies has improved survival in certain subtypes, relapse after initial therapy is a major problem. Dendritic cell (DC) vaccination has the potential to induce tumor-specific T cells providing long-lasting, anti-tumor immunity. This approach has demonstrated safety but limited clinical success until recently, as DC vaccination faces several barriers in both solid and hematological malignancies. Importantly, vaccine-mediated stimulation of protective immune responses is hindered by the aberrant production of immunosuppressive factors by cancer cells which impede both DC and T cell function. Leukemias present the additional challenge of severely disrupted hematopoiesis owing to both cytogenic defects in hematopoietic progenitors and an abnormal hematopoietic stem cell niche in the bone marrow; these factors accentuate systemic immunosuppression and DC malfunction. Despite these obstacles, several recent clinical trials have caused great excitement by extending survival in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients through DC vaccination. Here, we review the phenotype and functional capacity of DCs in leukemia and approaches to harness DCs in leukemia patients. We describe the recent clinical successes in AML and detail the multiple new strategies that might enhance prognosis in AML and other leukemias.","[""O'Brien, Liam J"", 'Guillerey, Camille', 'Radford, Kristen J']","[""O'Brien LJ"", 'Guillerey C', 'Radford KJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9728-3291', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7917-2432', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6512-6323']","['Mater Research Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD 4102, Australia. liam.obrien@mater.uq.edu.au.', 'Mater Research Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD 4102, Australia. c.guillerey@uq.edu.au.', 'Mater Research Institute, The University of Queensland, Translational Research Institute, Woolloongabba, QLD 4102, Australia. kristen.radford@mater.uq.edu.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190622,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,PMC6627518,2019/06/27 06:00,2019/06/27 06:01,['2019/06/26 06:00'],"['2019/05/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11060875 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11060875 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Jun 22;11(6). pii: cancers11060875. doi: 10.3390/cancers11060875.,6,"['1107417/National Health and Medical Research Council', 'N/A/Mater Foundation', 'N/A/University of Queensland', '15-0181/Worldwide Cancer Research/United Kingdom']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD141', 'CD1c', 'dendritic cell', 'immunotherapy', 'leukemia', 'moDC', 'vaccination']",,,,,,,,,,,

For this purpose, garlic were physicochemically characterized (Brix, pH, aW, L, polyphenol, and antioxidant capacity), and both in vivo and in vitro assays were carried out. Black garlic samples showed higher polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity than the white ones. The biological assays showed that none of the samples (neither raw nor black garlic) produced toxic effects in the Drosophila melanogaster animal genetic model, nor exerted protective effects against H2O2, with the exception of the 0C1 black garlic. Moreover, only white garlic was genotoxic at the highest concentration. On the other hand, 0C1 black garlic was the most antigenotoxic substance. The in vivo longevity assays showed significant extension of lifespan at some concentrations of white and 0C1and 1C2 black garlic. The in vitro experiments showed that all of the garlic samples induced a decrease in leukemia cell growth. However, no type of garlic was able to induce proapoptotic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Taking into account the physicochemical and biological data, black garlic could be considered a potential functional food and used in the preventive treatment of age-related diseases. In addition, our findings could be relevant for black-garlic-processing agrifood companies, as the economical and timing costs can significantly be shortened from 45 to 13 days of aging.","['Toledano Medina, Maria Angeles', 'Merinas-Amo, Tania', 'Fernandez-Bedmar, Zahira', 'Font, Rafael', 'Del Rio-Celestino, Mercedes', 'Perez-Aparicio, Jesus', 'Moreno-Ortega, Alicia', 'Alonso-Moraga, Angeles', 'Moreno-Rojas, Rafael']","['Toledano Medina MA', 'Merinas-Amo T', 'Fernandez-Bedmar Z', 'Font R', 'Del Rio-Celestino M', 'Perez-Aparicio J', 'Moreno-Ortega A', 'Alonso-Moraga A', 'Moreno-Rojas R']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1091-3527', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3057-1344', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9130-2669', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7687-7544', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2892-4294']","['Department of Food Science and Health, IFAPA-Palma del Rio, Avda.

A growing number of studies have focused on the relationship between FOX proteins and cancers, particularly hematological neoplasms such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FOX proteins are widely involved in AML biology, including leukemogenesis, relapse and drug sensitivity. Here we explore the role of FOX transcription factors in the major AML entities, according to ""The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia"", and in the context of the most recurrent gene mutations identified in this heterogeneous disease. Moreover, we report the new evidences about the role of FOX proteins in drug sensitivity, mechanisms of chemoresistance, and possible targeting for personalized therapies.","['Gurnari, Carmelo', 'Falconi, Giulia', 'De Bellis, Eleonora', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Fabiani, Emiliano']","['Gurnari C', 'Falconi G', 'De Bellis E', 'Voso MT', 'Fabiani E']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6164-4761', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6209-8934']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy. carmelogurnari31@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy. giulia_0312@hotmail.it.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy. debellis.eleonora.1@gmail.com.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, 00133 Rome, Italy.

We selected SALL4 and ID2 as potential Z-fusion-specific transcriptional targets that might lead to the differentiation disorder of Z-fusion-positive ALL. The introduction of EP300-ZNF384 and SYNRG-ZNF384 induced the expression of these genes. Z-fusion proteins exhibited stronger transcriptional activities on the promoter or enhancer region of these genes than Wild-Z. Furthermore, GST pull-down assay revealed that Z-fusion proteins associated more strongly with EP300 than Wild-Z. Coexpression of EP300 specifically enhanced the transcriptional activities of Z-fusion proteins.

We report the pedigree of a consanguineous family with four affected children. Although clinical and molecular tests confirm CMMRD, genetic testing revealed heterogeneous mutations. The index case developed severe toxicity from therapy for glioblastoma and T-cell leukemia and died from an infection while in complete remission. His sister developed a malignant brain tumor while undergoing surveillance for a low grade brain lesion and is still undergoing follow-up.

SEM showed HTLV-1 virions that were found on HCT-5 were observed in the interfaces between HCT-5 cells and SGECs. TEM imaging showed that HTLV-1 virions were transmitted to SGECs at the interface with thin film-like structure, while HTLV-1 virions were released from the surface of HCT-5 cells.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 20 patients with ALL were switched from vincristine to bortezomib (1.3 mg/m/dose) because of worsening neuropathy despite physical therapy interventions (n=18) or at increased risk of neuropathy (n=2). Relapse rates were compared with 56 vincristine-only patients matched by prognostic factors. Maintenance blood counts in bortezomib patients were compared with cooperative group data using vincristine during maintenance. In addition, 6 evaluable patients were assessed for neuropathy using the pediatric-modified total neuropathy score. Neuropathy scores were collected during treatment with vincristine and after switching to bortezomib. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 3.5 years the relapse rate in patients switched to bortezomib was nonsignificantly different than those remaining on vincristine. Patients on monthly bortezomib had statistically significantly lower platelet counts that did not require transfusions or dose adjustment. Total neuropathy for all 6 cases decreased significantly when switched to bortezomib from vincristine (P=0.015), with motor neuropathy declines in 5 of 6 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib substitution for vincristine in ALL treatment is a potential strategy to mitigate severe vincristine neuropathy. These findings should be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial to further assess benefits and risks of this approach.","['Joshi, Jaitri', 'Tanner, Lynn', 'Gilchrist, Laura', 'Bostrom, Bruce']","['Joshi J', 'Tanner L', 'Gilchrist L', 'Bostrom B']",,"[""Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Bortezomib/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Substitution/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Vincristine/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/25 06:00,2020/04/18 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MPH.0000000000001529 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;41(6):457-462. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0000000000001529.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, efficacy of the treatment still fails in 1015% of patients. Glucocorticoids (GCs) such as prednisone and dexamethasone (DEX) are essential drugs used for ALL chemotherapy, and the response to GC treatment is a strong independent factor of ALL prognosis. In the present study, we examined the mechanism of GC resistance of Bcell precursor ALL (BCPALL). As determined by RTqPCR and western blot analyses, GC treatment upregulated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein and Bcl2interacting mediator of cell death (BCL2L11, BIM) protein expression, resulting in apoptosis of a GCsensitive BCPALL cell line, but not of a GCresistant BCPALL cell line as shown by flow cytometry. GR was downregulated in a DEXresistant BCPALL cell line which was induced by treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of DEX. Importantly, expression levels of miR1423p and miR17~92 cluster were upregulated in the BCPALL cell line with acquired DEX resistance as examined by RTqPCR. Our results suggest that interference of miR1423p and miR17~92 may overcome the resistance of BCPALL to GCs.","['Sakurai, Naoto', 'Komada, Yoshihiro', 'Hanaki, Ryo', 'Morimoto, Mari', 'Ito, Takahiro', 'Nakato, Daisuke', 'Hirayama, Masahiro']","['Sakurai N', 'Komada Y', 'Hanaki R', 'Morimoto M', 'Ito T', 'Nakato D', 'Hirayama M']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie 5148507, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190610,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2019/06/25 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2018/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/or.2019.7191 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2019 Aug;42(2):708-716. doi: 10.3892/or.2019.7191.

Imatinib resistance can be ascribed to BcrAbldependent and independent resistance. In the present study, peripheral blood samples were collected from imatinibsensitive (IS) and imatinibresistant (IR) CML patients and transcriptome sequencing was carried out. From the RNAseq data, a significantly altered IRrelated gene (IRG), ribonucleotide reductase regulatory subunit M2 (RRM2) was identified. Using realtime quantitative fluorescence PCR (qFPCR), we found that RRM2 was elevated in both IR CML patients and an IR cell line. Using reversetranscription PCR (RTPCR) and western blot analysis, we indicated that imatinib can increase RRM2 level in a dosedependent manner in IR cells. We also demonstrated that RRM2 is involved in the Bcl2/caspase cell apoptotic pathway and in the Akt cell signaling pathway, and therefore affects the cell survival following imatinib therapy. The present study, for the first time, indicates that RRM2 is responsible for drug resistance in imatinibbased therapy. Therefore, RRM2 gene can be considered as a potential therapeutic target in the clinical treatment of CML.","['Liu, Chunshui', 'Li, Yuying', 'Hu, Ruiping', 'Han, Wei', 'Gao, Sujun']","['Liu C', 'Li Y', 'Hu R', 'Han W', 'Gao S']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R.

While other rare lesions were also identified (collectively 6.0%), single unusual entities in the above-cited series numbered <1-2 examples each out of the 4122 cases, underscoring their rarity. We searched our joint files for rare, often singular, sellar/suprasellar masses that we had encountered over the past several decades in our own specialty, tertiary care specialty pituitary center practices. Cases for this review were subjectively selected for their challenging clinical and/or histological features as well as teaching value based on the senior authors' (MBSL, BKD) collective experience with over 7000 examples. We excluded entities deemed to be already well-appreciated by neuropathologists such as mixed adenoma-gangliocytoma, posterior pituitary tumors, metastases, and hypophysitis. We identified examples that, in our judgment, were sufficiently unusual enough to warrant further reporting. Herein, we present 3 diffuse large cell B cell pituitary lymphomas confined to the sellar region with first presentation at that site, 2 sarcomas primary to sella in nonirradiated patients, and 1 case each of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and neurosarcoidosis with first presentations as a sellar/suprasellar mass. Other cases included 1 of chronic lymphocytic leukemia within a gonadotroph adenoma and 1 of ectopic nerve fascicles embedded within a somatotroph adenoma, neither of which impacted patient care. Our objective was to share these examples and review the relevant literature.","['Abushamat, Layla A', 'Kerr, Janice M', 'Lopes, M Beatriz S', 'Kleinschmidt-DeMasters, Bette K']","['Abushamat LA', 'Kerr JM', 'Lopes MBS', 'Kleinschmidt-DeMasters BK']",,"['Department of Endocrinology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Endocrinology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.', 'Department of Pathology (Neuropathology) and Neurological Surgery, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia.', 'Department of Pathology.', 'Department of Neurology.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Colorado Denver, Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190520,England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,,,,,2019/06/25 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]']","['5522422 [pii]', '10.1093/jnen/nlz044 [doi]']",aheadofprint,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 2019 May 20. pii: 5522422. doi: 10.1093/jnen/nlz044.,,,,,"['(c) 2019 American Association of Neuropathologists, Inc.

Prognosis of relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations is even more dismal with median overall survival of a few months only. Areas covered: This review will cover current and emerging treatments for relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations, preclinical rationale and clinical trials with new encouraging data for this particularly challenging population. The authors discuss mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors and how these insights serve to identify current and future treatments. As allogeneic stem cell transplant in the first remission is the preferred therapy for newly diagnosed AML patients with FLT3 mutations, the authors discuss the role of maintenance after SCT for the prevention of relapse. Expert opinion: Relapsed/refractory AML with FLT3 mutations remains a therapeutic challenge with currently available treatments. However, the evolution of targeted therapies with next-generation FLT3 inhibitors and their combinations with chemotherapy is showing much promise. Moreover, growing understanding of the pathways of resistance to treatment has led to the identification of various targeted therapies currently being explored, which in time will improve outcomes.","['Tallis, Eran', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Tallis E', 'Borthakur G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-6453'],"['a Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'a Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20190630,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,2019/06/25 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1635882 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Aug;12(8):621-640. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1635882.

The data analysis was performed using Phoenix NLME 1.3 software. The covariates included age, body surface area (BSA), body weight, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), and serum creatinine (SCr). The final model was validated by bootstrap resampling procedures (1,000 runs) and visual predictive check (VPC) method. RESULTS: The data were best described by a two-compartment linear pharmacokinetic model. The mean values of clearance (CL) and distribution volume (Vd) of MTX were 6.53 L/h and 67.88 L, respectively. Analysis of covariates showed that BSA influenced the CL of MTX. CONCLUSION: The final model was demonstrated as appropriate and effective for assessing the pharmacokinetic parameters of delayed MTX excretion in children with ALL.","['Zang, Yan-Nan', 'Wang, Si-Zheng', 'Qin, Yi', 'Zhang, Jing-Ru', 'Zhao, Li-Bo', 'Wang, Xiao-Ling']","['Zang YN', 'Wang SZ', 'Qin Y', 'Zhang JR', 'Zhao LB', 'Wang XL']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'RFM9X3LJ49 (Bilirubin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,"['Alanine Transaminase/metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/metabolism', 'Bilirubin/blood', 'Child', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2019/06/25 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['185274 [pii]', '10.5414/CP203423 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2019 Aug;57(8):402-407. doi: 10.5414/CP203423.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was suggested that monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against the Kringle (KNG) domain of ROR1 could induce apoptosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. Here, we reported the determination of the solution structure of human ROR1-KNG (hROR1-KNG), investigation of its dynamic properties and potential binding interface by NMR spectroscopy. The obtained NMR structure of hROR1-KNG exhibits an open form at Asn47-His50 and shows obvious differences from other canonical KNGs at the corresponding lysine binding site, which implies that hROR1-KNG may interact with some non-canonical ligands. Dynamics analysis of hROR1-KNG reveal a faster local motion around the alpha-turn and 310-helix, which may provide flexibility to protect the proximal hydrophobic core in solution or facilitate the binding of other molecules. The intermediate-to-slow conformational exchange of Cys77-Ile79 may influence the conformation determination of disulfide bond Cys53-Cys77. Binding interface of hROR1-KNG for mAb R11 was analyzed and compared with the epitope for the functional mAbs. Previous study implies that hROR1-KNG may be involved in mediating the heterooligomerization between ROR1 and ROR2 in vivo. However, apparently, no direct interaction between hROR1-KNG and hROR2-KNG was observed from chemical shift perturbation experiment. Our work lays foundation to further functional study on interactions of hROR1-KNG with other biological relevant partners.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

METHODS: 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25 D3) induced monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells, and the resulting changes in miR-16 and MYB expressions were detected. Morphology of the cells induced by 1,25 D3, after being transfection with miR-16 mimics, was observed by Wright-Giemsa staining. The expression of mononuclear cell surface marker CD14 was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Minimum miR-16 was expressed in early-differentiation KG-1a cells, while late-differentiation U937 and THP-1 cells had higher expressions (p < 0.01). The expressions of MYB changed oppositely. During the monocytic differentiation of HL60 cells, miR-16 expression showed a time-dependent increase, but MYB expression gradually decreased. Overexpression of miR-16 in HL60 cells promoted 1,25 D3-induced morphological changes and CD14 expression (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MR-16 facilitated the monocytic differentiation of leukemia HL60 cells by negatively regulating MYB expression.","['Yang, Hui', 'Dai, Xiuhua', 'Ai, Zhihui', 'Ren, Rong', 'Gao, Changjun', 'Han, Jing', 'Ma, Yinhui']","['Yang H', 'Dai X', 'Ai Z', 'Ren R', 'Gao C', 'Han J', 'Ma Y']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (MIRN16 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb/*genetics/metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells', 'U937 Cells']",,2019/06/25 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.181008 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2019 Jun 1;65(6). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.181008.,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: Until recently, inhibitors of mRNA translation have been thought to likely lack a therapeutic window. In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved omacetaxine mepesuccinate (homoharringtonine) for the treatment of adults with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who are resistant to at least two tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Since then, a few drugs, notably tomivosertib (eFT-508), selinexor (KPT-330), and ribavirin, have entered clinical trials. These drugs are known to inhibit mRNA translation. More recently, a number of interesting studies report that discrete subsets of proteins in cancer cells may be selectively targeted at the translation step, through inhibiting signals such as phospho-4E-BP1, eIF4A, and eIF4E. Promising therapies using these strategies have demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical cancer models. The growing number of translation inhibitors with diverse mechanisms, coupled with emerging insights into translational regulation of different cancer-promoting genes, suggests a bright new horizon for the field of therapeutic targeting of mRNA translation in cancer.","['Pal, Ipsita', 'Safari, Maryam', 'Jovanovic, Marko', 'Bates, Susan E', 'Deng, Changchun']","['Pal I', 'Safari M', 'Jovanovic M', 'Bates SE', 'Deng C']",,"['Department of Medicine, Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Divison of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Divison of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for Lymphoid Malignancies, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA. cd2448@cumc.columbia.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2019/06/25 06:00,2020/07/25 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00530-y [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00530-y [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Aug;14(4):219-227. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00530-y.,4,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*4E-BP1', '*Omacetaxine', '*Selinexor', '*Translation', '*Translation inhibitor', '*Umbralisib', '*eIF4A', '*eIF4E']",,,,,,,,,,,

We analyze the characteristics of invasive fusariosis and its association to antifungal prophylaxis in a retrospective cohort (2004-2017) from a tertiary hospital in Madrid, Spain. Epidemiological, clinical, microbiological, and antifungal consumption data were retrieved. Isolates were identified to molecular level, and antifungal susceptibility was tested. Eight cases of invasive fusariosis were diagnosed. Three periods were identified according to incidence: <2008 (three cases), 2008-2013 (zero cases), >2014 (five cases). All except one case involved breakthrough fusariosis. During the earliest period, the episodes occurred while the patient was taking itraconazole (two) or fluconazole (one); more recently, while on micafungin (three) or posaconazole (one). Early cases involved acute leukemia at induction/consolidation, recent cases relapsed/refractory disease (P = .029). Main risk factor for fusariosis (62.5%) was prolonged neutropenia (median 44 days). Galactomannan and beta-D-glucan were positive in 37.5% and 100% of cases, respectively. All isolates except F. proliferatum presented high minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against the azoles and lower MIC to amphotericin B. Most patients received combined therapy. Mortality at 42 days was 62.5%. Resolution of neutropenia was associated with survival (P = .048). Invasive fusariosis occurs as breakthrough infection in patients with hematologic malignancy, prolonged neutropenia, and positive fungal biomarkers. Recent cases were diagnosed in a period of predominant micafungin use in patients who had more advanced disease and protracted neutropenia and for whom mortality was extremely high. Resolution of neutropenia was a favorable prognostic factor.","['Fernandez-Cruz, Ana', 'Semiglia, Maria Auxiliadora', 'Guinea, Jesus', 'Martinez-Jimenez, Maria Del Carmen', 'Escribano, Pilar', 'Kwon,

In this study, the critical role of the Musashi2-Numb axis in determining cell fate and relationship of the axis to important signaling pathways such as Hedgehog and Notch that are essential for self-renewal pathways in CML stem cells will be reviewed meticulously. Materials and Methods: In this review, a PubMed search using the keywords of Leukemia, signaling pathways, Musashi2-Numb was performed, and then we summarized different research works . Results: Although tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Imatinib significantly kill and remove the cell with BCR-ABL1 translocation, they are unable to target BCR-ABL1 leukemia stem cells. The main problem is stem cells resistance to Imatinib therapy. Therefore, the identification and control of downstream molecules/ signaling route of the BCR-ABL1 that are involved in the survival and self-renewal of leukemia stem cells can be an effective treatment strategy to eliminate leukemia stem cells, which supposed to be cured by Musashi2-Numb signaling pathway. Conclusion: The control of molecules /pathways downstream of the BCR-ABL1 and targeting Musashi2-Numb can be an effective therapeutic strategy for treatment of chronic leukemia stem cells. While Musashi2 is a poor prognostic marker in leukemia, in treatment and strategy, it has significant diagnostic value.","['Moradi, Foruzan', 'Babashah, Sadegh', 'Sadeghizadeh, Majid', 'Jalili, Arsalan', 'Hajifathali, Abbas', 'Roshandel, Hajifathali']","['Moradi F', 'Babashah S', 'Sadeghizadeh M', 'Jalili A', 'Hajifathali A', 'Roshandel H']",,"['Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Biological Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology at Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Taleghani Hospital, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Iran,Iran J Basic Med Sci,Iranian journal of basic medical sciences,101517966,,,,PMC6570743,2019/06/25 06:00,2019/06/25 06:01,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22038/ijbms.2019.31879.7666 [doi]'],ppublish,Iran J Basic Med Sci. 2019 Jun;22(6):581-589. doi: 10.22038/ijbms.2019.31879.7666.,6,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Cancer stem cells', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Self-renewal', 'Signaling pathways', 'Targeted therapy']",['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

The transcription factor gene Friend Leukemia Integration 1 (FLI1) is methylated and downregulated in human GC tissues. Using human GC samples, we determined which cells downregulate FLI1, when FLI1 downregulation occurs, if FLI1 downregulation correlates with clinical-pathologic characteristics, and whether FLI1 plays a role in invasion and/or proliferation of cultured cells. We analyzed stomach tissues from 98 patients [8 normal mucosa, 8 intestinal metaplasia (IM), 7 dysplasia, 91 GC] by immunohistochemistry for FLI1. Epithelial cells from normal, IM, and low-grade dysplasia (LGD) showed strong nuclear FLI1 staining. GC epithelial cells showed significantly less nuclear FLI1 staining as compared to normal epithelium, IM and LGD (P=1.2x10(-5), P=1.4x10(-6) and P=0.006, respectively). FLI1 expression did not correlate with tumor stage or differentiation, but was associated with patient survival, depending on tumor differentiation. We tested the functional role of FLI1 by assaying proliferation and invasion in cultured GC cells. Lentiviral-transduced FLI1 overexpression in GC AGS cells inhibited invasion by 73.5% (P = 0.001) and proliferation by 31.5% (P = 0.002), as compared to controls. Our results support a combined role for FLI1 as a suppressor of invasiveness and proliferation in gastric adenocarcinoma, specifically in the transition from pre-cancer lesions and dysplasia to invasive adenocarcinoma, and suggest that FLI1 may be a prognostic biomarker of survival in gastric cancers.","['Del Portillo, Armando', 'Komissarova, Elena V', 'Bokhari, Aqiba', 'Hills, Caitlin', 'de Gonzalez, Anne Koehne', 'Kongkarnka, Sarawut', 'Remotti, Helen E', 'Sepulveda, Jorge L', 'Sepulveda, Antonia R']","['Del Portillo A', 'Komissarova EV', 'Bokhari A', 'Hills C', 'de Gonzalez AK', 'Kongkarnka S', 'Remotti HE', 'Sepulveda JL', 'Sepulveda AR']",,"['Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190611,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6570468,2019/06/25 06:00,2019/06/25 06:01,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26974 [doi]', '26974 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Jun 11;10(39):3852-3864. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26974. eCollection 2019 Jun 11.,39,['P30 CA013696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLI1', 'dysplasia', 'gastric cancer', 'methylation', 'tumor suppressor']","['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST There are no financial conflicts of interest to disclose', 'from any author.']",,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, human myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cell lines and clonogenic blasts from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients respond to C3 and C5 cleavage fragments by chemotaxis and increased adhesion. Consistent with this finding, C3a and C5a receptors are expressed by leukemic cells at the mRNA (RT-PCR) and protein (FACS) levels, and these cells respond to C3a and C5a stimulation by phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK and AKT. However, neither of these ComC cleavage fragments have an effect on cell proliferation or survival. In parallel, we found that inducible heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1)-an anti-inflammatory enzyme, is a negative regulator of ComC-mediated trafficking of malignant cells and that stimulation of these cells by C3 or C5 cleavage fragments downregulates HO-1 expression in a p38 MAPK-dependent manner, rendering cells exposed to C3a or C5a more mobile. We propose that, while the ComC is not directly involved in the proliferation of malignant hematopoietic cells, its activation in leukemia/lymphoma patients (e.g., as a result of accompanying infections or sterile inflammation after radio-chemotherapy) enhances the motility of malignant cells and contributes to their dissemination in a p38 MAPK-HO-1 axis-dependent manner. Based on this idea, we propose that inhibition of p38 MAPK or upregulation of HO-1 by available small-molecule modulators would have a beneficial effect on ameliorating expansion and dissemination of leukemia/lymphoma cells in clinical situations in which the ComC becomes activated. Finally, since we detected expression of C3 and C5 mRNA in human leukemic cell lines, further study of the potential role of the complosome in regulating the behavior of these cells is needed.","['Lenkiewicz, Anna', 'Bujko, Kamila', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus, Katarzyna', 'Xu, Bing', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Lenkiewicz A', 'Bujko K', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus K', 'Xu B', 'Ratajczak MZ']",,"['Department of Regenerative Medicine, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States.', 'Department of Hematology, Multi-Specialist Hospital Gorzow Wlkp., University of Zielona Gora, Zielona Gora, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University and Institute of Hematology of Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Center for Preclinical Research and Technology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190607,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,"['Chemotaxis/*physiology', 'Complement Activation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology']",PMC6567995,2019/06/25 06:00,2020/11/11 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01292 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jun 7;10:1292. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01292. eCollection 2019.,,"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*HO-1', '*Hmgb1', '*S100a9', '*cell migration', '*chemotaxis', '*complement cascade', '*inflammasome', '*leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, clinical efficacy of NK cell immunotherapy has been limited to a sub-fraction of patients. Here we show that steps incorporated in the ex vivo manipulation/production of NK cell products used for adoptive infusion, such as over-night IL-2 activation or cryopreservation followed by ex vivo expansion, drastically decreases NK cell surface expression of the bone marrow (BM) homing chemokine receptor CXCR4. Reduced CXCR4 expression was associated with dampened in vitro NK cell migration toward its cognate ligand stromal-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha). NK cells isolated from patients with WHIM syndrome carry gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in CXCR4 (CXCR4(R334X)). Compared to healthy donors, we observed that NK cells expanded from WHIM patients have similar surface levels of CXCR4 but have a much stronger propensity to home to BM compartments when adoptively infused into NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) (NSG) mice. Therefore, in order to augment the capacity of adoptively infused NK cells to home to the BM, we genetically engineered ex vivo expanded NK cells to express the naturally occurring GOF CXCR4(R334X) receptor variant. Transfection of CXCR4(R334X)-coding mRNA into ex vivo expanded NK cells using a clinically applicable method consistently led to an increase in cell surface CXCR4 without altering NK cell phenotype, cytotoxic function, or compromising NK cell viability. Compared to non-transfected and wild type CXCR4-coding mRNA transfected counterparts, CXCR4(R334X)-engineered NK cells had significantly greater chemotaxis toward SDF-1alpha in vitro. Importantly, expression of CXCR4(R334X) on expanded NK cells resulted in significantly greater BM homing following adoptive transfer into NSG mice compared to non-transfected NK cell controls. Collectively, these data suggest up-regulation of cell surface CXCR4(R334X) on ex vivo expanded NK cells via mRNA transfection represents a novel approach to improve homing and target NK cell-based immunotherapies to BM where hematological malignancies reside.","['Levy, Emily', 'Reger, Robert', 'Segerberg, Filip', 'Lambert, Melanie', 'Leijonhufvud, Caroline', 'Baumer, Yvonne', 'Carlsten, Mattias', 'Childs, Richard']","['Levy E', 'Reger R', 'Segerberg F', 'Lambert M', 'Leijonhufvud C', 'Baumer Y', 'Carlsten M', 'Childs R']",,"['National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'The Department of Molecular Medicine, The George Washington University, Washington, DC, United States.', 'National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.', 'Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190605,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', '*Gain of Function Mutation', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/genetics/*immunology', '*Transfection']",PMC6560173,2019/06/25 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01262 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jun 5;10:1262. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01262. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CXCR4', '*NK cells', '*WHIM', '*homing', '*immunotherapy', '*mRNA transfection']",,,,,,,,,,,

Stemmed from the seminal discoveries in early '90s, in which Alessandro Moretta was the major actor, an extraordinary amount of research on KIR specificity, genetics, polymorphism, and repertoire has followed. These basic notions on NK cells and their receptors have been successfully translated to clinical applications, primarily to the haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation to cure otherwise fatal leukemia in patients with no HLA compatible donors. The finding that NK cells may express the PD-1 inhibitory checkpoint, particularly in cancer patients, may allow understanding how anti-PD-1 therapy could function also in case of HLA class I(neg) tumors, usually susceptible to NK-mediated killing.

Methods: One million people insured under the Taiwan's National Health Insurance program in 2005 were randomly sampled to create the study's dataset. According to the presence of cancer and/or stroke, patients were separated into cancer and stroke, cancer-only, and stroke-only groups. Diagnoses of cancer, stroke, and comorbidities were defined according to ICD9-CM codes. Cancer and non-cancer populations were matched by age at cancer diagnosis, gender, and stroke risk factors, and each patient with cancer was matched with two non-cancer controls nested in the same year of cancer diagnosis. The hazards of stroke and cumulative incidences within a year after cancer diagnosis were evaluated using Fine and Gray's subdistributional hazard model. Results: The temporal distribution of first-ever stroke in patients with both cancer and stroke was a sharpened bell shape that peaked between 0.5 years before and after cancer diagnosis. Frequencies of stroke were further adjusted by number of cancer survivors. The monthly event rate of stroke remained nested around the time of cancer diagnosis in all strokes. Brain malignancies, lung cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia patients obtained higher ratio of stroke, while breast cancer and thyroid cancer patients had low percentage of combining stroke. When compared to non-cancer matched control, the hazard of stroke within one year after cancer diagnosis was increased by cancer at a subdistributional hazard ratio of 1.72 (95% confident interval 1.48 to 2.01; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Cancer increased the risk of stroke and stroke events were nested around the time of cancer diagnosis, occurring 0.5 years prior to cancer on average regardless of stroke type.","['Wei, Yi-Chia', 'Chen, Kuan-Fu', 'Wu, Chia-Lun', 'Lee, Tay-Wey', 'Liu, Chi-Hung', 'Shyu, Yu-Chiau', 'Lin, Ching-Po']","['Wei YC', 'Chen KF', 'Wu CL', 'Lee TW', 'Liu CH', 'Shyu YC', 'Lin CP']",,"['Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Community Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Clinical Informatics and Medical Statistics Research Center, Chung Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Department of Emergency, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Biostatistical Consultation Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Neurology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Community Medicine Research Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Neuroscience, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190607,Switzerland,Front Neurol,Frontiers in neurology,101546899,,,,PMC6566310,2019/06/25 06:00,2019/06/25 06:01,['2019/06/25 06:00'],"['2019/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fneur.2019.00579 [doi]'],epublish,Front Neurol. 2019 Jun 7;10:579. doi: 10.3389/fneur.2019.00579. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'cerebral hemorrhage', 'cumulative incidence', 'hazard ratio', 'infarction', 'neoplasms', 'stroke']",,,,,,,,,,,

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) survive inflammatory stress that kills other blood cells, but the mechanisms underlying this effect remain poorly understood. Here, we find that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) acts differently on HSCs and progenitors, thus facilitating hematopoietic clearance and promoting regeneration. We show that while inducing myeloid progenitor apoptosis, TNF-alpha promotes HSC survival and myeloid differentiation by activating a strong and specific p65-nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)-dependent gene program that primarily prevents necroptosis rather than apoptosis, induces immunomodulatory functions, and poises HSCs for myeloid cell production. These TNF-alpha-driven mechanisms are critical for HSC response to inflammatory stress but are also hijacked in aged and malignant HSCs. Our results reveal several TNF-alpha-mediated pro-survival mechanisms unique to HSCs, highlight an important role for necroptosis in HSC killing, and establish TNF-alpha as a major pro-survival and pro-regeneration factor for HSCs.","['Yamashita, Masayuki', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle']","['Yamashita M', 'Passegue E']",,"['Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.', 'Columbia Stem Cell Initiative, Department of Genetics & Development, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA.

In this study, we investigated the exposure of cats to feline lungworm infections by detecting antibodies in a large population of animals from several regions of Italy. Sera of 1087 domestic cats living in regions of the north (n = 700), the centre (n = 227) and the south (n = 160) of Italy were examined by a newly developed indirect ELISA conceived for detection of antibodies against the most frequently occurring feline lungworm Aelurostrongylus abstrusus. Individual cat data (i.e., age, sex, neutering status and provenience) were analysed as potential risk factors for exposure to lungworm infections. Samples were additionally screened for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNAs. Overall, 9% (98/1087; 95% confidence interval (CI) 7.4-10.9%) of the animals tested seropositive to lungworm antibodies. Positive cats were identified in the north (7.1%; CI 5.5-9.3%), in the centre (5.3%; CI 3.0-9.0%) and in the South (22.5%; CI 16.7-29.6%), with more seropositive animals in the latter area (p < 0.05). The risk of lungworm infection in cats was significantly associated with age less than 6 months (i.e. 24.4%, p < 0.05) and FIV infection (p < 0.05). This large-scale serological survey confirms the exposure of cats to lungworm infections in Italy and that serological tests can be used to assess the distribution of lungworm infections in large populations of animals.","['Cavalera, Maria Alfonsa', 'Schnyder, Manuela', 'Gueldner, Emily Katharina', 'Furlanello, Tommaso', 'Iatta, Roberta', 'Brianti, Emanuele', 'Strube, Christina', 'Colella, Vito', 'Otranto, Domenico']","['Cavalera MA', 'Schnyder M', 'Gueldner EK', 'Furlanello T', 'Iatta R', 'Brianti E', 'Strube C', 'Colella V', 'Otranto D']",,"['Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, 70010 Valenzano, Bari, Italy.', 'Institute of Parasitology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 266a, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Parasitology, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 266a, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'San Marco Veterinary Clinic and Laboratory, 35030 Veggiano, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, 70010 Valenzano, Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie, Universita degli Studi di Messina, 98168, Messina, Italy.', 'Institute for Parasitology, Centre for Infection Medicine, University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Buenteweg 17, 30559, Hanover, Germany.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, 70010 Valenzano, Bari, Italy.', 'Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, University of Melbourne, 3010 Parkville, Australia.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, 70010 Valenzano, Bari, Italy. domenico.otranto@uniba.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190622,Germany,Parasitol Res,Parasitology research,8703571,"['0 (Antigens, Helminth)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Helminth/blood', 'Cat Diseases/blood/epidemiology/*parasitology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feces/parasitology', 'Female', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Metastrongyloidea/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Risk Factors', 'Serologic Tests', 'Strongylida Infections/blood/immunology/*veterinary', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2019/06/24 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2019/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00436-019-06373-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00436-019-06373-z [pii]']",ppublish,Parasitol Res. 2019 Aug;118(8):2377-2382. doi: 10.1007/s00436-019-06373-z.

Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to assess the overall cancer risk and risk for specific cancers in patients with PD in Korea. METHODS: Using data from the Korean National Health Insurance Database, we analysed 52,009 patients diagnosed with PD between 2010 and 2015 and 260,045 individuals without PD. Patients previously diagnosed with cancer were excluded. The age- and sex-matched cohorts were followed up until 2016 for cancer development. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between PD and cancer. RESULTS: Patients with PD had a lower overall cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.82) after adjustment for multiple covariates during 2,022,852.6 person-years of follow-up. Patients with PD showed significantly lower risk of laryngeal cancer (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.21-0.84), gastric cancer (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.63-0.82), colorectal cancer (HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.60-0.76), liver cancer (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.95), pancreatic cancer (HR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.62-0.91), lung cancer (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.63-0.84), leukaemia (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-0.89), uterine cervical cancer (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.40-0.99) and prostate cancer (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.91). CONCLUSION: This nationwide population-based cohort study revealed that patients with PD had lower overall cancer risk and lower risk of specific cancers. Contrary to the results of the recent Asian study, this large cohort study revealed that patients with PD were less likely to develop cancer than those without PD in Korea. Our results were consistent with those of previous Western studies, despite differences in ethnicity and environment.","['Park, Joo-Hyun', 'Kim, Do-Hoon', 'Park, Yong-Gyu', 'Kwon, Do-Young', 'Choi, Moonyoung', 'Jung, Jin-Hyung', 'Han, Kyungdo']","['Park JH', 'Kim DH', 'Park YG', 'Kwon DY', 'Choi M', 'Jung JH', 'Han K']",,"['Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Korea University College of Medicine, Ansan, Republic of Korea.

However, sequencing data from bulk tumor samples often have considerable ambiguity in clonal composition, complicating the inference of ancestral relationships between clones. We introduce Cancer Analysis of Longitudinal Data through Evolutionary Reconstruction (CALDER), an algorithm to infer phylogenetic trees from longitudinal bulk DNA sequencing data. CALDER explicitly models a longitudinally observed phylogeny incorporating constraints that longitudinal sampling imposes on phylogeny reconstruction. We show on simulated bulk tumor data that longitudinal constraints substantially reduce ambiguity in phylogeny reconstruction and that CALDER outperforms existing methods that do not leverage this longitudinal information. On real data from two chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we find that CALDER reconstructs more plausible and parsimonious phylogenies than existing methods, with CALDER phylogenies containing fewer tumor clones per sample. CALDER's use of longitudinal information will be advantageous in further studies of tumor heterogeneity and evolution.","['Myers, Matthew A', 'Satas, Gryte', 'Raphael, Benjamin J']","['Myers MA', 'Satas G', 'Raphael BJ']",,"['Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA; Department of Computer Science, Brown University, Providence, RI 02912, USA.', 'Department of Computer Science, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.

Moreover, organs infiltration trends to occur during remission. Rapamycin was applied to treat malignancies for decades. In this investigation, we aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms and pathway changes during the T-ALL therapeutic process. T-ALL cell line Molt-4 cells were treated with rapamycin and performed microarray analysis to identify the deregulated miRNAs and mRNAs (log2 fold change>2 or <-2). To obtain regulatory miRNA/mRNA network, miRNA target prediction softwares and Cytoscape were used to plot and modularize the rapamycin treatment-related network. Surprisingly, the enriched pathways were not involved in mediating either cell death or apoptosis but were responsible for angiogenesis, cell survival, and anti-apoptosis, which is consistent with the Gene Ontology analysis and PPI network based on all deregulated mRNAs, indicating that these elements likely play a role in promoting Molt-4 cell survival or escaping from rapamycin. The expression of 3 miRNAs (miR-149-3p, miR-361-3p, and miR-944) and their putative targets, which play central roles in their module, were validated by qRT-PCR. These results provide novel insight into potentially relevant biological pathways for T-ALL cells escaping from chemotherapy or developing central nervous system infiltration.","['Chen, Xi', 'Guo, Zhibo', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Sun, Lili', 'Li, Huibo', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Li, Yinghua']","['Chen X', 'Guo Z', 'Fan S', 'Sun L', 'Li H', 'Zhou J', 'Li Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China; Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.

The present study evaluates the first step to create a bioengineered ovarian construct that can act as growth-supporting tissue for isolated small follicles that are dependent on a stroma for normal follicular maturation. The present study used the intact mouse ovary to develop a mouse ovarian scaffold through various protocols of decellularization. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Potential Immunogenic DNA and intracellular components were removed from whole mouse ovaries by agitation in a 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution (Protocol 1; P1), or in a 2% sodium deoxycholate solution (P2) or by a combination of the two (P3). The remaining decelluralized ovarian extracellular matrix structure was then assessed based on the DNA- and protein content, and was further evaluated histologically by haematoxylin and eosin-, Verhoeff's van gieson- (for elastin), Masson's trichrome- (for collagens) and Alcian blue (for glycosaminoglycans) staining. We also evaluated the decellularization efficiency using the mild detergent Triton-X100 (1%). RESULTS: Sodium dodecyl sulfate efficiently removed DNA and intracellular components from the ovarian tissue but also significantly reduced the integrity of the remaining ovarian extracellular matrix. Sodium deoxycholate, a considerably milder detergent compared to sodium dodecyl sulfate, preserved the ovarian extracellular matrix better, evident by a more distinct staining for glycosaminoglycan, collagen and elastic fibres. Triton-X100 was found ineffective as a decellularization reagent for mouse ovaries in our settings. CONCLUSIONS: The sodium dodecyl sulfate generated ovarian scaffolds contained minute amounts of DNA that may be an advantage to evade a detrimental immune response following engraftment. The sodium deoxycholate generated ovarian scaffolds had higher donor DNA content, yet, retained the extracellular composition better and may therefore have improved recellularization and other downstream bioengineering applications. These two novel types of mouse ovarian scaffolds serve as promising scaffold-candidates for future ovarian bioengineering experiments.","['Alshaikh, Ahmed Baker', 'Padma, Arvind Manikantan', 'Dehlin, Matilda', 'Akouri, Randa', 'Song, Min Jong', 'Brannstrom, Mats', 'Hellstrom, Mats']","['Alshaikh AB', 'Padma AM', 'Dehlin M', 'Akouri R', 'Song MJ', 'Brannstrom M', 'Hellstrom M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3323-5618'],"['Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', ""Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Daejeon St. Mary's Hospital, The Catholic University of Korea, Daejeon, South Korea."", 'Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Stockholm IVF-EUGIN, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Laboratory for Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden. mats.hellstrom@gu.se.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Goteborg, Sweden. mats.hellstrom@gu.se.', 'Kvinnokliniken, Bla straket 6, SE-413 45, Goteborg, Sweden. mats.hellstrom@gu.se.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190622,England,J Ovarian Res,Journal of ovarian research,101474849,"['005990WHZZ (Deoxycholic Acid)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bioartificial Organs', 'DNA/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Deoxycholic Acid/chemistry', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ovary/chemistry/*cytology', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate/chemistry', 'Tissue Engineering/*methods', '*Tissue Scaffolds']",PMC6588934,2019/06/24 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13048-019-0531-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13048-019-0531-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Ovarian Res. 2019 Jun 22;12(1):58. doi: 10.1186/s13048-019-0531-3.,1,"['116008/Vetenskapsradet', 'N/A/Adlerbertska Stiftelserna', 'N/A/Stiftelsen Handlanden Hjalmar Svenssons', 'N/A/Stiftelsen Handlanden Hjalmar Svenssons', 'N/A/Stiftelserna Wilhelm och Martina Lundgrens']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Biomaterial', 'Decellularization', 'Extracellular matrix', 'Malignancy', 'Ovary', 'Scaffold', 'Tissue engineering']",,,,,,,,,,,

There are few diagnostic criteria of DIC based on overall or global hemostatic mechanisms. METHODS: We have assessed in detailed the dynamic global hemostatic changes using thrombin and plasmin generation assay (T/P-GA), clot fibrinolytic waveform analysis (CFWA) and not-activated rotational thromboelastometry (NATEM), in a young girl with DIC associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ratios of endogenous thrombin potential (T-EP) and plasmin lag time (P-LT) relative to normal plasma was sourced from pooled normal plasma from healthy volunteers on T/P-GA. RESULTS: The inverse P-LT ratio prior to tranexamic acid (TXA) treatment was greater than the T-EP ratio (1.1-2.8 and 0.83-1.2, respectively). Significant reduction in inverse P-LT ratio (0.084-1.3) was observed after TXA treatment. The interval from clotting to the initiation of fibrinolysis (fibrinolysis lag time: FLT) in CFWA was significantly shorter than the control at onset (74.2-91.6 s vs 109 s), indicating enhanced fibrinolysis. Data from an adult with acute promyelocytic leukemia-associated DIC also supportively showed a high inverse P-LT ratio (2.1) and shortened FLT (83.7 s). The clotting time in patient whole blood using NATEM-mode during an episode of severe epistaxis markedly shortened beyond control, but returned to normal after the addition of an anti-tissue factor (TF) monoclonal antibody. CONCLUSION: The release of intravascular TF contributed to sustained activation of coagulation and subsequent fibrinolytic activity in this patient with AML-associated DIC, and T/P-GA could provide better quantitative data than conventional assays in these circumstances.","['Ishihara, Takashi', 'Nogami, Keiji', 'Onishi, Tomoko', 'Ogiwara, Kenichi', 'Ochi, Satoshi', 'Yamazaki, Masaharu', 'Shima, Midori']","['Ishihara T', 'Nogami K', 'Onishi T', 'Ogiwara K', 'Ochi S', 'Yamazaki M', 'Shima M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1061-085X'],"['Department of Pediatrics, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.', 'Central Clinical Laboratory, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nara Medical University, Kashihara, Nara, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Coagulation Tests', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/blood/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Female', '*Hemostasis', 'Humans']",,2019/06/23 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2019/06/23 06:00'],"['2019/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13919 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2019 Sep;61(9):872-881. doi: 10.1111/ped.13919.,9,"['18K07885/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology', '18K15726/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology']",,,['(c) 2019 Japan Pediatric Society.'],['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'clot fibrinolysis waveform analysis', 'disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'rotational thromboelastometry', 'thrombin and plasmin generation assay']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the diagnostic (n = 77) and relapsed (n = 31) pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) samples for the most common leukemia-associated gene variations CRLF2, JAK2, PAX5 and IL7R using deep sequencing and copy number alterations (CNAs) (CDKN2A/2B, PAX5, RB1, BTG1, ETV6, CSF2RA, IL3RA and CRLF2) by multiplex ligation proximity assay (MLPA), and evaluated for the clonal changes through relapse. Single nucleotide variations SNVs were detected in 19% of diagnostic 15.3% of relapse samples. The CNAs were detected in 55% of diagnosed patients; most common affected genes were CDKN2A/2B, PAX5, and CRLF2. Relapse samples did not accumulate a greater number of CNAs or SNVs than the cohort of diagnostic samples, but the clonal dynamics showed the accumulation/disappearance of specific gene variations explained the course of relapse. The CDKN2A/2B were most frequently altered in relapse samples and 32% of relapse samples carried at least one CNA. Moreover, CDKN2A/2B alterations and/or JAK2 variations were associated with decreased relapse-free survival. On the other hand, CRLF2 copy number alterations predicted a better survival rate in B-ALL. These findings contribute to the knowledge of CDKN2A/2B and CRLF2 alterations and their prognostic value in B-ALL. The integration of genomic data in clinical practice will enable better stratification of ALL patients and allow deeper understanding of the nature of relapse.","['Erbilgin, Yucel', 'Firtina, Sinem', 'Mercan, Sevcan', 'Hatirnaz Ng, Ozden', 'Karaman, Serap', 'Tasar, Orcun', 'Karakas, Zeynep', 'Celkan, Tulin Tiraje', 'Zengin, Emine', 'Sarper, Nazan', 'Yildirmak, Zeynep Yildiz', 'Sisko, Sinem', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Sayitoglu, Muge']","['Erbilgin Y', 'Firtina S', 'Mercan S', 'Hatirnaz Ng O', 'Karaman S', 'Tasar O', 'Karakas Z', 'Celkan TT', 'Zengin E', 'Sarper N', 'Yildirmak ZY', 'Sisko S', 'Ozbek U', 'Sayitoglu M']",,"['Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey; Istinye University, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey; Kafkas University, Faculty of Engineering, Kars, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey; Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul University, Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Cerrahpasa University Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Kocaeli University Medical Faculty, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Kocaeli University Medical Faculty, Kocaeli, Turkey.', 'Istanbul Sisli Hamidiye Etfal Education and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey; Acibadem Mehmet Ali Aydinlar University Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Aziz Sancar Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.

Some studies indicate that iron chelation therapy (ICT) may have beneficial effects on clinical endpoints in MDS; however, these data are from non-randomized trials and the validity of the results is vigorously debated. A consistent observation in clinical studies of ICT in MDS has been hematologic improvement (HI) in some patients, including a reduction in RBC transfusion requirements and even transfusion independence.

A six-year-old male European short-hair cat from Austria presented poor general condition, lethargy, anorexia, icterus, a painful abdomen, fever, ruffled hair and a tick infestation, and it had never left Austria. Laboratory tests revealed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and increased serum levels of symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) and bilirubin. In May Grunwald-Giemsa-stained blood smears, structures resembling Hepatozoon gamonts were observed inside neutrophil granulocytes. A PCR targeting a fragment of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. and DNA sequencing allowed the diagnosis of H. felis-DNA in blood samples. The cat was treated with imidocarb dipropionate (6mg/kg body weight, repeated after 14days) and doxycycline monohydrate (5mg/kg body weight twice a day, p.o., for four weeks) and recovered completely. A broad haematological and biochemical laboratory control after six months showed all evaluated parameters under normal ranges. Coinfection with other feline pathogens (i.e. feline leukaemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline Coronavirus, Leishmania and Dirofilaria immitis) could not be detected. This study reveals the presence of H. felis in Austria and provides more evidence on the geographical distribution and pathogenicity of this parasite for domestic cats.

The degree to which social and geographic barriers reduce access to alloHCT is unknown. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program (SEER) and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) were integrated to determine the rate of unrelated donor (URD) alloHCT for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) performed between 2000 and 2010 in the 612 counties covered by SEER. The total incidence of AML, ALL, and MDS was determined using SEER, and the number of alloHCTs performed in the same time period and geographic area were determined using the CIBMTR database. We then determined which sociodemographic attributes influenced the rate of alloHCT (rural/urban status, median family size, percentage of residents below the poverty line, and percentage of minority race). In the entire cohort, higher levels of poverty were associated with lower rates of alloHCT (estimated rate ratio [ERR], .86 for a 10% increase in the percentage of the population below the poverty line; P < .01), whereas rural location was not (ERR, .87; P=.11). Thus, patients from areas with higher poverty rates diagnosed with ALL, AML, and MDS are less likely patients from wealthier counties to undergo URD alloHCT. There is need to better understand the reasons for this disparity and to encourage policy and advocacy efforts to improve access to medical care for all.","['Paulson, Kristjan', 'Brazauskas, Ruta', 'Khera, Nandita', 'He, Naya', 'Majhail, Navneet', 'Akpek, Gorgun', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Buchbinder, David', 'Burns, Linda', 'Beattie, Sara', 'Freytes, Cesar', 'Garcia, Anne', 'Gajewski, James', 'Hahn, Theresa', 'Knight, Jennifer', 'LeMaistre, Charles', 'Lazarus, Hillard', 'Szwajcer, David', 'Seftel, Matthew', 'Wirk, Baldeep', 'Wood, William', 'Saber, Wael']","['Paulson K', 'Brazauskas R', 'Khera N', 'He N', 'Majhail N', 'Akpek G', 'Aljurf M', 'Buchbinder D', 'Burns L', 'Beattie S', 'Freytes C', 'Garcia A', 'Gajewski J', 'Hahn T', 'Knight J', 'LeMaistre C', 'Lazarus H', 'Szwajcer D', 'Seftel M', 'Wirk B', 'Wood W', 'Saber W']",,"['CancerCare Manitoba/University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Disruption of normal calvarial development usually causes craniosynostosis, a prevalent birth defect characterized by premature fusion of calvarial bone. Recent studies have identified mutations of KMT2D allele in patients with craniosynostosis, indicating a potential role for Kmt2d in calvarial development. KMT2D mutations have also been implicated in Kabuki syndrome, which features a distinct facial appearance, skeletal abnormality, growth retardation and intellectual disability. However, the expression pattern of Kmt2d has not been fully elucidated. In the present study we examined the expression pattern of Kmt2d at multiple stages of embryo development in mice, with a focus on the craniofacial tissues. Our in situ hybridization results showed that Kmt2d mRNA is expressed in the developing calvarial osteoblasts, epithelia and neural tissues. Such an expression pattern is in line with the phenotypes of Kabuki syndrome, suggesting that Kmt2d plays an intrinsic role in normal development and homeostasis of these craniofacial tissues.","['Dong, Chunmin', 'Umar, Meenakshi', 'Bartoletti, Garrett', 'Gahankari, Apurva', 'Fidelak, Lauren', 'He, Fenglei']","['Dong C', 'Umar M', 'Bartoletti G', 'Gahankari A', 'Fidelak L', 'He F']",,"['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Tulane University, New Orleans, LA 70118, USA.

CD133 antibody was immobilized on the gold chip surface via EDC/NHS coupling method and binding of the candidate cells to the modified gold sensor surface was monitored after isolation of mononuclear cells from bone marrow of the patients. The method was validated in terms of various parameters such as CD133- antibody concentration and cell density. The CD133-marked cells were investigated in seven AML patients. All SPR results were compared with those obtained from FC method. A very good correlation (R(2)=0.96) was obtained between SPR and FC responses related to CD133-marked cells densities.

Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a known regulator of the heat shock response proteins, including heat shock proteins. In the present study, the BLV LTR was investigated for interaction of heat shock element (HSE) with HSF1 and the viral Tax protein. It could be confirmed that a functional HSE is well conserved in different BLV strains. The LTR transcriptional activity, as measured by luciferase reporter assay, was upregulated by bovine HSF1 - without Tax expression - in feline CC81 cells. The HSF1 activated LTR transcription by binding to the HSE. LTR-activation was lost upon HSE removal from the LTR and upon expression of a mutant HSF1 lacking the DNA-binding domain. We conclude that BLV LTR is activated to a basal level by host transcriptional factor HSF1, but without Tax protein involvement.","['Hachiya, Yuma', 'Oguma, Keisuke', 'Koshida, Takeo', 'Koba, Ryota', 'Sentsui, Hiroshi']","['Hachiya Y', 'Oguma K', 'Koshida T', 'Koba R', 'Sentsui H']",,"['Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Microbiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-0880, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Epizootiology, Department of Veterinary Medicine, Nihon University, Kameino 1866, Fujisawa, Kanagawa, 252-0880, Japan.

Noncoding RNA transcription-mediated genome folding and activation of target gene expression have been found in a variety of cell types. Noncoding RNA ThymoD (thymocyte differentiation factor) transcription at superenhancers is essential for mouse T-cell lineage commitment. The cessation of ThymoD transcription abolishes transcription-mediated demethylation, recruiting looping factors such as the cohesin complex, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), ultimately leading to the phenotype of severe combined immunodeficiency and T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. In this review, we describe the functional role of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription at enhancers and in genome folding.

Expanding knowledge that chronic inflammation and a dysregulated immune system are central to the pathogenesis and progression of MPNs serves as a driving force for the development of agents affecting the immune system as therapy for MPN. This review describes the rationale and potential impact of anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and targeted agents in MPNs. RECENT FINDINGS: The advances in molecular insights, especially the discovery of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation and its role in JAK-STAT pathway dysregulation, led to the development of the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, which currently represents the cornerstone of medical therapy in MF and hydroxyurea-resistant/intolerant PV. However, there remain significant unmet needs in the treatment of these patients, and many agents continue to be investigated. Novel, more selective JAK inhibitors might offer reduced myelosuppression or even improvement of blood counts. The recent approval of a novel, long-acting interferon for PV patients in Europe, might eventually lead to its broader clinical use in all MPNs. Targeted immunotherapy involving monoclonal antibodies, checkpoint inhibitors, or therapeutic vaccines against selected MPN epitopes could further enhance tumor-specific immune responses. Immunotherapeutic approaches are expanding and hopefully will extend the therapeutic armamentarium in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Masarova, Lucia', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Masarova L', 'Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']",,"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. lmasarova@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Unit 0428, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/etiology/metabolism/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/23 06:00,2020/07/25 06:00,['2019/06/23 06:00'],"['2019/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00527-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00527-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Aug;14(4):310-327. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00527-7.,4,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Immunotherapy', '*Interferon', '*JAK inhibitors', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,

The SNPs were analyzed for deviation of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; Fisher's exact test was used to compare the genotypic and allelic frequencies between controls and patients. The association between SNPs and ALL susceptibility was calculated, and haplotype and ancestry analyses were conducted. All SNPs were associated with ALL, pre-B ALL, and hyperdiploid-ALL susceptibility (p < 0.05). No association with T-ALL and gene fusions was found (p > 0.05). The seven SNPs were associated with risk of pre-B ALL in younger children; however, rs2393732, rs2393782, rs2893881, and rs4948488 were not associated with susceptibility in older children and adolescents. The CAG haplotype (rs10821936, rs10994982, rs7089424) was strongly associated with ALL risk in our population (p < 0.00001).

This is the first report showing the association between rs2393732, rs2393782, and rs4948488 with pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL children. The G allele at rs2893881 confers major risk for pre-B hyperdiploid-ALL in Mexican (OR, 2.29) than in Hispanic children (OR, 1.71).

Having integrated those two reference standards in the ARResT/Interrogate bioinformatic platform, EuroClonality-NGS provides a complete protocol for standardised IG/TR gene rearrangement analysis by NGS with high reproducibility, accuracy and precision for valid marker identification and quantification in diagnostics of lymphoid malignancies.","['Knecht, Henrik', 'Reigl, Tomas', 'Kotrova, Michaela', 'Appelt, Franziska', 'Stewart, Peter', 'Bystry, Vojtech', 'Krejci, Adam', 'Grioni, Andrea', 'Pal, Karol', 'Stranska, Kamila', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Rijntjes, Jos', 'Songia, Simona', 'Svaton, Michael', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Bartram, Jack', 'Scheijen, Blanca', 'Herrmann, Dietrich', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Hancock, Jeremy', 'Moppett, John', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Groenen, Patricia J T A', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth A', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Trka, Jan', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Gonzalez, David', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Darzentas, Nikos']","['Knecht H', 'Reigl T', 'Kotrova M', 'Appelt F', 'Stewart P', 'Bystry V', 'Krejci A', 'Grioni A', 'Pal K', 'Stranska K', 'Plevova K', 'Rijntjes J', 'Songia S', 'Svaton M', 'Fronkova E', 'Bartram J', 'Scheijen B', 'Herrmann D', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Hancock J', 'Moppett J', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Davi F', 'Groenen PJTA', 'Hummel M', 'Macintyre EA', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Trka J', 'Langerak AW', 'Gonzalez D', 'Pott C', 'Bruggemann M', 'Darzentas N']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5394-1072', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4120-2787', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1844-3531', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2955-4528']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK."", 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Centro Ricerca Tettamanti, University of Milano Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine -

Dysregulation of alpha7-type nAChRs in neuropsychiatric as well as immunological and oncological diseases makes them attractive targets for pharmaceutical development. Recently, we identified NACHO as an essential chaperone for alpha7 nAChRs. Leveraging the robust recombinant expression of alpha7 nAChRs with NACHO, we utilized genome-wide cDNA library screening and discovered that several anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins further upregulate receptor assembly and cell surface expression. These effects are mediated by an intracellular motif on alpha7 that resembles the BH3 binding domain of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins, and can be blocked by BH3 mimetic Bcl-2 inhibitors. Overexpression of Bcl-2 member Mcl-1 in neurons enhanced surface expression of endogenous alpha7 nAChRs, while a combination of chemotherapeutic Bcl2-inhibitors suppressed neuronal alpha7 receptor assembly. These results demonstrate that Bcl-2 proteins link alpha7 nAChR assembly to cell survival pathways.","['Dawe, G Brent', 'Yu, Hong', 'Gu, Shenyan', 'Blackler, Alissa N', 'Matta, Jose A', 'Siuda, Edward R', 'Rex, Elizabeth B', 'Bredt, David S']","['Dawe GB', 'Yu H', 'Gu S', 'Blackler AN', 'Matta JA', 'Siuda ER', 'Rex EB', 'Bredt DS']",,"['Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Alkermes, Inc., 852 Winter Street, Waltham, MA, 02451, USA.', 'Discovery Sciences, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC, 800 Ridgeview Drive, Horsham, PA, 19044, USA.', 'Neuroscience Discovery, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, 3210 Merryfield Row, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.

We aimed to harness knowledge acquired by understanding a mechanism of Notch-induced cell death to elucidate a therapeutically viable target in B-ALL. To this end, we identified that Notch activation suppresses Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) in a B-ALL-specific manner. We identified that PLK1 is expressed in all subsets of B-ALL and is highest in Philadelphia-like (Ph-like) ALL, a high-risk subtype of disease. We biochemically delineated a mechanism of Notch-induced PLK1 downregulation that elucidated stark regulation of p53 in this setting. Our findings identified a novel posttranslational cascade initiated by Notch in which CHFR was activated via PARP1-mediated PARylation, resulting in ubiquitination and degradation of PLK1. This led to hypophosphorylation of MDM2(Ser260), culminating in p53 stabilization and upregulation of BAX. shRNA knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of PLK1 using BI2536 or BI6727 (volasertib) in B-ALL cell lines and patient samples led to p53 stabilization and cell death. These effects were seen in primary human B-ALL samples in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft models in vivo These results highlight PLK1 as a viable therapeutic target in B-ALL. Efficacy of clinically relevant PLK1 inhibitors in B-ALL patient-derived xenograft mouse models suggests that use of these agents may be tailored as an additional therapeutic strategy in future clinical studies.","['Kannan, Sankaranarayanan', 'Aitken, Marisa J L', 'Herbrich, Shelley M', 'Golfman, Leonard S', 'Hall, Mandy G', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Burks, Jared K', 'Song, Guangchun', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Chandra, Joya', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A']","['Kannan S', 'Aitken MJL', 'Herbrich SM', 'Golfman LS', 'Hall MG', 'Mak DH', 'Burks JK', 'Song G', 'Konopleva M', 'Mullighan CG', 'Chandra J', 'Zweidler-McKay PA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7937-531X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1871-1850']","['Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. skannan@mdanderson.org.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UT Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center UT Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Division of Pediatrics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'ImmunoGen, Waltham, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190621,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (BI 2536)', '0 (BI 6727)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pteridines)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pteridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",PMC6726528,2019/06/23 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/06/23 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-18-0706 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0706 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Sep;18(9):1615-1627. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0706.

In this article, we show that the function of PLZF is completely dependent on the transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1). Mouse NKT cells expressing wild-type levels of PLZF, but deficient for YY1, had developmental defects, lost their characteristic ""preformed"" mRNA for cytokines, and failed to produce cytokine protein upon primary activation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this open-label phase 2a study, patients with AML were treated with ibrutinib 560 mg per day alone (cohort 1; n = 7), or ibrutinib in combination with either cytarabine 20 mg administered subcutaneously twice daily for 10 days of a 28-day cycle (cohort 2; n = 21) or azacitidine 75 mg/m(2) administered intravenously once daily on days 1 to 7 of a 28-day cycle (cohort 3; n = 8). Best overall response (primary end point), overall survival, and safety were summarized. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were enrolled and received treatment; median duration of ibrutinib treatment was 5.4 weeks, and median time on study was 16 months. Of 24 patients evaluable for response, 1 partial remission (cohort 3) and 1 complete remission (cohort 2) were observed; the remaining responses were treatment failures. Median overall survival was 4.0 months in cohort 1, 2.2 months in cohort 2, 2.8 months in cohort 3, and 2.4 months for the overall population. No unexpected safety signals were identified. Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in >/= 10% of patients included AML progression, febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, asthenia, and respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: Ibrutinib alone or in combination with cytarabine or azacitidine demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. However, limited efficacy with ibrutinib was observed in patients with AML.","['Cortes, Jorge E', 'Jonas, Brian A', 'Graef, Thorsten', 'Luan, Ying', 'Stein, Anthony S']","['Cortes JE', 'Jonas BA', 'Graef T', 'Luan Y', 'Stein AS']",,"['MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

We compared autoHCT consolidation outcomes with chemotherapy alone in a minority-rich cohort in the Bronx. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We identified adults with favorable or intermediate cytogenetic risk AML in first complete remission after induction at Montefiore Medical Center from 1999 to 2015, and analyzed 81 patients who received consolidation with >/=2 cycles of chemotherapy, of whom 28 received autoHCT. RESULTS: The cohort predominantly consisted of ethnic/racial minorities (69%). Age, sex, race, presenting white cell count, and cytogenetic risk were similar between groups. The autoHCT group had longer relapse-free (RFS; 43 vs. 11 months; P = .003) and overall (OS) survival (not reached vs. 36 months; P = .043). Adjusted multivariable analysis showed significant benefit of autoHCT over chemotherapy alone for RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37-0.75; P < .001) and OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40-0.95; P = .027). CONCLUSION: In this inner-city non-high-risk AML cohort, autoHCT provided OS and RFS benefit compared with chemotherapy alone. AutoHCT might constitute a valuable option for ethnic/racial minorities affected by significant barriers to alloHCT, whereas integration of measurable residual disease can help select patients more likely to benefit.","['Adrianzen Herrera, Diego', 'Kornblum, Noah', 'Derman, Olga', 'Bachier-Rodriguez, Lizamarie', 'Sica, R Alejandro', 'Shastri, Aditi', 'Janakiram, Murali', 'Verma, Amit', 'Braunschweig, Ira', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis']","['Adrianzen Herrera D', 'Kornblum N', 'Derman O', 'Bachier-Rodriguez L', 'Sica RA', 'Shastri A', 'Janakiram M', 'Verma A', 'Braunschweig I', 'Mantzaris I']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.

In the majority of cases, drug-resistant disease is treated by selecting a combination of other drugs, without understanding the molecular mechanisms by which malignant cells escape chemotherapeutic treatments, even though a more detailed genomic characterization and the identification of actionable disease targets may enable informed decision of new agents to improve patient outcomes. In this work, we describe pathways of resistance to common chemotherapeutic agents including glucocorticoids and review the resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy such as IL7R, PI3K-AKT-mTOR, NOTCH1, BRD4/MYC, Cyclin D3: CDK4/CDK6, BCL2 inhibitors, and selective inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE). Finally, to overcome the limitations of the current trial-and-error method, we summarize the experiences of anti-cancer drug sensitivity resistance profiling (DSRP) approaches as a rapid and relevant strategy to infer drug activity and provide functional information to assist clinical decision one patient at a time.","['Follini, Elena', 'Marchesini, Matteo', 'Roti, Giovanni']","['Follini E', 'Marchesini M', 'Roti G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9489-7899'],"['University of Parma, Department of Medicine and Surgery, 43126 Parma, Italy. elena.follini@yahoo.it.', 'University of Parma, Department of Medicine and Surgery, 43126 Parma, Italy. matteo.marchesini@unipr.it.', 'University of Parma, Department of Medicine and Surgery, 43126 Parma, Italy. giovanni.roti@unipr.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190620,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC6627878,2019/06/23 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/23 06:00'],"['2019/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20123021 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20123021 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 20;20(12). pii: ijms20123021. doi: 10.3390/ijms20123021.,12,"['17107/Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro', '3576/2017/Fondazione Cariparma', '0180/2018/Fondazione Cariparma', '01-2018/Fondazione Grande Ale Onlus']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL2 inhibitors', 'BET inhibitors', 'CDK4/6 inhibitors', 'DSRP', 'IL7R signaling', 'NOTCH1 inhibitors', 'PI3K-AKT-mTOR inhibitors', 'T-ALL', 'chemotherapy', 'glucocorticoid', 'resistance', 'selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE)']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied a retrospective cohort of 784,944 newborns in Quebec, Canada between 2006 and 2016 who were followed for cancer one decade after birth. The exposures were residential distance to the nearest high voltage power transformer station and transmission line. We determined the incidence of childhood cancer, and estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for maternal and birth characteristics. RESULTS: There were 1114 incident cases of cancer during 4,647,472 person-years of follow-up. Residential proximity to transformer stations was associated with a somewhat greater risk of cancer, but there was no association with transmission lines. Compared with 200m, a distance of 80m from a transformer station was associated with a hazard ratio of 1.08 (95% CI 0.98, 1.20) for any cancer, 1.04 (95% CI 0.88, 1.23) for hematopoietic cancer, and 1.11 (95% CI 0.99, 1.25) for solid tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Residential proximity to transformer stations is associated with a borderline risk of childhood cancer, but the absence of an association with transmission lines suggests no causal link.","['Auger, Nathalie', 'Bilodeau-Bertrand, Marianne', 'Marcoux, Sophie', 'Kosatsky, Tom']","['Auger N', 'Bilodeau-Bertrand M', 'Marcoux S', 'Kosatsky T']",,"['University of Montreal Hospital Research Centre, 900 Saint-Denis, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Institut national de sante publique du Quebec, 190 Cremazie Blvd E., Montreal, Quebec, Canada; School of Public Health, University of Montreal, 1301 Sherbrooke E., Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

Worse still, CLL patients with TP53 mutation are associated with poor efficacy to current chemotherapeutic, such as Fludarabine. Here, we confirmed that high expression of HDAC1 in CLL patients with TP53 mutation, which is closely related to poor prognosis and drug-resistance. Subsequently, we demonstrated Entinostat (HDAC1 inhibitor) combination with Fludarabine significantly induced apoptosis in TP53 mutations CLL cells. Its mechanism was associated with up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and the down-regulation of HDAC1, HO-1 and BCL-2 proteins. More importantly, we also confirmed that upregulation of HDAC1 could resistant Entinostat-induced apoptosis in TP53 mutations CLL cells by activating the HDAC1/P38/HO-1 pathway. In vivo, we found that Entinostat combination with Fludarabine significantly induced tumor cells apoptosis and prolong survival time in xenograft mouse model. Finally, combining vitro and vivo experiments, we presented the first demonstration that Entinostat combination with Fludarabine had a synergistic effect on the induction of apoptosis in TP53 mutations CLL cells. In conclusion, we provide valuable pre-clinical experimental evidence for the treatment of CLL patients with poor prognosis, especially for TP53 mutations.","['Zhou, Zhen', 'Fang, Qin', 'Li, Peifan', 'Ma, Dan', 'Zhe, Nana', 'Ren, Mei', 'Chen, Bingqing', 'He, Zhengchang', 'Wang, Jun', 'Zhong, Qin', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Zhou Z', 'Fang Q', 'Li P', 'Ma D', 'Zhe N', 'Ren M', 'Chen B', 'He Z', 'Wang J', 'Zhong Q', 'Wang J']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Research Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Research Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Research Centre, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China; Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treat Centre of Guizhou Province, Guiyang 550004, China; Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.

Only 10% of HTLV-1 carries develop complications related to HTLV-1. HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is a chronic disabling inflammatory disease affecting the spinal cord. HAM/TSP produces principally weakness in the lower limbs and bladder disturbances, among other complications. In a previous study, our group identified three SNPs (rs3138053, rs2233406, and rs3138045) located in the promoter region of the NFKBIA gene associated with HAM/TSP. This study aimed to analyze the association between four Tag-SNPs (rs10148482, rs17103274, rs17103282, and rs762009) located in the upstream region of the NFKBIA gene and HAM/TSP, and to delimit the linkage disequilibrium zone in the upstream region of the NFBKIA gene associated with HAM/TSP. The tetra-primers ARMS-PCR technique was used to genotype 4 Tag-SNPs on 140 HAM/TSP patients and 258 asymptomatic carriers. The SNP rs17103282 showed a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p<.0001). Neither of three Tag-SNPs showed an association with HAM/TSP (P>.05). No linkage disequilibrium between four Tag-SNPs evaluated in this study and previous ones was observed.

How somatic cells restrict L1 activity and how this process becomes dysfunctional during aging and in cancer cells is poorly understood. L1s are enriched at lamin-associated domains, heterochromatic regions of the nuclear periphery. Whether this association is necessary for their repression has been elusive. Here we show that the sirtuin family member SIRT7 participates in the epigenetic transcriptional repression of L1 genome-wide in both mouse and human cells. SIRT7 depletion leads to increased L1 expression and retrotransposition. Mechanistically, we identify a novel interplay between SIRT7 and Lamin A/C in L1 repression. Our results demonstrate that SIRT7-mediated H3K18 deacetylation regulates L1 expression and promotes L1 association with elements of the nuclear lamina. The failure of such activity might contribute to the observed genome instability and compromised viability in SIRT7 knockout mice. Overall, our results reveal a novel function of SIRT7 on chromatin organization by mediating the anchoring of L1 to the nuclear envelope, and a new functional link of the nuclear lamina with transcriptional repression.","['Vazquez, Berta N', 'Thackray, Joshua K', 'Simonet, Nicolas G', 'Chahar, Sanjay', 'Kane-Goldsmith, Noriko', 'Newkirk, Simon J', 'Lee, Suman', 'Xing, Jinchuan', 'Verzi, Michael P', 'An, Wenfeng', 'Vaquero, Alejandro', 'Tischfield, Jay A', 'Serrano, Lourdes']","['Vazquez BN', 'Thackray JK', 'Simonet NG', 'Chahar S', 'Kane-Goldsmith N', 'Newkirk SJ', 'Lee S', 'Xing J', 'Verzi MP', 'An W', 'Vaquero A', 'Tischfield JA', 'Serrano L']",,"['Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Montpellier Institute of Molecular Genetics (IGMM), CNRS and the University of Montpellier, 34090, France.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy and Allied Health Professions, South Dakota State University, Brookings, SD 57007, USA.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Barcelona 08916, Spain.', 'Chromatin Biology Laboratory, Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona 08908, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.', 'Department of Genetics, Human Genetics Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (LMNA protein, human)', '0 (Lamin Type A)', '0 (SIRT7 protein, human)', '0 (Sirt7 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', '*Genome', 'Heterochromatin/chemistry/metabolism', 'Histones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lamin Type A/*genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/metabolism', '*Long Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'Nuclear Lamina/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Sirtuins/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Testis/cytology/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC6735864,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['5521784 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkz519 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2019 Sep 5;47(15):7870-7885. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkz519.,15,,,,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

These endpoints are often biologically related. This work is motivated by a study of bone marrow transplant (BMT) for leukemia patients, who may experience the acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), relapse of leukemia, and death after an allogeneic BMT. The acute GVHD is associated with the relapse free survival, and both the acute GVHD and relapse of leukemia are intermediate nonterminal events subject to dependent censoring by the informative terminal event death, but not vice versa, giving rise to survival data that are subject to two sets of semi-competing risks. It is important to assess the impacts of prognostic factors on these three time-to-event endpoints. We propose a novel statistical approach that jointly models such data via a pair of copulas to account for multiple dependence structures, while the marginal distribution of each endpoint is formulated by a Cox proportional hazards model. We develop an estimation procedure based on pseudo-likelihood and carry out simulation studies to examine the performance of the proposed method in finite samples.

This study was designed to develop a prediction model for leukemia-free survival (LFS) in a cohort of patients with de novo AML treated with ASCT during their first complete remission. METHODS: This was a registry study of 956 patients reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. The primary outcome was LFS. Multivariate Cox regression modeling with backward selection was used to select variables for the construction of the nomogram. The nomogram's performance was evaluated with discrimination (the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) and calibration. RESULTS: Age and cytogenetic risk (with or without FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication) were predictive of LFS and were used for the construction of the nomogram. Each factor in the nomogram was ascribed points according to its predictive weight. Through the calculation of the total score, the probability of LFS at 1, 3, and 5 years for each patient could be estimated. The discrimination of the nomogram, measured as the AUC, was 0.632 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.595-0.669), 0.670 (95% CI, 0.635-0.705), and 0.687 (95% CI, 0.650-0.724), respectively. Further validation with bootstrapping showed similar AUCs (0.629 [95% CI, 0.597-0.657], 0.667 [95% CI, 0.633-0.699], and 0.679 [95% CI, 0.647-0.712], respectively), and this suggested that the model was not overfitted. Calibration was excellent. Patients were stratified into 4 incremental 5-year prognostic groups, with the probabilities of LFS and overall survival ranging from 25% to 64% and from 33% to 79%, respectively.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (allo-HSCT) is the only potentially curative treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, most patients relapse after allo-HSCT and treatment options are limited. Craddock et al. reported recently in the Journal of Clinical Oncology results from a small phase Ib study combining azacitidine (AZA) and lenalidomide (LEN) for treatment of 29 patients (24 AML and 5 MDS patients) who relapsed after allo-HSCT. Overall response rate was 24%. Patients who received >/=3 cycles of treatment had a higher response rate and responders had a better survival compared to non-responders (27 months vs. 10 months; p = 0.004). Combination treatment was well tolerated with three cases of graft-versus-host disease. While this study suggests a potential synergistic effect of LEN + AZA combination therapy, many questions remain. Efficacy and safety should be confirmed in larger, ideally randomized, studies. Further research on mechanism of action of this combination, comparison with other treatment combinations (e.g. AZA + venetoclax) and use during other disease stages are needed.","['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Stahl, Maximilian', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Stahl M', 'Zeidan AM']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902'],"['a Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'b Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'c Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research (COPPER) Center, Yale University , New Haven , CT , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190626,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD223 antigen)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1635005 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Aug;12(8):575-578. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1635005.

Improvements in our understanding of how tumour cells respond to DNA damage, and especially how this response differs from that of normal cells, are crucial to the development of better and more efficient therapies. We have recently shown that the activity of the oncogenic transcription factor GFI1, which is required for the development and maintenance of T and B cell leukemia, increases the ability of tumour cells to repair their DNA following damage (Vadnais et al. Nat Commun 9(1):1418). GFI1 accomplishes this by regulating the post-translational modifications (PTM) of key DNA repair proteins, including MRE11 and 53BP1, by the methyltransferase PRMT1. Here, GFI1 acts as an accessory protein required for the interaction between the enzyme and its substrates. This has implications for the treatment response of tumour cells overexpressing GFI1, which includes T cell leukemia, neuroendocrine lung carcinomas and aggressive subtypes of medulloblastoma, and suggests that targeting GFI1's activity and with this its capacity to aid DNA repair may open avenues for new therapeutic approaches.","['Vadnais, Charles', 'Moroy, Tarik']","['Vadnais C', 'Moroy T']",,"['Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Departement de microbiologie, infectiologie et immunologie, Universite de Montreal.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20180724,Austria,Cell Stress,Cell stress,101718867,,,,PMC6551627,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/06/22 06:01,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.15698/cst2018.07.149 [doi]', 'CST0178E136 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Stress. 2018 Jul 24;2(8):213-215. doi: 10.15698/cst2018.07.149.,8,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['53BP1', 'Cytarabine', 'DNA damage response', 'DNA repair', 'GFI1', 'MRE11', 'PRMT1', 'tumour therapy']",['Conflict of interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,['Nat Commun. 2018 Apr 12;9(1):1418.

The inhibition of TET enzymes by D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG), which is produced by mutant IDH1/2 (mIDH1/2), has been suggested to promote epigenetic deregulation during tumorigenesis. In addition, mIDH also induces a differentiation block in various cell culture and mouse models. Here we analyze the genomic methylation patterns of AML patients with mIDH using Infinium 450K data from a large AML cohort and found that mIDH is associated with pronounced DNA hypermethylation at tens of thousands of CpGs. Interestingly, however, myeloid leukemia cells overexpressing mIDH, cells that were cultured in the presence of D-2-HG or TET2 mutant AML patients did not show similar methylation changes. In further analyses, we also characterized the methylation landscapes of myeloid progenitor cells and analyzed their relationship to mIDH-associated hypermethylation. Our findings identify the differentiation state of myeloid cells, rather than inhibition of TET-mediated DNA demethylation, as a major factor of mIDH-associated hypermethylation in AML. Furthermore, our results are also important for understanding the mode of action of currently developed mIDH inhibitors.","['Wiehle, Laura', 'Raddatz, Gunter', 'Pusch, Stefan', 'Gutekunst, Julian', 'von Deimling, Andreas', 'Rodriguez-Paredes, Manuel', 'Lyko, Frank']","['Wiehle L', 'Raddatz G', 'Pusch S', 'Gutekunst J', 'von Deimling A', 'Rodriguez-Paredes M', 'Lyko F']",,"['Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center; 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center; 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Consortium of Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center; 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Consortium of Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Clinical Cooperation Unit Neuropathology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, Ruprecht-Karls-University Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center; 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Epigenetics, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center; 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170920,Austria,Cell Stress,Cell stress,101718867,,,,PMC6551656,2017/09/20 00:00,2017/09/20 00:01,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/09/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/20 00:01 [medline]']","['10.15698/cst2017.10.106 [doi]', 'CST0177E125 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Stress. 2017 Sep 20;1(1):55-67. doi: 10.15698/cst2017.10.106.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'D-2-hydroxyglutarate', 'DNA methylation', 'TET enzymes', 'differentiation', 'mIDH']",['Conflict of interest: The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Chromothripsis leads to complex structural variants (cSVs) causing aberrant gene expression and the formation of de novo fusion genes, which can trigger cancer development, or worsen its clinical course. The functional impact of cSVs can be studied at the RNA level using whole transcriptome sequencing (total RNA-Seq). It represents a powerful tool for discovering, profiling, and quantifying changes of gene expression in the overall genomic context. However, bioinformatic analysis of transcriptomic data, especially in cases with cSVs, is a complex and challenging task, and the development of proper bioinformatic tools for transcriptome studies is necessary. Methods: We designed a bioinformatic workflow for the analysis of total RNA-Seq data consisting of two separate parts (pipelines): The first pipeline incorporates a statistical solution for differential gene expression analysis in a biologically heterogeneous sample set. We utilized results from transcriptomic arrays which were carried out in parallel to increase the precision of the analysis. The second pipeline is used for the identification of de novo fusion genes. Special attention was given to the filtering of false positives (FPs), which was achieved through consensus fusion calling with several fusion gene callers. We applied the workflow to the data obtained from ten patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) to describe the consequences of their cSVs in detail. The fusion genes identified by our pipeline were correlated with genomic break-points detected by genomic arrays. Results: We set up a novel solution for differential gene expression analysis of individual samples and de novo fusion gene detection from total RNA-Seq data. The results of the differential gene expression analysis were concordant with results obtained by transcriptomic arrays, which demonstrates the analytical capabilities of our method. We also showed that the consensus fusion gene detection approach was able to identify true positives (TPs) efficiently. Detected coordinates of fusion gene junctions were in concordance with genomic breakpoints assessed using genomic arrays. Discussion: Byapplying our methods to real clinical samples, we proved that our approach for total RNA-Seq data analysis generates results consistent with other genomic analytical techniques. The data obtained by our analyses provided clues for the study of the biological consequences of cSVs with far-reaching implications for clinical outcome and management of cancer patients. The bioinformatic workflow is also widely applicable for addressing other research questions in different contexts, for which transcriptomic data are generated.","['Hynst, Jakub', 'Plevova, Karla', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Bystry, Vojtech', 'Pal, Karol', 'Pospisilova, Sarka']","['Hynst J', 'Plevova K', 'Radova L', 'Bystry V', 'Pal K', 'Pospisilova S']",,"['Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190612,United States,PeerJ,PeerJ,101603425,,,,PMC6571010,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/06/22 06:01,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.7717/peerj.7071 [doi]', '7071 [pii]']",epublish,PeerJ. 2019 Jun 12;7:e7071. doi: 10.7717/peerj.7071. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bioinformatic pipeline', 'Chromothripsis', 'Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Complex structural variants', 'Fusion gene', 'Gene expression', 'Leukemia', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'Statistics', 'Transcriptomics']",['The authors declare there are no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

Thus, our findings suggest that the TCR Vbeta21 T cell clone found in CML patients might be a T cell clone that specifically recognizes WT1.","['Zhang, Yikai', 'Xu, Ling', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Zha, Xianfeng', 'Wei, Wei', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zhang Y', 'Xu L', 'Chen S', 'Zha X', 'Wei W', 'Li Y']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6851-6260', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0974-4036']","[""1Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, 601 Huang Pu Da Dao Xi, 510632 Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1790 3548grid.258164.c"", '2Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.0000 0004 1760 3828grid.412601.0', ""1Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, 601 Huang Pu Da Dao Xi, 510632 Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1790 3548grid.258164.c"", '2Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.0000 0004 1760 3828grid.412601.0', ""1Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, 601 Huang Pu Da Dao Xi, 510632 Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1790 3548grid.258164.c"", '3Department of Clinical Laboratory, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, 510632 China.0000 0004 1760 3828grid.412601.0', '4Guangzhou Municipality Tianhe Nuoya Bio-engineering Co.

Cutaneous biopsy showed lobular hypodermitis with polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltrations. The diagnosis of Weber Christian's disease was retained after eliminating other differential diagnoses. The patient was treated with prednisone with good outcome; during the follow-up period and during disease regression the diagnosis of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia was made; this uncommon outcome has never been described in the literature. The aim of this study is to discuss any similar situation where another diagnosis was made in patients initially treated for idiopathic lobular panniculitis.

Over expression of a range of ATP-dependent efflux pumps, particularly ABCB1 is a widely reported mechanism of cancer cell MDR. Approximately 30% acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients demonstrate ABCB1 over expression. Several mechanisms for up regulation of ABCB1 have been proposed. Our aim was to investigate the role of genomic amplification of the chromosome 7 region with regard to its influence on ABCB1 over expression in AML cell line. For this, we developed Doxorubicin (Dox) resistant leukemic cell line from K562 cells, demonstrating MDR phenotype. The chromosomal changes associated with the acquisition of MDR were characterized by array- based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with the parental K562 cell line as the reference genome. Significant genomic gains in the chromosomal region corresponding to 7q11.21-7q22.1 were observed in Dox selected cell line. Moreover, the amplicon contains the ABCB1 gene locus at 7q21.1 with a copy number gain of >4. ABCB1 mRNA was found to be up-regulated by54-fold. Our results demonstrate that the development of MDR in K562/Dox is underlined by a genomic amplification of the chromosome 7 region harboring the ABCB1 gene.","['Ibrahim, Sara M', 'Karim, Sajjad', 'Abusamra, Heba', 'Pushparaj, Peter N', 'Khan, Jalaluddin A', 'Abuzenadah, Adel M', 'Gari, Mamdooh A', 'Bakhashab, Sherin', 'Ahmed, Farid', 'Al-Qahtani, Mohammed H']","['Ibrahim SM', 'Karim S', 'Abusamra H', 'Pushparaj PN', 'Khan JA', 'Abuzenadah AM', 'Gari MA', 'Bakhashab S', 'Ahmed F', 'Al-Qahtani MH']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, King Abdulaziz University, P.O.

OBJECTIVE: Investigate the antitumor activity and their likely mechanisms of action of a series of N-substituted 2-(5-nitro-thiophene)-thiosemicarbazone derivatives. METHODS: Methods were performed in vitro (cytotoxicity, cell cycle progression, morphological analysis, mitochondrial membrane potential evaluation and topoisomerase assay), spectroscopic (DNA interaction studies), and in silico studies (docking and molecular modelling). RESULTS: Most of the compounds presented significant inhibitory activity; the NCIH-292 cell line was the most resistant, and the HL-60 cell line was the most sensitive. The most promising compound was LNN-05 with IC50 values ranging from 0.5 to 1.9 microg.mL-1. The in vitro studies revealed that LNN-05 was able to depolarize (dose-dependently) the mitochondrial membrane, induceG1 phase cell cycle arrest noticeably, promote morphological cell changes associated with apoptosis in chronic human myelocytic leukaemia (K-562) cells, and presented no topoisomerase II inhibition. Spectroscopic UV-vis and molecular fluorescence studies showed that LNN compounds interact with ctDNA forming supramolecular complexes. Intercalation between nitrogenous bases was revealed through KI quenching and competitive ethidium bromide assays. Docking and Molecular Dynamics suggested that 5-nitro-thiophene-thiosemicarbazone compounds interact against the larger DNA groove, and corroborating the spectroscopic results, may assume an intercalating interaction mode. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight 5-nitro-thiophene-thiosemicarbazone derivatives, especially LNN-05, as a promising new class of compounds for further studies to provide new anticancer therapies.","['Roque Marques, Karla Mirella', 'do Desterro, Maria Rodrigues', 'de Arruda, Sandrine Maria', 'de Araujo Neto, Luiz Nascimento', 'do Carmo Alves de Lima, Maria', 'de Almeida, Sinara Monica Vitalino', 'da Silva, Edjan Carlos Dantas', 'de Aquino, Thiago Mendonca', 'da Silva-Junior, Edeildo Ferreira', 'de Araujo-Junior, Joao Xavier', 'de M Silva, Marina', 'de A Dantas, Maria Dayanne', 'Santos, Josue Carinhanha C', 'Figueiredo, Isis M', 'Bazin, Marc-Antoine', 'Marchand, Pascal', 'da Silva, Teresinha Goncalves', 'Mendonca Junior, Francisco Jaime Bezerra']","['Roque Marques KM', 'do Desterro MR', 'de Arruda SM', 'de Araujo Neto LN', 'do Carmo Alves de Lima M', 'de Almeida SMV', 'da Silva ECD', 'de Aquino TM', 'da Silva-Junior EF', 'de Araujo-Junior JX', 'de M Silva M', 'de A Dantas MD', 'Santos JCC', 'Figueiredo IM', 'Bazin MA', 'Marchand P', 'da Silva TG', 'Mendonca Junior FJB']",,"['Bioactive Products Prospecting Laboratory, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil.', 'Bioactive Products Prospecting Laboratory, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil.', 'Bioactive Products Prospecting Laboratory, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry and Therapeutic Innovation, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Chemistry and Therapeutic Innovation, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Pernambuco, Garanhuns-PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, Nursing and Pharmacy School, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Development and Instrumentation in Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Development and Instrumentation in Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Development and Instrumentation in Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Development and Instrumentation in Analytical Chemistry, Institute of Chemistry and Biotechnology, Federal University of Alagoas, Maceio-AL, Brazil.', 'Universite de Nantes, Cibles et medicaments des infections et du cancer, IICiMed, EA1155, F-44000 Nantes, France.', 'Universite de Nantes, Cibles et medicaments des infections et du cancer, IICiMed, EA1155, F-44000 Nantes, France.', 'Bioactive Products Prospecting Laboratory, Department of Antibiotics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife-PE, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Synthesis and Drug Delivery, Department of Biological Sciences, State University of Paraiba, Joao Pessoa-PB, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Top Med Chem,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitro Compounds)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nitro Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiophenes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thiosemicarbazones/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['CTMC-EPUB-99151 [pii]', '10.2174/1568026619666190621120304 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Med Chem. 2019;19(13):1075-1091. doi: 10.2174/1568026619666190621120304.,13,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers;

RESULTS: Ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two observational studies were included, which involved 754 AL patients with CIT. Pooled analysis demonstrated that rhIL-11 was beneficial on CIT: recovery time of platelet count to 50 x 10(9) /L [weight mean difference (WMD) = -4.19 days; 95% CI: -5.01, -3.37], recovery time of platelet count to 100 x 10(9) /L (WMD = -4.45 days; 95% CI: -4.85, -4.06), platelet transfusion volume (WMD = -6.14 U; 95% CI: -9.20, -3.09), and the rate of haemorrhage (RR = 0.46; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.61).

This study was performed to investigate whether 14-3-3zeta is implicated in senescence evasion of Hep-2 laryngeal cancer cells. METHODS: The expression of 14-3-3zeta was suppressed using RNA interference strategy. Senescence induction was determined by senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and the numbers of promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear body. Real-time PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry were applied for the expression of corresponding proteins. Xenograft experiment was performed to show in vivo effect of 14-3-3zeta silencing on tumour growth. RESULTS: 14-3-3zeta silencing significantly induced senescence phenotypes via 27 accumulations. Subsequently, we demonstrated that p27 accumulation is linked to inactivation of SCF(Skp2) complex activity, probably due to the deneddylation of cullin-1 (Cul-1) as follows. (a) Neddylated Cul-1 is decreased by 14-3-3zeta silencing. (b) Blocking neddylation using MLN4924 reproduces senescence phenotypes. (c) Knockdown of CSN5, which functions as a deneddylase, was shown to restore the senescence phenotypes induced by 14-3-3zeta depletion. Finally, we demonstrated that 14-3-3zeta depletion effectively hindered the proliferation of Hep-2 cells implanted into nude mice. CONCLUSION: 14-3-3zeta negatively regulates senescence in Hep-2 cells, suggesting that 14-3-3zeta targeting may serve to suppress the expansion of laryngeal cancer via induction of senescence through the Cul-1/SCF(Skp2) /p27 axis.","['Seo, Sung Bin', 'Baek, Ji-Ye', 'Lim, Ji-Hee', 'Jin, Xuyan', 'Lee, Mun-Yong', 'Lee, Jeong-Hwa']","['Seo SB', 'Baek JY', 'Lim JH', 'Jin X', 'Lee MY', 'Lee JH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5970-194X'],"['Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, Graduate School, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, Graduate School, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Division of Nephrology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, Graduate School, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biochemistry, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Institute of Aging and Metabolic Diseases, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Health Sciences, Graduate School, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190621,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (Cullin 1)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins)', '0 (SKP1 protein, human)', '0 (SKP2 protein, human)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.-.- (COPS5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Cullin Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Peptide Hydrolases/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6797561,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cpr.12654 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2019 Sep;52(5):e12654. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12654.

We used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Cell Counting Kit-8 assay to detect the level of miR-33b and cell viability. Cell apoptosis and the expression of eIF5A-2 and MCL-1 protein were detected by flow cytometry analysis and Western Blot analysis, respectively. MiR-33b mimic increased sensitivity of AML cells against DNR, while miR-33b inhibitor had the opposite effect. Furthermore, the results showed that the eIF5A-2 gene was a direct target of miR-33b, and miR-33b regulated eIF5A-2 mRNA and protein expression. Silencing of eIF5A-2 by RNA interference increased the sensitivity of AML cells against DNR. We also found that MCL-1 contributed to the regulation of DNR sensitivity, which was dependent on downregulation of eIF5A-2. Finally, knockdown of eIF5A-2 eliminated the effects of miRNA-33b mimic or inhibitor on DNR sensitivity. These findings indicate that miR-33b maybe as a new therapeutic target in AML cells.","['Liu, Yanhui', 'Lei, Pingchong', 'Qiao, Hong', 'Sun, Kai', 'Lu, Xiling', 'Bao, Fengchang', 'Yu, Runhong', 'Lian, Cheng', 'Li, Yao', 'Chen, Wei', 'Xue, Fei']","['Liu Y', 'Lei P', 'Qiao H', 'Sun K', 'Lu X', 'Bao F', 'Yu R', 'Lian C', 'Li Y', 'Chen W', 'Xue F']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0399-6216'],"[""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", 'The Department of Oncology, Baoying Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China."", 'Cancer Institute of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Zhejiang Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.', ""Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, Zhengzhou University People's Hospital, Zhengzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190621,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN33b microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",,2019/06/22 06:00,2021/02/24 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29192 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Jan;121(1):385-393. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29192.

We hypothesized that the mode of PD correlates with clinical outcomes. Data from three phase III trials of the German CLL Study Group (GCLLSG) (CLL8, CLL10, CLL11) including a total of 2159 patients receiving first line (immuno)-chemotherapy (FCR, FC, CLB, CLB-R, CLB-Ob) were analyzed. Patients were categorized as ""ALC"" if PD was due to increasing absolute lymphocyte count, or as ""Ly"" if due to lymphadenopathy. A group of 241 patients progressed with ALC, and 727 progressed with Ly, including 329 who progressed on both modalities. In fit patients, median TTNT after PD in the Ly group was 12.3 months vs 17.0 months in the ALC group (HR 1.299 [1.036-1.628]; P = .024). Median OS after PD was 45.1 months in the Ly group and 42.4 months in the ALC group (HR=1.023 [0.753-1.389]; P = .885). For unfit patients, median TTNT in the Ly group was 11.7 months vs 21.4 months in the ALC group (HR 1.357 [1.051-1.753]; P = .019). Median OS was 42.8 months in the Ly group and not reached in the ALC group (HR 1.851 [1.280-2.677]; P = .001). Patients in the Ly group more frequently showed impairment of quality of life (QoL). This analysis demonstrates that patients with progressive lymphadenopathy have a significantly shorter TTNT, OS and less favorable QoL.

Both types of iPSCs fulfilled the quality criteria. Mutated iPSC colonies generated significantly more CD34(+) and CD34(+) CD45(+) cells compared to non-mutated iPSC colonies in a culture coated with irradiated AGM-S3 cells to which four growth factors were added sequentially or simultaneously. The haematopoietic differentiation potential of non-mutated JMML iPSC colonies was similar to or lower than that of iPSC colonies from a healthy individual. The PTPN11 mutation coexisted with the OSBP2 c.389C>T mutation. Zinc-finger nuclease-mediated homologous recombination revealed that correction of PTPN11 mutation in iPSCs with PTPN11 and OSBP2 mutations resulted in reduced CD34(+) cell generation to a level similar to that obtained with JMML iPSC colonies with the wild-type of both genes, and interestingly, to that obtained with normal iPSC colonies. Transduction of the PTPN11 mutation into JMML iPSCs with the wild-type of both genes increased CD34(+) cell production to a level comparable to that obtained with JMML iPSC colonies harbouring the two genetic mutations. Thus, PTPN11 mutation may be the most essential abnormality to confer an aberrant haematopoietic differentiation potential in this disorder.","['Shigemura, Tomonari', 'Matsuda, Kazuyuki', 'Kurata, Takashi', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Okuno, Yusuke', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Yue, Fengming', 'Ebihara, Yasuhiro', 'Tsuji, Kohichiro', 'Sasaki, Katsunori', 'Nakahata, Tatsutoshi', 'Nakazawa, Yozo', 'Koike, Kenichi']","['Shigemura T', 'Matsuda K', 'Kurata T', 'Sakashita K', 'Okuno Y', 'Muramatsu H', 'Yue F', 'Ebihara Y', 'Tsuji K', 'Sasaki K', 'Nakahata T', 'Nakazawa Y', 'Koike K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8077-2526', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9883-6986']","['Department of Paediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Health and Medical Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Shinshu University, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', ""Department of Haematology/Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Azumino, Japan."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Organ Technology, Institute of Organ Transplants, Reconstructive Medicine and Tissue Engineering, Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, International Medical Centre, Saitama Medical University, Hidaka, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Komoro Kogen Hospital, Komoro, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Organ Technology, Institute of Organ Transplants, Reconstructive Medicine and Tissue Engineering, Shinshu University Graduate School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Application, Centre for iPS Cell Research and Application (CiRA), Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Minami Nagano Medical Centre, Shinonoi General Hospital, Nagano, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190620,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (oxysterol binding protein)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', '*Point Mutation', '*Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/genetics/metabolism']",,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/06/10 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16060 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Oct;187(2):163-173. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16060.

In this study, we examined whether inhibition of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL enhances the biological effects of the repurposed CUSP9 regimen in an in vitro setting of glioblastoma. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We applied 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays to assess cellular proliferation. Annexin V/propidium iodide and tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester staining were used to examine apoptosis. Western blotting, RT-PCR, and specific knockdown experiments using siRNA were employed to examine molecular mechanisms of action. KEY RESULTS: Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition exerted synergistic anti-proliferative effects across established, primary cultured, and stem-like glioblastoma cells when combined with CUSP9 which had been reduced to only one tenth of its proposed original concentration (CUSP9-LD). The combination treatment also led to enhanced apoptosis with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases. On the molecular level, CUSP9-LD counteracted ABT263-mediated up-regulation of Mcl-1. Silencing of Mcl-1 enhanced ABT263-mediated apoptosis which indicates that down-regulation of Mcl-1 is crucial for the induction of cell death by the combination treatment. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: These data suggest that Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition enhances the susceptibility of glioblastoma cells towards CUSP9, allowing dramatic dose reduction and potentially decreased toxicity when applied clinically. A clinical trial involving the original CUSP doses (CUSP9v3) is currently ongoing in our institution (NCT02770378). The Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT263 is in clinical trials and might represent a valuable adjunct to the original CUSP.","['Halatsch, Marc-Eric', 'Kast, Richard Eric', 'Dwucet, Annika', 'Hlavac, Michal', 'Heiland, Tim', 'Westhoff, Mike-Andrew', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Wirtz, Christian Rainer', 'Siegelin, Markus David', 'Karpel-Massler, Georg']","['Halatsch ME', 'Kast RE', 'Dwucet A', 'Hlavac M', 'Heiland T', 'Westhoff MA', 'Debatin KM', 'Wirtz CR', 'Siegelin MD', 'Karpel-Massler G']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8236-5369'],"['Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'IIAIGC Study Center, Burlington, VT, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190730,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC6715605,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bph.14773 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2019 Sep;176(18):3681-3694. doi: 10.1111/bph.14773.

Claims data were used to identify adult patients with AML diagnoses from 1 January 2008 to 31 March 2016 in the USA. Patients were considered R/R if they had an AML relapse ICD-9 code (205.02) or a line of therapy consistent with R/R disease. The final R/R sample (N = 707) included 476 patients with and 231 patients without HSCT. The mean total episode cost (from relapse date to death or end of study period) for all patients was $439,104 (with HSCT $524,595 and without HSCT $263,310). Inpatient visits accounted for the greatest cost component (mean $308,978) followed by intensive care unit stays (mean $221,537), non-clinician (e.g., lab tests) visits (mean $30,909), and outpatient pharmacy utilization (mean $24,640). Patients with HSCT appeared to have longer episodes of care compared with patients without HSCT (16.8 vs 11.1 months), perhaps reflecting longer survival for HSCT patients. Mean number of visits within each category and their associated costs appeared to be higher in patients with HSCT compared with patients without HSCT. Patients with HSCT appeared to experience more SxTox compared with patients without HSCT across all categories. Results of the current study suggest that there is a substantial HRU and cost burden on R/R AML patients in the USA receiving active treatments. More effective therapies with improved tolerability would meet this tremendous unmet need in the R/R AML population.Funding: Astellas Pharma, Inc.","['Pandya, Bhavik J', 'Chen, Chi-Chang', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'McGuiness, Catherine B', 'Wilson, Samuel', 'Horvath Walsh, L Elise', 'Wade, Rolin L']","['Pandya BJ', 'Chen CC', 'Medeiros BC', 'McGuiness CB', 'Wilson S', 'Horvath Walsh LE', 'Wade RL']",,"['Health Economics and Outcomes Research - Oncology, Medical Affairs Americas, Astellas Pharma, Inc., Northbrook, IL, USA.

With the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, significant progress has been made in unraveling the AML genome and understanding leukemogenesis driven by recurrent mutations in signaling and kinase pathways, DNA methylation, and spliceosome complex genes. We are now poised to see our research-based advances translate clinically into the treatment of patients with AML.

Neutrophil count grew most significantly after reduction of exposure dose rate to red bone marrow (RBM) to </=0.1 Gy, which was typical both for CML and AL. An increase of a relative neutrophil count remained in the CML latency period along with relative lymphocytopenia. Peculiarities of PBCC among individuals with AL at a later date were 'rejuvenation' of neutrophils in the period of maximum exposure and in leukemia latency period. During haematopoiesis restoration period, high mean values of mature neutrophils were detected in the majority of exposed individuals with AL together with decreased lymphocyte and eosinophil count.

These mutations promote hypermethylation, yet it is only a favorable prognostic marker in glioma, for reasons that are unclear. We hypothesized that the patterns of DNA methylation, and transcriptome profiles, would vary among IDH(mut) cancers, especially gliomas. Using Illumina 450K and RNA-Seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we show that of 365,092 analyzed CpG sites, 70,591 (19%) were hypermethylated in IDH(mut) gliomas compared to wild-type (IDH(wt)) gliomas, and only 3%, 2%, and 4% of CpG sites were hypermethylated in IDH(mut) AML, melanoma, and cholangiocarcinoma, relative to each of their IDH(wt) counterparts. Transcriptome differences showed pro-malignant genes that appear to be unique to IDH(mut) gliomas. However, genes involved in differentiation and immune response were suppressed in all IDH(mut) cancers. Additionally, IDH(mut) caused a greater degree of hypermethylation in undifferentiated neural progenitor cells than in mature astrocytes. These data suggest that the extent and targets of IDH(mut)-induced genomic hypermethylation vary greatly according to the cellular context and may help explain why IDH(mut) is only a favorable prognostic marker in gliomas.","['Unruh, Dusten', 'Zewde, Makda', 'Buss, Adam', 'Drumm, Michael R', 'Tran, Anh N', 'Scholtens, Denise M', 'Horbinski, Craig']","['Unruh D', 'Zewde M', 'Buss A', 'Drumm MR', 'Tran AN', 'Scholtens DM', 'Horbinski C']",,"['Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA.', 'Department of Neurological Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. craig.horbinski@northwestern.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA. craig.horbinski@northwestern.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190620,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,['EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Glioma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Transcriptome']",PMC6586617,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-45346-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-45346-1 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jun 20;9(1):8946. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-45346-1.,1,"['K08 CA155764/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA216996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS102669/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001422/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA221747/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular insights into this process are lacking and it is unknown whether stable non-genetic resistance can be overcome. Using single cell RNA-sequencing of paired drug naive and resistant AML patient samples and cellular barcoding in a unique mouse model of non-genetic resistance, here we demonstrate that transcriptional plasticity drives stable epigenetic resistance. With a CRISPR-Cas9 screen we identify regulators of enhancer function as important modulators of the resistant cell state. We show that inhibition of Lsd1 (Kdm1a) is able to overcome stable epigenetic resistance by facilitating the binding of the pioneer factor, Pu.1 and cofactor, Irf8, to nucleate new enhancers that regulate the expression of key survival genes. This enhancer switching results in the re-distribution of transcriptional co-activators, including Brd4, and provides the opportunity to disable their activity and overcome epigenetic resistance. Together these findings highlight key principles to help counteract non-genetic drug resistance.","['Bell, Charles C', 'Fennell, Katie A', 'Chan, Yih-Chih', 'Rambow, Florian', 'Yeung, Miriam M',

The cancer genome atlas (TCGA) project identified 299 genes and 24 pathways/biological processes that drive tumor progression (Cell 173: 371-385 e318, 2018). Of the 299 driver genes, 12 genes are involved in histones, histone methylation, and demethylation (Table 1). Among these 12 genes, those encoding the histone demethylases JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A were identified as cancer driver genes. Furthermore, gain-of-function mutations in genes encoding metabolic enzymes, such as isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDH)1/2, drive tumor progression by producing an oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG), which is a competitive inhibitor of alpha-ketoglutarate, O2-dependent dioxygenases such as Jumonji domain-containing histone demethylases, and DNA demethylases. Studies on oncometabolites suggest that histone demethylases mediate metabolic changes in chromatin structure. We have reviewed the most recent findings regarding cancer-specific metabolic reprogramming and the tumor-suppressive roles of JARID1C/KDM5C and UTX/KDM6A. We have also discussed mutations in other isoforms such as the JARID1A, 1B, 1D of KDM5 subfamilies and the JMJD3/KDM6B of KDM6 subfamilies, which play opposing roles in tumor progression as oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the cancer cell type.

In this study, we report the outcomes of using unmanipulated haploidentical allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (haplo-PBSCT) as post-remission therapy for patients with high-risk or intermediate-risk AML in CR1. MATERIAL AND METHODS From January 2008 to July 2016, 33 patients diagnosed as high-risk or intermediate-risk AML in CR1 undergoing haplo-PBSCT in our institution were enrolled for analysis. The cumulative incidence of platelet and neutrophil recovery, the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD, relapse and non-relapse mortality were assessed. Patients' survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS The cumulative incidence of grade 2-4 acute GVHD, overall and extensive chronic GVHD was 18.2%, 9.1%, and 6.1%, respectively. 2-year probability of relapse was 9.1%. Disease-free survival and overall survival at 2 years were 72.7% and 75.8%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our results showed that unmanipulated haploidentical transplantation with G-CSF primed PBSC alone as a graft source could be an acceptable alternative post-remission treatment for high-risk or intermediate-risk AML patients in CR1 lacking a matched donor.","['Luo, Lan', 'Fang, Shu', 'Zhao, Shasha', 'Li, Fei', 'Zhou, Yu', 'Guan, Lixun', 'Yang, Nan', 'Gu, Zhenyang', 'Lin, Tao', 'Wang, Feiyan', 'Zhu, Chengying', 'Huang, Wenrong', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Gao, Chunji']","['Luo L', 'Fang S', 'Zhao S', 'Li F', 'Zhou Y', 'Guan L', 'Yang N', 'Gu Z', 'Lin T', 'Wang F', 'Zhu C', 'Huang W', 'Liu D', 'Gao C']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", 'Cancer Center, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, Hainan, China (mainland).', ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190621,United States,Ann Transplant,Annals of transplantation,9802544,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC6599420,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/01/17 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['915182 [pii]', '10.12659/AOT.915182 [doi]']",epublish,Ann Transplant. 2019 Jun 21;24:367-373. doi: 10.12659/AOT.915182.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the molecular basis underlying the development of these leukemias remains poorly understood, increasing evidence implicates the interaction of etoposide metabolites [i.e., etoposide quinone (EQ)] with topoisomerase II enzymes. However, effects of etoposide quinone on other cellular targets could also be at play. We investigated whether T-cell protein tyrosine phosphatase (TCPTP), a protein tyrosine phosphatase that plays a key role in normal and malignant hematopoiesis through regulation of Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling, could be a target of EQ. We report here that EQ is an irreversible inhibitor of TCPTP phosphatase (IC50 = approximately 7 muM, second-order rate inhibition constant of approximately 810 M(-1)min(-1)). No inhibition was observed with the parent drug. The inhibition by EQ was found to be due to the formation of a covalent adduct at the catalytic cysteine residue in the active site of TCPTP. Exposure of human hematopoietic cells (HL60 and Jurkat) to EQ led to inhibition of endogenous TCPTP and concomitant increase in STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Our results suggest that in addition to alteration of topoisomerase II functions, EQ could also contribute to etoposide-dependent leukemogenesis through impairment of key hematopoietic signaling enzymes, such as TCPTP.","['Nian, Qing', 'Berthelet, Jeremy', 'Zhang, Wenchao', 'Bui, Linh-Chi', 'Liu, Rongxing', 'Xu, Ximing', 'Duval, Romain', 'Ganesan, Saravanan', 'Leger, Thibaut', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Busi, Florent', 'Guidez, Fabien', 'Dupret, Jean-Marie', 'Rodrigues Lima, Fernando']","['Nian Q', 'Berthelet J', 'Zhang W', 'Bui LC', 'Liu R', 'Xu X', 'Duval R', 'Ganesan S', 'Leger T', 'Chomienne C', 'Busi F', 'Guidez F', 'Dupret JM', 'Rodrigues Lima F']",,"['Universite de Paris, BFA, UMR 8251, CNRS, Paris, France (Q.N., J.B., W.Z., L.-C.B., R.L., F.B., J.-M.D., F.R.L.);

Here, we propose that curative outcomes may, nevertheless, be achieved by sequencing therapies that are individually effective but noncurative. Basic principles for such an approach are derived from the eco-evolutionary dynamics of background extinctions in which a ""first strike"" reduces the size and heterogeneity of the population. When followed immediately by demographic and ecological ""second strikes,"" the population can be reduced below some minimum threshold, leading inevitably to extinction. This strategy bears strong similarity to the empirically-derived curative therapy in childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia.","['Gatenby, Robert A', 'Zhang, Jingsong', 'Brown, Joel S']","['Gatenby RA', 'Zhang J', 'Brown JS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1621-1510'],"['Cancer Biology and Evolution Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida. robert.gatenby@moffitt.org.', 'Department of Diagnostic Imaging and Interventional Radiology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of GU Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Cancer Biology and Evolution Program, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Department of Integrated Mathematical Oncology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190620,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', '*Salvage Therapy']",PMC6606376,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-19-0807 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0807 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 1;79(13):3174-3177. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0807.

Scores vary in their features and in the composition of development cohorts. We sought to externally validate and compare the performance of 8 commonly applied scoring systems on a cohort of allo-HSCT recipients. Among 528 patients studied, acute myeloid leukemia was the leading transplant indication (44%) and 46% of patients had a matched sibling donor. Most models successfully grouped patients into higher and lower risk strata, supporting their use for risk classification. However, discrimination varied (2-year overall survival area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: revised Pretransplantation Assessment of Mortality [rPAM], 0.64; PAM, 0.63; revised Disease Risk Index [rDRI], 0.62; Endothelial Activation and Stress Index [EASIx], 0.60; combined European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [EBMT]/Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-specific Comorbidity Index [HCT-CI], 0.58; EBMT, 0.58; Comorbidity-Age, 0.58; HCT-CI, 0.55); AUC ranges from 0.5 (random) to 1.0 (perfect prediction). rPAM and PAM, which had the greatest predictive capacity across all outcomes, are comprehensive models including patient, disease, and transplantation information. Interestingly, EASIx, a biomarker-driven model, had comparable performance for nonrelapse mortality (NRM; 2-year AUC, 0.65) but no predictive value for relapse (2-year AUC, 0.53). Overall, allo-HSCT prognostic systems may be useful for risk stratification, but individual prediction remains a challenge, as reflected by the scores' limited discriminative capacity.","['Shouval, Roni', 'Fein, Joshua A', 'Shouval, Aniela', 'Danylesko, Ivetta', 'Shem-Tov, Noga', 'Zlotnik, Maya', 'Yerushalmi, Ronit', 'Shimoni, Avichai', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Shouval R', 'Fein JA', 'Shouval A', 'Danylesko I', 'Shem-Tov N', 'Zlotnik M', 'Yerushalmi R', 'Shimoni A', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9827-8032', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5441-1516', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0627-5502']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Dr Pinchas Bornstein Talpiot Medical Leadership Program, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Division, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, Israel.', 'Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel; and.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Adult', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/trends', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality/therapy', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Research Design/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/methods']",PMC6595255,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019032268 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019032268 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jun 25;3(12):1881-1890. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019032268.,12,,,,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The knowledge of the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME), particularly mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), in MDS pathogenesis is increasing. Generally, cancer is associated with a procoagulant state participating in tumor development. Monocytes release procoagulant, tissue factor (TF)-bearing microparticles. We hypothesized that MSCs and clonal monocytes release procoagulant extracellular vesicles (EVs) within the CMML TME, inducing a procoagulant state that could modify hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis. We isolated and cultured MSCs and monocytes from CMML patients and MSCs from healthy donors (HDs). Their medium EVs and small EVs (sEVs) were collected after iterative ultracentrifugations and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Their impact on hemostasis was studied with a thrombin generation assay and fibrinography. CMML or HD HSCs were exposed to sEVs from either CMML or HD MSCs. CMML MSC sEVs increased HD HSC procoagulant activity, suggesting a transfer of TF from the CMML TME to HD HSCs. The presence of TF on sEVs was shown by electron microscopy and western blot. Moreover, CMML monocyte EVs conferred a procoagulant activity to HD MSCs, which was reversed by an anti-TF antibody, suggesting the presence of TF on the EVs. Our findings revealed a procoagulant ""climate"" within the CMML environment related to TF-bearing sEVs secreted by CMML MSCs and monocytes.","['Zannoni, Johanna', 'Mauz, Natacha', 'Seyve, Landry', 'Meunier, Mathieu', 'Pernet-Gallay, Karin', 'Brault, Julie', 'Jouzier, Claire', 'Laurin, David', 'Pezet, Mylene', 'Pernollet, Martine', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Cognasse, Fabrice', 'Polack, Benoit', 'Park, Sophie']","['Zannoni J', 'Mauz N', 'Seyve L', 'Meunier M', 'Pernet-Gallay K', 'Brault J', 'Jouzier C', 'Laurin D', 'Pezet M', 'Pernollet M', 'Cahn JY', 'Cognasse F', 'Polack B', 'Park S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1708-8606', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1706-2158', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9339-8369', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4365-7454', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2356-7101', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8041-928X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1697-6249', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0514-5789']","['Institute for Advanced Biosciences, INSERM U1209 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 5309, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, INSERM U1209 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 5309, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', ""Techniques de l'Ingenierie Medicale et de la Complexite Informatique, Mathematiques et Applications-Therapeutique Recombinante Experimentale, UMR 5525 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France."", 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, INSERM U1209 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 5309, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Grenoble Institute for Neurosciences, INSERM U1216, Plateforme de Microscopie Electronique, Grenoble, France.', ""Techniques de l'Ingenierie Medicale et de la Complexite Informatique, Mathematiques et Applications-Therapeutique Recombinante Experimentale, UMR 5525 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France."", 'Centre de Diagnostic de la Granulomatose Septique Diagnosis and Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, INSERM U1209 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 5309, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, INSERM U1209 and Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche (UMR) 5309, Grenoble Alpes University, Grenoble, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne, Grenoble, France.', 'Plateforme de Microscopie Photonique, Cytometrie en Flux, Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Grenoble, France.', ""Institut de Biologie et de Pathologie, Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France."", 'Department of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne, Saint-Etienne, France;

Despite their importance, the mechanism by which superstructures are patterned is unknown. Here, we identify components of the genetic program that control the patterning of Sox9 (+)/Scx (+) superstructure progenitors in mouse and show that this program includes both global and regional regulatory modules. Using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy combined with genetic lineage labeling, we mapped the broad contribution of the Sox9 (+)/Scx (+) progenitors to the formation of bone superstructures. Then, by combining literature-based evidence, comparative transcriptomic analysis and genetic mouse models, we identified Gli3 as a global regulator of superstructure patterning, whereas Pbx1, Pbx2, Hoxa11 and Hoxd11 act as proximal and distal regulators, respectively. Moreover, by demonstrating a dose-dependent pattern regulation in Gli3 and Pbx1 compound mutations, we show that the global and regional regulatory modules work in a coordinated manner. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence for genetic regulation of superstructure patterning, which further supports the notion that long bone development is a modular process.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.","['Eyal, Shai', 'Kult, Shiri', 'Rubin, Sarah', 'Krief, Sharon', 'Felsenthal, Neta', 'Pineault, Kyriel M', 'Leshkowitz, Dena', 'Salame, Tomer-Meir', 'Addadi, Yoseph', 'Wellik, Deneen M', 'Zelzer, Elazar']","['Eyal S', 'Kult S', 'Rubin S', 'Krief S', 'Felsenthal N', 'Pineault KM', 'Leshkowitz D', 'Salame TM', 'Addadi Y', 'Wellik DM', 'Zelzer E']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8131-8077', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4078-8560', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1584-6602']","['Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Genetics, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Genetics, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Genetics, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Genetics, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Genetics, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Cell & Regenerative Biology, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Life Sciences Core Facilities, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Life Sciences Core Facilities, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Life Sciences Core Facilities, Rehovot 76100, Israel.', 'University of Wisconsin-Madison, Department of Cell & Regenerative Biology, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Weizmann Institute of Science, Department of Molecular Genetics, Rehovot 76100, Israel eli.zelzer@weizmann.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190726,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (SOX9 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Scx protein, mouse)', '0 (Sox9 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Bone Development/genetics', 'Bone and Bones/*anatomy & histology/*embryology/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/physiology', '*Genes, Developmental/genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ligaments/anatomy & histology/embryology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Tendons/anatomy & histology/embryology/metabolism']",PMC6679367,2019/06/22 06:00,2020/07/07 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['dev.167882 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.167882 [doi]']",epublish,Development. 2019 Jul 26;146(14). pii: dev.167882. doi: 10.1242/dev.167882.,14,"['R01 AR055580/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR061402/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,['(c) 2019.

However, the success rate of the traditional approaches to construct such cell lines is low because a long time is required for the addition of drugs. METHODS: A cell culture technique was used to establish the drug-resistant cell lines from their parental cells. Molecular and cellular biological techniques including flow cytometry, MTT assay, western blotting, and DNA fingerprinting analysis were used to characterize the drug-resistant cell lines. Nude mice were used for xenograft studies. RESULTS: We established novel glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant cell lines from 3 GC-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. First, we established a novel GC-resistant T-ALL cell line, CEM-C7/HDR, by mimicking the microenvironment of the bone marrow and culturing GC-sensitive CEM-C7-14 cells under hypoxia for 5 weeks with a single dexamethasone (Dex) treatment. The CEM-C7/HDR cells had been cultured continuously in drug-free medium under normoxia for 1 year. The IC50 and resistance index (RI) to Dex were maintained at 60~70 muM and 1500~1800, respectively, which is in consistent with the IC50 and RI of GC-resistant CEM-C1-15 cells. To clarify the reliability of the method, we subcloned CEM-C7-14 cells, and obtained Dex-resistant cell lines, CEM-C7-SC2/HDR and CEM-C7-SC14/HDR, from 2 monoclonal cells of CEM-C7-14 by the same method. Moreover, we obtained two additional Dex-resistant B-ALL cell lines, NALM-6/HDR and HXEX-ALL1/HDR, from NALM-6 and HXEX-ALL1 cells with the same approach. CONCLUSIONS: CEM-C7/HDR, NALM-6/HDR and HXEX-ALL1/HDR cell lines may serve as useful GC-resistant ALL models for both in vitro and in vivo studies. Culturing under hypoxic condition with a single Dex treatment is a novel and convenient approach for generating stable GC resistant cell lines.","['Gu, Ling', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Zhang, Yanle']","['Gu L', 'Zhang G', 'Zhang Y']",,"[""Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, No.20, Section 3, Renmin South Road, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China. guling@scu.edu.cn."", 'Joint laboratory of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University and School of Life Science, Fudan University for Pulmonary Development and Disease, Chengdu, China. guling@scu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', ""Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, No.20, Section 3, Renmin South Road, Chengdu, 610041, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190620,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology']",PMC6585113,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-019-1280-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-019-1280-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jun 20;38(1):269. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1280-2.,1,"['81270602/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2018JY0044/Applied Basic Research Program of Sichuan Province', '2015-HM01-00307-SF/Chengdu Science and Technology Huimin Project of China']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cell line', 'Glucocorticoid resistance', 'Hypoxia', 'Method']",,,,,,,,,,,

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate efficacy and adverse effects of AZA plus LEN for the treatment of patients with high-risk MDS, AML or CMML. METHODS: The current study systematically identified all cohort studies of patients with AML and/or MDS and/or CMML who received AZA in combination with LEN that reported the overall complete remission (CR) rate and/or overall response rate (ORR). A DerSimonian-d random-effects model with double arcsine transformation was used for the pooled rates and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the all outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies with 406 patients were identified and included into the meta-analysis. The pooled CR rate after the treatment with AZA-plus-LEN regimen was 33.0% (95% CI, 27.7%-38.7%, I(2) = 18%) while the pooled ORR was 49.9% (95% CI, 38.4%-61.5%, I(2) = 72%). Nonetheless, adverse events including grade 3-4 neutrophil toxicity events, platelet toxicity events and febrile neutropenia were common with AZA-plus-LEN regimen. CONCLUSIONS: The current study may serve as a preliminary data to suggest that the addition of LEN may offer incremental benefit to patients with high-risk MDS, AML and CMML. However, randomized-controlled studies that directly compare the efficacy and adverse events of AZA-plus-LEN regimen versus AZA monotherapy are still needed.","['Kunacheewa, Chutima', 'Thongthang, Pakaporn', 'Ungprasert, Patompong', 'Utchariyaprasit, Eakkapol', 'Owattanapanich, Weerapat']","['Kunacheewa C', 'Thongthang P', 'Ungprasert P', 'Utchariyaprasit E', 'Owattanapanich W']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4817-9404', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1262-2005']","['a Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand.', 'a Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand.', 'b Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand.', 'a Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand.', 'a Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital , Mahidol University , Bangkok , Thailand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review']",,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/22 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1631425 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):498-506. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1631425.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"[':Azacitidine', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'lenalidomide', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",,,,,,,,,,,

All compounds are neutral, presenting the formula [Ru(PPh3)2(2TU)2] (1), [Ru(PPh3)2(6m2TU)2] (2), [Ru(dppb)(2TU)2] (3) and [Ru(dppb)(6m2TU)2] (4), where PPh3=triphenylphosphine; dppb=1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane, 2TU=2-thiouracil and 6m2TU=6-methyl-2-thiouracil. They were characterized using NMR, UV-vis and IR spectroscopies, microanalytical analysis and mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the crystal structures of 1-4 were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The coordination of 2-thiouracil derivatives with ruthenium increases regions able to carry out hydrogen bonds with the biological targets, such as DNA. We evaluated the interaction of the complexes with DNA by UV/Vis spectrophotometric titration, and as a result, the values of DNA-binding constants are in the range of 0.8-1.8x10(4)M(-1). Moreover, the interaction of the complexes with BSA was investigated. In vitro, activities against B16-F10 (mouse melanoma), HepG2 (human hepatocellular carcinoma), HL-60 (human promyelocytic leukemia) and K562 (human chronic myelocytic leukemia) and non-tumor cells: PBMC (human peripheral blood mononuclear cells activated with concanavalin A - human lymphoblast) were carried out.

Historically, differences in cancer rates have been observed between US-born and foreign-born individuals. However, comprehensive and up-to-date data on US cancer rates by birth place is lacking. To compare cancer mortality rates among foreign and US-born individuals, population-based cancer mortality data were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Utilizing data recorded on death certificates, individuals were categorized as US-born or foreign-born. Annual population estimates were obtained from the American Community Survey. Age-adjusted mortality rates and rate ratios (RRs) for all cancer sites were calculated using SEER*Stat. A total of 5,670,535 deaths from malignant cancers were recorded in the US from 2005 to 2014 and 9% of deaths occurred among foreign-born individuals. Overall, foreign-born individuals had a 31% lower cancer mortality rate when compared to US-born individuals (Rate Ratio (RR): 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68-0.69)), and similar results were observed when stratifying by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and geographic region.

Several conditions are associated with BMN, including sickle cell disease, metastatic carcinoma, and hematologic malignancies. It is also associated with the use of antineoplastic drugs, such as fludarabine, interferon alpha, and imatinib. Blinatumomab is a CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager antibody which redirects autologous CD3-positive T cells to CD19-positive lymphoblasts creating a cytolytic synapse leading to blastic cells. Cytokine release syndrome, cerebral nervous system toxicities, and febrile neutropenia are the most frequent adverse effects of blinatumomab.

Some birth defects are known to be strongly associated with childhood cancer (eg, trisomy 21 and acute leukemia). However, comprehensive evaluations of childhood cancer risk in those with birth defects have been limited in previous studies by insufficient sample sizes. Objectives: To identify specific birth defect-childhood cancer (BD-CC) associations and characterize cancer risk in children by increasing number of nonchromosomal birth defects. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multistate, population-based registry linkage study pooled statewide data on births, birth defects, and cancer from Texas, Arkansas, Michigan, and North Carolina on 10181074 children born from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2013. Children were followed up to 18 years of age for a diagnosis of cancer. Data were retrieved between September 26, 2016, and September 21, 2017, and data analysis was performed from September 2, 2017, to March 21, 2019. Exposures: Birth defects diagnoses (chromosomal anomalies and nonchromosomal birth defects) recorded by statewide, population-based birth defects registries. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cancer diagnosis before age 18 years, as recorded in state cancer registries. Cox regression models were used to generate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs to evaluate BD-CC associations and the association between number of nonchromosomal defects and cancer risk. Results: Compared with children without any birth defects, children with chromosomal anomalies were 11.6 (95% CI, 10.4-12.9) times more likely to be diagnosed with cancer, whereas children with nonchromosomal birth defects were 2.5 (95% CI, 2.4-2.6) times more likely to be diagnosed with cancer before 18 years of age. An increasing number of nonchromosomal birth defects was associated with a corresponding increase in the risk of cancer. Children with 4 or more major birth defects were 5.9 (95% CI, 5.3-6.4) times more likely to be diagnosed with cancer compared with those without a birth defect. In the analysis of 72 specific BD-CC patterns, 40 HRs were statistically significant (adjusted P < .05) after accounting for multiple comparisons. Cancers most frequently associated with nonchromosomal defects were hepatoblastoma and neuroblastoma. Conclusions and Relevance: Several significant and novel associations were observed between specific birth defects and cancers. Among children with nonchromosomal birth defects, the number of major birth defects diagnosed was significantly and directly associated with cancer risk. These findings could inform clinical treatment for children with birth defects and may elucidate mechanisms that lead to these complex outcomes.","['Lupo, Philip J', 'Schraw, Jeremy M', 'Desrosiers, Tania A', 'Nembhard, Wendy N', 'Langlois, Peter H', 'Canfield, Mark A', 'Copeland, Glenn', 'Meyer, Robert E', 'Brown, Austin L', 'Chambers, Tiffany M', 'Sok, Pagna', 'Danysh, Heather E', 'Carozza, Susan E', 'Sisoudiya, Saumya D', 'Hilsenbeck, Susan G', 'Janitz, Amanda E', 'Oster, Matthew E', 'Scheuerle, Angela E', 'Schiffman, Joshua D', 'Luo, Chunqiao', 'Mian, Amir', 'Mueller, Beth A', 'Huff, Chad D', 'Rasmussen, Sonja A', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Plon, Sharon E']","['Lupo PJ', 'Schraw JM', 'Desrosiers TA', 'Nembhard WN', 'Langlois PH', 'Canfield MA', 'Copeland G', 'Meyer RE', 'Brown AL', 'Chambers TM', 'Sok P', 'Danysh HE', 'Carozza SE', 'Sisoudiya SD', 'Hilsenbeck SG', 'Janitz AE', 'Oster ME', 'Scheuerle AE', 'Schiffman JD', 'Luo C', 'Mian A', 'Mueller BA', 'Huff CD', 'Rasmussen SA', 'Scheurer ME', 'Plon SE']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.', ""Arkansas Children's Research Institute, Little Rock."", 'Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch,Texas Department of State Health Services, Austin.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch,Texas Department of State Health Services, Austin.', 'Division for Vital Records and Health Statistics, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, Lansing, Michigan.', 'Department of Maternal and Child Health, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'School of Biological and Population Health Sciences, Oregon State University, Corvallis.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Hudson College of Public Health, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Birth Defects Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch,Texas Department of State Health Services, Austin.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Epidemiology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Florida College of Medicine Gainsville.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of Florida College of Medicine and College of Public Health and Health Professions, Gainesville.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', ""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Texas Children's Hospital, Houston."", 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,,PMC6587148,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/06/21 06:01,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/21 06:01 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['2736368 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.1215 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2019 Aug 1;5(8):1150-1158. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.1215.,8,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES010126/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 MD011564/MD/NIMHD NIH HHS/United States']",['JAMA Oncol. 2019 Aug 1;5(8):1232.

Objective: To investigate whether general anesthesia is associated with neurocognitive impairment and neuroimaging abnormalities in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cohort study of 212 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received treatment between July 7, 2000, and November 3, 2010, and follow-up at a mean (SD) of 7.7 (1.7) years post diagnosis, was conducted at an academic medical center. Of 301 survivors who were alive and eligible for participation, 217 individuals (72.1%) agreed to participate in long-term follow-up. Data analysis was performed from August 23, 2017, to May 3, 2018. Exposures: For 5699 anesthesia procedures, data on duration and cumulative doses of all anesthetics, sedatives, analgesics, anxiolytics, and neuromuscular blockers were abstracted, along with cumulative doses of high-dose intravenous methotrexate and number of triple intrathecal chemotherapy treatments. Main Outcomes and Measures: Neurocognitive measures of attention, processing speed, executive function, and intelligence were examined. Brain volumes, cortical thickness, and diffusion tensor imaging of the whole brain, corpus callosum, frontal lobes, and parietal lobes were evaluated. Results: Of the 217 study participants, 212 were included in both neurocognitive and brain imaging analysis. Of these, 105 were female (49.5%); mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 14.36 (4.79) years; time since diagnosis was 7.7 (1.7) years. Adjusting for chemotherapy doses and age at diagnosis, neurocognitive impairment was associated with higher propofol cumulative dose (relative risk [RR], 1.40 per 100 mg/kg; 95% CI, 1.11-1.75), flurane exposure (RR, 1.10 per exposure; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21), and longer anesthesia duration (RR, 1.03 per cumulative hour; 95% CI, 1.00-1.06). Slower processing speed was associated with higher propofol dose (estimate [est], -0.30; P = .04), greater number of exposures to fluranes (est, -0.14; P = .01), and longer anesthesia duration (est, -0.04; P = .003). Higher corpus callosum white matter diffusivity was associated with dose of propofol (est, 2.55; P = .01) and duration of anesthesia (est, 2.40; P = .02). Processing speed was significantly correlated with corpus callosum diffusivity (r = -0.26, P < .001). Conclusions and Relevance: Higher cumulative anesthesia exposure and duration may be associated with neurocognitive impairment and neuroimaging abnormalities in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, beyond the known outcomes associated with neurotoxic chemotherapies. Anesthesia exposures should be limited in pediatric populations with chronic health conditions who undergo multiple medical procedures.","['Banerjee, Pia', 'Rossi, Michael G', 'Anghelescu, Doralina L', 'Liu, Wei', 'Breazeale, Ashley M', 'Reddick, Wilburn E', 'Glass, John O', 'Phillips, Nicholas S', 'Jacola, Lisa M', 'Sabin, Noah D', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Srivastava, Deokumar', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Banerjee P', 'Rossi MG', 'Anghelescu DL', 'Liu W', 'Breazeale AM', 'Reddick WE', 'Glass JO', 'Phillips NS', 'Jacola LM', 'Sabin ND', 'Inaba H', 'Srivastava D', 'Robison LL', 'Pui CH', 'Hudson MM', 'Krull KR']",,"[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatric Medicine, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Psychology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,,IM,,PMC6587141,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/06/21 06:01,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/21 06:01 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['2736366 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.1094 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2019 Oct 1;5(10):1456-1463. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2019.1094.,10,['T32 CA225590/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the anticancer properties of UV-Tianjin on human osteosarcoma HOS cells and the underlying molecular mechanism. Apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined by flow cytometry analysis. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were tested by western blotting. The results showed that UV-Tianjin concentration-dependently induced apoptosis in HOS cells. UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis was mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, which was confirmed by mitochondrial dysfunction, downregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), B-cell lymphoma-xL (Bcl-xL) and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), upregulation of B-cell lymphoma 2 associated X protein (Bax) and Bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist/Killer (Bak), as well as the cleavage of caspase-9 and -3. Further analysis showed that UV-Tianjin augmented the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, the extracellular-regulated kinase and p38, the major components of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, as well as the generation of ROS. Moreover, UV-Tianjin-induced apoptosis was remarkably attenuated by MAPK inhibitors and ROS inhibitor. Taken together, our results indicated that UV-Tianjin exerts antitumor effects by inducing mitochondria-dependent apoptosis involving ROS generation and MAPK pathway in human osteosarcoma HOS cells.","['Li, Qing', 'Ma, Huachong', 'Sun, Shuya', 'Shi, Liying']","['Li Q', 'Ma H', 'Sun S', 'Shi L']",,"['Department of Pathogenic Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China. liqing2@tmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of General Surgery, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190620,Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Mitochondria/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Osteosarcoma/pathology/*therapy/*virology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sendai virus/*classification/*radiation effects']",,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4149/gpb_2019015 [doi]'],ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2019 Jul;38(4):335-342. doi: 10.4149/gpb_2019015.

Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells are one of these novel therapies, demonstrating impressive efficacy against B-cell malignancies. With the development of new therapies, it is not uncommon to identify new and unanticipated toxicities. CAR-T cells cause unique toxicities not typically found with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy or small molecule inhibitors. Areas covered: CAR-T cell associated toxicities include cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and CAR-T cell-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES), alternatively known as immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). Prompt identification and management of CRS and CRES are imperative for the prevention of life-threatening complications of these innovative therapies. This literature review describes the seminal trials of CD19-directed immunotherapy and the pathophysiology and management of the toxicities found with CAR-T cells. In addition, the use of the interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab for CRS is reviewed. Expert opinion: This review describes the recommended management of CRS and CRES and examines the current limitations in management. Alternative therapies for the treatment of CAR-T cell related toxicities are also explored.

However, when stimulated by supernatants from human T lymphocyte cultures, K562 cells upregulate beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and MHC class I expression, which would induce allo-specific T cells. Methods: We disrupted the B2M locus in K562 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 and achieved MHC class I-negative K562 cells. Results: We further generated K562-based MHC class I-negative aAPC line by zinc-finger nuclease mediated insertion of costimulatory molecules into the AAVS1 locus. This aAPC line could attenuate allogeneic immune responses but support robust antigen-independent and CD19 antigen-specific chimeric antigen receptor-T cell expansion in vitro. Conclusion: B2M-knockout K562 cells provide a new scaffold for aAPC construction and broader application in adoptive immunotherapies.","['Zha, Shijun', 'Li, Zhendong', 'Chen, Can', 'Du, Zhicheng', 'Tay, Johan Chin-Kang', 'Wang, Shu']","['Zha S', 'Li Z', 'Chen C', 'Du Z', 'Tay JC', 'Wang S']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543.', 'Institute of Bioengineering & Nanotechnology, Singapore 138669.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190620,England,Immunotherapy,Immunotherapy,101485158,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/immunology', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', '*Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*genetics/immunology']",,2019/06/21 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/imt-2018-0211 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunotherapy. 2019 Aug;11(11):967-982. doi: 10.2217/imt-2018-0211.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate platelet functions and associated bleeding symptoms in patients with CML using TKIs. A standardized questionnaire that was developed for inherited bleeding disorders (ISTH/SSC Bleeding Assessment Tool) was used to score bleeding symptoms in 68 chronic phase patients with CML receiving imatinib (n = 47), dasatinib (n = 15), or nilotinib (n = 6). Light transmission aggregometry was used for platelet function testing. None of the patients had major bleeding (score > 3). Minor bleeding was observed in 25.6% and 20% of the patients in imatinib and dasatinib treatment groups. Impaired/decreased platelet aggregation was observed in 29.8% of imatinib treatment group, 50% of nilotinib group, and 40% of dasatinib group. A secondary aggregation abnormality compatible with the release defect was observed in 26% of patients with CML; 25.5%, 33.3%, and 16.7% of patients receiving imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib, respectively. No correlation was found between bleeding symptoms and the impaired platelet function. We can conclude that TKIs may impair in vitro platelet aggregation but this impairment is not associated with bleeding diathesis.","['Sener, Yigit', 'Okay, Mufide', 'Aydin, Seda', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Akbiyik, Filiz', 'Dikmen, Zeliha Gunnur']","['Sener Y', 'Okay M', 'Aydin S', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Akbiyik F', 'Dikmen ZG']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5317-0597'],"['1 Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', '2 Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', '2 Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', '2 Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', '1 Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', '1 Department of Medical Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,Clinical and applied thrombosis/hemostasis : official journal of the International Academy of Clinical and Applied Thrombosis/Hemostasis,9508125,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Platelet Disorders/*chemically induced', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",PMC6714920,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1076029619858409 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Appl Thromb Hemost. 2019 Jan-Dec;25:1076029619858409. doi: 10.1177/1076029619858409.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic-phase myeloid leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib mesylate', 'platelet aggregation']",,,,,,,,,,,

Rarely, patients with CML can present directly in a blast crisis (BC). While most blast crises are of myeloid origin, myeloid BC with ALL-like morphologic features and Ph-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is rare, especially at the time of CML diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 20-year-old man presented with Ph chromosome-positive AML mimicking acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Bone marrow (BM) aspiration revealed AML with ALL-like morphologic features. The results of the immunophenotypic analysis suggested AML. Cytogenetic analysis of the BM cells revealed a 46,XY,t(3;14)(q21;q32),t(9;22)(q34;q11.2)[20] karyotype. Thus, we called the condition AML mimicking ALL. The patient was diagnosed with myeloid BC based on the combination of clinical, cytologic, and cytogenetic studies. CONCLUSION: To date, no case reports of a patient diagnosed with CML BC presented with Ph chromosome-positive AML mimicking ALL have been reported. We present the case given its rarity, easy misdiagnosis, and poor prognosis. It is important to combine clinical, cytologic, and cytogenetic analyses in distinguishing CML BC from de novo AML with the t(9;22)and further cases should be accumulated to explore how to improve the prognosis of the patients.","['Liu, Keyu', 'Hu, Jintian', 'Wang, Xueqin', 'Li, Li']","['Liu K', 'Hu J', 'Wang X', 'Li L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8429-8267'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Engineering University of Hebei, Handan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Engineering University of Hebei, Handan, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Affiliated Hospital of Engineering University of Hebei, Handan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Engineering University of Hebei, Handan, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190619,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",PMC6805270,2019/06/21 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22961 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2019 Oct;33(8):e22961. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22961.

The cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab has not previously been examined. METHODS: Cost effectiveness of blinatumomab versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell precursor ALL patients with one or no prior salvage therapy from a United States (US) payer perspective was estimated using a partitioned survival model. Health outcomes were estimated based on published aggregate data from INO-VATE-ALL and individual patient data from TOWER weighted to match patients in INO-VATE-ALL using matching adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC). Analyses were conducted using five approaches relating to use of anchored versus unanchored comparisons of health outcomes and, for the anchored comparisons, the reference treatment to which treatment effects on health outcomes were applied. Estimates from TOWER including the probabilities of complete remission and allogeneic stem-cell transplant (allo-SCT), overall and event-free survival, utilities, duration of therapy, and use of subsequent therapies were MAIC adjusted to match INO-VATE-ALL. Costs of treatment, adverse events, allo-SCT, subsequent therapies, and terminal care were from published sources. A 50-year time horizon and 3% annual discount rate were used. RESULTS: Incremental costs for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from US$7023 to US$36,244, depending on the approach used for estimating relative effectiveness. Incremental quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) ranged from 0.54 to 1.78. Cost effectiveness for blinatumomab versus inotuzumab ranged from US$4006 to US$20,737 per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: Blinatumomab is estimated to be cost effective versus inotuzumab in R/R B-cell precursor ALL adults who have received one or no prior salvage therapy from a US payer perspective.","['Delea, Thomas E', 'Zhang, Xinke', 'Amdahl, Jordan', 'Boyko, Diana', 'Dirnberger, Franziska', 'Campioni, Marco', 'Cong, Ze']","['Delea TE', 'Zhang X', 'Amdahl J', 'Boyko D', 'Dirnberger F', 'Campioni M', 'Cong Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5493-1925'],"['Policy Analysis Inc.

Our aim was to explore whether LIF-transfected NSCs (LIF-NSCs) can ameliorate brain injury and promote neuroprotection in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. To accomplish this goal, we transfected NSCs with a lentivirus carrying the LIF gene to stably overexpress LIF. The LIF-NSCs reduced caspase 3 activation under conditions of oxygen-glucose deprivation in vitro. Transient cerebral ischemia was induced in rats by 2 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), and LIF-NSCs were intravenously injected at 6 h post-ischemia. LIF-NSC treatment reduced the infarction volume and improved neurological recovery. Moreover, LIF-NSCs improved glial cell regeneration and ameliorated white matter injury in the MCAo rats. The NSCs acted as carriers and increased the expression of LIF in the lesions to protect against cerebral infarction, suggesting that LIF-NSCs could be a potential treatment for cerebral infarction.","['Tian, Lili', 'Zhu, Wenli', 'Liu, Yuanchu', 'Gong, Ye', 'Lv, Aowei', 'Wang, Zhen', 'Ding, Xiaoli', 'Li, Shaowu', 'Fu, Ying', 'Lin, Yi', 'Yan, Yaping']","['Tian L', 'Zhu W', 'Liu Y', 'Gong Y', 'Lv A', 'Wang Z', 'Ding X', 'Li S', 'Fu Y', 'Lin Y', 'Yan Y']",,"['Department of Neurology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China.', ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China.', ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China.', ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", 'Department of Function Neuroimaging, Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100050, China.', ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China."", 'Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, 350000, China. linyi7811@163.com.', 'Department of Neurology, Tianjin Neurological Institute, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China. yaping.yan@snnu.edu.cn.', ""Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Medicinal Resources and Natural Pharmaceutical Chemistry, National Engineering Laboratory for Resource Development of Endangered Crude Drugs in Northwest of China, College of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, 710119, China. yaping.yan@snnu.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190619,Singapore,Neurosci Bull,Neuroscience bulletin,101256850,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Ischemia/*genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neural Stem Cells/*physiology/*transplantation', 'Neuroprotection/*physiology', 'Random Allocation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Transfection/*methods']",PMC6754523,2019/06/21 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2018/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12264-019-00405-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s12264-019-00405-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurosci Bull. 2019 Oct;35(5):901-908. doi: 10.1007/s12264-019-00405-5.

The objective of the current study was to select supplemental items to add to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) to ensure content coverage of all important clinical concepts in patients with higher-risk (HR) MDS, low-blast count (LB) AML, and CMML, thus, improving the instrument's ability to detect clinically meaningful treatment benefit for this context of use. METHODS: Our mixed methods approach comprised literature review, clinician consultation (n = 3), and qualitative and quantitative analysis of two stages of patient interview data (n = 14, n = 18) to select library bank items to supplement a generic cancer PRO, the EORTC QLQ-C30. RESULTS: Unique symptom (n = 54) and impact (n = 72) concepts were organized into conceptual frameworks of treatment benefit, compared with EORTC QLQ-C30 items and conceptual gaps identified. Supplemental items (n = 13) addressing those gaps were selected from the EORTC Item Library and tested with patients. Supplemental item endorsement frequencies met World Health Organization Quality of Life criteria, suggesting good targeting and relevance for this sample. However, three supplemental items were confirmed as problematic based upon cognitive debriefing results, and expert clinical consultations. Ultimately, 10 supplemental items (n = 7 symptom; n = 3 impact) were selected for the MDS/AML/CMML context. CONCLUSION: Supplemental items were selected to enhance the conceptual coverage of the EORTC QLQ-C30 in the areas of fatigue, shortness of breath, and functioning.","['Bell, Jill A', 'Galaznik, Aaron', 'Pompilus, Farrah', 'Strzok, Sara', 'Bejar, Rafael', 'Scipione, Fatima', 'Fram, Robert J', 'Faller, Douglas V', 'Cano, Stefan', 'Marquis, Patrick']","['Bell JA', 'Galaznik A', 'Pompilus F', 'Strzok S', 'Bejar R', 'Scipione F', 'Fram RJ', 'Faller DV', 'Cano S', 'Marquis P']",,"['Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited), 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA. jill.bell@takeda.com.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited), 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center - MDS Center of Excellence, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited), 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited), 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited), 40 Landsdowne Street, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Modus Outcomes, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190619,Germany,J Patient Rep Outcomes,Journal of patient-reported outcomes,101722688,,,,PMC6584583,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/06/21 06:01,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41687-019-0123-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s41687-019-0123-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Patient Rep Outcomes. 2019 Jun 19;3(1):35. doi: 10.1186/s41687-019-0123-4.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Patient-reported outcomes', 'Quality of life']",,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS: Blood samples were collected from 20 patients with CLL and 20 hematologically normal donors. Human cell lines K562, HL-60, MEG-1, and BALL-1 were performed in vitro and BALB/c nude mouse was used in subcutaneous tumor experiments. TREATMENT: WP1066 (30 mg/kg) was also injected intratumorally two days after the first lentivirus treatment and then every four days for a total of four injections and 3 microM WP1066 was carried out for 48 h to downregulate STAT3 phosphorylation. METHODS: We performed studies using the human CLL cell line MEG-1 in vitro and nude mouse subcutaneous tumor experiments in vivo. Differential expression of RNAs was determined using qRT-PCR. The CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay were conducted to evaluate cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell apoptosis. The relative protein levels were detected using western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, luciferase reporter assays and WP1066, a STAT3 inhibitor, were used to explore the regulatory mechanisms of proteases and transcription factors. A subcutaneous tumor model was constructed to verify the results in vivo. RESULTS: SMYD3 and STAT3 expressions positively correlated with the progression of CLL. Upregulation of SMYD3 significantly promoted the proliferation and inhibited the expression of apoptosis-related genes. The results of the ChIP assays and luciferase reporter assays suggested that STAT3 targeted the promoter region of SMYD3 and, thus, promoted SMYD3 transcription. Downregulation of the phosphorylation of STAT3 by WP1066 notably inhibited the binding of STAT3 to the SMYD3 promoter, and subsequently downregulated SMYD3 transcription. The STAT3 inhibitor inhibited CLL cell growth in vivo, and overexpression of SMYD3 promoted CLL cell growth. Furthermore, overexpression of SMYD3 reversed the inhibitory effects of the STAT3 inhibitor on CLL cell growth. CONCLUSIONS: The STAT3-mediated transcription of SMYD3 plays a role in promoting the progression of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Lin, Fujia', 'Wu, Danjuan', 'Fang, Dan', 'Chen, Yao', 'Zhou, Haitao', 'Ou, Caiwen']","['Lin F', 'Wu D', 'Fang D', 'Chen Y', 'Zhou H', 'Ou C']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9003-4890'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, No 111 Dade Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, No 111 Dade Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, No 111 Dade Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou, 510120, Guangdong, China. ocw313@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190619,Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Improvement of their treatment, for all phases of the disease, is an important unmet medical need. We analyzed the effect of homoharringtonine (HHT), a natural protein synthesis inhibitor approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia, on four cell lines representing aggressive, BRCA1/2 non-mutated, TNBC genomic categories. We show that HHT inhibits in vitro growth of all cell lines for more than 80%, after 48-72 h exposure to 20-100 ng/mL, the concentrations achievable in human plasma after subcutaneous administration of the drug. HHT, at 100 ng/mL, strongly reduced levels of a major TNBC survival factor, anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, after only 2 h of exposure, in all cell lines except MDA-MB-231. Other anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-2, survivin and XIAP, were also strongly downregulated. Moreover, in vivo growth of the least sensitive cell line to HHT in vitro, MDA-MB-231, was inhibited for 36.5% in mice, by 1 mg/kg of the drug, given subcutaneously, bi-daily, over 7 days.

In this study, a clinically achievable concentration of enzastaurin synergized with ATRA to induce differentiation and apoptosis in ATRA-resistant APL cell lines, NB4-R1 and NB4-R2. Mechanistically, although enzastaurin is a protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta) inhibitor, PKCbeta may not be required since the activity of PKCbeta was not suppressed by enzastaurin-ATRA (enz-ATRA) co-treatment, and another PKCbeta-selective inhibitor did not mimic the effects of enzastaurin. An MEK inhibitor but not a RAF-1 inhibitor suppressed enz-ATRA treatment-triggered differentiation, activation of MEK/ERK and up-regulation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and/or PU.1. Therefore, RAF-1-independent MEK/ERK signaling was required for enz-ATRA treatment-induced differentiation via modulation of the protein levels of C/EBPbeta and/or PU.1. Enz-ATRA treatment collapsed mitochondrial transmembrane potential without the activation of caspase-3, -6 and -7. Moreover, caspase-3/7- and caspase-6-specific inhibitors had no inhibitory effect on enz-ATRA treatment-triggered apoptosis. Therefore, enz-ATRA treatment-induced apoptosis was mitochondria-dependent but caspase-independent. Enz-ATRA treatment degraded PML-RARalpha, which may be involved in enz-ATRA treatment-induced dual effects and may also be beneficial for APL eradication. These findings may provide a potential therapy for ATRA-resistant APL patients.","['Liang, Cui', 'Ding, Ming', 'Weng, Xiang-Qin', 'Sheng, Yan', 'Wu, Jing', 'Li, Ze-Yi', 'Cai, Xun']","['Liang C', 'Ding M', 'Weng XQ', 'Sheng Y', 'Wu J', 'Li ZY', 'Cai X']",,"['Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University No. 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Central Hospital of Minhang District No. 170 Xin Song Road, Shanghai 201199, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University No. 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University No. 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University No. 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University No. 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology and State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Rui-Jin Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University No. 197 Rui-Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190501,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC6556610,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/06/21 06:01,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/21 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2019 May 1;9(5):906-926. eCollection 2019.,5,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoic acid', 'apoptosis', 'differentiation', 'enzastaurin']",['None.'],,,,,,,,,,

In has been shown that tanshinone IIA (Tan IIA), exhibited anti-tumor activities on different types of cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms by which Tan IIA regulates apoptosis and autophagy in AML remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of Tan IIA on AML in vitro and in vivo. CCK-8 assay, EdU staining, flow cytometry, MDC staining, immunofluorescence, transwell migration and invasion assay were used to detect cell proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy, migration and invasion, respectively. In addition, western blotting was used to examine the protein levels of Bax, Bcl-2, active caspase-3, Beclin-1, Atg-5, p-mTOR and p-Akt in cells. Moreover, animal studies were performed to evaluate anti-tumor effect of Tan IIA on AML in vivo. The results revealed that Tan IIA significantly suppressed the growth of U937 cells in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, Tan IIA induced apoptosis in U937 cells via up-regulating the levels of active caspase-3 and Bax, and down-regulating Bcl-2 in vitro and in vivo. In addition, Tan IIA inhibited the capacity of migration and invasion in U937 cells. Moreover, Tan IIA induced autophagy in U937 cells via upregulation of the expression of LC3 II, Atg5 and Beclin 1, which was further confirmed by MDC staining and immunofluorescence assays. For the first time, we have shown that autophagy inhibitor 3MA significantly enhanced Tan IIA-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Furthermore, Tan IIA induced apoptosis and autophagy via downregulation of PI3K/Akt pathway in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, the accumulating evidences suggested that Tan IIA could be a potential agent for improving the symptoms of AML in the future.","['Zhang, Yanping', 'Geng, Yan', 'He, Juntao', 'Wu, Dong', 'Zhang, Tong', 'Xue, Li', 'Zhang, Lei', 'He, Aili']","['Zhang Y', 'Geng Y', 'He J', 'Wu D', 'Zhang T', 'Xue L', 'Zhang L', 'He A']",,"[""Department of Laboratory, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University Xi'an 710004, P.

EPCs were isolated from human AML bone marrow mononuclear cells and fused with DCs, which were then injected back into AML mice. Changes in leukemia cells, micro-vessel density (MVD), early EPC molecular markers vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2/KDR) and CD133 in bone marrow were measured. The results indicated that CD133 and KDR expression in EPCs was significantly higher than in epithelial cells (HUVECs). There were 46.14% +/- 8.21% DCs doubly positive for VEGFR2 and CD11c, and it was 8.53% +/- 1.27% in co-culture group. Fusion rate of DC/EPCs was 37.61% +/- 6.94%, and 35.63% +/- 6.09% in DC/ECs group. Growth rate of DC/EPCs was faster than that of EPCs (P<0.05). At 14-20 days after fused cells injection, symptoms gradually decreased. There were a greater number of micro-vessels in bone marrow biopsy sections of AML mice than in normal controls (P<0.05). There was slightly lower MVD in EC/DCs compared with EPC/DCs (P>0.05). Positive expression of CD133 and VEGFR2 in bone marrow biopsies of AML mice was significantly higher than that in control mice (P<0.05). Positive expression of CD133 and VEGFR2 in DC/EC fused cells was significantly lower than that before fusion (P<0.05). In conclusion, DC-EPCs play a certain immunosuppressive effect on angiogenesis in AML mice.

The endometriosis (EM) is accompanied by chronic inflammation. The present study aims to explore the therapeutic effects of sulforaphane on EM and its underlying mechanism. An EM rat model was established by transplantation of autologous fragments. The rats were intragastrically administered sulforaphane (5 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, and 30 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. The volumes of endometriotic foci and adhesion score were calculated at the end of the experiment. Levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon (IFN)-gamma, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Expressions of VEGF, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (Bcl-2), Bax, cleaved caspase-3, PI3K, and Akt in endometrial tissue were determined by Western blotting. Relative expressions of PI3K and Akt were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Posttreatment of sulforaphane dose-dependently decreased the volumes of endometriotic foci and adhesion score in EM model. Additionally, posttreatment of sulforaphane inhibited levels of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and VEGF in peritoneal fluid and plasma. Posttreatment of sulforaphane regulated the expressions of VEGF, bcl-2, Bax, and cleaved Caspase-3 in EM model.

The average scoliosis patient will receive 10 to 25 spinal X-rays over several years equating to a maximum estimated dose of 10 to 25 mGy. Some patients, those getting diagnosed at a younger age and receiving early and ongoing treatments, may receive up to 40 to 50 X-rays, approaching at most 50 mGy. There are concerns that repeated radiographs given to patients are carcinogenic. Some studies have used the linear no-threshold model to derive cancer-risk estimates; however, it is invalid for low-dose irradiation (ie, X-rays); these estimates are untrue. Other studies have calculated cancer-risk ratios from long-term health data of historic scoliosis cohorts. Since data indicate reduced cancer rates in a cohort receiving a total radiation dose between 50 and 300 mGy, it is unlikely that scoliosis patients would get cancer from repeated X-rays. Moreover, since the threshold for leukemia is about 1100 mGy, scoliosis patients will not likely develop cancers from spinal X-rays. Scoliosis patients likely have long-term health consequences, including cancers, from the actual disease entity itself and not from protracted X-ray radiation exposures that are essential and indeed safe.","['Oakley, Paul A', 'Ehsani, Niousha Navid', 'Harrison, Deed E']","['Oakley PA', 'Ehsani NN', 'Harrison DE']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3117-7330'],"['Private Practice, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada.', 'Private Practice, Newmarket, Ontario, Canada.', 'CBP NonProfit, Inc, Eagle, ID, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190611,United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,PMC6560808,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/06/21 06:01,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1559325819852810 [doi]', '10.1177_1559325819852810 [pii]']",epublish,Dose Response. 2019 Jun 11;17(2):1559325819852810. doi: 10.1177/1559325819852810. eCollection 2019 Apr-Jun.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['LNT', 'X-ray', 'cobb angle', 'dose threshold', 'radiogenic cancer', 'scoliosis']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have indicated similar proliferation and apoptosis between N822K and D816V mutations.The current study aims to determine the occurrence and potential functions of N822K mutation-induced c-KIT activation in AML cells, and explore possible mechanisms of poor prognosis of CBF-AML. Methods: c-KIT N822K mutation status in AML cells was determined by exon 17 sequencing. The level of c-KIT expression was detected by flow cytometry (FCM) and colony formation was assessed after hu-SCF stimulation. After exposure to sunitinib (a kind of tyrosine kinase inhibitor, TKI), cell proliferation inhibition was tested by MTT, cell cycle and apoptosis were measured by FCM, autophagy was assessed by fluorescence microscopy and immunoblotting. Results: Kasumi-1 cell line was detected to bear c-KIT N822K (T>A) mutation. After hu-SCF stimulation, CD117 expression was decreased and the colony formation efficiency was not altered in Kasumi-1 cells. After sunitinib inhibited the c-KIT activity, the colony formation efficiency was reduced, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of sunitinib was low (0.44+/-0.17muM) at 48 hours. Moreover, cells were arrested in G0/G1 phase, corresponding to an increase of apoptosis ratio. Acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) were observed along with an altered expression of autophagy-related proteins in Kasumi-1 cells. Conclusions: Our data indicated that inhibition of N822K T>A mutation-induced constitutive c-KIT activation in AML cells triggered apoptotic and autophagic pathways leading to death, and c-KIT N822K mutation may have clinical application as a CBF-AML treatment target.","['Xu, Jianping', 'Zheng, Jinyuan', 'Fu, Xiaomeng', 'Wu, Wei', 'Tao, Linfen', 'Li, Dan', 'Lin, Donghong']","['Xu J', 'Zheng J', 'Fu X', 'Wu W', 'Tao L', 'Li D', 'Lin D']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350001 China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350001 China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350001 China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350001 China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350001 China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Fujian Cancer Hospital, Fujian Medical University Cancer Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350014 China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medical Technology and Engineering, Fujian Medical University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350001 China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190521,Australia,Int J Med Sci,International journal of medical sciences,101213954,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gain of Function Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Sunitinib/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC6566732,2019/06/21 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijms.33532 [doi]', 'ijmsv16p0757 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Med Sci. 2019 May 21;16(5):757-765. doi: 10.7150/ijms.33532. eCollection 2019.,5,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CBF-AML', 'biological behavior', 'c-KIT', 'function mutation', 'treatment target']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,

We find that the small molecule Ro 08-2750 (Ro) binds directly and selectively to MSI2 and competes for its RNA binding in biochemical assays. Ro treatment in mouse and human myeloid leukemia cells results in an increase in differentiation and apoptosis, inhibition of known MSI-targets, and a shared global gene expression signature similar to shRNA depletion of MSI2. Ro demonstrates in vivo inhibition of c-MYC and reduces disease burden in a murine AML leukemia model. Thus, we identify a small molecule that targets MSI's oncogenic activity. Our study provides a framework for targeting RNA binding proteins in cancer.","['Minuesa, Gerard', 'Albanese, Steven K', 'Xie, Wei', 'Kazansky, Yaniv', 'Worroll, Daniel', 'Chow, Arthur', 'Schurer, Alexandra', 'Park, Sun-Mi', 'Rotsides, Christina Z', 'Taggart, James', 'Rizzi, Andrea', 'Naden, Levi N', 'Chou, Timothy', 'Gourkanti, Saroj', 'Cappel, Daniel', 'Passarelli, Maria C', 'Fairchild, Lauren', 'Adura, Carolina', 'Glickman, J Fraser', 'Schulman, Jessica', 'Famulare, Christopher', 'Patel, Minal', 'Eibl, Joseph K', 'Ross, Gregory M', 'Bhattacharya, Shibani', 'Tan, Derek S', 'Leslie, Christina S', 'Beuming, Thijs', 'Patel, Dinshaw J', 'Goldgur, Yehuda', 'Chodera, John D', 'Kharas, Michael G']","['Minuesa G', 'Albanese SK', 'Xie W', 'Kazansky Y', 'Worroll D', 'Chow A', 'Schurer A', 'Park SM', 'Rotsides CZ', 'Taggart J', 'Rizzi A', 'Naden LN', 'Chou T', 'Gourkanti S', 'Cappel D', 'Passarelli MC', 'Fairchild L', 'Adura C', 'Glickman JF', 'Schulman J', 'Famulare C', 'Patel M', 'Eibl JK', 'Ross GM', 'Bhattacharya S', 'Tan DS', 'Leslie CS', 'Beuming T', 'Patel DJ', 'Goldgur Y', 'Chodera JD', 'Kharas MG']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0973-5030', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4550-6211', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7351-676X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7693-2013', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8460-7867', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7956-9659', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4571-5910', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9779-7778', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0542-119X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1165-6991']","['Molecular Pharmacology Program, Experimental Therapeutics Center and Center for Stem Cell Biology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, 10065, USA.', 'Louis V.

Covalent BTK inhibitors (e.g., ibrutinib) bind to cysteine C481, and mutations of this residue confer clinical resistance. This has led to the development of noncovalent BTK inhibitors that do not require binding to cysteine C481. These new compounds are now entering clinical trials. In a systematic BTK mutagenesis screen, we identify residues that are critical for the activity of noncovalent inhibitors. These include a gatekeeper residue (T474) and mutations in the kinase domain. Strikingly, co-occurrence of gatekeeper and kinase domain lesions (L512M, E513G, F517L, L547P) in cis results in a 10- to 15-fold gain of BTK kinase activity and de novo transforming potential in vitro and in vivo. Computational BTK structure analyses reveal how these lesions disrupt an intramolecular mechanism that attenuates BTK activation. Our findings anticipate clinical resistance mechanisms to a new class of noncovalent BTK inhibitors and reveal intramolecular mechanisms that constrain BTK's transforming potential.","['Wang, Shenqiu', 'Mondal, Sayan', 'Zhao, Chunying', 'Berishaj, Marjan', 'Ghanakota, Phani', 'Batlevi, Connie Lee', 'Dogan, Ahmet', 'Seshan, Venkatraman E', 'Abel, Robert', 'Green, Michael R', 'Younes, Anas', 'Wendel, Hans-Guido']","['Wang S', 'Mondal S', 'Zhao C', 'Berishaj M', 'Ghanakota P', 'Batlevi CL', 'Dogan A', 'Seshan VE', 'Abel R', 'Green MR', 'Younes A', 'Wendel HG']",,"['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York USA.', 'Schrodinger, Inc., New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York USA.', 'Schrodinger, Inc., New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Lymphoma Service.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, and.', 'Department of Epidemiology-Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Schrodinger, Inc., New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma and Myeloma and Department of Genomic Medicine, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine Lymphoma Service.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190620,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Domains', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC6629124,2019/06/21 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['127566 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.127566 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2019 Jun 20;4(12). pii: 127566. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.127566. eCollection 2019 Jun 20.,12,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190384/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA217694/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA207217/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA183876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA192937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Hematology', '*Lymphomas', '*Oncology', '*Protein kinases']",,,,,,,,,,,

By analyzing the DNA copy number profiles of 1000 DLBCL tumors, we identified gains of 18q21.2 as the most frequent genetic alteration in ABC-like DLBCL. Using integrative analysis of matched gene expression profiling data, we found that the TCF4 (E2-2) transcription factor gene was the target of these alterations. Overexpression of TCF4 in ABC-like DLBCL cell lines led to its occupancy on immunoglobulin (IGHM) and MYC gene enhancers and increased expression of these genes at the transcript and protein levels. Inhibition of TCF4 activity with dominant-negative constructs was synthetically lethal to ABC-like DLBCL cell lines harboring TCF4 DNA copy gains, highlighting these gains as an attractive potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, the TCF4 gene was one of the top BRD4-regulated genes in DLBCL cell lines. BET proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) ARV771 extinguished TCF4, MYC, and IgM expression and killed ABC-like DLBCL cells in vitro. In DLBCL xenograft models, ARV771 treatment reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival. This work highlights a genetic mechanism for promoting immunoglobulin signaling in ABC-like DLBCL and provides a functional rationale for the use of BET inhibitors in this disease.","['Jain, Neeraj',

However, it remains unclear whether ALV-K represents an independent ALV subgroup with regard to receptor usage, host range, and superinfection interference. In the present study, we examined the host range of the Chinese infectious isolate JS11C1, an ALV-K prototype, and we found substantial overlap of species that were either resistant or susceptible to ALV-A and JS11C1. Ectopic expression of the chicken tva gene in mammalian cells conferred susceptibility to JS11C1, while genetic ablation of the tva gene rendered chicken DF-1 cells resistant to infection by JS11C1. Thus, tva expression is both sufficient and necessary for JS11C1 entry. Receptor sharing was also manifested in superinfection interference, with preinfection of cells with ALV-A, but not ALV-B or ALV-J, blocking subsequent JS11C1 infection. Finally, direct binding of JS11C1 and Tva was demonstrated by preincubation of the virus with soluble Tva, which substantially decreased viral infectivity in susceptible chicken cells. Collectively, these findings indicate that JS11C1 represents a new and bona fide ALV subgroup that utilizes Tva for cell entry and binds to a site other than that for ALV-A.IMPORTANCE ALV consists of several subgroups that are particularly characterized by their receptor usage, which subsequently dictates the host range and tropism of the virus. A few newly emerging and highly pathogenic Chinese ALV strains have recently been suggested to be an independent subgroup, ALV-K, based solely on their genomic sequences. Here, we performed a series of experiments with the ALV-K strain JS11C1, which showed its dependence on the Tva cell surface receptor. Due to the sharing of this receptor with ALV-A, both subgroups were able to interfere with superinfection. Because ALV-K could become an important pathogen and a significant threat to the poultry industry in Asia, the identification of a specific receptor could help in the breeding of resistant chicken lines with receptor variants with decreased susceptibility to the virus.","['Prikryl, David', 'Plachy, Jiri', 'Kucerova, Dana', 'Koslova, Anna', 'Reinisova, Marketa', 'Senigl, Filip', 'Hejnar, Jiri']","['Prikryl D', 'Plachy J', 'Kucerova D', 'Koslova A', 'Reinisova M', 'Senigl F', 'Hejnar J']",,"['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic hejnar@img.cas.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190813,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Tva receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/metabolism/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Avian Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Mesocricetus', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Virus Internalization']",PMC6694804,2019/06/21 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00580-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00580-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Aug 13;93(17). pii: JVI.00580-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00580-19.

A common feature of these disorders is the presence of abnormal megakaryocytes, which have been implicated as causative agents in the development of bone marrow fibrosis. However, the specific contributions of megakaryocytes to MPN pathogenesis remain unclear. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used Pf4-Cre transgenic mice to drive expression of JAK2(V617F) in megakaryocyte lineage-committed hematopoietic cells. We also assessed the critical role of mutant megakaryocytes in MPN maintenance through cell ablation studies in JAK2(V617F) and MPL(W515L) BMT models of MPN. RESULTS: JAK2(V617F) -mutant presence in megakaryocytes was sufficient to induce enhanced erythropoiesis and promote fibrosis, which leads to a myeloproliferative state with expansion of mutant and nonmutant hematopoietic cells. The increased erythropoiesis was associated with elevated IL6 level, which was also required for aberrant erythropoiesis in vivo. Furthermore, depletion of megakaryocytes in the JAK2(V617F) and MPL(W515L) BMT models ameliorated polycythemia and leukocytosis in addition to expected effects on megakaryopoiesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations reveal that JAK/STAT pathway activation in megakaryocytes induces myeloproliferation and is necessary for MPN maintenance in vivo. These observations indicate that MPN clone can influence the behavior of the wild-type hematopoietic milieu, at least, in part, via altered production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Our findings resonate with patients who present with a clinical MPN and a low JAK2(V617F) allele burden, and support the development of MPN therapies aimed at targeting megakaryocytes.","['Woods, Brittany', 'Chen, Wei', 'Chiu, Sophia', 'Marinaccio, Christian', 'Fu, Chunling', 'Gu, Lilly', 'Bulic, Marinka', 'Yang, Qiong', 'Zouak, Anouar', 'Jia, Shengxian', 'Suraneni, Praveen Kumar', 'Xu, Kailin', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Crispino, John D', 'Wen, Qiang Jeremy']","['Woods B', 'Chen W', 'Chiu S', 'Marinaccio C', 'Fu C', 'Gu L', 'Bulic M', 'Yang Q', 'Zouak A', 'Jia S', 'Suraneni PK', 'Xu K', 'Levine RL', 'Crispino JD', 'Wen QJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4417-1541', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8174-7506']","['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Center for Hematologic Malignancies and Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Louis V.

FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), although effective in kinase ablation, do not eliminate primitive FLT3-ITD(+) leukemia cells, which are potential sources of relapse. Thus, understanding the mechanisms underlying FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell persistence is essential to devise future AML therapies. Here, we show that expression of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1), the primary type I arginine methyltransferase, is increased significantly in AML cells relative to normal hematopoietic cells. Genome-wide analysis, coimmunoprecipitation assay, and PRMT1-knockout mouse studies indicate that PRMT1 preferentially cooperates with FLT3-ITD, contributing to AML maintenance. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of PRMT1 markedly blocked FLT3-ITD(+) AML cell maintenance. Mechanistically, PRMT1 catalyzed FLT3-ITD protein methylation at arginine 972/973, and PRMT1 promoted leukemia cell growth in an FLT3 methylation-dependent manner. Moreover, the effects of FLT3-ITD methylation in AML cells were partially due to cross talk with FLT3-ITD phosphorylation at tyrosine 969. Importantly, FLT3 methylation persisted in FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells following kinase inhibition, indicating that methylation occurs independently of kinase activity. Finally, in patient-derived xenograft and murine AML models, combined administration of AC220 with a type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) enhanced elimination of FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells relative to AC220 treatment alone. Our study demonstrates that PRMT1-mediated FLT3 methylation promotes AML maintenance and suggests that combining PRMT1 inhibition with FLT3 TKI treatment could be a promising approach to eliminate FLT3-ITD(+) AML cells.","['He, Xin', 'Zhu, Yinghui', 'Lin, Yi-Chun', 'Li, Min', 'Du, Juan', 'Dong, Haojie', 'Sun, Jie', 'Zhu, Lei', 'Wang, Hanying', 'Ding, Zonghui', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Zhang, Lianjun', 'Zhao, Dandan', 'Wang, Zhihao', 'Wu, Herman', 'Zhang, Han', 'Jiang, Wenjuan', 'Xu, Yang', 'Jin, Jian', 'Shen, Yudao', 'Perry, Jeff', 'Zhao, Xinyang', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Liu, Songbai', 'Xue, Sheng-Li', 'Shen, Binghui', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Khaled, Samer', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Luo, Yun', 'Li, Ling']","['He X', 'Zhu Y', 'Lin YC', 'Li M', 'Du J', 'Dong H', 'Sun J', 'Zhu L', 'Wang H', 'Ding Z', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang L', 'Zhao D', 'Wang Z', 'Wu H', 'Zhang H', 'Jiang W', 'Xu Y', 'Jin J', 'Shen Y', 'Perry J', 'Zhao X', 'Zhang B', 'Liu S', 'Xue SL', 'Shen B', 'Chen CW', 'Chen J', 'Khaled S', 'Kuo YH', 'Marcucci G', 'Luo Y', 'Li L']",,"['Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona CA.', 'Department of Information Sciences and.', 'The Integrative Genomics Core, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, AZ.', 'Translational Biomarker Discovery Core and.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona CA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona CA.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside, CA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Suzhou Key Laboratory for Medical Biotechnology, Suzhou Vocational Health College, Suzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China;

Yet, our foundational knowledge of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) and sonoporation remains to be critically weak because the pertinent cellular bioeffects have not been rigorously studied. In this article, we present a population-based experimental protocol that can effectively foster investigations on the mechanistic bioeffects of LIPUS and sonoporation over a cell population. Walkthroughs of different methodological details are presented, including the fabrication of the ultrasound exposure platform and its calibration, as well as the design of a bioassay procedure that uses fluorescent tracers and flow cytometry to isolate sonicated cells with similar characteristics. An application example is also presented to illustrate how our protocol can be used to investigate the downstream cellular bioeffects of leukemia cells. We show that, with 1-MHz LIPUS exposure (with 29.1 J/cm(2) delivered acoustic energy density), variations in viability and morphology would be found among different types of sonicated leukemia cells (HL-60, Molt-4) in the absence and presence of MBs. Taken altogether, this article provides a reference on how cellular bioeffect experiments on LIPUS and sonoporation can be planned meticulously to acquire strong observations that are critical to establish the biological foundations for therapeutic applications.","['Duan, Xinxing', 'Yu, Alfred C H', 'Wan, Jennifer M F']","['Duan X', 'Yu ACH', 'Wan JMF']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190617,United States,IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",9882735,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Contrast Media', 'Equipment Design', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microbubbles', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Sonication/instrumentation/*methods', '*Ultrasonic Waves']",,2019/06/21 06:00,2020/09/05 06:00,['2019/06/21 06:00'],"['2019/06/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2923443 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Ultrason Ferroelectr Freq Control. 2019 Sep;66(9):1422-1434. doi: 10.1109/TUFFC.2019.2923443.

For checkpoint blockade, current studies focus on combinational approaches, perioperative use, new tumor entities, response prediction, toxicity management and use in special patient populations. Regarding cellular immunotherapy, recent studies confirmed safety and efficacy of CAR T cells in larger cohorts of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Different strategies to translate the striking success of CAR T cells in B cell malignancies to other hematological and solid cancer types are currently under clinical investigation.

In this study, using ChIP-sequencing, we identified EZH2 and H3K27me3 target genes in two prognostic subgroups of CLL with distinct prognosis and outcome, i.e., cases with unmutated (U-CLL, n = 6) or mutated IGHV genes (M-CLL, n = 6). While the majority of oncogenic pathways were equally enriched for EZH2 target genes in both prognostic subgroups, PI3K pathway genes were differentially bound by EZH2 in U-CLL versus M-CLL. The occupancy of EZH2 for selected PI3K pathway target genes was validated in additional CLL samples (n = 16) and CLL cell lines using siRNA-mediated EZH2 downregulation and ChIP assays. Intriguingly, we found that EZH2 directly binds to the IGF1R promoter along with MYC and upregulates IGF1R expression in U-CLL, leading to downstream PI3K activation. By investigating an independent CLL cohort (n = 96), a positive correlation was observed between EZH2 and IGF1R expression with higher levels in U-CLL compared to M-CLL. Accordingly, siRNA-mediated downregulation of either EZH2, MYC or IGF1R and treatment with EZH2 and MYC pharmacological inhibitors in the HG3 CLL cell line induced a significant reduction in PI3K pathway activation. In conclusion, we characterize for the first time EZH2 target genes in CLL revealing a hitherto unknown implication of EZH2 in modulating the PI3K pathway in a non-canonical, PRC2-independent way, with potential therapeutic implications considering that PI3K inhibitors are effective therapeutic agents for CLL.","['Kosalai, Subazini Thankaswamy', 'Morsy, Mohammad Hamdy Abdelrazak', 'Papakonstantinou, Nikos', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Kanduri, Chandrasekhar', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Kanduri, Meena']","['Kosalai ST', 'Morsy MHA', 'Papakonstantinou N', 'Mansouri L', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Kanduri C', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Rosenquist R', 'Kanduri M']",,"['Department of Medical Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Institute of Biomedicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg , Gothenburg , Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical chemistry and Transfusion medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital , Gothenburg , Sweden.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Center for Research and Technology Hellas , Thessaloniki , Greece.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden.', 'Hematology Department and HCT Unit, G.

The disease exhibits a complex pathology and an equally complex clinical behavior. The classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) divides mastocytosis into cutaneous forms, systemic variants, and localized mast cell tumors. In >80% of patients with systemic mastocytosis (SM), a somatic point mutation in KIT at codon 816 is found. Whereas patients with indolent forms of the disease have a normal or near-normal life expectancy, patients with advanced mast cell neoplasms, including aggressive SM and mast cell leukemia, have a poor prognosis with short survival times. In a majority of these patients, multiple somatic mutations and/or an associated hematologic neoplasm, such as a myeloid leukemia, may be detected. Independent of the category of mastocytosis and the serum tryptase level, patients may suffer from mediator-related symptoms and/or osteopathy. Depending on the presence of co-morbidities, the symptomatology in such patients may be mild, severe or even life-threatening. Most relevant co-morbidities in such patients are IgE-dependent allergies, psychiatric, psychological or mental problems, and vitamin D deficiency. The diagnosis and management of mastocytosis is an emerging challenge in clinical practice and requires vast knowledge, a multidisciplinary approach, and personalized medicine procedures. In this article, the current knowledge about mastocytosis is reviewed with special emphasis on the multidisciplinary aspects of the disease and related challenges in daily practice.","['Valent, Peter', 'Akin, Cem', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Arock, Michel', 'Triggiani, Massimo']","['Valent P', 'Akin C', 'Gleixner KV', 'Sperr WR', 'Reiter A', 'Arock M', 'Triggiani M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0456-5095'],"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48106, USA. cemakin@umich.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. karoline.gleixner@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. karoline.gleixner@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@meduniwien.ac.at.', 'III.

Therefore, the method used to detect ADA activity and screen the effectiveness of various inhibitor candidates has important implications for the diagnosis treatment for various human diseases. A simple and rapid assay method for ADA, based on the enzymatic formation of a luminescent lanthanide complex, is proposed in this study. Inosine, an enzymatic product of ADA with stronger sensitization efficiency for Tb(3+) than adenosine, produced a strong luminescence by forming an inosine-Tb(3+) complex, and it enabled the direct monitoring of ADA activity in real-time. By introducing only Tb(3+) to adenosine and ADA in the buffer, the enhancement of luminescence enabled the detection of a low concentration of ADA (detection limit 1.6 U/L). Moreover, this method could accurately determine the inhibition efficiency (IC50) of the known ADA inhibitor, erhythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA), and the inhibition of ADA could be confirmed by the naked eye. Considering its simplicity, this assay could be extended to the high-throughput screening of various ADA inhibitor candidates.","['Lee, Suji', 'Park, Heewon', 'Ki, Yeongcheol', 'Lee, Hohjai', 'Han, Min Su']","['Lee S', 'Park H', 'Ki Y', 'Lee H', 'Han MS']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9588-6980'],"['Department of Chemistry, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 123 Cheomdangwagi-ro, Buk-gu, Gwangju 61005, Korea. jabtneod@gist.ac.kr.', 'Department of Chemistry, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 123 Cheomdangwagi-ro, Buk-gu, Gwangju 61005, Korea. ynotzzz8@gist.ac.kr.', 'Department of Chemistry, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, 123 Cheomdangwagi-ro, Buk-gu, Gwangju 61005, Korea.

Skin and subcutaneous tissue manifestations have been reported and were witnessed in up to 32% of the patients on ibrutinib. The mechanism in which ibrutinib can cause skin toxicities has been thought due to the inhibition of epidermal growth factor; c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor). Here, we report a case of an elderly chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient who developed multiple inflamed lesions and lower limb cellulitis in 100 days after initiating ibrutinib therapy. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old male patient with relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia was started on ibrutinib 420 mg orally daily following multiple lines of therapy. Three months following ibrutinib, the patient developed multiple hyper pigmented lesions over both forearms then over both thighs; buttocks and lower limbs. The lesions were labeled as ecthyma and cellulitis that started as papules, which progressed to pustules. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES: The patient required admission in which he received prolonged course of antibiotics. Biopsy from the wound showed soft tissue fragment infiltrated by acute and chronic inflammatory cells with necrosis; rare foreign body giant cells and granulation tissue formation; suggestive of abscess. Subsequently, ibrutinib was stopped permanently. DISCUSSION: This is the first case description of an ibrutinib-associated sever skin toxicity in Qatar. The provided information regarding the clinical descriptions of toxicity profiles in general and skin-based in particular is valuable information for daily clinical practice, especially when selecting the optimum first-line treatment for the patient.","['Ghasoub, R', 'Albattah, A', 'Elazzazy, S', 'Alokka, R', 'Nemir, A', 'Alhijji, I', 'Taha, R']","['Ghasoub R', 'Albattah A', 'Elazzazy S', 'Alokka R', 'Nemir A', 'Alhijji I', 'Taha R']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1392-8831', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0017-4401']","['National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'College of Pharmacy, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC), Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20190619,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aged', 'Cellulitis/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Ecthyma/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Skin/drug effects/pathology']",,2019/06/20 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219856422 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Mar;26(2):487-491. doi: 10.1177/1078155219856422.

A total of 24 patients with CLL and eight controls were vaccinated with PPV23 five years after PCV7. Blood samples for evaluation of antibody response to PCV7 serotypes and PPV23 serotypes 5 and 7 were taken before vaccination and one month after it. Post-vaccination samples were available from 20 patients. IgG antibodies were measured with ELISA. Antibody concentrations after PPV23 were significantly lower in CLL patients for six of the PCV7 serotypes and for both PPV23 serotypes. Only 10% to 15% of CLL patients achieved an antibody response suggested to be protective against IPD. Hence, PCV7 given five years before PPV23 did not improve antibody response in patients with CLL. Based on our results, PPV23 given after a PCV primer is not useful against IPD in CLL patients.","['Lindstrom, Vesa', 'Aittoniemi, Janne', 'Salmenniemi, Urpu', 'Kayhty, Helena', 'Huhtala, Heini', 'Sinisalo, Marjatta']","['Lindstrom V', 'Aittoniemi J', 'Salmenniemi U', 'Kayhty H', 'Huhtala H', 'Sinisalo M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5724-9120', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1372-430X']","['Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Clinical Microbiology, Fimlab Laboratories, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Division of Medicine, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Research prof emerita, visiting scientist, Department of Health Security, National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190709,United States,Hum Vaccin Immunother,Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,101572652,"['0 (23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine)', '0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Pneumococcal Vaccines)', '0 (Vaccines, Conjugate)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', 'Female', 'Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Secondary', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumococcal Infections/*prevention & control', 'Pneumococcal Vaccines/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Conjugate/immunology']",PMC6930110,2019/06/20 06:00,2020/05/15 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/21645515.2019.1627160 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2019;15(12):2910-2913. doi: 10.1080/21645515.2019.1627160.

In this study, we sought to explore whether ivermectin (IVM), a macrolide antiparasitic agent, could overcome the resistance of cancer cells to the therapeutic drugs. METHODS: We used two solid tumor cell lines (HCT-8 colorectal cancer cells and MCF-7 breast cancer cells) and one hematologic tumor cell line (K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells), which are resistant to the chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine and adriamycin respectively, and two xenograft mice models, including the solid tumor model in nude mice with the resistant HCT-8 cells and the leukemia model in NOD/SCID mice with the resistant K562 cells to investigate the reversal effect of IVM on the resistance in vitro and in vivo. MTT assay was used to investigate the effect of IVM on cancer cells growth in vitro. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were performed to investigate the reversal effect of IVM in vivo. Western blotting, qPCR, luciferase reporter assay and ChIP assay were used to detect the molecular mechanism of the reversal effect. Octet RED96 system and Co-IP were used to determine the interactions between IVM and EGFR. RESULTS: Our results indicated that ivermectin at its very low dose, which did not induce obvious cytotoxicity, drastically reversed the resistance of the tumor cells to the chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ivermectin reversed the resistance mainly by reducing the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) via inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), not by directly inhibiting P-gp activity. Ivermectin bound with the extracellular domain of EGFR, which inhibited the activation of EGFR and its downstream signaling cascade ERK/Akt/NF-kappaB. The inhibition of the transcriptional factor NF-kappaB led to the reduced P-gp transcription. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrated that ivermectin significantly enhanced the anti-cancer efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs to tumor cells, especially in the drug-resistant cells. Thus, ivermectin, a FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, could potentially be used in combination with chemotherapeutic agents to treat cancers and in particular, the drug-resistant cancers.","['Jiang, Lu', 'Wang, Pan', 'Sun, Ying-Jian', 'Wu, Yi-Jun']","['Jiang L', 'Wang P', 'Sun YJ', 'Wu YJ']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Toxicology, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1-5 Beichenxilu Rd., Chaoyang, Beijing, 100101, China.', ""University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, People's Republic of China."", 'Laboratory of Molecular Toxicology, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1-5 Beichenxilu Rd., Chaoyang, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Toxicology, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1-5 Beichenxilu Rd., Chaoyang, Beijing, 100101, China. yjsun51@sina.com.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, Beijing University of Agriculture, Beinonglu Rd, Changping, Beijing, 102206, China. yjsun51@sina.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Toxicology, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects and Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 1-5 Beichenxilu Rd., Chaoyang, Beijing, 100101, China. wuyj@ioz.ac.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190618,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '70288-86-7 (Ivermectin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ivermectin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology']",PMC6580523,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-019-1251-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-019-1251-7 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jun 18;38(1):265. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1251-7.,1,['31672366/National Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug resistance', 'EGFR', 'Ivermectin', 'P-glycoprotein', 'Reversal']",,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of this protein family has been implicated in some cancers, such that agents that could inhibit their over-activity are now being explored for anticancer drug development. A number of studies have revealed the anticancer potential of Morinda lucida-derived extracts and compounds. In search of more inhibitors of this anti-apoptotic protein family from plant resources, 47 compounds, identified in Morinda lucida Benth (Rubiaceae) were screened for their inhibitory activities against BCL-XL, BCL-2, and MCL-1 by molecular docking using BINDSURF, while binding interactions of the top compounds were viewed with PyMOL. Druglikeness and Absorption-Distribution-Metabolism-Excretion (ADME) parameters of the top 6 compounds from docking study were evaluated using SuperPred webserver. Results revealed that out of the 47 compounds, 2 triterpenes (ursolic acid and oleanolic acid) and 4 phytosterols (cycloartenol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and beta-sitosterol) have higher binding affinities for the selected BCL-2 proteins, compared to known standard inhibitors; these compounds also fulfill oral drugability of Lipinski rule of five. Therefore, since these Morinda lucida-derived phytosterols and triterpenes show high binding affinity toward the selected anti-apoptotic proteins and exhibited good drugability characteristics, they qualify for further study on drug development against cancers characterized by overexpression of this family of protein.","['Adewole, Kayode Ezekiel', 'Ishola, Ahmed Adebayo']","['Adewole KE', 'Ishola AA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6761-3798', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5395-5922']","['a Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences , University of Medical Sciences Ondo , Ondo City , Nigeria.', 'b Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Life Sciences , University of Ilorin , Ilorin , Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190619,England,J Recept Signal Transduct Res,Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,9509432,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phytosterols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Morinda/*chemistry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phytosterols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10799893.2019.1625062 [doi]'],ppublish,J Recept Signal Transduct Res. 2019 Feb;39(1):87-97. doi: 10.1080/10799893.2019.1625062.

Among salvage chemotherapy regimens, the clofarabine and cytarabine (CLARA) combination has been widely evaluated and has a favourable safety/efficacy balance. Predictive factors of efficacy in patients with R/R AML are unclear, particularly the impact of AML-related gene mutations. We report our single-centre experience on 34 R/R AML patients treated with CLARA, with a focus on the genetic characterization of our cohort. CLARA yielded a 47% response rate among this poor-prognosis AML population, while two patients (5.8%) died due to treatment-related toxicity. The two-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 29.4% and 35.3%, respectively. Nine patients (26%) had long-term response with a median follow-up of 39.5 months among the responders, of whom six underwent haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Adverse karyotype did not correlate with response or survival, and secondary AML were more frequent among responders to CLARA, suggesting that this combination may successfully salvage R/R AML patients regardless of adverse prognostic markers. We also observed that a low mutational burden and absence of splice mutations correlated with prolonged survival after CLARA, suggesting that extensive genotyping may have prognostic implications in R/R AML.","['Mondesir, Johanna', 'Alary, Anne-Sophie', 'Sibon, David', 'Willems, Lise', 'Deau, Benedicte', 'Suarez, Felipe', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Bouscary, Didier', 'Kosmider, Olivier', 'Tamburini, Jerome']","['Mondesir J', 'Alary AS', 'Sibon D', 'Willems L', 'Deau B', 'Suarez F', 'Hermine O', 'Fontenay M', 'Bouscary D', 'Kosmider O', 'Tamburini J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9205-625X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7468-5466', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0167-5996']","['Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Necker Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Necker Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Necker Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Department, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.', 'Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France.', 'Haematology Laboratory, Cochin Hospital, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190618,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Clofarabine/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/20 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16045 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Oct;187(1):65-72. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16045.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 32 children with ALL without distinction of gender were selected for study. The oral cavity of the patients was evaluated before the induction stage and 17 days later. Clinical evaluation of the submandibular, submental, and cervical lymph nodes was performed. Saliva samples were collected during the early morning hours. Bacterial plaque was assessed by using the Silness and Loe plaque index (SLPI) and gingiva status was evaluated with the gingival Loe and Silness index (GLSI). The WHO toxicity oral scale was used to record the degree of oral mucositis. The resulting data were analysed with McNemar's test, t test (for related samples), and Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences for palpable lymph nodes, paleness of oral mucosa, and ecchymoseis, respectively, P </= 0.000, P = 0.03, and P = 0.01, with these manifestations decreasing significantly after treatment. Incipient gingivitis had frequencies of 71.9% and 75% before and after treatment, respectively. The mean SLPI score declined significantly from 1.16 +/- 0.52 (before treatment) to 0.56 +/- 0.36 (after treatment) (P < 0.000); salivary flow increased significantly from 0.54 +/- 0.34 to 1.22 +/- 1.07 after chemotherapy treatment (P < 0.00). Oral mucositis was present in 24 children (75%) with a 1-2 severity level. CONCLUSIONS: After chemotherapy treatment, there were changes in the oral conditions of children with ALL.

It is reported that arsenicals can effectively degrade PML/RARalpha, such as arsenic trioxide and realgar. However, the high toxicity or insolubility have hampered their clinical applications. Realgar transforming solution (RTS) was produced from realgar by bioleaching process in our lab. Previous studies demonstrated that RTS had a significant anti-cancer ability on chronic myeloid leukemia through oncoprotein degradation. The capacity of RTS on treating APL is what is focused on in this study. The results showed that RTS had a noticeable sensitivity in NB4 cell, and RTS remarkably down-regulated PML/RARalpha expression and induced cell differentiation. Further, RTS could accumulate PML/RARalpha into the nuclear bodies and then execute degradation, which could be reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132. The results also exhibited that the reduction of RTS-induced PML/RARalpha expression accompanied by the elevation of ubiquitin and SUMO-1 protein expression. Finally, PML and SUMO-1 had been demonstrated to be co-localized after RTS treatment by immunofluorescence co-localization assay and immunoprecipitation assay. In conclusion, these results suggested that RTS-induced cell differentiation may attribute to the PML/RARalpha degradation partially through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.","['Hai, Yang', 'Wang, Xin', 'Song, Peng', 'Li, Jian-Yin', 'Zhao, Long-He', 'Xie, Fei', 'Tan, Xiang-Min', 'Xie, Qin-Jian', 'Yu, Lan', 'Li, Yang', 'Wu, Zheng-Rong', 'Li, Hong-Yu']","['Hai Y', 'Wang X', 'Song P', 'Li JY', 'Zhao LH', 'Xie F', 'Tan XM', 'Xie QJ', 'Yu L', 'Li Y', 'Wu ZR', 'Li HY']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5612-4908'],"['School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Tianshui Road No. 222, Lanzhou, 730000, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'Gansu Corps Hospital of CAPF, Lanzhou, 730000, Gansu, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Lanzhou University, Donggang Road No. 199, Lanzhou, 730020, China. lihy@lzu.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences, Lanzhou University, Tianshui Road No. 222, Lanzhou, 730000, China. lihy@lzu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190618,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Sulfides)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '56320-22-0 (arsenic disulfide)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Solutions', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",,2019/06/20 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12272-019-01170-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s12272-019-01170-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2019 Aug;42(8):684-694. doi: 10.1007/s12272-019-01170-9.

METHODS: Two subtypes of T- and B-ALL cell lines, followed by ALL primary cells were treated with cinnamon, ginger, and green tea extracts, alone or in combination with methotrexate (MTX). Possible apoptosis was investigated using Annexin-V/PI double staining. Real-time PCR was applied to evaluate the expression levels of related ABC transporters upon combination therapy. RESULTS: The IC50s for cinnamon, ginger and green tea extracts on ALL cell lines were 300 mug/ml, 167 mug/ml and 70 mug/ml, respectively. Surprisingly, the methotrexate (MTX)-resistant sub-line showed more sensitivity to ginger. Combined treatment with ginger and MTX showed synergistic effects on CCRF-CEM, Nalm-6 and ALL primary cells. It was shown that ginger does not impair the high expression levels of ABCA2 or ABCA3 transporter genes in the ALL malignant cells, suggesting other molecular pathways involved in its anticancer potential. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that reveals the antileukemic effect of ginger extract on both, pediatric ALL cell lines and primary cells.","['Rahimi Babasheikhali, Somayeh', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Mohammadi, Mahboubeh']","['Rahimi Babasheikhali S', 'Rahgozar S', 'Mohammadi M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9193-2038', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1376-255X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8038-2509']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, 81746-73441, Iran.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, 81746-73441, Iran. rahgozar@sci.ui.ac.ir.', 'Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan, Isfahan, 81746-73441, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190618,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Tea)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cinnamomum zeylanicum/chemistry', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Ginger/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tea/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/08/09 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-019-02949-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-019-02949-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2019 Aug;145(8):1987-1998. doi: 10.1007/s00432-019-02949-5.

The disease arises from a transient population of NC cells that undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and generate diverse cell-types and tissues. Patients with neuroblastoma are characterized by their extreme heterogeneity ranging from spontaneous regression to malignant progression. More than half of newly diagnosed patients present highly metastatic tumors and are stratified into a high-risk group with dismal outcome. As many as 20% of high-risk patients have residual disease that is refractory or progressive during induction chemotherapy. Although a majority of high-risk patients achieve remission, larger part of those patients has minimal residual disease (MRD) that causes relapse even after additional consolidation therapy. MRD is composed of drug-resistant tumor cells and dynamically presented as cancer stem cells (CSCs) in residual tumors, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood (PB), and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in bone marrow (BM) and other metastatic sites. EMT appears to be a key mechanism for cancer cells to acquire MRD phenotypes and malignant aggressiveness. Due to the restricted availability of residual tumors, PB and BM have been used to isolate and analyze CTCs and DTCs to evaluate MRD in cancer patients. In addition, recent technical advances make it possible to use circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) shed from tumor cells into PB for MRD evaluation. Because MRD can be detected by tumor-specific antigens, genetic or epigenetic changes, and mRNAs, numerous assays using different methods and samples have been reported to detect MRD in cancer patients. In contrast to the tumor-specific gene-rearrangement-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and the oncogenic fusion-gene-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and several solid tumors, the clinical significance of MRD remains to be established in neuroblastoma. Given the extreme heterogeneity of neuroblastoma, dynamics of MRD in neuroblastoma patients will hold a key to the clinical validation. In this review, we summarize the biology and detection methods of cancer MRD in general and evaluate the available assays and clinical significance of neuroblastoma MRD to clarify its dynamics in neuroblastoma patients.","['Uemura, Suguru', 'Ishida, Toshiaki', 'Thwin, Khin Kyae Mon', 'Yamamoto, Nobuyuki', 'Tamura, Akihiro', 'Kishimoto, Kenji', 'Hasegawa, Daiichiro', 'Kosaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Nino, Nanako', 'Lin, Kyaw San', 'Takafuji, Satoru', 'Mori, Takeshi', 'Iijima, Kazumoto', 'Nishimura, Noriyuki']","['Uemura S', 'Ishida T', 'Thwin KKM', 'Yamamoto N', 'Tamura A', 'Kishimoto K', 'Hasegawa D', 'Kosaka Y', 'Nino N', 'Lin KS', 'Takafuji S', 'Mori T', 'Iijima K', 'Nishimura N']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kobe Children's Hospital, Kobe, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, Kobe, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190604,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6558004,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/06/20 06:01,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00455 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jun 4;9:455. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00455. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer stem cell (CSC)', 'circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)', 'circulating tumor cell (CTC)', 'disseminating tumor cell (DTC)', 'epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)', 'minimal residual disease (MRD)', 'neuroblastoma']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is an aggressive hematologic neoplasm, with a bimodal age distribution typically presenting in childhood and the 6(th) decade of life (Terwilliger and Abdul-Hay, 2017). Renal injury in ALL is common and can occur through many different mechanisms, such as prerenal acute kidney injury, acute tubular necrosis, renovascular disease, obstruction, glomerulonephritis, and parenchymal infiltration of tumor cells (Luciano and Brewster, 2014). Infiltration of kidneys by leukemia cells is common; however a resultant injury only occurs in about 1% of patients, and renal failure is even more rare (Luciano and Brewster, 2014). Renal failure due to bilateral infiltration of tumor cells has been reported in only a few cases and is thought to be a poor prognostic indicator (Luciano and Brewster, 2014; Sherief et al., 2015). Biopsy is essential to the diagnosis of renal infiltration of leukemia.

Prompt and sequential administration of escalating cell doses improves the efficacy of CIK cell therapy without exacerbating graft vs. host disease (GVHD). This study addresses manufacturing-related issues and aimed to develop a time-, personal- and cost-saving good manufacturing process (GMP)-compliant protocol for the generation of ready-for-use therapeutic CIK cell doses starting from one unstimulated donor-derived peripheral blood (PB) or leukocytapheresis (LP) products. Culture medium with or without the addition of either AB serum, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or platelet lysate (PL) was used for culture. Fresh and cryopreserved CIK cells were compared regarding expansion rate, viability, phenotype, and ability to inhibit leukemia growth. Cell numbers increased by a median factor of 10-fold in the presence of FFP, PL, or AB serum, whereas cultivation in FFP/PL-free or AB serum-free medium failed to promote adequate CIK cell proliferation (p < 0.01) needed to provide clinical doses of 1 x 10(6) T cells/kG, 5 x 10(6) T cells/kG, 1 x 10(7) T cells/kG, and 1 x 10(8) T cells/kG recipient body weight. CIK cells consisting of T cells, T- natural killer (T-NK) cells and a minor fraction of NK cells were not significantly modified by different medium supplements. Moreover, neither cytotoxic potential against leukemic THP-1 cells nor cell activation shown by CD25 expression were significantly influenced. Moreover, overnight and long-term cryopreservation had no significant effect on the composition of CIK cells, their phenotype or cytotoxic potential. A viability of almost 93% (range: 89-96) and 89.3% (range: 84-94) was obtained after freeze-thawing procedure and long-term storage, respectively, whereas viability was 96% (range: 90-97) in fresh CIK cells. Altogether, GMP-complaint CIK cell generation from an unstimulated donor-derived PB or LP products was feasible. Introducing FFP, which is easily accessible, into CIK cell cultures was time- and cost-saving without loss of viability and potency in a 10-12 day batch culture. The feasibility of cryopreservation enabled storage and delivery of sequential highly effective ready-for-use CIK cell doses and therefore reduced the number of manufacturing cycles.","['Bremm, Melanie', 'Pfeffermann, Lisa-Marie', 'Cappel, Claudia', 'Katzki, Verena', 'Erben, Stephanie', 'Betz, Sibille', 'Quaiser, Andrea', 'Merker, Michael', 'Bonig, Halvard', 'Schmidt, Michael', 'Klingebiel, Thomas', 'Bader, Peter', 'Huenecke, Sabine', 'Rettinger, Eva']","['Bremm M', 'Pfeffermann LM', 'Cappel C', 'Katzki V', 'Erben S', 'Betz S', 'Quaiser A', 'Merker M', 'Bonig H', 'Schmidt M', 'Klingebiel T', 'Bader P', 'Huenecke S', 'Rettinger E']",,"['Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Therapy, Fraunhofer Institute for Cell Therapy and Immunology IZI, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Translational Development of Cellular Therapeutics, Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Translational Development of Cellular Therapeutics, Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe-University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Clinic for Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190531,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Interleukin-15)'],IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cryopreservation/*methods', 'Cytokine-Induced Killer Cells/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-15/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/*therapy', 'Plasma', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC6554420,2019/06/20 06:00,2020/08/22 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01218 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 May 31;10:1218. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01218. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*AB-serum', '*CIK cells', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*cryopreservation', '*fresh frozen plasma', '*immunotherapy', '*platelet lysate']",,,,,,,,,,,

Purpose: This article explored the bile salt transport pathway for oral deliver of QUE using cholate-modified polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (cPLNs) aiming to enhance its antileukemic effect. Methods: QUE-loaded cPLNs (QUE-cPLNs) were developed through a nanoprecipitation technique and characterized by particle size, entrapment efficiency (EE), microscopic morphology and in vitro drug release. In vitro cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of QUE-cPLNs were examined on Caco-2 and P388 cells; in vivo pharmacokinetics and antileukemic effect were evaluated using Sprague Dawley rats and leukemic model mice, respectively. Results: The prepared QUE-cPLNs possessed a particle size of 110 nm around with an EE of 96.22%. QUE-cPLNs resulted in significantly enhanced bioavailability of QUE, up to 375.12% relative to the formulation of suspensions. In addition, QUE-cPLNs exhibited excellent cellular uptake and internalization capability compared to cholate-free QUE-PLNs. The in vitro cytotoxic and in vivo antileukemic effects of QUE-cPLNs were also signally superior to free QUE and QUE-PLNs. Conclusion: These findings indicate that cPLNs are a promising nanocarrier able to improve the oral bioavailability and therapeutic index of QUE.","['Yin, Juntao', 'Hou, Yantao', 'Song, Xiaoyong', 'Wang, Peiqing', 'Li, Yang']","['Yin J', 'Hou Y', 'Song X', 'Wang P', 'Li Y']",,"[""Department of Pharmaceutics, Huaihe Hospital Affiliated to Henan University, Kaifeng, People's Republic of China."", ""Henan Vocational College of Applied Technology, Kaifeng, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Pharmacy, Henan University, Kaifeng, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutics, Huaihe Hospital Affiliated to Henan University, Kaifeng, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pharmaceutics, Huaihe Hospital Affiliated to Henan University, Kaifeng, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190531,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cholates)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Polymers)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)']",,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Area Under Curve', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholates/*chemistry', 'Drug Liberation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Particle Size', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Quercetin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",PMC6549487,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/08/09 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S210057 [doi]', '210057 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2019 May 31;14:4045-4057. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S210057. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bile salt', 'bioavailability', 'leukemia', 'polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles', 'quercetin']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

However, components of such regimens are typically first developed individually and subsequently combined using strategies to minimize toxicity. Little or no consideration is given to strategies that potentially maximize efficacy. In contrast, CPX-351 (Vyxeos(R)) is a dual-drug liposomal encapsulation of cytarabine and daunorubicin that was rationally designed to improve efficacy over the traditional 7+3 cytarabine/daunorubicin chemotherapy regimen for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The notable clinical efficacy of CPX-351 is achieved through maintenance of a synergistic 5:1 molar ratio of cytarabine and daunorubicin within the liposome after intravenous injection. The CPX-351 liposome, which is formulated to contain bilayers of distearoylphosphatidylcholine, distearoylphosphatidylglycerol, and cholesterol at a 7:2:1 molar ratio and remains in a gel phase at body temperature, provides stability without polyethylene glycol, controlled release of cytarabine and daunorubicin, limited systemic drug distribution, and preferential internalization within malignant myeloblasts in the bone marrow via active uptake of liposomes into cytoplasmic vacuoles. Thus, the CPX-351 liposome protects cytarabine and daunorubicin from metabolism and elimination, while overcoming pharmacokinetic differences between the two agents. In clinical studies, these liposome properties markedly increased the elimination half-life of CPX-351 versus free cytarabine and daunorubicin and maintained a synergistic drug ratio for over 24 hrs after administration. Preferential uptake of liposomes by leukemia cells suggests that relatively large amounts of cytarabine and daunorubicin enter malignant cells via liposomes, potentially bypassing P-glycoprotein-based efflux pumps, which are important mediators of chemotherapy resistance, and contribute to the rapid clearance of leukemia cells from the circulation and bone marrow. These pharmacologic advantages, a direct consequence of properties of the encapsulating liposome, may explain the efficacy of CPX-351 in patients with newly diagnosed high-risk/secondary AML and the reduced drug exposure in off-target tissues that contribute to a manageable safety profile.","['Mayer, Lawrence D', 'Tardi, Paul', 'Louie, Arthur C']","['Mayer LD', 'Tardi P', 'Louie AC']",,"['Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190523,New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (CPX-351)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,"['Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Drug Compounding', '*Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution/drug effects']",PMC6537039,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/08/09 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S139450 [doi]', '139450 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2019 May 23;14:3819-3830. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S139450. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CPX-351', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytarabine', 'daunorubicin', 'molar ratio', 'nanoscale liposomes']","['AC Louie, P Tardi, and LD Mayer are employees of Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Methods: PubMed, EMBASE database, and the Cochrane Library were searched for relevant studies. Eligible studies were clinical trials of refractory AML assigned to cladribine with data on efficacy including complete remission (CR) rate, overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival. Toxicity was evaluated based on the early death rate and the incidence of grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs). Results: A total of 10 clinical trials including 422 refractory AML patients were analyzed. The overall CR rate was 42.2% (95% CI: 31.0-54.3%). And the ORR of seven trials including 235 patients was 49.7% (95% CI: 33.5-66.0%). The overall early death rate of 260 patients enrolled in five trials was 6.8% (95% CI: 4.3-10.6%). Thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, and infection were the most common grade 3 and 4 AEs. Conclusion: Cladribine is effective for refractory AML, and its efficacy can be increased with the combination of cladribine, cytarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor regimen.","['Zhou, Anqi', 'Han, Qi', 'Song, Huihui', 'Zi, Jie', 'Ma, Jinlong', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Zhou A', 'Han Q', 'Song H', 'Zi J', 'Ma J', 'Ge Z']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, Institute of Hematology Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",20190529,New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology']",PMC6549775,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S207425 [doi]', '207425 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2019 May 29;13:1867-1878. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S207425. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cladribine', 'meta-analysis', 'refractory AML']",['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor B4 (LILRB4), which suppresses T-cell activation and supports tissue infiltration of AML cells, represents an attractive drug target for anti-AML therapeutics. Here, we report the identification and development of an LILRB4-specific humanized mAb that blocks LILRB4 activation. This mAb, h128-3, showed potent activity in blocking the development of monocytic AML in various models including patient-derived xenograft mice and syngeneic immunocompetent AML mice. MAb h128-3 enhanced the anti-AML efficacy of chemotherapy treatment by stimulating mobilization of leukemia cells. Mechanistic studies revealed four concordant modes of action for the anti-AML activity of h128-3: (i) reversal of T-cell suppression, (ii) inhibition of monocytic AML cell tissue infiltration, (iii) antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, and (iv) antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis. Therefore, targeting LILRB4 with antibody represents an effective therapeutic strategy for treating monocytic AML.","['Gui, Xun', 'Deng, Mi', 'Song, Hao', 'Chen, Yuanzhi', 'Xie, Jingjing', 'Li, Zunling', 'He, Licai', 'Huang, Fangfang', 'Xu, Yixiang', 'Anami, Yasuaki', 'Yu, Hai', 'Yu, Chenyi', 'Li, Leike', 'Yuan, Zihao', 'Xu, Xiaoying', 'Wang, Qihui', 'Chai, Yan', 'Huang, Tao', 'Shi, Yi', 'Tsuchikama, Kyoji', 'Liao, X Charlene', 'Xia, Ningshao', 'Gao, George F', 'Zhang, Ningyan', 'Zhang, Cheng Cheng', 'An, Zhiqiang']","['Gui X', 'Deng M', 'Song H', 'Chen Y', 'Xie J', 'Li Z', 'He L', 'Huang F', 'Xu Y', 'Anami Y', 'Yu H', 'Yu C', 'Li L', 'Yuan Z', 'Xu X', 'Wang Q', 'Chai Y', 'Huang T', 'Shi Y', 'Tsuchikama K', 'Liao XC', 'Xia N', 'Gao GF', 'Zhang N', 'Zhang CC', 'An Z']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4291-0144', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2811-0370', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5136-7708', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2359-0408', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3446-9192', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0179-5266']","['Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Research Network of Immunity and Health (RNIH), Beijing Institutes of Life Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Taishan Immunology Program, Basic Medicine School, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Taishan Immunology Program, Basic Medicine School, Binzhou Medical University, Yantai, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medicine, Ministry of Education, School of Laboratory Medical and Life Science, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China.', 'Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'School of Xiangya Medicine, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Immune-Onc Therapeutics, Inc., Palo Alto, California.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Immune-Onc Therapeutics, Inc., Palo Alto, California.', 'School of Public Health, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, China.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Microbial Physiological and Metabolic Engineering, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC), Beijing, China.', 'Texas Therapeutics Institute, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, Texas.

We searched the PubMed database and Google Scholar engine using English-language article (1980-2019) using the terms 'Neutropenia,' 'Leukemia,' 'Mutation,' and 'Polymorphism.' Patients with neutropenia have leukemia-related genetic abnormalities which are noticeable as mutations and chromosome abnormalities. The presence of mutations in patients with neutropenia can affect the biological function of neutrophils and increase the likelihood of leukemia progression, which can be important in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients. NIM can play an important role in leukemia development via enhancing intracellular signaling, apoptosis inhibition, and effects on transcription factors in patients with neutropenia. Therefore, the detection of genetic risk factors can be useful in prognosis, early diagnosis, and prevention of leukemia development.","['Shahrabi, Saeid', 'Maleknia, Mohsen', 'Tavakolifar, Yousef', 'D Zayeri, Zeinab', 'Saki, Najmaldin']","['Shahrabi S', 'Maleknia M', 'Tavakolifar Y', 'D Zayeri Z', 'Saki N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3362-750X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4559-6525', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6420-1990', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8621-5904', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8494-5594']","['Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur, University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Pediatric Health Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur, University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Thalassemia & Hemoglobinopathy Research Center, Health Research Institute, Ahvaz Jundishapur, University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190619,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology/genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Neutrophils/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,2019/06/20 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1630622 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Dec;60(14):3363-3374. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1630622.

The expression of HOXA9 homeoprotein is associated with anterior-posterior patterning during embryonic development, and its expression is then abolished in most adult cells, with the exception of hematopoietic progenitor cells. The oncogenic function of HOXA9 was first assessed in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in the mixed-phenotype associated lineage leukemia (MPAL) subtype. HOXA9 expression in AML is associated with aggressiveness and a poor prognosis. Since then, HOXA9 has been involved in other hematopoietic malignancies and an increasing number of solid tumors. Despite this, HOXA9 was for a long time not targeted to treat cancer, mainly since, as a transcription factor, it belongs to a class of protein long considered to be an ""undruggable"" target; however, things have now evolved. The aim of the present review is to focus on the different aspects of HOXA9 targeting that could be achieved through multiple ways: (1) indirectly, through the inhibition of its expression, a strategy acting principally at the epigenetic level; or (2) directly, through the inhibition of its transcription factor function by acting at either the protein/protein interaction or the protein/DNA interaction interfaces.","['Lambert, Melanie', 'Alioui, Meryem', 'Jambon, Samy', 'Depauw, Sabine', 'Van Seuningen, Isabelle', 'David-Cordonnier, Marie-Helene']","['Lambert M', 'Alioui M', 'Jambon S', 'Depauw S', 'Van Seuningen I', 'David-Cordonnier MH']",,"['Univ.

Our previous study revealed that quercetin could suppress the expression of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) to achieve anti-inflammatory effects in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells. The present study explored whether quercetin can inhibit the interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in ARPE-19 cells. Prior to stimulation by IL-1beta, ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with quercetin at various concentrations (2.5-20 microM). The results showed that quercetin could dose-dependently decrease the mRNA and protein levels of ICAM-1, IL-6, IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). It also attenuated the adherence of the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 to IL-1beta-stimulated ARPE-19 cells. We also demonstrated that quercetin inhibited signaling pathways related to the inflammatory process, including phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase (IKK)alpha/beta, c-Jun, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) and nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB p65, and blocked the translocation of NF-kappaB p65 into the nucleus. Furthermore, MAPK inhibitors including an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 inhibitor (U0126), a p38 inhibitor (SB202190) and a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor (SP600125) decreased the expression of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1), but not ICAM-1. U0126 and SB202190 could inhibit the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1, but SP600125 could not. An NF-kappaB inhibitor (Bay 11-7082) also reduced the expression of ICAM-1, sICAM-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1. Taken together, these results provide evidence that quercetin protects ARPE-19 cells from the IL-1beta-stimulated increase in ICAM-1, sICAM-1, IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 production by blocking the activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways to ameliorate the inflammatory response.","['Cheng, Shu-Chen', 'Huang, Wen-Chung', 'S Pang, Jong-Hwei', 'Wu, Yi-Hong', 'Cheng, Ching-Yi']","['Cheng SC', 'Huang WC', 'S Pang JH', 'Wu YH', 'Cheng CY']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5219-7461', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7141-8971', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3250-7397']","['Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan 33372, Taiwan. kkaren0330@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan. kkaren0330@yahoo.com.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Health Industry Technology, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine and Research Center for Food and Cosmetic Safety, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan 33303, Taiwan. wchuang@mail.cgust.edu.tw.', 'Division of Allergy, Asthma, and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan 33305, Taiwan. wchuang@mail.cgust.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan. jonghwei@mail.cgu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan 33305, Taiwan. jonghwei@mail.cgu.edu.tw.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan. mzpjih@gmail.com.', 'Division of Chinese Internal Medicine, Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan 33372, Taiwan. mzpjih@gmail.com.', 'School of Traditional Chinese Medicine, College of Medicine, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan 33302, Taiwan. mzpjih@gmail.com.', 'Graduate Institute of Health Industry Technology, Research Center for Chinese Herbal Medicine and Research Center for Food and Cosmetic Safety, College of Human Ecology, Chang Gung University of Science and Technology, Taoyuan 33303, Taiwan. jennycheng@mail.cgust.edu.tw.', 'Department of Thoracic Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou 33305, Taiwan. jennycheng@mail.cgust.edu.tw.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou 33305, Taiwan. jennycheng@mail.cgust.edu.tw.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190617,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Retinal Pigment Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC6628093,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20122957 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20122957 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 17;20(12). pii: ijms20122957. doi: 10.3390/ijms20122957.,12,"['CMRPF3E0051-52, CMRPF3G0011-13, CMRPG3C0901 and BMRPD16/Chang Gung Memorial', 'Hospital, Linkou', 'NSC 101-2320-B-255 -003 -MY3/Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan', 'EZRPF3E0161, EZRPF3E0201/Chang Gung University of Science and Technology']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['anti-inflammatory', 'chemokines', 'cytokines', 'quercetin', 'retinal pigment epithelial cells']",,,,,,,,,,,

The most common diagnoses were leukemia/lymphoma (36%), brain tumors (37%), and malignant solid tumors (26%). The most common indications were chemotherapy-related nausea, pain, and cancer cachexia. The age range at certification was 1.4-28.7 years (median 15.3 years). The time from cancer diagnosis to certification ranged from 0.5-197 months (median 8.9 months). The majority (94%) were certified during their first line of treatment.

Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical functioning as well as psychosocial aspects of emotional and social functioning. This study explored factors related to HRQoL in Asian pediatric patients with leukemia in Singapore. The available variables included: age, treatment duration, household income, gender, ethnicity, religion, diagnosis, and phase of treatment. It is hypothesized that the relationships will be significant. In the current study, there were 60 patients (60% males) with leukemia; their ages ranged from 1 to 21 years (Mean = 8.03, Standard Deviation = 4.55). The hypothesis was partially supported. Age had a significant positive relationship with physical functioning, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05, physical health, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05, and the total HRQoL score, r(60) = 0.29, p < 0.05. Treatment duration had a positive relationship with school functioning, r(60) = 0.28, p < 0.05. All other correlations were statistically non-significant. The effects of the available psychosocial variables of gender, ethnicity, and religion were examined on scores from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL). Ethnicity had a significant effect on social functioning, U = 292.00, p < 0.05, r = 0.3 (medium effect size). Specifically, Chinese (Median = 85.00, n = 33) had significantly higher scores on social functioning than others (Median = 70.00, n = 27). The remaining comparisons were statistically non-significant. The current findings added to QoL research, and provided an impetus for more research in the area of HRQoL for children with leukemia in Singapore.","['Choo, Carol C', 'Chew, Peter K H', 'Tan, Pinhong', 'Choo, Jessica Q', 'Choo, Amanda M H', 'Ho, Roger C', 'Quah, Thuan Chong']","['Choo CC', 'Chew PKH', 'Tan P', 'Choo JQ', 'Choo AMH', 'Ho RC', 'Quah TC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7868-5757', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5243-1481', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5568-4188', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9629-4493']","['Department of Psychology, College of Healthcare Sciences, James Cook University, Singapore 387380, Singapore. carol.choo@jcu.edu.au.', 'Department of Psychology, College of Healthcare Sciences, James Cook University, Singapore 387380, Singapore. peter.chew@jcu.edu.au.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119228, Singapore. wnozer@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119228, Singapore. jessica-choo@hotmail.com.', 'Cambridge Biomedical Campus, University of Cambridge School of Clinical Medicine, Cambridge CB2 0SP, UK. amhc2@cam.ac.uk.', 'Department of Psychological Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119228, Singapore. pcmrhcm@nus.edu.sg.', 'Institute for Health Innovation and Technology (iHealthtech), National University of Singapore, Singapore 117599, Singapore. pcmrhcm@nus.edu.sg.', 'Center of Excellence in Behavioral Medicine, Nguyen Tat Thanh University, Ho Chi Minh City 70000, Vietnam. pcmrhcm@nus.edu.sg.', 'Faculty of Education, Huaibei Normal University, 100 Dongshan Road, Huaibei 235000, China. pcmrhcm@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National University of Singapore, 1E Kent Ridge Road, Singapore 119228, Singapore. paeqtc@nus.edu.sg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190612,Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*psychology', 'Male', 'Pediatrics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Singapore', '*Social Adjustment', '*Stress, Psychological', 'Young Adult']",PMC6617504,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph16122069 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph16122069 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2019 Jun 12;16(12). pii: ijerph16122069. doi: 10.3390/ijerph16122069.,12,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia', '*age', '*health-related quality of life', '*pediatric']",,,,,,,,,,,

The recoding machinery is centered around two dedicated RNA components: The selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) located in the 3' UTR of the mRNA and the selenocysteine-tRNA (Sec-tRNA([Ser]Sec)). This translational UGA-selenocysteine recoding event by the ribosome is a limiting stage of selenoprotein expression. Its efficiency is controlled by the SECIS, the Sec-tRNA([Ser]Sec) and their interacting protein partners. In the present work, we used a recently developed CRISPR strategy based on murine leukemia virus-like particles (VLPs) loaded with Cas9-sgRNA ribonucleoproteins to inactivate the Sec-tRNA([Ser]Sec) gene in human cell lines. We showed that these CRISPR-Cas9-VLPs were able to induce efficient genome-editing in Hek293, HepG2, HaCaT, HAP1, HeLa, and LNCaP cell lines and this caused a robust reduction of selenoprotein expression. The alteration of selenoprotein expression was the direct consequence of lower levels of Sec-tRNA([Ser]Sec) and thus a decrease in translational recoding efficiency of the ribosome. This novel strategy opens many possibilities to study the impact of selenoprotein deficiency in hard-to-transfect cells, since these CRISPR-Cas9-VLPs have a wide tropism.","['Vindry, Caroline', 'Guillin, Olivia', 'Mangeot, Philippe E', 'Ohlmann, Theophile', 'Chavatte, Laurent']","['Vindry C', 'Guillin O', 'Mangeot PE', 'Ohlmann T', 'Chavatte L']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2038-0288', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7696-2431']","['Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), 69007 Lyon, France. caroline.vindry@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite U1111, 69007 Lyon, France. caroline.vindry@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69342 Lyon, France. caroline.vindry@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL1), 69622 Lyon, France. caroline.vindry@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche 5308 (UMR5308), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), 69007 Lyon, France. caroline.vindry@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), 69007 Lyon, France. olivia.guillin@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite U1111, 69007 Lyon, France. olivia.guillin@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69342 Lyon, France. olivia.guillin@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL1), 69622 Lyon, France. olivia.guillin@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche 5308 (UMR5308), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), 69007 Lyon, France. olivia.guillin@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), 69007 Lyon, France. philippe.mangeot@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite U1111, 69007 Lyon, France. philippe.mangeot@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69342 Lyon, France. philippe.mangeot@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL1), 69622 Lyon, France. philippe.mangeot@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche 5308 (UMR5308), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), 69007 Lyon, France. philippe.mangeot@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), 69007 Lyon, France. theophile.ohlmann@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite U1111, 69007 Lyon, France. theophile.ohlmann@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69342 Lyon, France. theophile.ohlmann@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL1), 69622 Lyon, France. theophile.ohlmann@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche 5308 (UMR5308), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), 69007 Lyon, France. theophile.ohlmann@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Centre International de Recherche en Infectiologie (CIRI), 69007 Lyon, France. laurent.chavatte@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) Unite U1111, 69007 Lyon, France. laurent.chavatte@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, 69342 Lyon, France. laurent.chavatte@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Universite Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (UCBL1), 69622 Lyon, France. laurent.chavatte@ens-lyon.fr.', 'Unite Mixte de Recherche 5308 (UMR5308), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), 69007 Lyon, France. laurent.chavatte@ens-lyon.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190611,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (Codon, Terminator)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acid-Specific)', '0 (Selenoproteins)', '0 (tRNA, selenocysteine-)', '0CH9049VIS (Selenocysteine)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/*genetics', 'Codon, Terminator/*genetics', 'Gene Editing', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'INDEL Mutation/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acid-Specific/chemistry/*genetics', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Selenium/metabolism', 'Selenocysteine/*metabolism', 'Selenoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Virion/*metabolism']",PMC6627462,2019/06/20 06:00,2019/06/20 06:01,['2019/06/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/20 06:01 [medline]']","['cells8060574 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8060574 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Jun 11;8(6). pii: cells8060574. doi: 10.3390/cells8060574.,6,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CRISPR-Cas9', '*SECIS', '*Sec-tRNA[Ser]Sec', '*UGA-recoding', '*nanoblades', '*selenium', '*selenocysteine', '*selenoprotein', '*viral-like particles']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 22 newly diagnosed, untreated AML patients as well as 26 healthy controls were enrolled. Percentages of cTfh and cTfr cells were detected using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared to healthy controls, a significantly higher percentage of cTfr cells was observed in AML patients (4.10 +/- 11.18 vs. 0.63 +/- 0.38%) (p < 0.05). In addition, a significantly lower cTfh/cTfr ratio was found in the AML patients' group when compared to the control group (9.04 +/- 9.19 vs. 11.66 +/- 5.68) (p < 0.05). A lower level of plasma IL-2 and TGF-beta1 was found in AML patients. Based on the complete remission (CR) response after one cycle of inductive chemotherapy, patients were divided into two groups at sample collection: AML with and without CR. Significantly lower percentages of cTfr cells and a higher cTfh/cTfr ratio were found in the group of AML patients with CR than in the AML patients without CR. CONCLUSION: There was a significantly higher percentage of cTfr cells in AML patients. cTfr cells may have a potential association with the pathogenesis of AML patients.","['Guo, Zhenxing', 'Chen, Zhenping', 'Xu, Yaru', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Hu, Liangding', 'Yu, Fan', 'Chai, Junyue', 'Liu, Li', 'Ren, Xiuhong']","['Guo Z', 'Chen Z', 'Xu Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Hu L', 'Yu F', 'Chai J', 'Liu L', 'Ren X']",,"['Department of Hematology/Oncology, First Hospital of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, gzx2962@outlook.com.', ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, First Hospital of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the 307 Hospital of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the 307 Hospital of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Beijing No. 6 Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, First Hospital of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology, First Hospital of Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190618,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*cytology/immunology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/blood', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['000500588 [pii]', '10.1159/000500588 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2020;143(1):19-25. doi: 10.1159/000500588.

The structures of the synthesized compounds were proved by IR, mass, NMR (2D) spectra and elemental analyses. The target compounds were evaluated for their in vitro cytotoxic activity against 60 cancer cell lines according to NCI protocol. Consequently, seven compounds were further examined against the most sensitive cell lines, leukemia CCRF-CEM, and MOLT-4. 5-Amino-1-(6-bromo-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinolin-4-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3,4-dicarbonitrile (7f) was the most active product, with IC50=1.35 uM and 2.42 uM against MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM, respectively. Also, it showed a remarkable inhibitory activity compared to erlotinib on the EGFR TK with IC50=247.14nM and 208.42nM, respectively. Cell cycle analysis of MOLT-4 cells treated with 7f showed cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase (supported by Caspases, BAX and Bcl-2 studies) with a significant pro-apoptotic activity as indicated by annexin V-FITC staining. Moreover, the docking study indicated that both the pyrazole moiety and the quinolin-2-one ring showed good fitting into EGFR (PDB code: 1M17). In order to interpret SAR of the designed compounds, and provide a basis for further optimization, molecular docking of the synthesized compounds to known EGFR inhibitors was performed. The study illustrated the effect of several factors on the compounds' activity.","['Elbastawesy, Mohammed A I', 'Aly, Ashraf A', 'Ramadan, Mohamed', 'Elshaier, Yaseen A M M', 'Youssif, Bahaa G M', 'Brown, Alan B', 'El-Din A Abuo-Rahma, Gamal']","['Elbastawesy MAI', 'Aly AA', 'Ramadan M', 'Elshaier YAMM', 'Youssif BGM', 'Brown AB', 'El-Din A Abuo-Rahma G']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Organic Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, 71524 Assiut, Egypt.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Minia University, 61519 Minia, Egypt.

Conventional myeloablative conditioning followed by allogeneic blood or marrow transplantation is associated with significantly less relapse compared with reduced-intensity conditioning when performed in younger patients with AML or MDS, but the toxicity of this approach in older patients is prohibitive. We hypothesized that pharmacokinetic targeting to optimize busulfan (BU) exposure, combined with the administration of azacitidine (AZA) post-transplant would mitigate the risk of relapse while reducing nonrelapse mortality and ultimately improve progression-free survival (PFS). On this phase II multicenter study, 63 patients (40 unrelated donors and 23 matched related donors) received a uniform conditioning regimen consisting of fludarabine i.v. (days -7 to -3), BU targeted to a daily area under the curve (AUC) of 4000 muM/min (days -6 to -3) after the administration of a 25-mg/m(2) i.v. test dose on 1 day between days -14 to -9, and antithymocyte globulin (days -6, -5, and -4 (2 doses for matched related donors and 3 for matched unrelated donors only). Beginning on days +42 to +90, all patients were planned to receive up to 6 monthly cycles of AZA at 32mg/m(2) subcutaneously for 5 days. The median age was 62 years (range, 44 to 74); 13 had AML and 50 had MDS; 87% of patients were within 20% of the target AUC based on a validation sample. Forty-one patients (65%) started AZA at a median of 61 days (range, 43 to 91) post-transplant, and 17 patients (41%) completed all 6 cycles of AZA. The cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality at 2 years was 33.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22%-45%). The cumulative incidence of relapse was 25% (95% CI, 15%-37%) at 2 years. With a median follow-up of 58.9 months, the estimated PFS probability at 2 years and 5 years after transplantation was 41.2% (80% CI, 33.9%-49.9%) and 26.9% (80% CI, 20.4%-35.5%), respectively, for the entire group with a median PFS of 15.8 months (95% CI, 6.7 to 28.3). The probability of overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 45.7% (95% CI, 34.9%-59.9%) and 31.2% (95% CI, 21.3% to 45.8%), respectively, for the entire group with a median overall survival of 19.2 months (95% CI, 8.7 to 37.5). In summary, we demonstrated the feasibility of a novel reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with test dose BU targeted to an AUC of 4000 muM/min. The feasibility of AZA in this setting appears to be limited if applied to an unselected population of older hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients.

We evaluated the impact of early CMV reactivation and changes in NK cell subset recovery on relapse rate and survival after haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haploSCT) for acute leukemia. Fifty patients with acute leukemia who received haploSCT were analyzed. Expression of T cells and specific receptors (NKG2A, NKG2D, DNAM1, and CD57) on circulating NK cells (CD56(bright)CD16(dim/)(-) or CD56(dim)CD16(+) cells) was serially measured using multiparametric flow cytometry. CMV reactivation during the first 100 days was observed in 41 patients (82%) at a median of 23 days after haploSCT. The incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD tended to be higher in patients with CMV reactivation, although this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis showed that CMV reactivation (P=.011) and a dose of infused T cells > 3.2x10(8)/kg (P=.027) were independent predictors of a reduced relapse risk and only CMV reactivation (P=.029) was an independent predictor of improved leukemia-free survival. CD56(bright)CD16(dim/-)DNAM1(+)NK cell counts increased from day 30 to 90 in patients with CMV reactivation but decreased after day 30 in patients without CMV reactivation. An increase in CD56(bright)CD16(dim/-)DNAM1(+) NK cells was not associated with the occurrence of chronic GVHD but was associated with a reduced cumulative relapse rate (16.4% versus 58.0%, P=.019). Multivariate analysis indicates that an increase in the CD56(bright)CD16(dim/-)DNAM1(+)NK cell count was an independent predictor of reduced relapse risk. Our study demonstrates a significant correlation between low relapse rates and CMV reactivation as well as the recovery of CD56(bright)CD16(dim/-)DNAM1(+) NK cells, providing valuable information for understanding the plausible immunologic mechanism of the graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Jang, Ji Eun', 'Hwang, Doh Yu', 'Chung, Haerim', 'Kim, Soo-Jeong', 'Eom, Ju-In', 'Jeung, Hoi-Kyung', 'Song, Jaewoo', 'Kim, Jin Seok', 'Cheong, June-Won', 'Min, Yoo Hong']","['Jang JE', 'Hwang DY', 'Chung H', 'Kim SJ', 'Eom JI', 'Jeung HK', 'Song J', 'Kim JS', 'Cheong JW', 'Min YH']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Avison Biomedical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Avison Biomedical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

However, some patients may prefer radiation without hormone therapy, for which there is minimal modern data. We modeled the comparative efficacy of aromatase inhibition alone without radiation versus radiation alone without hormone therapy. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We constructed a patient-level Markov model and compared 5 years of anastrozole to a 15-fraction course of radiation without boost or anastrozole. The relative effectiveness between treatments was based on the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-21 trial, which was further adjusted such that the endocrine-alone arm matched the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9343 and PRIME II trials. Common or severe side effects were considered. Eight survival metrics were assessed and validated against clinical trial data. The cost-efficacy of each strategy was considered using the quality-adjusted life year and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). RESULTS: The model's predicted outcomes matched those demonstrated by modern trials. Aromatase inhibitors were superior in preventing contralateral cancers, with a small impact on the risk of distant metastatic disease. Radiation was superior in preventing ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence with a small impact on regional failure. No clinically significant differences were seen in the other 4 oncologic endpoints. Differences in quality-adjusted life years were small, but radiation therapy was $3809 more expensive over the average lifetime. The ICER suggested anastrozole was cost-effective in 62% of probabilistic simulations. However, the ICER was unstable owing to a denominator that approached zero. CONCLUSIONS: Women age 70 or above with low-risk early breast cancer who are reluctant or unable to pursue adjuvant aromatase inhibition can safely pursue adjuvant radiation alone with limited differences in outcome and a modest increase in costs.","['Ward, Matthew C', 'Vicini, Frank', 'Chadha, Manjeet', 'Pierce, Lori', 'Recht, Abram', 'Hayman, James', 'Thaker, Nikhil G', 'Khan, Atif', 'Keisch, Martin', 'Shah, Chirag']","['Ward MC', 'Vicini F', 'Chadha M', 'Pierce L', 'Recht A', 'Hayman J', 'Thaker NG', 'Khan A', 'Keisch M', 'Shah C']",,"['Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, Charlotte, North Carolina.', '21st Century Oncology, Farmington Hills, Michigan.', 'Ichan School of Medicine at Mt.

Data regarding outcome to frontline immuno-chemotherapy are conflicting. Although the prognostic impact of the tumour microenvironment (TME) in EBV(-neg) DLBCL is well-established, it remains untested whether the TME influences survival in EBV(-pos) DLBCL. There are no data with new digital gene expression technologies that simultaneously interrogate the virus, B cells and the tumour microenvironment (TME). METHODS: We used the NanoString platform in a population-based cohort of 433 patients to establish if the technology could detect EBV in the tumour biopsies and to investigate the influence that EBV has on the complex tumour microenvironment of DLBCL. RESULTS: Incidence of EBV(-pos) DLBCL was 6.9% with 5-year survival of 65% vs 82% in EBV(-neg) DLBCL (P = 0.018). EBV(-pos) tissues had similar expression of T-cell genes compared to EBV(-neg) DLBCL but higher levels of the antigen-presenting molecule B2M. This was countered by elevated PD-L1, PD-L2, LAG3 and TIM3 immune checkpoints and a higher CD163/CD68 ""M2"" macrophage score. CONCLUSION: In EBV(-pos) DLBCL, the TME is immuno-tolerogenic and may explain the poor outcomes seen in this subtype of DLBCL.","['Keane, Colm', 'Tobin, Joshua', 'Gunawardana, Jay', 'Francis, Santiyagu', 'Gifford, Grace', 'Gabrielli, Sara', 'Gill, Anthony', 'Stevenson, William', 'Talaulikar, Dipti', 'Gould, Clare', 'Jain, Sanjiv', 'Birch, Simone', 'Hertzberg, Mark', 'Gandhi, Maher K']","['Keane C', 'Tobin J', 'Gunawardana J', 'Francis S', 'Gifford G', 'Gabrielli S', 'Gill A', 'Stevenson W', 'Talaulikar D', 'Gould C', 'Jain S', 'Birch S', 'Hertzberg M', 'Gandhi MK']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9009-9934'],"['Mater Research, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Mater Research, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Mater Research, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Mater Research, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'NSW Health Pathology, Department of Anatomical Pathology, Royal North Shore Hospital, St Leonards, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Kolling Institute of Medical Research, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.', 'Australia National University Medical School, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.', 'Mater Research, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Canberra Hospital, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.', 'Australia National University Medical School, Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Pathology Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Mater Research, Translational Research Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190724,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/etiology/virology', 'Gene Expression', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology']",PMC6899834,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13274 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Sep;103(3):200-207. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13274.

Raised values of WT1 have been associated with progression in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the available bone marrow (BM) samples from 115 patients with myeloid neoplasms obtained before and during treatment with 5-azacytidine. A threshold of 100 copies in BM was used to define risk groups: group 1: patients with WT1 levels always below < 100 copies; group 2: cases with initial WT1 levels greater than 100 copies but with a conversion to sustained levels below 100; and group 3: cases with follow-up WT1 levels greater than 100. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included in group 1, 17 in group 2, and 78 in group 3. Survival analysis showed statistically significant differences in terms of OS between groups (p: 0.016). Patients in group 2 showed the best 5-year overall survival (OS). In multivariate analysis, only the cytogenetic risk category and receiving an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT) independently predicted the survival. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies are needed to assess whether BM WT1 levels could be useful to predict the survival of patients with myeloid neoplasms treated with 5-azacytidine.","['Santaliestra, Marta', 'Garrido, Ana', 'Carricondo, Maite', 'Bussaglia, Elena', 'Pratcorona, Marta', 'Blanco, Maria L', 'Gich, Ignasi', 'Hoyos, Montserrat', 'Esquirol, Albert', 'Garcia-Cadenas, Irene', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F']","['Santaliestra M', 'Garrido A', 'Carricondo M', 'Bussaglia E', 'Pratcorona M', 'Blanco ML', 'Gich I', 'Hoyos M', 'Esquirol A', 'Garcia-Cadenas I', 'Brunet S', 'Martino R', 'Sierra J', 'Nomdedeu JF']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3399-346X'],"['Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Epidemiology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de la Santa Creu I Sant Pau, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'IIB Sant Pau and Josep Carreras Leukemia Foundation, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190703,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13275 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Sep;103(3):208-214. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13275.

In 2013, the CAP was awarded a 5-year cooperative agreement grant from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increase the effectiveness of LPGs. OBJECTIVE.-: To assess the awareness and adoption of 2 CAP LPGs: immunohistochemical (IHC) assay validation and initial workup of acute leukemia. DESIGN.-: Baseline surveys for each LPG were conducted in 2010 and 2015, respectively. To measure the adoption of guideline recommendations and inform future updates, a follow-up study consisting of surveys, telephone interviews, and focus group sessions was conducted in laboratories that indicated they perform IHC testing. A follow-up study for the acute leukemia LPG is planned. RESULTS.-: For the IHC Validation LPG, a total of 1624 survey responses, 40 telephone interviews, and discussions with 5 focus group participants were analyzed. The response rate for the aforementioned 3 modalities was 46%, 13%, and 3%, respectively. All modalities indicated most respondents were aware of the LPG and had adopted most or all of its recommendations. Respondents expressed needs for continued communication, increased specificity, and more prescriptive recommendations when the guideline is updated. CONCLUSIONS.-: While data-driven development of evidence-based LPGs requires significant resources, active data collection to identify gaps and assess adoption contributes to improved laboratory testing practices in support of patient care. The CAP identified sustainable modalities to track metrics and developed multiple tools that should improve guideline development, adoption, and implementation. Of these modalities, written or electronic surveys were the most logistically feasible and had the highest response rate.","['Goldsmith, Jeffrey D', 'Fitzgibbons, Patrick L', 'Fatheree, Lisa A', 'Astles, J Rex', 'Nowak, Jan A', 'Souers, Rhona J', 'Volmar, Keith E', 'Nakhleh, Raouf E']","['Goldsmith JD', 'Fitzgibbons PL', 'Fatheree LA', 'Astles JR', 'Nowak JA', 'Souers RJ', 'Volmar KE', 'Nakhleh RE']",,"[""From the Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, Massachusetts (Dr Goldsmith);

Here we present and validate a fluorescence-based platform for high-throughput and cost-effective quantification of global genomic 5-hmC levels. We utilized the assay to characterize cancerous tissues based on their 5-hmC content, and observed a pronounced reduction in 5-hmC level in various cancer types. We present data for glioblastoma, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and pancreatic cancer, compared to corresponding controls.

We have found that menin functions in promoting proper cell division. Here, we show that menin localizes to the mitotic spindle poles and the mitotic spindle during early mitosis and to the intercellular bridge microtubules during cytokinesis in HeLa cells. In our study, menin depletion led to defects in spindle assembly and chromosome congression during early mitosis, lagging chromosomes during anaphase, defective cytokinesis, multinucleated interphase cells, and cell death. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of the menin-MLL1 interaction also led to similar cell division defects. These results indicate that menin and the menin-MLL1 interaction are important for proper cell division. These results highlight a function for menin in cell division and aid our understanding of how mutation and misregulation of menin promotes tumorigenesis.","['Sawicki, Mark P', 'Gholkar, Ankur A', 'Torres, Jorge Z']","['Sawicki MP', 'Gholkar AA', 'Torres JZ']",,"['Department of Surgery, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Surgery, University of California, Los Angeles David Geffen School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, California.', 'Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MEN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['*Cell Division', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Spindle Apparatus/*physiology']",PMC6656424,2019/06/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['5519300 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2019-00274 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2019 Aug 1;160(8):1926-1936. doi: 10.1210/en.2019-00274.,8,['T32 GM007185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Endocrine Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow aspirate and targeted biopsy of the humeral head excluded blast cell crisis, in contrast to previously reported cases.

RESULTS: Our results showed that his-mir-335 was a critical regulatory of homeobox A gene family. PBX3, KAT6A, MEIS1, and COMMD3-BMI1 were predicted as top transcription regulators in the regulatory network of the HOXA family. The most significantly enriched functions were cell growth, proliferation, and survival in the mRNA-miRNA network.

First-line time-to-next-treatment was longer for patients treated in the later years towards 2015, while second-line time-to-next-treatment did not improve over time. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that improved treatment outcomes over time were likely influenced by patient characteristics and treatments, but also through other factors unexplored in this study. Hence, further research on the factors influencing patients' survival over time is needed. In particular, research on using B/BR in clinical practice is warranted.","['Lindstrom, Vesa', 'Hakkarainen, Katja M', 'Mehtala, Juha', 'Klement, Riho', 'Leval, Amy', 'Jarvinen, Tiina M']","['Lindstrom V', 'Hakkarainen KM', 'Mehtala J', 'Klement R', 'Leval A', 'Jarvinen TM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8646-314X'],"['Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center and University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'StatFinn & EPID Research, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'StatFinn & EPID Research, Espoo, Finland.', 'StatFinn & EPID Research, Tartu, Estonia.', 'Janssen-Cilag Ab, Solna, Sweden.', 'Janssen-Cilag Oy, Espoo, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",20190725,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/history/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time-to-Treatment']",PMC6851967,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13273 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Sep;103(3):190-199. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13273.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum level of miRNA-485-5p in AML patients and healthy controls was determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). MiRNA-485-5p level in AML cell lines was detected by qRT-PCR as well. Proliferative and apoptotic changes in AML5 and U937 cells overexpressing miRNA-485-5p were assessed. Subsequently, the regulatory effect of miRNA-485-5p on SALL4 level was evaluated. Rescue experiments were conducted to uncover the role of miRNA-485-5p/SALL4 regulatory loop in regulating cellular behaviors of AML. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, serum level of miRNA-485-5p was lower in AML patients. MiRNA-485-5p was similarly downregulated in AML cell lines. Overexpression of miRNA-485-5p stimulated proliferation and alleviated apoptosis in AML. SALL4 level was downregulated by transfection of miRNA-485-5p mimics in AML5 and U937 cells. Overexpression of SALL4 could reverse the regulatory effect of miRNA-485-5p on proliferative and apoptotic abilities of AML. CONCLUSIONS: MiRNA-485-5p is downregulated in AML. Overexpression of miRNA-485-5p alleviates the malignant progression of AML through downregulating SALL4.","['-L-Wang, W', 'Wang, H-R', 'Ji, W-G', 'Guo, S-L', 'Li, H-X', 'Xu, X-Y']","['-L-Wang W', 'Wang HR', 'Ji WG', 'Guo SL', 'Li HX', 'Xu XY']",,"['Department of Hematopathology, Luoyang Central Hospital, Luoyang, China. wangmai510@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN485 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (SALL4 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201906_18071 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Jun;23(11):4842-4849. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201906_18071.,11,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, identification of new, potent, and safe anticancer agents through drug repurposing has been regarded as an expeditious alternative to traditional drug development. The cyclooxygenase-2 is known to be over-expressed in several types of human cancer. For this reason cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition may be useful tool for cancer chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE: The first aim of the study was to develop a validated linear model to predict antitumor activity. Subsequently, applicability of the model for repurposing these cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors as antitumor compounds to abridge drug development process. METHODS: We performed a quantitative structure-toxicity relationship (QSTR) study on a set of coumarin derivatives using a large set of molecular descriptors. A linear model predicting growth inhibition on leukemia CCRF cell lines was developed and consequently validated internally and externally. Accordingly, the model was applied on a set of 143 cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor coumarin derivatives to explore their antitumor activity. RESULTS: The results indicated that the developed QSAR model would be useful for estimating inhibitory activity of coumarin derivatives on leukemia cell lines. Electronegativity was found to be a prominent property of the molecules in describing antitumor activity. The applicability domain of the developed model highlighted the potential antitumor compounds. CONCLUSION: The promising results revealed that applied integrated in silico approach for repurposing by combining both the biological activity similarity and the molecular similarity via the computational method could be efficiently used to screen potential antitumor compounds among cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.","['Tugcu, Gulcin', 'Sipahi, Hande', 'Aydin, Ahmet']","['Tugcu G', 'Sipahi H', 'Aydin A']",,"['Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Yeditepe University, Istanbul-34755, Turkey.', 'Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Yeditepe University, Istanbul-34755, Turkey.', 'Department of Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Yeditepe University, Istanbul-34755, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Curr Top Med Chem,Current topics in medicinal chemistry,101119673,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coumarins/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Repositioning', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', '*Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['CTMC-EPUB-98988 [pii]', '10.2174/1568026619666190618143552 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Top Med Chem. 2019;19(13):1121-1128. doi: 10.2174/1568026619666190618143552.,13,,,,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",['NOTNLM'],"['CCRF', 'COX-2', 'Coumarin', 'Drug repurposing', 'Leukemia', 'QSTR.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Further, the amount of transporter is usually expressed as a number of ABCB1 molecules per cell. In contrast, the substrate concentration in cell membranes is estimated by determination of substrate-lipid partition coefficient, as examples. In this study, we demonstrate an approach, which enables us to estimate the concentration of ABCB1 molecules within plasma membranes. For this purpose, human leukemia K562 cells with varying expression levels of ABCB1 were used: drug selected K562/Dox and K562/HHT cells with very high transporter expression, and K562/DoxDR2, K562/DoxDR1, and K562/DoxDR05 cells with gradually decreased expression of ABCB1 derived from K562/Dox cells using RNA interference technology. First, we determined the absolute amount of ABCB1 in cell lysates using immunoblotting and recombinant ABCB1 as a standard. We then determined the relative portion of transporter residing in the plasma membrane using immunohistochemistry in nonpermeabilized and permeabilized cells. These results enabled us to estimate the concentration of ABCB1 in the plasma membrane in resistant cells. The ABCB1 concentrations in the plasma membrane of drug selected K562/Dox and K562/HHT cells containing the highest amount of transporter reached millimolar levels. Concentrations of ABCB1 in the plasma membrane of resistant K562/DoxDR2, K562/DoxDR1, and K562/DoxDR05 cells with lower transporter expression were proportionally decreased.","['Mlejnek, Petr', 'Kosztyu, Petr', 'Dolezel, Petr', 'Kimura, Yasuhisa', 'Cizkova, Katerina', 'Ruzickova, Eliska']","['Mlejnek P', 'Kosztyu P', 'Dolezel P', 'Kimura Y', 'Cizkova K', 'Ruzickova E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8253-1248'],"['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Cellular Biochemistry, Division of Applied Sciences, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190618,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/genetics/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA Interference']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/09/15 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2018/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29157 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Oct;120(10):18406-18414. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29157.

Increased glutamate synthesis via upregulation of glutaminase (GLS) activity in brain immune cells has been identified as one potential source of excess glutamate in HAND. However, direct evidence for this hypothesis in an animal model is lacking, and the viability of GLS as a drug target has not been explored. In this brief report, we demonstrate that GLS inhibition with the glutamine analogue 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) can reverse cognitive impairment in the EcoHIV-infected mouse model of HAND. However, due to peripheral toxicity DON is not amenable to clinical use in a chronic disease such as HAND. We thus tested JHU083, a novel, brain penetrant DON prodrug predicted to exhibit improved tolerability. Systemic administration of JHU083 reversed cognitive impairment in EcoHIV-infected mice similarly to DON, and simultaneously normalized EcoHIV-induced increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate and GLS activity in microglia-enriched brain CD11b + cells without observed toxicity. These studies support the mechanistic involvement of elevated microglial GLS activity in HAND pathogenesis, and identify JHU083 as a potential treatment option.

The objectives of the current analysis of observed data from adult patients randomized to venetoclax-rituximab in the phase III MURANO study were to characterize venetoclax pharmacokinetics (PKs) using a Bayesian approach, evaluate whether a previously developed population PK model for venetoclax can describe the PKs of venetoclax when administered with rituximab, and to determine post hoc estimates of PK parameters for the exposure-response analysis. METHODS: Parameter estimates and uncertainty estimated by a population PK model were used as priors. Additional covariate effects (CLL risk status, geographic region, and 17p deletion [del(17p)] status) were added to the model. The updated model was used to describe venetoclax PKs after repeated dosing in combination with rituximab, and to determine post hoc estimates of PK parameters for exposure-response analysis. RESULTS: The PK analysis included 600 quantifiable venetoclax PK samples from 182 patients in the MURANO study. Model evaluation using standard diagnostic plots, visual predictive checks, and normalized prediction distribution error plots indicated no model deficiencies. There was no significant relationship between venetoclax apparent clearance (CL/F) and bodyweight, age, sex, mild and moderate hepatic and renal impairment, or coadministration of weak cytochrome P450 3A inhibitors. The chromosomal abnormality del(17p) and CLL risk status had no apparent effect on the PKs of venetoclax. A minimal increase in venetoclax CL/F (approximately 7%) was observed after coadministration with rituximab. CL/F was 30% lower in patients from Central and Eastern Europe (n = 60) or Asia (n = 4) compared with other regions (95% confidence interval [CI] 21-39%). Apparent central volume of distribution was 30% lower (95% CI 22-38%) in females (n = 56) compared with males (n = 126). No clinically significant impact of region or sex was observed on key safety and efficacy outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The Bayesian model successfully characterized venetoclax PKs over time and confirmed key covariates affecting PKs in the MURANO study. The model was deemed appropriate for further use in simulations and for generating individual patient PK parameters for subsequent exposure-response evaluation.","['Deng, Rong', 'Gibiansky, Leonid', 'Lu, Tong', 'Agarwal, Priya', 'Ding, Hao', 'Li, Xiaobin', 'Kshirsagar, Smita', 'Lu, Dan', 'Li, Chunze', 'Girish, Sandhya', 'Wang, Jue', 'Boyer, Michelle', 'Humphrey, Kathryn', 'Freise, Kevin J', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Seymour, John F', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Miles, Dale']","['Deng R', 'Gibiansky L', 'Lu T', 'Agarwal P', 'Ding H', 'Li X', 'Kshirsagar S', 'Lu D', 'Li C', 'Girish S', 'Wang J', 'Boyer M', 'Humphrey K', 'Freise KJ', 'Salem AH', 'Seymour JF', 'Kater AP', 'Miles D']",,"['Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA. deng.rong@gene.com.', 'Clinical Pharmacology, Genentech Research and Early Development, 1 DNA Way, MS463a, South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA. deng.rong@gene.com.', 'QuantPharm, LLC, North Potomac, MD, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Roche Products Limited, Welwyn Garden City, UK.', 'Roche Products Limited, Welwyn Garden City, UK.', 'AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'AbbVie, North Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Royal Melbourne Hospital, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, and University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, University of Amsterdam on behalf of HOVON CLL WG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Sex Factors', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-019-00788-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-019-00788-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2019 Dec;58(12):1621-1634. doi: 10.1007/s40262-019-00788-8.,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, by combining the excellent optical properties of carbon dots (CDs) with the favorable selectivity of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP), a novel fluorescent probe for lysozyme detection and cell imaging was constructed, where silanized CDs with low cytotoxicity (CDs/SiO2) were used as the fluorescence signal reporter and N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) was used as the temperature-sensitive monomer. The as-prepared CDs/SiO2/MIP showed a thermo-sensitive property for the response to lysozyme. Moreover, this probe could be used for quantitative detection of lysozyme, with a wider detection range (0.001~0.01 mg/mL), a low detection limit (0.55 mug/mL), and a high selectivity. Importantly, the MTT assay testified that the fluorescent CDs/SiO2/MIP probe had low cytotoxicity. In addition, human hepatoma carcinoma cells (HepG-2 cells) could be stained by the CDs/SiO2/MIP, and showed a bright intracellular green fluorescence, indicating that the imaging of live cells was possible. This study provides a new way to detect lysozyme in vitro and an attractive perspective to probe intracellular lysozyme in vivo.","['Fang, Mengyao', 'Zhuo, Kelei', 'Chen, Yujuan', 'Zhao, Yajing', 'Bai, Guangyue', 'Wang, Jianji']","['Fang M', 'Zhuo K', 'Chen Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Bai G', 'Wang J']",,"['Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Jianshe Eastern Road 48, Xinxiang, 453007, Henan, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Jianshe Eastern Road 48, Xinxiang, 453007, Henan, China. klzhuo@263.net.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Jianshe Eastern Road 48, Xinxiang, 453007, Henan, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Jianshe Eastern Road 48, Xinxiang, 453007, Henan, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Jianshe Eastern Road 48, Xinxiang, 453007, Henan, China.', 'Collaborative Innovation Center of Henan Province for Green Manufacturing of Fine Chemicals, Key Laboratory of Green Chemical Media and Reactions, Ministry of Education, School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Henan Normal University, Jianshe Eastern Road 48, Xinxiang, 453007, Henan, China.

Our group has recently reported that CK patients with major structural abnormalities (i.e. CK2) are characterised by a worse prognosis, as compared to other lesions within CK(CK1). METHODS: We performed a multicentre retrospective study to test whether the combination of CK subtypes with IGHV status could be a relevant prognostic and predictive tool. RESULTS: Among 522 patients 13% harboured CK2, 41% CK1 and/or U-IGHV (U-CK1) and 46% M-IGHV without any CK subtypes (M-noCK). After a median follow-up of 5.8 years, CK2 patients had the shortest TTFT (5-year TTFT 31%, 39 and 81%, p < 0.0001) and OS (5-year OS 67%, 85 and 93%, p < 0.0001) as compared to U-CK1 or M-noCK cases, regardless of TP53 abnormalities. CK2 patients also had the worst outcome after chemoimmunotherapy. In fact, the median TTNT after FCR or BR was 1.86 and 4.79 years for CK2 and U-CK1, but not reached for M-noCK patients (p < 0.0005). CONCLUSIONS: We herein suggest that the combined assessment of the IGHV mutational status and CK subtypes refines the prognostication of CLL, allowing to identify M-IGHV patients without any CK subtypes who are characterised by an indolent disease and excellent outcome after chemoimmunotherapy.","['Visentin, Andrea', 'Bonaldi, Laura', 'Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Martines, Annalisa', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Imbergamo, Silvia', 'Scomazzon, Edoardo', 'Pravato, Stefano', 'Bardi, Maria Antonella', 'Cavallari, Maurizio', 'Volta, Eleonora', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Nanni, Maurizio', 'Del Giudice, Ilaria', 'Facco, Monica', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Foa, Robin', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Visentin A', 'Bonaldi L', 'Rigolin GM', 'Mauro FR', 'Martines A', 'Frezzato F', 'Imbergamo S', 'Scomazzon E', 'Pravato S', 'Bardi MA', 'Cavallari M', 'Volta E', 'Cavazzini F', 'Nanni M', 'Del Giudice I', 'Facco M', 'Guarini A', 'Semenzato G', 'Foa R', 'Cuneo A', 'Trentin L']",,"['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padua, Italy.', 'Immunology and Molecular Oncology Unit, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCSS, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology section, Department of Medical Sciences, Azienda Ospedaliera-Universitaria, Arcispedale S.

Despite these significant advances there are still unanswered questions on patient management regarding how to more reliably predict treatment failure at the time of diagnosis and how to select frontline tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy for optimal outcome. The BCR-ABL1 transcript level at diagnosis has no established prognostic impact and cannot guide frontline TKI selection. BCR-ABL1 mutations are detected in ~50% of TKI resistant patients but are rarely responsible for primary resistance. Other resistance mechanisms are largely uncharacterized and there are no other routine molecular testing strategies to facilitate the evaluation and further stratification of TKI resistance. Advances in next-generation sequencing technology has aided the management of a growing number of other malignancies, enabling the incorporation of somatic mutation profiles in diagnosis, classification, and prognostication. A largely unexplored area in CML research is whether expanded genomic analysis at diagnosis, resistance, and disease transformation can enhance patient management decisions, as has occurred for other cancers. The aim of this article is to review publications that reported mutated cancer-associated genes in CML patients at various disease phases. We discuss the frequency and type of such variants at initial diagnosis and at the time of treatment failure and transformation. Current limitations in the evaluation of mutants and recommendations for future reporting are outlined. The collective evaluation of mutational studies over more than a decade suggests a limited set of cancer-associated genes are indeed recurrently mutated in CML and some at a relatively high frequency.

Fucosylation, catalyzed by fucosyltransferases (FUTs), is a post-translational modification that widely exists in cancer cells. However, the expression and clinical implication of the FUT family (FUT1-11) in AML has not been investigated. From the Cancer Genome Atlas database, a total of 155 AML patients with complete clinical characteristics and FUT1-11 expression data were included in our study. In patients who received chemotherapy alone showed that high expression levels of FUT3, FUT6, and FUT7 had adverse effects on event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) (all P < 0.05), whereas high FUT4 expression had favorable effects on EFS and OS (all P < 0.01). However, in the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) group, we only found a significant difference in EFS between the high and low FUT3 expression subgroups (P = 0.047), while other FUT members had no effect on survival. Multivariate analysis confirmed that high FUT4 expression was an independent favorable prognostic factor for both EFS (HR = 0.423, P = 0.001) and OS (HR = 0.398, P < 0.001), whereas high FUT6 expression was an independent risk factor for both EFS (HR = 1.871, P = 0.017) and OS (HR = 1.729, P = 0.028) in patients who received chemotherapy alone. Moreover, we found that patients with low FUT4 and high FUT6 expressions had the shortest EFS and OS (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that high expressions of FUT3/6/7 predict poor prognosis, high FUT4 expression indicates good prognosis in AML; FUT6 and FUT4 have the best prognosticating profile among them, but their effects could be neutralized by allo-HSCT.","['Dai, Yifeng', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Qian, Tingting', 'Quan, Liang', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Liu, Yan', 'Si, Chaozeng', 'Chen, Jinghong', 'Ye, Xu', 'Chen, Jingqi', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Wu, Depei', 'Zhang, Xinyou', 'Fu, Lin']","['Dai Y', 'Cheng Z', 'Pang Y', 'Jiao Y', 'Qian T', 'Quan L', 'Cui L', 'Liu Y', 'Si C', 'Chen J', 'Ye X', 'Chen J', 'Shi J', 'Wu D', 'Zhang X', 'Fu L']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3507-7414', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8837-9542', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1077-6422', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0478-4952', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2416-7572']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, 48073, USA.', 'Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Zhejiang University, 310058, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China.', 'Department of Operations and Information Management, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, 100029, Beijing, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 100853, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, 215006, Suzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Second Clinical Medical College (Shenzhen People's Hospital), Jinan University, 518020, Shenzhen, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, 510260, Guangzhou, China. fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, 475000, Kaifeng, China. fulin022@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190617,England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,['EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fucosyltransferases/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/19 06:00,2021/05/11 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41417-019-0115-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41417-019-0115-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2020 Feb;27(1-2):70-80. doi: 10.1038/s41417-019-0115-9.

Here, we attempted to disentangle the relationship between asparagine metabolism, glutamine metabolism, and downstream pathways that modulate cell viability by testing the hypothesis that ASNase anticancer activity is based on asparagine depletion rather than glutamine depletion per se. We tested ASNase wild-type (ASNase(WT)) and its glutaminase-deficient Q59L mutant (ASNase(Q59L)) and found that ASNase glutaminase activity contributed to durable anticancer activity against xenografts of the ASNS-negative Sup-B15 leukemia cell line in NOD/SCID gamma mice, whereas asparaginase activity alone yielded a mere growth delay.

Although very rare, the fusion proteoforms play important roles in biomedical science. For example, fusion proteoforms influence the development of tumors by serving as cancer markers or cell cycle regulators. Although numerous studies have reported bioinformatics tools that can predict fusion transcripts, few proteogenomic tools are available that can predict and identify proteoforms. In this study, we develop a versatile proteogenomic tool ""FusionPro,"" which facilitates the identification of fusion transcripts and their potential translatable peptides. FusionPro provides an independent gene fusion prediction module and can build sequence databases for annotated fusion proteoforms. FusionPro shows greater sensitivity than the available fusion finders when analyzing simulated or real RNA sequencing data sets. We use FusionPro to identify 18 fusion junction peptides and three potential fusion-derived peptides by MS/MS-based analysis of leukemia cell lines (Jurkat and K562) and ovarian cancer tissues from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium. Among the identified fusion proteins, we molecularly validate two fusion junction isoforms and a translation product of FAM133B:CDK6. Moreover, sequence analysis suggests that the fusion protein participates in the cell cycle progression. In addition, our prediction results indicate that fusion transcripts often have multiple fusion junctions and that these fusion junctions tend to be distributed in a nonrandom pattern at both the chromosome and gene levels. Thus, FusionPro allows users to detect various types of fusion translation products using a transcriptome-informed approach and to gain a comprehensive understanding of the formation and biological roles of fusion proteoforms.","['Kim, Chae-Yeon', 'Na, Keun', 'Park, Saeram', 'Jeong, Seul-Ki', 'Cho, Jin-Young', 'Shin, Heon', 'Lee, Min Jung', 'Han, Gyoonhee', 'Paik, Young-Ki']","['Kim CY', 'Na K', 'Park S', 'Jeong SK', 'Cho JY', 'Shin H', 'Lee MJ', 'Han G', 'Paik YK']",,"['double daggerInterdisciplinary Program of Integrated OMICS for Biomedical Science, The Graduate School, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea; section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'paragraph signDepartment of Pharmacy, College of Pharmacy, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.', 'section signYonsei Proteome Research Center, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea.

Therefore, identifying personalized treatment options for each patient early and accurately is essential. To address this, we developed a computational biology modeling (CBM) and digital drug simulation platform that relies on somatic gene mutations and gene CNVs found in malignant cells of individual patients. Drug treatment simulations based on unique patient-specific disease networks were used to generate treatment predictions. To evaluate the accuracy of the genomics-informed computational platform, we conducted a pilot prospective clinical study (NCT02435550) enrolling confirmed MDS and AML patients. Blinded to the empirically prescribed treatment regimen for each patient, genomic data from 50 evaluable patients were analyzed by CBM to predict patient-specific treatment responses. CBM accurately predicted treatment responses in 55 of 61 (90%) simulations, with 33 of 61 true positives, 22 of 61 true negatives, 3 of 61 false positives, and 3 of 61 false negatives, resulting in a sensitivity of 94%, a specificity of 88%, and an accuracy of 90%. Laboratory validation further confirmed the accuracy of CBM-predicted activated protein networks in 17 of 19 (89%) samples from 11 patients. Somatic mutations in the TET2, IDH1/2, ASXL1, and EZH2 genes were discovered to be highly informative of MDS response to hypomethylating agents. In sum, analyses of patient cancer genomics using the CBM platform can be used to predict precision treatment responses in MDS and AML patients.","['Drusbosky, Leylah M', 'Singh, Neeraj Kumar', 'Hawkins, Kimberly E', 'Salan, Cesia', 'Turcotte, Madeleine', 'Wise, Elizabeth A', 'Meacham, Amy', 'Vijay, Vindhya', 'Anderson, Glenda G', 'Kim, Charlie C', 'Radhakrishnan, Saumya', 'Ullal, Yashaswini', 'Talawdekar, Anay', 'Sikora, Huzaifa', 'Nair, Prashant', 'Khanna-Gupta, Arati', 'Abbasi, Taher', 'Vali, Shireen', 'Guha, Subharup', 'Farhadfar, Nosha', 'Murthy, Hemant S', 'Horn, Biljana N', 'Leather, Helen L', 'Castillo, Paul', 'Tucker, Caitlin', 'Cline, Christina', 'Pettiford, Leslie', 'Lamba, Jatinder K', 'Moreb, Jan S', 'Brown, Randy A', 'Norkin, Maxim', 'Hiemenz, John W', 'Hsu, Jack W', 'Slayton, William B', 'Wingard, John R', 'Cogle, Christopher R']","['Drusbosky LM', 'Singh NK', 'Hawkins KE', 'Salan C', 'Turcotte M', 'Wise EA', 'Meacham A', 'Vijay V', 'Anderson GG', 'Kim CC', 'Radhakrishnan S', 'Ullal Y', 'Talawdekar A', 'Sikora H', 'Nair P', 'Khanna-Gupta A', 'Abbasi T', 'Vali S', 'Guha S', 'Farhadfar N', 'Murthy HS', 'Horn BN', 'Leather HL', 'Castillo P', 'Tucker C', 'Cline C', 'Pettiford L', 'Lamba JK', 'Moreb JS', 'Brown RA', 'Norkin M', 'Hiemenz JW', 'Hsu JW', 'Slayton WB', 'Wingard JR', 'Cogle CR']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9205-2021', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0965-1737', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4534-4248', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0411-0007', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5422-6863']","['Division of Hematology Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Cellworks Research India Pvt.

However, patients with unmutated IGHV rarely have durable responses. Ibrutinib is active for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia irrespective of IGHV mutation status but requires continuous treatment. We postulated that time-limited ibrutinib plus FCR would induce durable responses in younger fit patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: We did a multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, single-arm phase 2 trial at seven sites in the USA. We enrolled patients aged 65 years or younger with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Our initial cohort (original cohort) was not restricted by prognostic marker status and included patients who had del(17p) or TP53 aberrations. After a protocol amendment (on March 21, 2017), we enrolled an additional cohort (expansion cohort) that included patients without del(17p). Ibrutinib was given orally (420 mg/day) for 7 days, then up to six 28-day cycles were administered intravenously of fludarabine (25 mg/m(2), days 1-3), cyclophosphamide (250 mg/m(2), days 1-3), and rituximab (375 mg/m(2) day 1 of cycle 1; 500 mg/m(2) day 1 of cycles 2-6) with continuous oral ibrutinib (420 mg/day). Responders continued on ibrutinib maintenance for up to 2 years, and patients with undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow after 2 years were able to discontinue treatment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response with undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow 2 months after the last cycle of ibrutinib plus FCR. Analyses were done per-protocol in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02251548) and is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between Oct 23, 2014, and April 23, 2018, 85 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were enrolled. del(17p) was detected in four (5%) of 83 patients and TP53 mutations were noted in three (4%) of 81 patients; two patients had both del(17p) and TP53 mutations. Median patients' age was 55 years (IQR 50-58). At data cutoff, median follow-up was 16.5 months (IQR 10.6-34.1). A complete response and undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow 2 months after the last cycle of ibrutinib plus FCR was achieved by 28 (33%, 95% CI 0.23-0.44) of 85 patients (p=0.0035 compared with a 20% historical value with FCR alone). A best response of undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow was achieved by 71 (84%) of 85 patients during the study. One patient had disease progression and one patient died (sudden cardiac death after 17 months of ibrutinib maintenance, assessed as possibly related to ibrutinib). The most common all-grade toxic effects were haematological, including thrombocytopenia in 63 (74%) patients, neutropenia in 53 (62%), and anaemia in 41 (49%). Grade 3 or 4 non-haematological serious adverse events included grade 3 atrial fibrillation in three (4%) patients and grade 3 Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in two (2%). INTERPRETATION: The proportion of patients who achieved undetectable minimal residual disease in bone marrow with ibrutinib plus FCR is, to our knowledge, the highest ever published in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia unrestricted by prognostic marker status. Ibrutinib plus FCR is promising as a time-limited combination regimen for frontline chronic lymphocytic leukaemia treatment in younger fit patients.

Highly priced second-generation TKIs might offer deep molecular response status more quickly and for more patients than imatinib; however, with the availability and lower cost of generic imatinib, the value of second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy for this particular treatment endpoint remains unknown. We aimed to assess the potential value of second-generation TKIs used as frontline therapy in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase in relation to the probability of achieving sustained deep molecular responses compared with generic imatinib, and the associated cost of each modality. METHODS: We used a decision analytic model to consider the value of different TKI approaches from the payer's perspective. The proportion of patients achieving sustained deep molecular response after 5 years of treatment in chronic phase was estimated at 26% with imatinib and 44% with second-generation TKIs. We also modelled more favourable scenarios of the proportion of patients achieving such response with second-generation TKIs at 66%, 88%, and a near-perfect response of 99%. For each scenario, we examined the impact of the combination of health utilities for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukaemia (base case 0.89, range 0-1) and the annual cost of second-generation TKIs (base case US$152 814 [ie, the price of nilotinib in the USA], range 0-240 000) on the cost-effectiveness of second-generation TKIs compared with generic imatinib. We used different price scenarios for generic imatinib in the USA (average price $35 000 per year; lowest price $4400 per year), Europe ($4000 per year), and developing countries ($2100 per year). We calculated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and assessed cost-effectiveness by considering two societal willingness-to-pay thresholds: $50 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in all markets and $200 000 per QALY in the USA. FINDINGS: In the base case, we obtained an ICER of $22 765 208, meaning that second-generation TKIs as frontline therapy to achieve sustained deep molecular response was not cost-effective under either of the societal willingness-to-pay thresholds. In our sensitivity analyses, none of the explored scenarios showed potential treatment value for use of second-generation TKIs at the current prices in the USA or at the price of $30 000-40 000 per year elsewhere. For example, considering a scenario in the USA using second-generation TKIs versus imatinib (annual price $4400 per year) with the potential benefit in favour of second-generation TKI (willingness to pay $200 000 per QALY, 66% of patients achieving sustained deep molecular response, and health utility of the chronic phase of 0.1), the cost of second-generation TKIs would need to be less than $25 000 per year to be a cost-effective option. Under the same conditions in developing nations, with a price of generic imatinib of $2100 per year and a willingness to pay of $50 000 per QALY, the annual price of second-generation TKIs should not exceed $10 000 per year of therapy. INTERPRETATION: Considering the current prices of second-generation TKIs and of generic imatinib under different pricing scenarios in the USA, Europe, and developing countries, second-generation TKIs at current prices do not offer good value as frontline therapy in chronic myeloid leukaemia in order to achieve sustained deep molecular response and treatment-free remission.

We conducted a retrospective study of 137 patients diagnosed with B-cell malignancies treated with ibrutinib compared with 106 patients treated with chemotherapy for the same cancers in order to quantify the rates and risk of AA in a ""real-world"" sample of cancer patients. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate for any statistically significant differences between groups. Logistic regression was used to generate odds ratios, adjusting for potential confounders. Incidence of AA was 14% (n=17) in ibrutinib-treated patients compared with 3% (n=3) in patients treated with chemotherapy (p=0.009). Ibrutinib-treated patients were significantly older (mean age 67 vs 63 years, p=0.003); however, there were no other significant differences in baseline characteristics. Ibrutinib use, age, hypertension, and previous use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blocker use, beta blocker use, and aspirin use were independently associated with incident arrhythmias. In multivariable analysis, patients treated with ibrutinib were associated with a 5-fold increased risk of developing AA (odds ratio=5.18, 95% confidence interval 1.42 to 18.89). In conclusion, the rates and risk of AA are higher in patients treated with ibrutinib compared with chemotherapy, and this study provides strong evidence that ibrutinib itself is an independent risk factor for the development of incident AA.","['Fradley, Michael G', 'Gliksman, Matthew', 'Emole, Josephine', 'Viganego, Federico', 'Rhea, Isaac', 'Welter-Frost, Allan', 'Armanious, Merna', 'Lee, Dae Hyun', 'Walko, Christine', 'Shah, Bijal', 'Chavez, Julio C', 'McLeod, Howard', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Schabath, Matthew B']","['Fradley MG', 'Gliksman M', 'Emole J', 'Viganego F', 'Rhea I', 'Welter-Frost A', 'Armanious M', 'Lee DH', 'Walko C', 'Shah B', 'Chavez JC', 'McLeod H', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Schabath MB']",,"['Cardio-Oncology Program, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of South Florida Morsani College of Medicine and H.

Lymphomagenesis is not a tumor-autonomous process, and the onset and progression of tumors requires reciprocal crosstalk with the tumor microenvironment (TME). Minimal residual disease and immunosurveillance are also regulated by factors in the TME. Here, we dissect the stromal compartment in lymphoid organs, focusing on conditions that are prevalent in an autochthonous environment for lymphoid neoplasia. Identification of tumor-promoting factors is instrumental in the selection of therapeutic targets that are part of the immune system. Targeting the TME is an appealing treatment option for lymphoma because this compartment is subject to low selective pressure for mutations.","['Hopken, Uta E', 'Rehm, Armin']","['Hopken UE', 'Rehm A']",,"['Department of Microenvironmental Regulation in Autoimmunity and Cancer, Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, MDC, 13125, Berlin, Germany.

Antibodies reactive to retroviruses have been documented in the serum of patients with LGL leukemia. Culture or molecular approaches have to date not been successful in identifying a retrovirus. METHODS: Because a retrovirus must integrate into the genome of an infected cell, we focused our efforts on detecting a novel retrovirus integration site in the clonally expanded LGL cells. We present a new computational tool that uses long-insert mate pair sequence data to search the genome of LGL leukemia cells for retrovirus integration sites. We also utilize recently published methods to interrogate the status of polymorphic human endogenous retrovirus type K (HERV-K) provirus in patient genomes. RESULTS: Our data show that there are no new retrovirus insertions in LGL genomes of LGL leukemia patients. However, our insertion call tool did detect four HERV-K provirus integration sites that are polymorphic in the human population but absent from the human reference genome, hg19. To determine if the prevalence of these or other polymorphic proviral HERV-Ks differed between LGL leukemia patients and the general population, we used a recently developed tool that reports sites in the human genome occupied by a known proviral HERV-K. We report that there are significant differences in the number of polymorphic HERV-Ks in the genomes of LGL leukemia patients of European origin compared to individuals with European ancestry in the 1000 genomes (KGP) data. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the clonal expansion of LGL cells in LGL leukemia is not driven by the integration of a new infectious or endogenous retrovirus, although we do not rule out that these cells are responding to retroviral antigens produced in other cell types. However, our computational analyses revealed that the genomes of LGL leukemia patients carry a higher burden of polymorphic HERV-K proviruses compare to individuals from KGP of European ancestry. Our research emphasizes the merits of comprehensive genomic assessment of HERV-K in cancer samples and suggests that further analyses to determine contributions of HERV-K to LGL leukemia are warranted.","['Li, Weiling', 'Yang, Lei', 'Harris, Robert S', 'Lin, Lin', 'Olson, Thomas L', 'Hamele, Cait E', 'Feith, David J', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', 'Poss, Mary']","['Li W', 'Yang L', 'Harris RS', 'Lin L', 'Olson TL', 'Hamele CE', 'Feith DJ', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Poss M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4147-2410'],"['The School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.', 'Department of Statistics, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, USA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, USA.', 'Department of Biology, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. maryposs@gmail.com.', 'Department of Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, 16802, USA. maryposs@gmail.com.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center and Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology & Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, 22908, USA. maryposs@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190617,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,IM,"['Genome, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*genetics/*virology', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",PMC6580525,2019/06/19 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12920-019-0549-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s12920-019-0549-9 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2019 Jun 17;12(1):88. doi: 10.1186/s12920-019-0549-9.,1,"['R01 CA170334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178393/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178393/NCI NIH HHS/National Cancer Institute/United States', 'R01 CA170334/NCI NIH HHS/National Cancer Institute/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Genomic insertion', '*HERV-K', '*Large granular lymphocyte leukemia', '*Retrovirus', '*Visualization tool']",,,,,,,,,,,

Upper respiratory tract (URT) colonization can be regarded as a major contributor to infection, so the relationship between carriage rates, disease incidence, or antibiotic resistance should be monitored. This prospective study included 50 newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with CLL and 38 healthy volunteers. A total of 264 samples obtained from anterior nares and oropharynx were microbiologically examined. A significantly higher frequency of S. aureus and Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) colonization in CLL patients was observed in comparison to healthy volunteers. Information regarding baseline characteristics; the Rai staging system; hematological tests results; immunophenotype of basic lymphocyte subsets, including the expression of programmed cell death-1 protein (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1); as well as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status were determined to analyze risk factors for infections and bacterial colonization. The data represent the basic information for identification of further risk factors of infection and bacterial oropharyngeal colonization in CLL patients. The rate of disease progression within the time from the CLL diagnosis was significantly higher in patients colonized by GNB. This study highlights EBV infection and frequencies of PD-1 positive T CD3(+) cells and B cells as risk factors in CLL patients.","['Korona-Glowniak, Izabela', 'Grywalska, Ewelina', 'Grzegorczyk, Agnieszka', 'Rolinski, Jacek', 'Glowniak, Andrzej', 'Malm, Anna']","['Korona-Glowniak I', 'Grywalska E', 'Grzegorczyk A', 'Rolinski J', 'Glowniak A', 'Malm A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1634-0387', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0451-4741', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5398-4179', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1503-7634']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. iza.glowniak@umlub.pl.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. ewelina.grywalska@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. aga.grzegorczyk@umlub.pl.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Immunotherapy, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. jacek.rolinski@gmail.com.', 'Department of Cardiology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. andrzej.glowniak@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Medical University of Lublin, 20-093 Lublin, Poland. anna.malm@umlub.pl.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190616,Switzerland,J Clin Med,Journal of clinical medicine,101606588,,,,PMC6616586,2019/06/19 06:00,2019/06/19 06:01,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/19 06:01 [medline]']","['jcm8060861 [pii]', '10.3390/jcm8060861 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Med. 2019 Jun 16;8(6). pii: jcm8060861. doi: 10.3390/jcm8060861.,6,['UMO-2012/05/B/NZ6/00792 and UMO-2016/21/B/NZ6/02279/Narodowe Centrum Nauki'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL patients', 'Gram-negative bacilli', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'nasal and oropharyngeal colonization', 'respiratory infections']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we trace the roles of RA/RARs signaling in the immune system (where this pathway has both an immunosuppressive role or is involved in the inflammatory response), in hematopoiesis (enhancing hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal, progenitor cells differentiation or maintaining the bone marrow microenvironment homeostasis), and in bone remodeling (where this pathway seems to have controversial effects on bone formation or osteoclast activation). Moreover, in this review is shown the involvement of RAR genes in multiple chromosomal rearrangements generating different fusion genes in hematological neoplasms, with a particular focus on acute promyelocytic leukemia and its variant subtypes. The effect of different RARs fusion proteins on leukemic transformation, on patients' outcome, and on therapy response is also discussed.","['Conserva, Maria Rosa', 'Anelli, Luisa', 'Zagaria, Antonella', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Albano, Francesco']","['Conserva MR', 'Anelli L', 'Zagaria A', 'Specchia G', 'Albano F']",,"['Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. mariarosaconserva@gmail.com.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. luisa.anelli@uniba.it.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. antonellazagaria@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. giorgina.specchia@uniba.it.', 'Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation (D.E.T.O.), Hematology Section, University of Bari, 70124 Bari, Italy. francesco.albano@uniba.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190614,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Pleiotropy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism']",PMC6627493,2019/06/19 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/06/19 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20122921 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20122921 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 14;20(12). pii: ijms20122921. doi: 10.3390/ijms20122921.,12,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Retinoic acid receptors signaling', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'chromosomal rearrangements']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,

Methods: From January 2013 to December 2016, 114 de novo patients with FLT3-ITD(+)AML were enrolled in this study. Out of 114 cases, 75 were male, and 39 were female. The median age was 42 years old (ranged from 14 to 72 years old) . The chemotherapy regimens were used for induction therapy and all cases were followed up. The treatment response was evaluated by MICM and the comparison of the ratio were analyzed by chi-square test and the survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify independent prognostic factors. Results: There were 52 FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis genes (46 cases with NPM1, 5 cases with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, 1 case with CEBPA double mutation) and 62 patients with other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML at diagnosis. All patients completed at least one cycle of induction therapy and the clinical curative effect was evaluated, complete remission (CR) rate was 50.0% (57/114) in one cycle and total CR rate was 72.5% (74/104) in two cycles. The CR rate of the FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients with favorable prognosis genes was 67.3% (35/52) in one cycle and 83.3% (40/48) in two cycles; for the other types FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients, the CR rate was 35.5% (22/62) in one cycle and 64.8% (35/54) in two cycles. There was a significant difference in CR rate between the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with and without favorable prognosis genes (P<0.05) . This indicates that the FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients with favorable prognosis gene had relatively good therapeutic effect. Among other types of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients who did not achieve remission from one cycle of chemotherapy, 9 patients were given sorafenib plus chemotherapy and 6 cases (66.7%) achieved CR; 23 patients were given conventional chemotherapy and 7 cases (30.4%) achieved CR. There was a significant difference between sorafenib plus chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy groups (chi(2)=4.47, P<0.05) and this indicates that sorafenib plus chemotherapy can significantly improve the CR rate of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients. Comparing overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) , there was no significant difference between sorafenib plus chemotherapy and conventional chemotherapy groups (P values were 0.641 and 0.517, respectively) . Conclusion: The overall prognosis of FLT3-ITD(+)AML patients is poor, and the stratification therapeutic efficacy of FLT3-ITD(+)AML without favorable prognosis gene can be improved by sorafenib combined with chemotherapy.","['Jia, J S', 'Zhu, H H', 'Gong, L Z', 'Zhao, T', 'Wang, J', 'Jiang, Q', 'Huang, X J', 'Jiang, H']","['Jia JS', 'Zhu HH', 'Gong LZ', 'Zhao T', 'Wang J', 'Jiang Q', 'Huang XJ', 'Jiang H']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",PMC7342235,2019/06/19 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.05.010 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 May 14;40(5):398-403. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2019.05.010.,5,"['SQ2017ZX090304007002/Major Scientific and Technological Special Project for', 'Significant New Drugs Creation']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'Leukemia, myeloid, acute', 'Sorafinbe', 'Treatment efficacy']",,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: Six B-CLPD patients with TP53 abnormalities from May 2008 to May 2012 were prospectively enrolled in the study. The patients were treated with HDMP+RTX+FFP for up to 6 cycles. Results: Of the six B-CLPD patients, there were 4 cases of chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders-unclassified (B-CLPD-U) , 1 B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) and 1 mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) . After a median 3 courses of treatment, 4 patients achieved complete remission (CR) including 3 with undetectable minimal residual disease (MRD(-)) . One patient was evaluated as stable disease (SD) and another one patient was in disease progression (PD) . After a median follow-up of 30 (4-56) months, 2 non-responders progressed quickly and died. All of CR patients survived and no one succumbed to disease progression at the last follow-up. The hematopoietic function was significantly improved after the treatment whereas there was also significant decrease in serum IgA, IgG and IgM levels. All patients showed well tolerance to this regimen. The incidence of myelosuppression was low and adverse events (AE) were mainly neutropenia which did not exceed grade 3 and infection. All AE were controllable.

Methods: The clinical data of 118 CLL patients diagnosed from January 2003 to August 2017 were collected. Survival was analyzed according to indicators including sex, age, Binet risk stratification, B symptoms, beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)-MG) , immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene (IGHV) mutation status, chromosome karyotype and TP53 gene deletion/mutation. The efficacy of first-line CIT of 101 CLL patients was further analyzed. Results: Among 118 patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12 (95%CI 10.148-13.852) months and median overall survival (OS) was 53 (95%CI 41.822-64.178) months, only 30.5% patients survived over 5 years. Low beta(2)-MG<3.5 mg/L indicated longer PFS (P=0.027) , female and Binet A patients had longer OS (P=0.011 and 0.013, respectively) . Of 118 patients, 17 (14.4%) didn't receive any therapy until follow-up time or the dead time. Among the 101 patients who received >/=1 CIT, median time to first treatment (TTFT) was 1 (0-62) months, patients in Binet A had longer TTFT (P<0.001) compared to the patients in Binet B/C. According to statistical needs, we divided those first-line CIT into four groups: there were 30 cases (29.7%) in mild chemotherapy group (mainly treated with nitrogen mustard phenylbutyrate or rituximab alone) , 32 cases (31.7%) in the fludarabine-containing group, 23 cases (22.8%) in high-dose methyprednisolone (HDMP) containing group and 16 cases (15.8%) in the other chemotherapy group. The first regimen contained HDMP can bring longer PFS (P<0.001) , however the OS between four groups had no statistical differences.

Aurora kinases have shown great promise in treating tumors. However, the efficacy of Aurora kinase (AURK) A and B inhibition in t(8;21) AML remains unclear. We found that AURK-A inhibitor Alisertib and AURK-B inhibitor Barasertib strongly inhibited the growth and proliferation of t(8;21) AML cells. The quantity and size of cell colonies were markedly decreased after a 14-d drug exposure. The cell cycle distribution was blocked at the G2/M phase in both dose- and time-dependent manner. The expression of p53 family and cdc2-p34 significantly changed as well. Notably, we found that t(8;21) AML cells are more sensitive to Aurora B inhibition.

We validate that the primary colorectal tumors exhibit heterogeneous telomere lengths but mostly (90%) short telomeres relative to normal tissues. Intriguingly, relatively short telomeres are associated with tumor malignancy as indicated by poorly differentiated state, and these tumors contain more cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) identified by several commonly used markers CD44, EPHB2 or LGR5. Moreover, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) and ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies (APBs) are frequently found in tumors with short telomeres and high proliferation. In contrast, distant normal tissues rarely or only minimally express PML. Inhibition of PML and APBs by an ATR inhibitor decreases proliferation of CSLCs and organoids, suggesting a potential therapeutic target to progressive colorectal tumors. Together, telomere maintenance underling tumor progression is connected with CSLCs.","['Gong, Peng', 'Wang, Hua', 'Zhang, Jingsong', 'Fu, Yudong', 'Zhu, Zhengmao', 'Wang, Jinmiao', 'Yin, Yu', 'Wang, Haiying', 'Zhou, Zhongcheng', 'Yang, Jiao', 'Liu, Linlin', 'Gou, Mo', 'Zeng, Ming', 'Yuan, Jinghua', 'Wang, Feng', 'Pan, Xinghua', 'Xiang, Rong', 'Weissman, Sherman M', 'Qi, Feng', 'Liu, Lin']","['Gong P', 'Wang H', 'Zhang J', 'Fu Y', 'Zhu Z', 'Wang J', 'Yin Y', 'Wang H', 'Zhou Z', 'Yang J', 'Liu L', 'Gou M', 'Zeng M', 'Yuan J', 'Wang F', 'Pan X', 'Xiang R', 'Weissman SM', 'Qi F', 'Liu L']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy; Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, 300071, China.', 'Department of Genetics, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Department of Genetics, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, China.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology, 2011 Collaborative Innovation Center for Biotherapy.', 'Department of Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Department of General Surgery, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin, 300052, China.

Although the pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated, many specific gene mutations have been found in AML. Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) is recognized as a drug target for the treatment of AML, and the activation mutations of FLT3 were found in about 30% of AML patients. Targeted inhibition of FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase has shown promising results in the treatment of FLT3 mutation AML. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effects of FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors used as AML monotherapy are usually accompanied by the high risk of resistance development within a few months after treatment. FLT3 dual inhibitors were generated with the co-inhibition of FLT3 and another target, such as CDK4, JAK2, MEK, Mer, Pim, etc., to solve the problems mentioned above. As a result, the therapeutic effect of the drug is significantly improved, while the toxic and side effects are reduced. Besides, the life quality of AML patients with FLT3 mutation has been effectively improved. In this paper, we reviewed the studies of dual FLT3 inhibitors that have been discovered in recent years for the treatment of AML.","['Yuan, Ting', 'Qi, Baowen', 'Jiang, Zhongliang', 'Dong, Wenjuan', 'Zhong, Lei', 'Bai, Lan', 'Tong, Rongsheng', 'Yu, Jiying', 'Shi, Jianyou']","['Yuan T', 'Qi B', 'Jiang Z', 'Dong W', 'Zhong L', 'Bai L', 'Tong R', 'Yu J', 'Shi J']",,"[""Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Science & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610072, China."", 'College of Pharmacy and Biological Engineering, Chengdu University, Chengdu, 610106, China.', 'Miller School of Medicine, University of Miami, Miami, Florida, 33136, USA.', ""Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Science & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610072, China."", ""Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Science & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610072, China."", ""Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Science & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610072, China."", ""Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Science & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610072, China."", ""Personalized Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Science & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, 610072, China.

Usually, the descriptors used to build QSTR model were made up of anion and cation descriptors, and their interactions were often neglected to some extent. In this work, based on the optimization of the ILs structure, a new set of descriptors were proposed to describe the interaction between anions and cations, and some new atomic distribution matrices were constructed to calculate norm descriptors of ILs, anion and cation. A norm index-based QSTR model was built to predict the eco-toxicity of ILs toward Leukemia rat cell line (IPC-81). This model has satisfactory statistical results with the R(2) of 0.954 and RMSE of 0.241, respectively. Furthermore, leave-one-out cross-validation and applicability domain results showed good stability and predictability of this model. This approach showed that the interaction between cations and anions could be reflected by optimizing the whole structure of ILs which might play an important role for describing the eco-toxicity of ILs. Therefore, it is further suggested that the norm descriptors would be applicable to predict the eco-toxicity of ILs towards IPC-81.","['Yan, Fangyou', 'Lan, Tian', 'Yan, Xue', 'Jia, Qingzhu', 'Wang, Qiang']","['Yan F', 'Lan T', 'Yan X', 'Jia Q', 'Wang Q']",,"['School of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, 13St. 29, TEDA, 300457, Tianjin, PR China.', 'School of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, 13St. 29, TEDA, 300457, Tianjin, PR China.', 'School of Marine and Environmental Science, Tianjin Marine Environmental Protection and Restoration Technology Engineering Center, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, 13St. 29, TEDA, 300457, Tianjin, PR China.', 'School of Marine and Environmental Science, Tianjin Marine Environmental Protection and Restoration Technology Engineering Center, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, 13St. 29, TEDA, 300457, Tianjin, PR China.', 'School of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, 13St. 29, TEDA, 300457, Tianjin, PR China.

Previous studies have demonstrated that microRNA-374 (miR-374) is a novel biomarker for cancer therapy. Therefore, this study explores whether miR-374 targeting tyrosinase (TYR) affects melanoma and its underlying mechanism. We constructed subcutaneous melanoma models to carry out the following experiments. The cells were transfected with a series of miR-374 mimics, miR-374 inhibitors or siRNA against TYR. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was used for the verification of the targeting relationship between miR-374 and TYR. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were conducted to determine the expression of miR-374, TYR, beta-catenin, B-cell leukaemia 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), Leucine-rich repeat G protein-coupled receptor 5 (LGR5) and CyclinD1. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, scratch test, transwell assay and flow cytometry respectively. TYR was proved as a putative target of miR-374 as the evidenced by the result. It was observed that up-regulated miR-374 or down-regulated TYR increased expression of Bax and decreased expressions of TYR, beta-catenin, LRP6, Bcl-2, CyclinD1 and LGR5, along with diminished cell proliferation, migration, invasion and enhanced apoptosis. Meanwhile, cells with miR-374 inhibitors showed an opposite trend. These findings indicated that up-regulated miR-374 could inhibit the expression of TYR to suppress cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promote cell apoptosis in melanoma cells by inhibiting the Wnt signalling pathway.","['Li, Xiao-Jing', 'Li, Zhi-Feng', 'Xu, Yan-Yan', 'Han, Zhao', 'Liu, Zhi-Jun']","['Li XJ', 'Li ZF', 'Xu YY', 'Han Z', 'Liu ZJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5616-9479'],"['Department of Dermatology, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei Engineering University, Handan, P.

However, the exact expression, biological function and underlying mechanism of DLEU1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. In this study, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in HCC tissues and cell lines revealed that DLEU1 expression was up-regulated, and the increased DLEU1 was closely associated with advanced tumour-node-metastasis stage, vascular metastasis and poor overall survival. Function experiments showed that knockdown of DLEU1 significantly inhibited HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, and suppressed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) process via increasing the expression of E-cadherin and decreasing the expression of N-cadherin and Vimentin. Luciferase reporter gene assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay demonstrated that DLEU1 could sponge miR-133a. Moreover, miR-133a inhibition significantly reversed the suppression effects of DLEU1 knockdown on HCC cells. Besides, we found that silenced DLEU1 significantly decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression (a target of miR-133a) and its downstream signal PI3K/AKT pathway in HCC cells, while miR-133a inhibitor partially reversed this trend. Furthermore, DLEU1 knockdown impaired tumour growth in vivo by regulating miR-133a/IGF-1R axis. Collectively, these findings indicate that DLEU1 promoted HCC progression by sponging miR-133a to regulate IGF-1R expression. Deleted in lymphocytic leukaemia 1/miR-133a/IGF-1R axis may be a novel target for treatment of HCC.","['Zhang, Wei', 'Liu, Songyang', 'Liu, Kai', 'Liu, Yahui']","['Zhang W', 'Liu S', 'Liu K', 'Liu Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4698-5370'],"['Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, P.R.

Little attention has been given to using EHR data to identify patients with pediatric hematologic malignancies. METHODS: This study used EHR-derived data in a pediatric clinical data research network, PEDSnet, to develop and evaluate a computable phenotype algorithm to identify pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma who received treatment with chemotherapy. To guide early development, multiple computable phenotype-defined cohorts were compared to one institution's tumor registry. The most promising algorithm was chosen for formal evaluation and consisted of at least two leukemia/lymphoma diagnoses (Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine codes) within a 90-day period, two chemotherapy exposures, and three hematology-oncology provider encounters. During evaluation, the computable phenotype was executed against EHR data from 2011 to 2016 at three large institutions. Classification accuracy was assessed by masked medical record review with phenotype-identified patients compared to a control group with at least three hematology-oncology encounters. RESULTS: The computable phenotype had sensitivity of 100% (confidence interval [CI] 99%, 100%), specificity of 99% (CI 99%, 100%), positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%, and C-statistic of 1 at the development institution. The computable phenotype performance was similar at the two test institutions with sensitivity of 100% (CI 99%, 100%), specificity of 99% (CI 99%, 100%), PPV of 96%, NPV of 100%, and C-statistic of 0.99. CONCLUSION: The EHR-based computable phenotype is an accurate cohort identification tool for pediatric patients with leukemia and lymphoma who have been treated with chemotherapy and is ready for use in clinical studies.","['Phillips, Charles A', 'Razzaghi, Hanieh', 'Aglio, Taylor', 'McNeil, Michael J', 'Salvesen-Quinn, Mikaela', 'Sopfe, Jenna', 'Wilkes, Jennifer J', 'Forrest, Christopher B', 'Bailey, L Charles']","['Phillips CA', 'Razzaghi H', 'Aglio T', 'McNeil MJ', 'Salvesen-Quinn M', 'Sopfe J', 'Wilkes JJ', 'Forrest CB', 'Bailey LC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0391-1673', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8817-1995', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2758-2437', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5191-7511', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3806-6019', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1252-068X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8967-0662']","[""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology and Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Division of Oncology and Center for Childhood Cancer Research, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', ""Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190617,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Algorithms', 'Child, Preschool', '*Electronic Health Records', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Registries']",PMC7135896,2019/06/18 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27876 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Sep;66(9):e27876. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27876.

METHODS: Between February 2001 and December 2011, 33 patients out of 773 (4.3%) relapsed; 27 had Burkitt lymphoma and six large B-cell histology. Median age at diagnosis was 10.1 years. One patient was initially treated in risk group A, 21 in group B, and 11 in group C. RESULTS: Median time to relapse after diagnosis was 4.5 months (range 2.4-13.6). Thirty-two patients received salvage therapy. Twenty-seven received rituximab mainly in addition to high-dose cytarabine and etoposide (n = 18) and/or ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (n = 7). First-line salvage chemotherapy response rate was 66% with 47% being complete remission (CR). Twenty-one patients received high-dose chemotherapy (HDC) followed by autologous (n = 13) or allogeneic (n = 8) transplant. With a median follow-up of 6.8 years, the 5-year survival rate after relapse was 36.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 22-53%). Twelve patients were still alive; all but one (group A) received consolidation treatment. Achieving CR before consolidation was significantly associated with better survival, with a 5-year survival rate of 75% (95% CI 46.8-91.1%) for patients in CR before HDC, 33% (95% CI 9.7-70%) for patients in partial remission, and 0% for nonresponders (P = .033). CONCLUSION: Survival of children/adolescents with mature B-cell lymphoma/leukemia remains poor after relapse with no apparent improvement with rituximab. Response rates to salvage chemo-immunotherapies are insufficient and new drugs are urgently needed to improve disease control.","['Rigaud, Charlotte', 'Auperin, Anne', 'Jourdain, Anne', 'Haouy, Stephanie', 'Couec, Marie-Laure', 'Aladjidi, Nathalie', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Lambliotte, Anne', 'Plat, Genevieve', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Michon, Jean', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Patte, Catherine', 'Minard-Colin, Veronique']","['Rigaud C', 'Auperin A', 'Jourdain A', 'Haouy S', 'Couec ML', 'Aladjidi N', 'Gandemer V', 'Lambliotte A', 'Plat G', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Michon J', 'Leblanc T', 'Patte C', 'Minard-Colin V']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1774-778X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0231-4460', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0610-1895', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0296-5207']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Statistics, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Tours, Tours, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Nantes, Nantes, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Rennes, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, Centre Oscar Lambret, Lille, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, University Hospital of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, Hospital Armand Trousseau, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Institut Curie, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Haematology, Hospital Robert Debre, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190617,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', '*Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Infant', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2018/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27873 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Sep;66(9):e27873. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27873.

In the vast majority of CML patients, the typical subtype of BCR-ABL transcript are b3a2, b2a2 or both. The aim of this study was to determine the different subtypes of BCR-ABL transcript and their impact on the demographic and hematological parameters in Iraqi patients with CML. METHODS: One hundred patients with chronic phase CML (11 newly diagnosed and 89 imatinib-resistant) were enrolled in this study. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from leukocytes, and complementary DNA was created using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction with four specific primers was used to determine the BCR-ABL fusion subtypes in each patient. RESULTS: Male to female ratio was 1.38:1. Fifty-nine patients expressed b3a2 transcript, whereas 39 of the remaining cases were positive for b2a2 variant. One case expressed b2a3 transcript, while the last case coexpressed the two subtypes of mRNA b3a2/b2a2. Male and female were significantly associated with b3a2 and b2a2 subtypes, respectively. The b3a2 subtype showed higher total leukocyte count than b2a2 subgroup, while b2a2 variant demonstrated significantly elevated platelet counts compared to those with b3a2 transcript. A significantly higher plateletcrit percentage (PCT%) was found in patients with b2a2 transcript whereas. CONCLUSIONS: The testified Iraqi group expressed M-BCR-ABL type with preponderance of b3a2 over b2a2 subtype. There was a gender-skewed distribution in BCR-ABL transcript types with b3a2 transcript more prevalent in males. The type of BCR-ABL transcript is reflected by different leukocyte and platelet counts at diagnosis, which might represent a distinct phenotype and disease biology.","['Khazaal, Mahmood S', 'Hamdan, Farqad B', 'Al-Mayah, Qasim S']","['Khazaal MS', 'Hamdan FB', 'Al-Mayah QS']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4994-3694'],"['Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq.', 'Medical Research Unit, College of Medicine, Al-Nahrain University, Baghdad, Iraq.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190617,United States,Mol Genet Genomic Med,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Iraq', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Sex Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC6687619,2019/06/18 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mgg3.809 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomic Med. 2019 Aug;7(8):e809. doi: 10.1002/mgg3.809.

METHODS: The levels of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 and the expression of JARID1B and miR-137 were analyzed in six ALL cell lines and 30 ALL patients. The effects of miR-137 and JARID1B on cell proliferation and apoptosis were investigated by silencing or promoting the respective genes. The interaction between miR-137 and JARID1B was confirmed by double-luciferase report assay. RESULTS: The histone H3K4 expressions and miR-137 expression were lower in 30 ALL patients and in six ALL cell lines, while the expression of JARID1B was elevated. A negative correlation was observed between JARID1B and miR-137. Over-expression of miR-137 led to decreasing cell proliferation and increasing apoptosis in MOLT-4 and BALL-1 cells. MiR-137 inhibitor up-regulated JARID1B in these two cell lines, while promoted proliferation in BALL-1 cells only.

CONCLUSIONS: The expression of miR-137 was declined in ALL, and JARID1B was directly repressed by miR-137. Aberrant JARID1B expression could result in abnormal histone methylation, which might be one cause of ALL.","['Huang, Yiqun', 'Zou, Yong', 'Zheng, Ruiji', 'Ma, Xudong']","['Huang Y', 'Zou Y', 'Zheng R', 'Ma X']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6650-7176', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8242-9035']","['Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhangzhou Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Zhangzhou, Fujian, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190701,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Histones)', '0 (MIRN137 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM5B protein, human)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13276 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Sep;103(3):215-224. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13276.

Limited data suggest that children with cancer in sub-Saharan Africa have poor survival. We aimed to describe the presentation, treatment outcomes, and factors associated with survival among children with cancer managed at Uganda Cancer Institute. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated patients with childhood cancer (age </=19 years) from Kyadondo County treated at Uganda Cancer Institute from 2006 to 2009. Cox's regression and Kaplan-Meier methods were used to study 1-year survival. Results. Among 310 patients studied, median age was 7 years (range = 0.25-19 years), 64% were boys, and 92% had histological confirmation of cancer diagnosis. The commonest diagnoses were Burkitt lymphoma (BL, N = 87), Kaposi sarcoma (KS, N = 68), non-BL non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL, N = 32), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, N = 28), Wilms (N = 28), and Hodgkin disease (HD, N = 20). Advanced disease at diagnosis was common for all cancers (ranging from 45% for KS to 83% for non-BL NHL). Overall, 33.2% abandoned treatment. One-year survival was 68% for HD (95% confidence interval [CI] = 11.3-40.6), 67% for KS (95% CI = 52.1-77.9), 55% for BL (95% CI = 42-66.9), 44% for Wilms (95% CI = 22.5-63), 43% for non-BL NHL (95% CI = 23.3-61.3), and 20% for ALL (95% CI = 6.4-38.7). In univariate and multivariate analysis, anemia and thrombocytopenia were associated with mortality for several cancers. Conclusion. Survival among children with cancer in Uganda is poor. Advanced stage disease and loss to follow-up likely contribute to poor outcomes. Anemia and thrombocytopenia may augment traditional staging methods to provide better prognostic factors in Uganda and warrant further evaluation.","['Mutyaba, Innocent', 'Wabinga, Henry R', 'Orem, Jackson', 'Casper, Corey', 'Phipps, Warren']","['Mutyaba I', 'Wabinga HR', 'Orem J', 'Casper C', 'Phipps W']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5548-1209', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3609-661X']","['Uganda Cancer Institute, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Uganda Cancer Institute, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Makerere University College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda.', 'Infectious Disease Research Institute, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190518,United States,Glob Pediatr Health,Global pediatric health,101670224,,,,PMC6537233,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/06/18 06:01,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2333794X19849749 [doi]', '10.1177_2333794X19849749 [pii]']",epublish,Glob Pediatr Health. 2019 May 18;6:2333794X19849749. doi: 10.1177/2333794X19849749. eCollection 2019.,,"['D43 TW009759/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI027757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA190146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Burkitt lymphoma', 'Hodgkin disease', 'Kaposi sarcoma', 'Uganda', ""Wilms' tumor"", 'children', 'follow-up', 'leukemia', 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'prognostic', 'treatment']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,

However, there are a fraction of patients with solid tumors, such as liver cancer, who respond to As2O3 treatment poorly. The underlying mechanisms for this remain unclear. Methods: We determined the suitable concentration of drugs by IC50. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and flow cytometry were used to analyze the apoptosis. Morphological changes of the cells were observed by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Furthermore, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) were detected by flow cytometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot tests were conducted to detect the mRNA and protein levels in different groups. Finally, a xenograft tumor assay and histopathological analysis were performed to evaluate the MARVELD1 function in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Results: Here, we show that MARVELD1 enhances the therapeutic effects of epirubicin, while inducing the strong resistance of liver cancer cells to As2O3 treatment. We further demonstrate that the As2O3-induced apoptosis was inhibited by MARVELD1 overexpression (24 h Vector vs. MARVELD1 =30.58% vs. 17.41%, P<0.01; 48 h Vector vs. MARVELD1 =46.50% vs. 21.02%, P<0.01), possibly through inhibiting ROS production by enhancing TRXR1 expression. In vivo, we found a significantly increased size (Vector vs. MARVELD1 =203.90+/-21.92 vs. 675.70+/-37.84 mm(3), P<0.001) and weight (Vector vs. MARVELD1 =0.19+/-0.02 vs. 0.58+/-0.05 g, P<0.001) of tumors with high expression of MARVELD1 after As2O3 treatment. Consistently, a higher expression of MARVELD1 predicted a poor prognosis for liver cancer patients. Conclusions: Our data identified a unique role of MARVELD1 in As2O3-induced apoptosis and As2O3 cancer therapy resistance.","['Ma, Wenping', 'Shen, Haiyang', 'Li, Qian', 'Song, Hao', 'Guo, Yanyan', 'Li, Fangrong', 'Zhou, Xingang', 'Guo, Xinwu', 'Shi, Jingdong', 'Cui, Qi', 'Xing, Jinhao', 'Deng, Jinhai', 'Yu, Youtao', 'Liu, Wenjie', 'Zhao, Hongshan']","['Ma W', 'Shen H', 'Li Q', 'Song H', 'Guo Y', 'Li F', 'Zhou X', 'Guo X', 'Shi J', 'Cui Q', 'Xing J', 'Deng J', 'Yu Y', 'Liu W', 'Zhao H']",,"['Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Intervention Therapy, The Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Intervention Therapy, The Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Intervention Therapy, The Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Intervention Therapy, The Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Intervention Therapy, The Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Beijing Ditan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100015, China.', 'Sansure Biotech Inc., Changsha 410205, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100070, China.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Intervention Therapy, The Fourth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100048, China.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100021, China.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,PMC6545301,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/06/18 06:01,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.04.38 [doi]', 'atm-07-09-200 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 May;7(9):200. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.04.38.,9,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide (As2O3)', 'MARVELD1', 'apoptosis', 'reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'therapy']",['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,

However, medical success is largely dependent on the identification of the large number of people unaware of these infections, especially in developing countries. Dried blood spots (DBS) have been demonstrated to be a good tool for collecting, storing and transporting clinical specimens from rural areas and limited-resource settings to laboratory facilities, where viral infections can be more reliably diagnosed. Methods: The seroprevalence and virological characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), as well as human retroviruses (HIV-1, HIV-2, human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 [HTLV-1] and human T-cell leukaemia virus type 2 [HTLV-2]), were investigated in clinical specimens collected from DBS in Ghana. Results: A total of 305 consecutive DBS were collected. A high prevalence of chronic HBV (8.5%) and occult hepatitis B (14.2%) was found, whereas rates were lower for HIV-1, HTLV-1 and HCV (3.2%, 1.3% and 0.6%, respectively). HIV-2 and HTLV-2 were absent. CRF02_AG was the predominant HIV-1 subtype, whereas genotype E was the most frequent HBV variant. Conclusions: DBS are helpful in the diagnosis and virological characterization of hepatitis and retrovirus infections in resource-limited settings. The high rate of hepatitis B in Ghana, either overt or occult, is noteworthy and confirms recent findings from other sub-Saharan countries. This should encourage close clinical follow up and antiviral treatment assessment in this population, as well as universal HBV vaccine campaigns.","['de Mendoza, Carmen', 'Bautista, Jose M', 'Perez-Benavente, Susana', 'Kwawu, Roger', 'Fobil, Julius', 'Soriano, Vicente', 'Diez, Amalia']","['de Mendoza C', 'Bautista JM', 'Perez-Benavente S', 'Kwawu R', 'Fobil J', 'Soriano V', 'Diez A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4624-5199'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Complutense University of Madrid, Faculty of Veterinary Sciences Avda.

Whilst monoclonal anti-CD20 agents such as rituximab have a central role in combination with traditional cytotoxic therapy, their combination with novel agents that target the B cell receptor signaling pathway and other intracellular mechanisms of B cell proliferation is a new approach to treatment. Venetoclax is a highly specific novel agent inhibiting the bcl-2 anti-apoptotic pathway and has potent activity in CLL. Its combination with rituximab results in deeper and more durable responses and this regimen is a valuable option in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CLL including adverse prognostic variants such as cases that are fludarabine refractory or harbor the 17p chromosomal deletion.

The frequency of hypothyroidism in TM patients ranges from 4% to 29 % in different reports. The wide variation has been attributed to several factors such as patients' genotype, age, ethnic heterogeneity, treatment protocols of transfusions and chelation, and varying compliance to treatment. Hypothyroidism is the result of primary gland failure or insufficient thyroid gland stimulation by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. The main laboratory parameters of thyroid function are the assessments of serum thyroid-stimulating hor-mone (TSH) and serum free thyroxine (FT4). It is of primary importance to interpret these measurements within the context of the laboratory-specific normative range for each test. An elevated serum TSH level with a standard range of serum FT4 level is consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. A low serum FT4 level with a low, or inappropriately normal, serum TSH level is consistent with secondary hypothyroidism. Doctors caring for TM patients most commonly encounter subjects with subclinical primary hypothyroidism in the second decade of life. Several aspects remain to be elucidated as the frequency of thyroid cancer and the possible existence of a relationship between thyroid dysfunction, on one hand, cardiovascular diseases, components of metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance) and hypercoagulable state, on the other hand. Further studies are needed to explain these emerging issues. Following a brief description of thyroid hormone regulation, production and actions, this article is conceptually divided into two parts; the first reports the spectrum of thyroid disease occurring in patients with TM, and the second part focuses on the emerging issues and the open problems in TM patients with thyroid disorders.","['De Sanctis, Vincenzo', 'Soliman, Ashraf T', 'Canatan, Duran', 'Yassin, Mohamed A', 'Daar, Shahina', 'Elsedfy, Heba', 'Di Maio, Salvatore', 'Raiola, Giuseppe', 'Corrons, Joan-Lluis Vives', 'Kattamis, Christos']","['De Sanctis V', 'Soliman AT', 'Canatan D', 'Yassin MA', 'Daar S', 'Elsedfy H', 'Di Maio S', 'Raiola G', 'Corrons JV', 'Kattamis C']",,"['Pediatric and Adolescent Outpatient Clinic, Quisisana Hospital, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, University of Alexandria, Alexandria, Egypt.', 'Director of Thalassemia Diagnosis Center of Mediterranean Blood Diseases Foundation, Antalya, Turkey.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Medical Oncology Hematology Section HMC, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Haematology, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sultan Qaboos University, Sultanate of Oman.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Emeritus Director in Pediatrics, Children\'s Hospital ""Santobono-Pausilipon,"" Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Red Blood Cell and Haematopoietic Disorders Unit.

Methods: SIMPLICITY (NCT01244750) is an observational study in CP-CML patients, exploring first-line (1L) TKI use and management patterns in the US and Europe. Over half of the patients recruited in Europe are from Italy (n=266). This is an analysis of the Italian cohort and a comparison with the rest of the European SIMPLICITY population. Baseline demographic, factors influencing the choice of first-line TKI, response monitoring patterns and predictors of monitoring, and treatment interruptions, discontinuations and switching by index TKIs are presented for the Italian cohort in the first year of treatment and compared with that for the overall European SIMPLICITY cohort. Results: Italian patients received 1L imatinib (IM; retrospective [(n=31]; prospective [n=106]), dasatinib (DAS; n=56) or nilotinib (NIL; n=73). Documented cytogenetic response monitoring by 12 months was lower than expected, but almost all patients had documented molecular response monitoring. Fewer patients discontinued first-line TKI by 12 months in Italy compared with the rest of the European SIMPLICITY population (p=0.003). Of those with >/=12 months follow-up since the start of 1L TKI, only 7.1% (n=19) of Italian patients switched to a second-line TKI, a third less than in the rest of the European SIMPLICITY population. Of interest, intolerance as opposed to resistance, was the main reason for switching. Conclusions: This analysis provides valuable insights into management and treatment patterns in Italian patients with CML within routine clinical practice.","['Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Bosi, Alberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', ""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Liberati, Anna Marina', 'Porrini, Raffaele', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Pungolino, Ester', 'Sora, Federica', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Sen, Ginny P', 'Gentilini, Fabiana', 'De Solda, Francesco', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Abruzzese E', 'Bosi A', 'Breccia M', ""D'Adda M"", 'Di Renzo N', 'Liberati AM', 'Porrini R', 'Orlandi EM', 'Pane F', 'Pungolino E', 'Sora F', 'Stagno F', 'Sen GP', 'Gentilini F', 'De Solda F', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']",,"['S.

Semaphorins have different roles in various kinds of cancers, but there is no study concerning their expression in the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study aimed to assess the SEMA3A, SEMA4A and SEMA4D expression in patients with CLL. Materials and Methods: Peripheral blood specimens were collected from 30 newly-diagnosed untreated patients with CLL and 30 healthy subjects as a control group. The SEMA3A, SEMA4A and SEMA4D expression was determined by real-time PCR method. Results: The fold change expression of SEMA3A and SEMA4D was 7.58 +/- 2.66 and 3.20 +/- 0.99 in patients with CLL, and was 1.01 +/- 0.31 and 1.00 +/- 0.27 in healthy subjects, respectively. The CLL patients expressed higher amounts of SEMA3A and SEMA4D in comparison with healthy subjects (P<0.02 and P<0.03, respectively). The fold change expression of SEMA3A in patients with stage II (11.12 +/- 5.35) was also higher than patients with stage I (4.49 +/- 1.61, P<0.05). No significant difference was also observed in the expression of SEMA4A and SEMA4D between patients with stage I and stage II CLL. In both CLL and control groups, the fold change expression of SEMA3A was higher in men than in women (P<0.03 and P<0.02, respectively).

Differentiation of the hematopoietic stem cells into specific cell lineage occurs through a highly regulated pathway which is mainly monitored during transcription step. Expression level and pattern of transcription factors e.g. PU.1 determine fate and developmental phases in this pathway. This study was performed to evaluate the expression level of the PU.1 gene in a group of children suffering from ALL. Materials and Methods: The mRNA expression level of the PU.1 gene was compared between 30 children diagnosed as new cases of ALL and 30 sex- and gender-matched healthy children in the present case-control study. The quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to determine the level of PU.1 gene expression. The data were analyzed using Graph Pad Prism statistical software. Results: The mRNA level of the PU.1 gene was significantly lower in the blood samples of the ALL patients compared to the controls (p= 0.002).

Traditional chemotherapy does generate long-term benefit but are usually accompanied by severe side effects. Immunotherapy by adoptive infusion of T cells is now an attractive alternative to chemotherapy. Chimeric antigen receptor engineered lymphocytes have produced tremendous clinical outcomes in treating leukemia or lymphoma, but not in solid tumors, which is in part due to the low affinity of single chain Fv fragment or the rapid loss of transfused T cells. In present research, we designed a novel Fab based chimeric antigen receptor, which inherits the advantages of Fab fragment as well as the natural TCR receptor. The novel Fab CAR could recognize the tumor antigens independent of MHC/peptide complex, and mimic the natural activation process of endogenous TCR, therefore extend the life span of CAR-engineered T cells and generate durable clinical effects.","['Duan, Honghong', 'Huang, Huibin', 'Jing, Guangjun']","['Duan H', 'Huang H', 'Jing G']",,"['Department of obstetrics and gynecology, The Second affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou Fujian 362000, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The Second affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University, Quanzhou Fujian 362000, China.', 'iCATAB biomedical co.

Therefore, in this study, we identified that Pokemon is overexpressed in human prostate cancer tissue samples, and its suppression inhibits proliferation of prostate cancer cells, along with promotion of apoptosis. Furthermore, to explore the mechanism by which Pokemon promotes tumor progression, we observed that it binds to the promoter of STRN4 (striatin 4), a downstream target, and subsequently regulates its expression.

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is a single agent used for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia and is highly promising for other malignancies but is also attractive for RA, although its relationship with autophagy remains to be further clarified and its application optimized. For the first time, we report a defective functional module of autophagy comprising the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), PPAR-gamma, microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3 (LC3), and p62 which appears in RA synovial fibroblasts. ATO alleviated RA symptoms by boosting effective autophagic flux through significantly downregulating p62, the inflammation and catabolism protein. Importantly, low-dose ATO synergizes with Vitamin D in RA treatment.","['Wang, Weiyan', 'Li, Chunling', 'Zhang, Zhiyi', 'Zhang, Yue']","['Wang W', 'Li C', 'Zhang Z', 'Zhang Y']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5633-7353', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3951-3834', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3443-7721']","['Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng St., Nangang District, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng St., Nangang District, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng St., Nangang District, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, 23 Youzheng St., Nangang District, Harbin, China.', 'Shenzhen Futian Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, 22 Nonglin Road, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190507,United States,PPAR Res,PPAR research,101269101,,,,PMC6530228,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/06/18 06:01,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/6403504 [doi]'],epublish,PPAR Res. 2019 May 7;2019:6403504. doi: 10.1155/2019/6403504. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Summary: We report a case of a 72-year-old female presenting to the intensive care unit with hepatic failure after high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) for the treatment of relapsed AML. The patient's liver function tests (LFTs) were elevated acutely, with a mildly elevated bilirubin and a normal alkaline phosphatase. HiDAC was discontinued but her LFTs remained high for 9 days post discontinuation, and the patient eventually expired due to sepsis and multiple organ failure. We estimated the probability of the hepatotoxicity observed with HiDAC as probable based on a score of 5 on the Naranjo scale. Conclusion: Clinicians should be aware of the potential hepatotoxicity associated with HiDAC for patients with AML, specifically in the elderly population.","['Fu, Samuel H', 'Flannery, Alexander H', 'Thompson Bastin, Melissa L']","['Fu SH', 'Flannery AH', 'Thompson Bastin ML']",,"['University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, USA.', 'University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, USA.', 'University of Kentucky HealthCare, Lexington, USA.', 'University of Kentucky College of Pharmacy, Lexington, USA.', 'University of Kentucky HealthCare, Lexington, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180601,United States,Hosp Pharm,Hospital pharmacy,0043175,,,,PMC6535927,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/06/18 06:01,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/0018578718779763 [doi]', '10.1177_0018578718779763 [pii]']",ppublish,Hosp Pharm. 2019 Jun;54(3):160-164. doi: 10.1177/0018578718779763.

Limited guidance exists for TSS in adults and is absent in pediatric practice.The international survey and retrospective case series evaluated the current use of TSS in pediatric testicular tumors. Alongside the complementary literature review, the aim of this work was to provide evidence that could be used to produce a guideline document. RECENT FINDINGS: Published evidence advocates small mass size as an indicator for TSS, this was not supported in the pediatric literature. Frozen section examination at TSS was not always performed by surgeons and yet the literature reports close to 100% specificity. Tumor markers and ultrasound findings are also used as indicators for TSS, a finding reflected in our survey results. SUMMARY: Multiple case series are reported but no large data series exists, which will require international collaboration rather than a drive to publish the results of individual centers. Common indicators for TSS use; such as tumor markers and imaging are known but further work needs to evaluate the role of on-table histology and the risks of this not being available.","['Radford, Anna', 'Peycelon, Matthieu', 'Haid, Bernhard', 'Powis, Mark', 'Lakshminarayanan, Bhanu']","['Radford A', 'Peycelon M', 'Haid B', 'Powis M', 'Lakshminarayanan B']",,"[""Leeds Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Surgery, Leeds, UK."", 'EAU Young Academic Urologists Paediatric Urology Group.', 'Robert-Debre University Hospital (Assistance-Publique Hopitaux de Paris), Department of Pediatric Surgery and Urology, Reference Center for Rare Diseases (CRMR) Malformations Rares des Voies Urinaires (MARVU), Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Riley Hospital for Children, Indiana University and Purdue University in Indiana, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.', 'EAU Young Academic Urologists Paediatric Urology Group.', 'Department of Paediatric Urology, Hospital of the Sisters of Charity, Linz, Austria.', ""Leeds Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Surgery, Leeds, UK."", ""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, British Association of Paediatric Surgeons."", ""Leeds Children's Hospital, Department of Paediatric Surgery, Leeds, UK."", ""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group, British Association of Paediatric Surgeons.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Urol,Current opinion in urology,9200621,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Frozen Sections', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Orchiectomy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*surgery', 'Testis/pathology/*surgery']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOU.0000000000000652 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Urol. 2019 Sep;29(5):481-486. doi: 10.1097/MOU.0000000000000652.,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agranulocytosis was confirmed with bone marrow examination. Vemurafenib was considered the most probable drug responsible for this agranulocytosis and was thus stopped. We observed a full neutrophils recovery 10 days after vemurafenib cessation without any haematopoietic growth factors. A bone marrow biopsy performed 1 month after aplasia ending showed a good partial response with less than 5% of hairy cells remaining.

METHODS: 312 leukemia and lymphoma children necessarily undergone lumbar puncture were divided into compound lidocaine cream (cream) group and compound lidocaine injection (injation) group as control with 156 cases respectively according to the will of inpatient children and their family. For cream group, compound lidocaine cream was smeared on the skin around the lumbar puncture point evenly and covered with sterile and transparent dressing for about one hour before lumbar puncture. Then the cream and transparent dressing were removed and lumbar puncture was performed after regular disinfection. For control group, 2% compound lidocaine was injected as local anesthesia before lumbar puncture. The extent of pain was evaluated by Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale and FLACC Scale as well as children's physiological indexes (heart rate, breathing, blood pressure). The lumbar puncture success rate and the discomfortableness as well as family satisfaction were recorded by special person. RESULTS: Compared with control group, the incidence of pain and discomfortableness in cream group significantly reduced, and the family satisfaction significantly increased (P0.05). There were obviously differences in the physiological indexes (heart rate, breathing, systolic blood pressure) before and after lumbar puncture in control group (P0.05).

METHODS: The bone marrow specimens of T-ALL patients and controls were collected, the expression of beta-arrestin1 and beta-arrestin1 in the T-ALL patients was detected by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively, and the relation of beta-arrestin1 expression with the clinical pathologic characteristics and the prognosis of T-ALL patients was analyzed statistically. The stable Jurkat cell line with knocked down or overexpressed beta-arrestin1 was constructed, the CCK method was used to detect the Jurkat cell number, the beta-gal staining was used to analyze the effect of beta-arrestin1 on senescence of Jurkat cells, the cross analysis of RNA-Seg data and KEGG data was performed for screening the possible signaling pathway, and Western blot was performed for varifying the key sites of signaling pathway. RESULTS: The beta-arrestin1 expression in specimens of T-ALL patients decreased (P0.01), moreover the beta-arrestin1 expression negatively related with peripheral blood cell number (r=-0.601), the blasts in peripheral blood (r=-0.516) and extramedullary infiltration (r=-0.359), while positively related with the response to chemotherapy (r=0.393). The detection of stable Jurkat cell line with knocked-down and overexpressed beta-arrestin1 found that the beta-arrestin 1 could decrease the Jurkat cell number and accelarate the senescence of Jurkat cells (P0.05). The cross analysis of RNA-Seg data and KEGG data showed that the senescence of T-ALL cells may be regulated via RAS-P16-PRb-E2F1 by beta-arrestin 1. Western bolt confirmed that beta-arrestin1 promoted the expression of Ras and p16, and decreased the expression of pRB and E2F1 (P0.05). CONCLUSIONS: beta-arrestin1 accelerates the senescence of Jurkat cells via Ras-p16-pRb-E2F1, and delays the progression in T-ALL, which may provide a new hypothesis for the pathogenesis of T-ALL.","['Guo, Wei', 'Liu, Shan', 'Liu, Hai-Yan', 'Chen, Yan-Hua', 'Zhang, Hang', 'Lyu, Wen-Qiong', 'Zou, Lin']","['Guo W', 'Liu S', 'Liu HY', 'Chen YH', 'Zhang H', 'Lyu WQ', 'Zou L']",,"[""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Center for Clinical Molecular Medicine, Children's Hospital, Chongqing Medical University; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders; Key Laboratory of Pediatrics in Chongqing; Chongqing International Science and Technology Cooperation Center for Child Development and Disorders, Chongqing 400014, China,E-mail: zoulin74@hotmail.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,['0 (beta-Arrestin 1)'],IM,"['Cellular Senescence', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'beta-Arrestin 1/*genetics']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0777-08 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.022 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):777-784. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.022.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Among 162 B-ALL children, the EBV infection rate was 41.36%. Univariate analysis showed that the B-ALL children with EBV infection had the poor prognosis and higher risk of shorter survival time, as compared with B-ALL children without EBV infection (HR=2.373, 95% CI: 1.129-4.987) (P0.05), the multivariate analysis showed that the result was consistent with result of univariate analysis indicating that EBV infection was an independent predictor for poor prognosis of B-ALL children. CONCLUSION: The EBV infection may play an important role in the occurrence and progression of B-ALL and is an independent predictor for poor prognosis, therefore the detection of EBV DNA in plasma of B-ALL children possesses an important significance for evaluation of B-ALL children's prognosis.","['Tang, Shi', 'Zhang, Rong', 'Wang, Dan', 'Wang, Xing-Bin', 'Chen, E', 'Liu, Zhi-Dai', 'Liu, Shan', 'Zou, Lin', 'Liu, Hai-Yan', 'Yu, Jie']","['Tang S', 'Zhang R', 'Wang D', 'Wang XB', 'Chen E', 'Liu ZD', 'Liu S', 'Zou L', 'Liu HY', 'Yu J']",,"[""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Clinical Molecular Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University;Chongqing 400014, China,Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China,E-mail: zoulin74@126.com."", ""Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China,Blood Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China."", ""Chongqing Key Laboratory of Pediatrics, Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases of Ministry of Education; Chongqing 400014, China,Blood Center of Children's Hospital Affiliated to Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400014, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Child', 'DNA, Viral', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0769-08 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):769-776. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.021.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 31 cases of leukemia and 15 cases of non-tumor as controls were collected. The expression of RhoH in bone marrow cells was detected by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR). The median expression level of RhoH was used as the cut-off value. The newly diagnosed patients were divided into RhoH high expression group and low expression group. The relationship of different RhoH expression levels with clinical features and prognosis of newly diagnosed patients was analyzed. RESULTS: The mRNA expression of RhoH in the bone marrow cells of 31 cases of leukemia was significantly lower than that in the control group, mRNA expression of RhoH in the ALL group was significantly lower than that in AML group (P0.05). Compared with the RhoH high expression group, the proportion of bone marraw blasts and LDH level in the RhoH low expression group was significantly increased (P0.05), but there were no significant differences in clinical features such as age, white blood cell count, hemoglobin level, platelets count, PCT and CRP level (P0.05). In AML, the recurrence rate after standard chemotherapy in RhoH low expression group was higher than that in high expression group, while the expression of RhoH not correlated with other prognostic genes of AML. In ALL, the recurrence rate in RhoH low expression group was not statistically significant different from that in high expression group. CONCLUSION: RhoH may be involved in the genesis of acute leukemia. In AML, RhoH expression negatively correlates with recurrence rate, which can be used as a prognostic indicator independently. In ALL, RhoH may participate in the disease process through other mechanism.","['Ni, Jun', 'Shi, Qing-Qing', 'Wu, Wei', 'Sun, Xin', 'Fang, Yue-Zhi', 'Gu, Jian']","['Ni J', 'Shi QQ', 'Wu W', 'Sun X', 'Fang YZ', 'Gu J']",,"[""Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Hematonosis, Jiangsu Northern People's Hospital, Yangzhou Institute of Hematology, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Hematonosis, Jiangsu Northern People's Hospital, Yangzhou Institute of Hematology, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Hematonosis, Jiangsu Northern People's Hospital, Yangzhou Institute of Hematology, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Hematonosis, Jiangsu Northern People's Hospital, Yangzhou Institute of Hematology, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Hematonosis, Jiangsu Northern People's Hospital, Yangzhou Institute of Hematology, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu Province, China."", ""Laboratory of Blood Diseases and Hematonosis, Jiangsu Northern People's Hospital, Yangzhou Institute of Hematology, Yangzhou 225001, Jiangsu Province, China,E-mail: maolujiu918@163.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RhoH protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0758-05 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.019 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):758-762. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.019.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and ten patients diagnosed as AML in our hospital were divided into 3 groups: newly diagnosed group (38 cases), remission group (40 cases) and recurrence group (32 cases). The expression levels of serum matriptase were detected by Western blot, and the expression levels of serum SE-CAD were detected by ELISA. The serum levels of serum SE-CAD and matriptase among 3 groups were compared. Followin-up for one year, according to the outcome of patients, all the patients were divided into 2 groups: the survival group and death group. The serum levels of SE-CAD and Matriptase were compared between 2 groups. The correlation of serum levels of SE-CAD and matriptase with the survival of AML patients was analyzed by multivariate Logistic analysis. The evaluation value of the serum levels of SE-CAD and matriptase for the prognosis of the patients with AML were analyzed by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). RESULTS: The serum levels of SE-CAD and matriptase were siginificantly different among 3 groups (P0.05). The serum levels of SE-CAD and matriptase in remission group were lowest (P0.05), and the serum levels of SE-CAD and matriptase were not different between newly diagnoses and recurrence groups (P0.05).

METHODS: By using Taqman probe-based ddPCR technique, the method that able to detect both long and short isoforms of PML-RARA fusion gene transcripts was established. RNA from PML-RARA negative cell line HL-60 as negative control was used to set the limit of blank (LOB), while the RNA from PML-RARA positive cell line NB4 and the recombinant plasmid pSG5-PML-RARA(S) were used to set the limit of detection (LOD) for long and short PML-RARA transcripts, respectively. Furtherly, the expression of exosomal PML-RARA fusion gene in NB4 cell culture supernatant and serum of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was analyzed by ddPCR technique. RESULTS: The LOB of ddPCR assay for long and short PML-RARA transcripts were 0.0725 and 0.083 copies per microliter of PCR reaction system, respectively, while the LOD of long and short PML-RARA transcripts were 0.19 and 0.21 copies per microliter of PCR reaction system, respectively. In addition, the expression of exosomal PML-RARA fusion gene derived from both NB4 cell culture supernatant and serum of APL patients was successfully detected.

The RAG1 expression level in IK6 positive patients was higher than that in IK6 negative patients (5.30 vs 2.11) (P0.05). The ratio of patients with LDH1 000 U/L in RAG1 high expression group was higher than that in RAG1 low expression group (42.2% vs 20.5%) (P0.05). CONCLUSION: RAG1 up-regulation may play an important role in the development of adult B-ALL especially when relapsed, which may also take part in the formation of Ik6. Monitoring RAG1 expression may provide a new method to evaluate the prognosis of adult B-ALL patients.","['Han, Qi', 'Gu, Yan', 'Gao, Yu-Qiao', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Chen, Bao-An', 'Ge, Zheng']","['Han Q', 'Gu Y', 'Gao YQ', 'Li JY', 'Chen BA', 'Ge Z']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province people's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province people's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu Province, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Province people's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 210029, Jiangsu Province, China,Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing 210009, Jiangsu Province, China,E-mail: gezheng2008@163.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prognosis']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0735-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):735-740. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.015.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 240 CML-CP patients treated with imatinib mesylate in our hospital between Janunay 2008 and December 2017 were analyzed retrospecively. The risk was stratified according to 4 prognostic score systems, the relationship between the 4 prognostic score systems and 3-month early molecular response (3M-EMR), 6 month complete cytogenetic response (6M-CCyR), 12-month major molecular response (12M-MMR) as well as the correlation of the 4 prognostic score systems with deep molecalar response were analyzed. RESULTS: At the end of treatment for 3 months, the EMR was evaluated for 219 patients, among them 164 (74.9%) patients achieved 3M-EMR; at the end of treatment for 6 months, CCyR was evaluated for 180 pathsents, among them 130 (72.2%) patients achicved 6M-CCyR; at the end of treatment for 12 months, the MMR was evaluated for 111 patients, among them 60 (54.1%) patients achieved 12M-MMR. Compared with the high-risk group, the treatment response to IM in the low-risk group (including the low-risk group and the intermediate-risk group) was better. There was significant difference in 3M-EMR according to Sokal score and ELTS score (P0.05), and there was significant difference in 12M-MMR according to EUTOS score and ELTS score (P0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed Sokal score (HR=0.69, 95%CI0.22-1.37, P0.05) and 3M-EMR (HR=0.47, 95%CI0.28-0.84, P0.01) independently related with MR4.5, The combination of Sokal score, especially the low risk with 3M-EMR much more can predict MR4.5 (HR=0.42, 95%CI=0.21-0.82, P0.01). CONCLUSION: There is a remarkable clinical efficacy of imatinib mesylate on CML-CP patients, moreover, low risk group has a better therapeutic response. Both Sokal score and ELTS score evaluate 3M-EMR better, both EUTOS score and ELTS score evaluate 12M-MMR better. The combination of low risk in Sokal score with 3M-EMR much more can predict MR4.5. The results of this study provide the reference basis for evaluating the clinical therapentic efficacy and timely modifying the therapeutic regimens for CML patients, also possess the reference value for predicting the MR4.5.","['Wang, Pan-Pan', 'Zhang, Peng-Peng', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Xi, Ya-Ming']","['Wang PP', 'Zhang PP', 'Zhang J', 'Xi YM']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital Affiliated to Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Provinnce, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital Affiliated to Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Provinnce, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital Affiliated to Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Provinnce, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Hospital Affiliated to Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu Provinnce, China,E-mail: xiyaming02@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0723-06 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):723-728. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.013.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Western-blot was used to detect the expression of FMI protein in K562 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic myeloid blast crisis and healthy volunteers. The specific interference sequences targeting at the human FMI gene were designed and ligated into the lentiviral vector LV3; the three plasmid system-packaged lentivirus particles were used to transfect K562 cells to screen K562 cells that stably down-regulated FMI. CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry were used to determine effect of IM on cell proliferation and apoptosis. The transcription level of FMI and Fz8 in leukemia cells was detected by fluorescent quantitative PCR. The protein expression levels of FMI, Fz8, NFAT1, BCR-ABL and beta-catenin in leukemia cells were detected by Western-blot. RESULTS: The expression of FMI protein could be detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of the patients with CML-BC and K562 cells, the FMI expression could not be detected in all the patients with CML-CP and healthy volunteers. The recombinant lentiviral vector LV3/FMI had been successfully constructed the lentivirus was packaged, and the K562 cells stably down-regulating the FMI protein were screened. After stable down-regulation of FMI expression in K562 cells, the proliferation rate of leukemia cells decreased and the apoptosis rate was increased under the same drug concentration. Both the transcription and protein expression levels of Fz8 decreased. The NFAT1 total protein level increased, as well as the nuclear translocation of protein was enhanced. There was no significant change in the expression level of BCR-ABL fusion protein. The expression level of beta-catenin protein decreased. CONCLUSION: After the stable down-regulation of FMI expression, the sensitivity of K562 cells to IM and apoptosis of cells increase, which are performed possibly by inhibiting the FMI-Fz8 signaling pathway and activating the Ca(2+)-NFAT and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.","['Han, Ya-Hui', 'Zhang, Huan-Xin', 'Hong, Fei', 'Yu, Di', 'Hu, Chen-Yuan', 'Sun, Qian', 'Zeng, Ling-Yu', 'Li, Zhen-Yu', 'Yan, Zhi-Ling', 'Xu, Kai-Lin']","['Han YH', 'Zhang HX', 'Hong F', 'Yu D', 'Hu CY', 'Sun Q', 'Zeng LY', 'Li ZY', 'Yan ZL', 'Xu KL']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China,Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China,Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China,Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China,E-mail: hematology_md@126.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China,Department of Hematology, Xuzhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital, Xuzhou 221002, Jiangsu Province, China,E-mail:lihmd@163.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', '*Leukocytes, Mononuclear']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0708-09 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):708-716. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.011.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 70 (60-91) years old, ratio of male to female was 1.9ratio1 (55ratio29) , the median OS time was 9 (1-125) months, 1 year OS rate was 35.3%, and 5 year OS rate was 12.6%. The age grouping, remission of induction chemotherapy, whether refractory/relapse, WBC count grouping at initial diagnosis, levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine were risk factors for OS. Remission of induction chemotherapy, whether refractory/relapse, WBC count grouping and co-infections at initial diagnosis, levels of lactate dehydrogenase, and ECOG score were the risk factors for DFS. In the assessment of comorbidities, the two score classifications of charlson comorbidity index(CCI) were the risk factor of OS, however,whose effects for DFS were not statistically different.

METHODS: The DEG of ETP ALL were screened based on the intersection of GEO database and TCGA database. The functional enrichment analysis and interaction analysis were carried out for DEG. Next, MCODE algorithm was used to screen core genes of DEG, and the mirDIP online tool and starBase online tool were utilized to predict upstream miRNA and lncRNA of the core genes. RESULTS: A total of 424 DEG with a high credibility were identified, which were mainly enriched in the biological activity, such as transcriptional regulation, signaling pathway and protein function activation according to GO function, and the KEGG pathway was enriched in hematopoiesis, anoxic stress response, transcriptional misregulation, immunity and other functions, which interrelated each other 7 core genes were identified. Subsequently, 7 miRNAs and 19 lncRNAs were predicted to meet screening criteria. Finally, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA-pathway regulatory network was constructed. CONCLUSION: The DEG in ETP ALL has been identified based on data mining methods; the core genes have been gained by co-expression analysis, and their upstream miRNA and lncRNA can be predicted for the early diagnosis of ETP ALL, thus providing a theoretical basis for the early diagnosis and reasonable treatment of ETP ALL, and helping to look for new tumor biomarkers of ETP ALL different from classical T-ALL.","['Lun, Yong-Zhi', 'Sun, Jie', 'Yu, Zeng-Guo']","['Lun YZ', 'Sun J', 'Yu ZG']",,"['Department of Laboratorial Medicine, School of Pharmacy and Medical Technology, Putian University, Putian 351100, Fujian Province, China,E-mail: lunyz@163.com.', 'Department of Laboratorial Medicine, School of Pharmacy and Medical Technology, Putian University, Putian 351100, Fujian Province, China.', 'Department of Laboratorial Medicine, School of Pharmacy and Medical Technology, Putian University, Putian 351100, Fujian Province, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Humans', 'MicroRNAs', '*Precursor Cells, T-Lymphoid', '*Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Messenger']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0673-12 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):673-684. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.007.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: GFP-tagged plasmid for Pim1 overexpression and an empty vector plasmid were constructed, and then a stable Pim1 expressed U937 cell line and a control virus-infected U937 cell line were established by a lentiviral vector system. After confirming Pim1 overexpression in U937 cells, proliferation and apoptosis are determined by CCK-8 Kit and flow cytometry respectively. Transwell chemotaxis assay was used to measure the effect of Pim1 overexpression on AML cells. Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were applied to detect the influence of Pim1 overexpression on phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) and its location. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the expression of angiogenesis and adhesion related genes in AML primary cells. RESULTS: The lentivirus-infected AML cell line with Pim1 overex-pression and the control virusdouble ended arrowinfected AML cell line were established successfully. The Pim1 overexpression could enhance the proliferation and inhibit the cell apoptosis, moreover accompnied with the increasing expression of cyclin D1, phosphorylated BAD (pBAD) and pCXCR4. After SDF-1 alpha stimuli, Pim1 overexpression induced AML cell chemotaxis accompanied with p-CXCR4 expression and calcium influx increment. Pim1 overexpression has no effect on angiogenesis. Pim1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in AML patients than the healthy people. CONCLUSION: Pim1 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AML, which not only promotes AML cell proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis, but also enhances the chemotactic ability of leukemia cells, which closely relates with Pim1 phosphorylation of CXCR4 and the increase of intracellular calcium ion influx signals.","['Li, Qing', 'Sun, Rui-Xue', 'Ou, Yang', 'Luo, Hong-Mei', 'Wu, Yu']","['Li Q', 'Sun RX', 'Ou Y', 'Luo HM', 'Wu Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Laboratory of Hematology Research Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Laboratory of Hematology Research Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Laboratory of Hematology Research Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Laboratory of Hematology Research Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Laboratory of Hematology Research Chengdu 610041, Sichuan Province, China,E-mail: wu_yu@scu.edu.cn.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'U937 Cells']",,2019/06/18 06:00,2019/07/12 06:00,['2019/06/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137(2019)03-0664-09 [pii]', '10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;27(3):664-672. doi: 10.19746/j.cnki.issn.1009-2137.2019.03.006.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression level of SCIN in mononucleatr cells of bone marrow samples from 64 CML patients and 37 controls. The methylation levels of SCIN promoter in 65 patients with CML and 29 controls were detected by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing PCR. RESULTS: The expression level of SCIN in CML patients was significantly down-regulated (P0.05), compared with the control group. The down-regulation rate of SCIN expression in CML patients at chronic phase, accelerated phase and blast crisis was 61%, 67% and 75%, respectively. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the expression level of SCIN negatively correlated with the transcript level of BCR-ABL1 (R=-0.315, P0.05).

The mutation also existed in a pair of twins one of them developed acute myeloid leukaemia M4 (acute myelomonocytic leukaemia) type. The mutation resides in about 2-kb downstream of HOXA1 gene where a functional retinoic acid response element is located and also bound by histone demethylase KDM3B.

The most effective fractions were analyzed by flow cytometry and colorimetric assay for apoptosis induction and cell cycle changes. Various fractions from S. hortensis showed growth inhibitory effects on leukemia cells, among them two hexane and dichloromethane fractions with IC50 values of 32.1-47.8 mug/ml (K562) and 44.3-45.7 mug/ml (Jurkat) were the most effective. According to annexin V staining, both of these fractions significantly induced apoptosis at 50mug/ml in K562 (hexane; 73.06 +/- 5.11% and dichloromethane; 96.14 +/- 2.33%) and Jurkat cells (hexane; 78.85 +/- 11.9% and dichloromethane; 94.05 +/- 2.47%) 48 h after treatment.

Despite drugs are used to treat the disease clinically, the influence of these drugs on leukemia cells' biomechanical properties, which are closely related to complications like leukostasis or infiltration, is still unclear. Due to non-adherent and viscoelastic nature of leukemia cells, accurate measurement of their elastic modulus is still a challenging issue. In this study, we adopted rate-jump method together with optical tweezers indentation to accurately measure elastic modulus of leukemia cells K562 after phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), Cytoxan (CTX), and Dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, respectively. We found that compared to control sample, K562cells treated by PMA showed nearly a threefold increase in elastic modulus. Transwell experiment results suggested that the K562cells treated with PMA have the lowest migration capability. Besides, it was shown that the cytoskeleton protein gene alpha-tubulin and vimentin have a significant increase in expression after PMA treatment by qPCR. The results indicate that PMA has a significant influence on protein expression, stiffness, and migration ability of the leukemia cell K562, and may also play an important role in the leukostasis in leukemia.","['Wang, Kui', 'Xue, Yuntian', 'Peng, Ying', 'Pang, Xiangchao', 'Zhang, Yuanjun', 'Ruiz-Ortega, L I', 'Tian, Ye', 'Ngan, A H W', 'Tang, Bin']","['Wang K', 'Xue Y', 'Peng Y', 'Pang X', 'Zhang Y', 'Ruiz-Ortega LI', 'Tian Y', 'Ngan AHW', 'Tang B']",,"['Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China; Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China.', 'College of Materials Science and Engineering, Central South University of Forestry and Technology, Changsha, 410004, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PR China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Southern University of Science and Technology, Shenzhen, 518055, PR China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Cell Microenvironment and Disease Research, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Cell Microenvironment, PR China.

Addition of midostaurin to upfront intensive chemotherapy for younger patients with FLT3 mutant AML significantly improved overall survival and validated FLT3 as a therapeutic target. Other regimens such as sorafenib and hypomethylating agents (azacitidine, decitabine) have expanded the use of FLT3 inhibitors to other populations with FLT3 mutant AML.

Inhibition of PI3K, downstream of the B cell receptor pathway, represents an active therapeutic strategy in CLL. Here, we explore the relevance of PI3K inhibition in CLL, examine efficacy and toxicity of approved PI3K inhibitors in CLL, examine barriers to use of PI3K inhibitors, and explore strategies to optimize use of PI3K inhibitors in CLL. RECENT FINDINGS: Current generation PI3K inhibitors are active agents in CLL but their use may be limited by immune-mediated toxicities. Clinical trials of next generation PI3K inhibitors are ongoing and early data suggests these agents are highly active with potentially differentiated toxicity profiles. Furthermore, alternative dosing schedules may reduce toxicities of these agents. Inhibition of PI3K remains an important strategy in management of CLL and novel approaches to limit toxicities of PI3K inhibitors represent an important area of clinical research in CLL.","['Patel, Krish', 'Pagel, John M']","['Patel K', 'Pagel JM']",,"['Swedish Cancer Institute, Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, 1221 Madison Street, 10th Floor, Seattle, WA, 98104, USA.', 'Swedish Cancer Institute, Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, 1221 Madison Street, 10th Floor, Seattle, WA, 98104, USA.

BCL-2 Ovarian Killer (BOK) is a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family of proteins which, when stabilized from endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), induces apoptosis in response to ER stress. Although ER stress appropriately activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) in BOK-disrupted cells, the downstream effector signaling that includes ATF4 is defective. We used Nup98-HoxD13 (NHD13) transgenic mice to evaluate the consequences of BOK loss on hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Acute myeloid leukemia developed in 36.7% of NHD13 mice with a Bok gene knockout between the age of 8 and 13 months and presented a similar overall survival to the NHD13 mice. The loss of BOK exacerbated anemia in NHD13 mice, and NHD13/BOK-deficient mice exhibited significantly lower hemoglobin, lower mean cell hemoglobin concentration, and higher mean cell volume than NHD13 mice. Hematopoietic progenitor cell assays revealed a decreased amount of erythroid progenitor stem cells (BFU-E) in the bone marrow of NHD13-transgenic/BOK-deficient mice.

This study retrospectively analyzed outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for 192 adults with AML in third or subsequent complete remission (CR3+), 300 in second relapse (REL2), and 50 in third or subsequent relapse (REL3+) who were enrolled in a Japanese nationwide transplantation registry. The study population included patients undergoing umbilical cord blood transplantation, but not those undergoing haploidentical HCT. Patients transplanted in CR3+ had better survival than those transplanted in REL2 and REL3+ (48%, 21%, and 12% at 4 years; P < 0.001), and this was due to a reduction in post-transplant relapse (23%, 57%, and 52%; P < 0.001). The corresponding cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 33%, 26%, and 36% (P = 0.022). Multivariate analysis revealed significantly lower relapse and overall mortality for those in CR3+ and significantly lower non-relapse mortality for those in REL2. Hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for overall mortality were 2.02 (1.56-2.64) for REL2+ versus CR3+ (P < 0.001) and 2.12 (1.40-3.19) for REL3+ versus CR3+ (P < 0.001). Our analysis demonstrates the curative potential of allogeneic HCT for patients with a history of multiple AML relapses and suggests the potential benefits and risks of reinduction attempt before transplantation, highlighting the need for an individualized approach in determining whether to give reinduction therapy in this setting.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Mori, Jinichi', 'Aoki, Jun', 'Masuko, Masayoshi', 'Harada, Kaito', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Doki, Noriko', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Sakura, Toru', 'Kanamori, Heiwa', 'Sawa, Masashi', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Katayama, Yuta', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Yano, Shingo']","['Yanada M', 'Mori J', 'Aoki J', 'Masuko M', 'Harada K', 'Uchida N', 'Doki N', 'Fukuda T', 'Sakura T', 'Kanamori H', 'Sawa M', 'Kondo T', 'Katayama Y', 'Kanda J', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Yano S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1602-9775'],"['Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Aichi Cancer Center, 1-1 Kanokoden, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, 464-8681, Japan. myanada@aichi-cc.jp.', 'Jyoban Hospital Tokiwa Foundation, Fukushima, Japan.', 'Yokohama City University Medical Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Niigata University Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Tokai University School of Medicine, Isehara, Japan.', 'Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Saiseikai Maebashi Hospital, Maebashi, Japan.', 'Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Anjo Kosei Hospital, Anjo, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital and Atomic-Bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190615,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,2019/06/17 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/06/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03736-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03736-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Sep;98(9):2179-2186. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03736-5.

Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK1) has been shown to regulate specific cellular targets downstream of E2. However, whether and how SGK1 directly mediates the regulatory effects of E2 on trophoblasts functions remain unknown. METHODS: SGK1 expression in human villous samples and serum E2 levels were measured in women with early pregnancy loss (EPL) and healthy pregnant women. The effect of E2 on SGK1 regulation was assessed using luciferase reporter gene assay and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assay. The mediation of regulatory effects of E2 by SGK1 on trophoblast functions including cell viability, invasion and related signaling molecules such as B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6, E-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinase 2, alpha-ENaC, vascular endothelial growth factor, and the phosphorylation status of FOXO1 and AKT were evaluated in HTR8/SVneo cells transfected with SGK1 knockdown plasmid with/without E2 treatment. RESULTS: SGK1 protein levels in human villous samples and serum E2 levels were decreased in patients with EPL compared to controls. E2 (10nM) increased SGK1 promoter activity directly through estrogen receptor. E2-activated SGK1 enhanced cell viability, invasion and downstream targets in trophoblast cells. SGK1 knockdown abrogated the above responses to E2 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: SGK1 mediates the effects of E2 on trophoblast viability and invasion, suggesting that SGK1 acts as a key node in regulating the cross-talk at the feto-maternal interface during the development of placenta and might be a potential therapeutic target for EPL.","['He, Wei-Hua', 'Jin, Meng-Meng', 'Liu, Ai-Ping', 'Zhou, Ying', 'Hu, Xiao-Ling', 'Zhu, Yi-Min', 'Liu, Ai-Xia']","['He WH', 'Jin MM', 'Liu AP', 'Zhou Y', 'Hu XL', 'Zhu YM', 'Liu AX']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, 79 Qingchun Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, 310003, PR China.

However, the molecular basis for these effects is not fully known. To address this issue, in this study we screened molecules whose expression is altered by KIT D816 V mutation and found that Pim kinases were overexpressed in D816V-mutant neoplastic mast cells. This was accompanied by upregulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and downregulation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2). Activated Pim kinases promoted the survival of D816 V cells by maintaining mTOR and p70S6K activation even under nutrient starvation. Conversely, cell proliferation was suppressed by inhibiting Pim kinases. The mRNA level of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) was about 2-fold higher in D816 V cells; this was associated with a 2-fold increase in migratory capacity, which was modulated by Pim kinases. We also confirmed that upregulation of Pim kinases is a feature specific to cells with the D816 V mutation and is not observed in cells with the c-Kit activating N822 K mutation. These data suggest Pim kinases as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of mast cell neoplasms with KIT D816 V mutation.","['Park, Hyejoo', 'Kim, Dongchan', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo']","['Park H', 'Kim D', 'Koh Y', 'Yoon SS']",,"['Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea; Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, 03080, Republic of Korea.

Here, we show that DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) mediated by topoisomerase 2 (TOP2) activities are enriched at chromatin loop anchors with high transcriptional activity. Recurrent DSBs occur at CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) and cohesin-bound sites at the bases of chromatin loops, and their frequency positively correlates with transcriptional output and directionality. The physiological relevance of this preferential positioning is indicated by the finding that genes recurrently translocating to drive leukemias are highly transcribed and are enriched at loop anchors. These genes accumulate DSBs at recurrent hotspots that give rise to chromosomal fusions relying on the activity of both TOP2 isoforms and on transcriptional elongation. We propose that transcription and 3D chromosome folding jointly pose a threat to genomic stability and are key contributors to the occurrence of genome rearrangements that drive cancer.","['Gothe, Henrike Johanna', 'Bouwman, Britta Annika Maria', 'Gusmao, Eduardo Gade', 'Piccinno, Rossana', 'Petrosino, Giuseppe', 'Sayols, Sergi', 'Drechsel, Oliver', 'Minneker, Vera', 'Josipovic, Natasa', 'Mizi, Athanasia', 'Nielsen, Christian Friberg', 'Wagner, Eva-Maria', 'Takeda, Shunichi', 'Sasanuma, Hiroyuki', 'Hudson, Damien Francis', 'Kindler, Thomas', 'Baranello, Laura', 'Papantonis, Argyris', 'Crosetto, Nicola', 'Roukos, Vassilis']","['Gothe HJ', 'Bouwman BAM', 'Gusmao EG', 'Piccinno R', 'Petrosino G', 'Sayols S', 'Drechsel O', 'Minneker V', 'Josipovic N', 'Mizi A', 'Nielsen CF', 'Wagner EM', 'Takeda S', 'Sasanuma H', 'Hudson DF', 'Kindler T', 'Baranello L', 'Papantonis A', 'Crosetto N', 'Roukos V']",,"['Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany; Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany; Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany; Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075 Gottingen, Germany.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Radiation Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Hematology, Medical Oncology and Pneumology, University Medical Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany; University Cancer Center of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Cell Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, 50931 Cologne, Germany; Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Gottingen, 37075 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Institute of Molecular Biology (IMB), Mainz 55128, Germany.

In this review, we discussed the known and unknown aspects of relapse post haplo-SCT. Encouragingly, haplo-SCT experienced lower or similar incidence of relapse. But there is currently a lack of multicenter prospective studies evaluating the outcomes of different haplo-SCT strategies.

A number of studies indicated that treating hematological malignancy patients with haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) could achieve comparable outcomes to those who underwent matched sibling donor transplantation (MSDT). In recent years, more and more evidence support the notion that haploidentical allografts may have a stronger graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect than MSDT. In this review, we summarized the transplant outcomes of haplo-SCT and MSDT, mainly focusing on the subgroup of patients who will benefit from the stronger GVL effects of haplo-SCT compared with MSDT. We also offered strategies of how to translate the strong antileukemia activity of haploidentical allograft into superior survival.

In the present study, we investigated the potential benefit of combination therapy with imatinib and Huaier extract, a traditional Chinese medicine, in Ik6(+) Ph(+) ALL. The Ik6(+) Ph(+) -ALL cell lines Sup-B15 or BV173 were treated with Huaier extract, imatinib or the combination of the two. Analysis of cell proliferation showed that the combined treatment of imatinib and Huaier extract exhibited a greater effect on cell inhibition. Using flow cytometry and Western blot, enhanced effects on the induction of cell apoptosis were observed. The combination of the two drugs also exhibited a significant effect in decreasing the protein and enzymatic activity levels of BCR-ABL. The molecular mechanisms may be involved in BCR-ABL related pathways, including the inactivation of p-AKT, p-STAT5, p-mTOR and p-Lyn. Consistent with the in vitro results, the combination of Huaier extract and imatinib inhibit the growth and infiltration of xenografted tumors. Taken together, our findings show that Huaier extract enhances the anticancer efficacy of imatinib in Ik6(+) Ph(+) ALL Further, it also provides a potential clinical application in the treatment of refractory Ph(+) ALL.","['Qu, Ping', 'Han, Juan', 'Qiu, Yining', 'Yu, Hui', 'Hao, Jinjin', 'Jin, Runming', 'Zhou, Fen']","['Qu P', 'Han J', 'Qiu Y', 'Yu H', 'Hao J', 'Jin R', 'Zhou F']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.

In our study, we analysed 55 childhood hyperdiploid BCP-ALL patients using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray testing. The group consisted mostly of patients with the modal number of chromosomes between 54 and 58 (34 cases). Within this group, Trisomy 4 and Trisomy 10 (30 cases) were the most frequent cases. Additionally, a total of 93 structural abnormalities mainly affecting chromosomes 1, 6, 9, 12, and 17 as well as 68 copy number alterations (CNAs) were identified. The microarray testing revealed a loss of ETV6, IKZF1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, PAX5, and RB1. Moreover, chromosomal abnormalities resulting in the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) were also observed. Currently, patients with hyperdiploidy constitute a genetically heterogeneous group, and therefore, it is insufficient to rely only on banding cytogenetic analysis for the identification of hyperdiploid karyotype. Microarray testing has been proven an effective and satisfactory tool for the analysis of molecular karyotypes and to redefine the prognostic criteria in hyperdiploid patients.","['Lejman, Monika', 'Zawitkowska, Joanna', 'Styka, Borys', 'Babicz, Mariusz', 'Winnicka, Dorota', 'Zaucha-Prazmo, Agnieszka', 'Pastorczak, Agata', 'Taha, Joanna', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R']","['Lejman M', 'Zawitkowska J', 'Styka B', 'Babicz M', 'Winnicka D', 'Zaucha-Prazmo A', 'Pastorczak A', 'Taha J', 'Mlynarski W', 'Kowalczyk JR']",,"['Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', ""Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, University Children's Hospital, Lublin, Poland."", ""Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, University Children's Hospital, Lublin, Poland."", 'Laboratory of Genetic Diagnostics, Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric, Oncology, Hematology and Diabetology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190528,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', '*Ploidies', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality']",,2019/06/16 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/06/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(19)30101-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2019.05.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2019 Aug;83:106163. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2019.05.013.

In this study, we reported the transcriptome profiles of bone marrow cells in four B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients before and after CD19-specific CAR-T therapy. CD19-CAR-T therapy remarkably reduced the number of leukemia cells, and three patients achieved bone marrow remission (minimal residual disease negative). The efficacy of CD19-CAR-T therapy on B-ALL was positively correlated with the abundance of CAR and immune cell subpopulations, e.g., CD8(+) T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, in the bone marrow. Additionally, CD19-CAR-T therapy mainly influenced the expression of genes linked to cell cycle and immune response pathways, including the NK cell mediated cytotoxicity and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. The regulatory network analyses revealed that microRNAs (e.g., miR-148a-3p and miR-375), acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors, could regulate the crosstalk between the genes encoding transcription factors (TFs; e.g., JUN and FOS) and histones (e.g., HIST1H4A and HIST2H4A) involved in CD19-CAR-T therapy. Furthermore, many long non-coding RNAs showed a high degree of co-expression with TFs or histones (e.g., FOS and HIST1H4B) and were associated with immune processes. These transcriptome analyses provided important clues for further understanding the gene expression and related mechanisms underlying the efficacy of CAR-T immunotherapy.","['Zhang, Qiong', 'Hu, Hui', 'Chen, Si-Yi', 'Liu, Chun-Jie', 'Hu, Fei-Fei', 'Yu, Jianming', 'Wu, Yaohui', 'Guo, An-Yuan']","['Zhang Q', 'Hu H', 'Chen SY', 'Liu CJ', 'Hu FF', 'Yu J', 'Wu Y', 'Guo AY']",,"['Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics and Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.

We report BU PK data on HSCT conditioning for infants with KMT2A-gene-rearrangement-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (MLL-r ALL). Infants showed wide variation in BU PK indices, such as clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) value, which are distributed more widely among those who received oral, rather than intravenous (IV), BU. Because the steady state concentration (Css) fluctuates readily in infants, dose re-adjustment based on PK at the initial administration was important even if the initial dose was determined by a PK test. HSCT can be performed safely within the Css range of 600-900 ng/mL per dose, although it was difficult to fit within the therapeutic index of BU. The clinical outcome of engraftment, graft-versus-host disease, adverse events, including sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and survival did not correlate with the BU PK data, which paradoxically suggests that remaining within this Css range helped minimize transplant-related toxicities, while securing engraftment in infants with MLL-r ALL.","['Takachi, Takayuki', 'Arakawa, Yuki', 'Nakamura, Hiroyoshi', 'Watanabe, Tomoyuki', 'Aoki, Yuki', 'Ohshima, Junjiro', 'Takahashi, Yoshihiro', 'Hirayama, Masahiro', 'Miyamura, Takako', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Koh, Katsuyoshi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke']","['Takachi T', 'Arakawa Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Watanabe T', 'Aoki Y', 'Ohshima J', 'Takahashi Y', 'Hirayama M', 'Miyamura T', 'Sugita K', 'Koh K', 'Horibe K', 'Ishii E', 'Mizutani S', 'Tomizawa D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1520-7007'],"[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shizuoka Children's Hospital, Shizuoka, Japan."", 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Department of Pharmacy, Chiba University Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'International University of Health and Welfare Mita Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Nutrition and Health, Faculty of Psychological and Physical Science, Aichi Gakuin University, Nisshin, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology/Oncology for Children and Adolescents, Sapporo Hokuyu Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aomori Prefectural Central Hospital, Aomori, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Suita, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Saitama Children's Medical Center, Saitama, Japan."", 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization, Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Toon, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, 2-10-1 Okura, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo, 157-8535, Japan. tomizawa-d@ncchd.go.jp.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190614,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['Allografts', '*Busulfan/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/mortality/therapy', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning']",,2019/06/16 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02684-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02684-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Sep;110(3):355-363. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02684-0.

Segmentation of the blood smear cells and extraction of features of the cells is essential in the field of medicine. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a form of blood cancer caused due to the abnormal increase in the production of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow. It mostly affects the children below 5 years and adults above 50 years of age. Due to the late diagnosis and cost of the devices used for the determination, the mortality rate has increased drastically. Flow cytometry technique that performs automated counting fails to identify the abnormal cells. Manual recount performed using hemocytometer are prone to errors and are imprecise. The proposed work aims to survey different computer-aided system techniques used to segment the blood smear image. The primary objective here is to derive knowledge from the different methodologies used for extracting features from white blood cells and develop a system that would accurately segment the blood smear image by overcoming the drawbacks of the previous works. The objective mentioned above is achieved in two ways. Firstly, a novel algorithm is developed to segment the nucleus and cytoplasm of white blood cell. Secondly, a model is built to extract the features and train the model. The different supervised classifiers are compared, and the one with the highest accuracy is used for the classification. Six hundred images are used in the experimentation. InfoGainAttributeEval and the Ranker Search method are used to achieve the feature selection which in turn helps in improvising the classifier performance. The result shows the classification of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia into its three respective categories namely: ALL-L1, ALL-L2, ALL-L3. The model can differentiate between a normal peripheral blood smear and an abnormal blood smear. The extracted feature values of a cancerous cell and a normal cell are also shown. The performance of the model is evaluated using the test images stained with various stains. The proposed algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 98.6%. The promising results show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool by the pathologists.

According to the European LeukemiaNet prognostic index, 5 patients had favorable risk, 18 had intermediate risk, and 11 had poor risk. The complete remission was achieved in 58% of the patients with tolerable toxicities. Fifteen patients underwent stem cell transplantation later. Patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had a significantly improved 1-year overall survival compared with those who did not (73% vs. 29%, P < 0.001).

Despite intensive chemotherapy leading to initial treatment responses, relapse caused by intrinsic or acquired drug resistance represents a major challenge. Here, we report that histone 3 lysine 27 demethylase KDM6A (UTX) is targeted by inactivating mutations and mutation-independent regulation in relapsed AML. Analyses of matched diagnosis and relapse specimens from individuals with KDM6A mutations showed an outgrowth of the KDM6A mutated tumor population at relapse. KDM6A expression is heterogeneously regulated and relapse-specific loss of KDM6A was observed in 45.7% of CN-AML patients. KDM6A-null myeloid leukemia cells were more resistant to treatment with the chemotherapeutic agents cytarabine (AraC) and daunorubicin. Inducible re-expression of KDM6A in KDM6A-null cell lines suppressed proliferation and sensitized cells again to AraC treatment. RNA expression analysis and functional studies revealed that resistance to AraC was conferred by downregulation of the nucleoside membrane transporter ENT1 (SLC29A1) by reduced H3K27 acetylation at the ENT1 locus. Our results show that loss of KDM6A provides cells with a selective advantage during chemotherapy, which ultimately leads to the observed outgrowth of clones with KDM6A mutations or reduced KDM6A expression at relapse.","['Stief, Sophie M', 'Hanneforth, Anna-Li', 'Weser, Sabrina', 'Mattes, Raphael', 'Carlet, Michela', 'Liu, Wen-Hsin', 'Bartoschek, Michael D', 'Dominguez Moreno, Helena',

However, a matched sibling donor (MSD) is still considered the optimal donor. Using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database, we compared outcomes after Haplo-HCT vs MSD in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1). Data from 1205 adult CR1 AML patients (2008-2015) were analyzed. A total of 336 patients underwent PT-Cy-based Haplo-HCT and 869 underwent MSD using calcineurin inhibitor-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. The Haplo-HCT group included more reduced-intensity conditioning (65% vs 30%) and bone marrow grafts (62% vs 7%), consistent with current practice. In multivariable analysis, Haplo-HCT and MSD groups were not different with regard to overall survival (P = .15), leukemia-free survival (P = .50), nonrelapse mortality (P = .16), relapse (P = .90), or grade II-IV acute GVHD (P = .98). However, the Haplo-HCT group had a significantly lower rate of chronic GVHD (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.30-0.48; P < .001). Results of subgroup analyses by conditioning intensity and graft source suggested that the reduced incidence of chronic GVHD in Haplo-HCT is not limited to a specific graft source or conditioning intensity. Center effect and minimal residual disease-donor type interaction were not predictors of outcome. Our results indicate a lower rate of chronic GVHD after PT-Cy-based Haplo-HCT vs MSD using calcineurin inhibitor-based GVHD prophylaxis, but similar other outcomes, in patients with AML in CR1. Haplo-HCT is a viable alternative to MSD in these patients.","['Rashidi, Armin', 'Hamadani, Mehdi', 'Zhang, Mei-Jie', 'Wang, Hai-Lin', 'Abdel-Azim, Hisham', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Assal, Amer', 'Bajel,

Beyond protein-coding RNAs (derived from only approximately 1.5% of the genome), noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) are emerging as versatile key regulators of gene information involved in multiple major biological processes. Accordingly, deregulation of ncRNA expression has been associated with multiple diseases, including cancer. In this issue of Cancer Research, Shahabi and colleagues characterize LINC00261 as a tumor suppressor long ncRNA epigenetically silenced in lung cancer. They provide crucial mechanistic insights to explain its role in lung tumorigenesis, demonstrating that deregulation of the LINC00261/FOXA2 locus disrupts DNA damage repair signaling, cell-cycle control, and cell proliferation.See related article by Shahabi et al., p. 3050.","['Davalos, Veronica', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Davalos V', 'Esteller M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4077-5137'],"[""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",,2019/06/16 06:00,2019/07/04 06:00,['2019/06/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['79/12/3028 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0910 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Jun 15;79(12):3028-3030. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0910.,12,,,,['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],,,,,['Cancer Res. 2019 Jun 15;79(12):3050-3062.

We report our experience with the high-dose chemotherapy mCBAD (modified cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone) regimen in newly diagnosed MM (NDMM), relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), and plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We searched our electronic records database for MM patients who received mCBAD from 2010 to 2016 for 28-day cycles of cyclophosphamide 350 mg/m(2) intravenously (I.V.) twice daily with mesna 400 mg/m(2) I.V. daily (days 1-4), bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) subcutaneously/I.V. (days 1, 4, 8, 11), doxorubicin 9 mg/m(2) daily continuous infusion (days 1-4), dexamethasone 40 mg orally daily (on days 1-4, 9-12, 17-20). International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria were used for response assessment and diagnosis. Descriptive statistics, Fisher exact test, chi(2), Wilcoxon rank sum, and Kaplan-Meier were used for statistical purposes. RESULTS: One hundred forty patients met the inclusion criteria. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered. The overall response rate was 85% in patients with RRMM (n = 116) and 100% in NDMM (n = 13) and PCL (n = 11) patients. Respective median progression-free survival (mPFS) for NDMM, PCL, and RRMM were 19.61 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.26 to not applicable [NA]), 7.56 months (95% CI, 4.7 to NA), and 4.64 months (95% CI, 3.75-6.73). Patients with RRMM who used mCBAD as a bridge to autologous transplant (36.2%) had mPFS (11.48 months; 95% CI, 7.52-15.9 months) compared with those who did not (mPFS: 3.19 months; 95% CI, 2.4-3.75 months). Cytopenias occurred in more than 90% of patients, and febrile neutropenia was noted in 26%. All cases of treatment-related mortality (8%) occurred in patients with RRMM, except for 1 patient with PCL. CONCLUSION: mCBAD results in high response rates in myeloma and PCL, however, with high treatment-related mortality. Its use in RRMM should be limited to patients who have immediate need for therapy without other treatment options and who have good performance status (score of 0-1) or NDMM if novel agents are not available depending on practice setting. mCBAD can be a treatment option for patients with PCL.","['Tabchi, Samer', 'Nair, Rajit', 'Kunacheewa, Chutima', 'Patel, Krina K', 'Lee, Hans C', 'Thomas, Sheeba K', 'Amini, Behrang', 'Ahmed, Sairah', 'Mehta, Rohtesh S', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Qazilbash, Muzzaffar H', 'Weber, Donna M', 'Orlowski, Robert Z', 'Alexanian, Raymond', 'Feng, Lei', 'Manasanch, Elisabet E']","['Tabchi S', 'Nair R', 'Kunacheewa C', 'Patel KK', 'Lee HC', 'Thomas SK', 'Amini B', 'Ahmed S', 'Mehta RS', 'Bashir Q', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Weber DM', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Alexanian R', 'Feng L', 'Manasanch EE']",,"['Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Diagnostic Imaging, Department of Diagnostic Radiology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

We aimed to examine the effects of gradual treatment withdrawal and whether TFR is feasible for patients with less deep but stable remission. METHODS: The De-Escalation and Stopping Treatment with Imatinib, Nilotinib, or sprYcel (DESTINY) study is a non-randomised, phase 2 trial undertaken at 20 UK hospitals. We recruited patients (aged >/=18 years) with chronic myeloid leukaemia in first chronic phase, who had received TKI therapy for 3 years or more, with three or more BCR-ABL quantitative PCR transcript measurements (BCR-ABL to ABL1 ratio) less than 0.1% (major molecular response [MMR]) in the 12 months before entry. Patients with all PCR measurements less than 0.01% were assigned to the MR4 group. Patients with results between 0.1% and 0.01% were allocated to the MMR group. TKI treatment was de-escalated to half the standard dose for 12 months, then stopped for a further 24 months, with frequent PCR monitoring. Recurrence was defined as the first of two consecutive samples with PCR measurement greater than 0.1%, which required treatment recommencement at full dose. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who could first de-escalate their treatment for 12 months, and then stop treatment completely for a further 2 years, without losing MMR. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01804985. FINDINGS: Treatment at entry was imatinib (n=148), nilotinib (n=16), or dasatinib (n=10), for a median of 6.9 years (IQR 4.8-10.2). Between Dec 16, 2013, and May 6, 2015, we enrolled 49 patients into the MMR group and 125 into the MR4 group. In the MR4 group, 84 (67%) patients reached the 36-month trial completion point and recurrence-free survival was 72% (95% CI 64-80). In the MMR group, 16 (33%) entrants completed the study and recurrence-free survival was 36% (25-53). No disease progression was seen and two deaths occurred due to unrelated causes. All recurrences regained MMR within 5 months of treatment resumption. INTERPRETATION: Initial de-escalation before discontinuation might improve the success of TFR protocols, although the mechanism of its benefit is not yet clear. The findings also suggest that TFR merits further study in patients with stable MMR.

However, little is known about the role of MCL1 in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas. In this study, we aimed to clarify whether MCL1 could be a therapeutic target in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinomas for which no effective molecular targeted drugs are available. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined to what extent MCL1 knockdown either alone or in combination with MEK inhibitor trametinib suppressed growth or induced apoptosis in the KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line H441 and EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line H1975. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic effects of dual inhibition of MCL1 and Bcl-xL, another anti-apoptotic BCL2 family member, in these two cell lines. RESULTS: MCL1 knockdown alone did not induce apoptosis in H441 or H1975 cells. However, MCL1-depleted H441 and H1975 cells underwent apoptosis and decreased in number in the presence of trametinib. We also confirmed that combined therapy by MCL1 knockdown and trametinib almost completely suppressed the growth of H441 cells in vivo. Moreover, dual knockdown of MCL1 and Bcl-xL induced extensive apoptosis in H441 and H1975 cells. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that combined treatments of MCL1 knockdown and trametinib or dual inhibition of MCL1 and Bcl-xL would be effective therapies for lung adenocarcinomas including the KRAS-mutant subtype.","['Tada, Makoto', 'Sumi, Toshiyuki', 'Tanaka, Yusuke', 'Hirai, Sachie', 'Yamaguchi, Miki', 'Miyajima, Masahiro', 'Niki, Toshiro', 'Takahashi, Hiroki', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Sakuma, Yuji']","['Tada M', 'Sumi T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Hirai S', 'Yamaguchi M', 'Miyajima M', 'Niki T', 'Takahashi H', 'Watanabe A', 'Sakuma Y']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan; Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan; Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan; Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Division of Integrative Pathology, Jichi Medical University, 3311-1 Yakushiji, Shimotsuke, Tochigi 329-0498, Japan.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan.

Thus, there is a need for versatile and data-adaptive methods for filtering data prior to investigating the underlying biological phenomena. Here, we propose a data-adaptive pipeline for filtering metabolomics data that are generated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) platforms. Our data-adaptive pipeline includes novel methods for filtering features based on blank samples, proportions of missing values, and estimated intra-class correlation coefficients. RESULTS: Using metabolomics datasets that were generated in our laboratory from samples of human blood, as well as two public LC-MS datasets, we compared our data-adaptive filtering method with traditional methods that rely on non-method specific thresholds. The data-adaptive approach outperformed traditional approaches in terms of removing noisy features and retaining high quality, biologically informative ones. The R code for running the data-adaptive filtering method is provided at https://github.com/courtneyschiffman/Metabolomics-Filtering . CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed data-adaptive filtering pipeline is intuitive and effectively removes uninformative features from untargeted metabolomics datasets. It is particularly relevant for interrogation of biological phenomena in data derived from complex matrices associated with biospecimens.","['Schiffman, Courtney', 'Petrick, Lauren', 'Perttula, Kelsi', 'Yano, Yukiko', 'Carlsson, Henrik', 'Whitehead, Todd', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Hayes, Josie', 'Rappaport, Stephen', 'Dudoit, Sandrine']","['Schiffman C', 'Petrick L', 'Perttula K', 'Yano Y', 'Carlsson H', 'Whitehead T', 'Metayer C', 'Hayes J', 'Rappaport S', 'Dudoit S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4126-9033'],"['Division of Biostatistics, UC Berkeley, Berkeley, 94720, USA. courtneys@berkeley.edu.', 'The Senator Frank R.

Consequently, parenchymal and CSF exposure of most antineoplastic agents following intravenous (IV) administration is lower than systemic exposure. In this review, we describe the different strategies developed to improve delivery of antineoplastic agents into the brain in primary and metastatic CNS tumors. We observed that several methods, such as BBB disruption (BBBD), intra-arterial (IA) and intracavitary chemotherapy, are not routinely used because of their invasiveness and potentially serious adverse effects. Conversely, intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy has been safely and widely practiced in the treatment of pediatric primary and metastatic tumors, replacing the neurotoxic cranial irradiation for the treatment of childhood lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). IT chemotherapy may be achieved through lumbar puncture (LP) or across the Ommaya intraventricular reservoir, which are both described in this review. Additionally, we overviewed pharmacokinetics and toxic aspects of the main IT antineoplastic drugs employed for primary or metastatic childhood CNS tumors (such as methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside, hydrocortisone), with a concise focus on new and less used IT antineoplastic agents.","['Triarico, Silvia', 'Maurizi, Palma', 'Mastrangelo, Stefano', 'Attina, Giorgio', 'Capozza, Michele Antonio', 'Ruggiero, Antonio']","['Triarico S', 'Maurizi P', 'Mastrangelo S', 'Attina G', 'Capozza MA', 'Ruggiero A']",,"['Pediatric Oncology Unit, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

We found progranulin (GRN), a protein that has been linked to inflammation and cancer, to be upregulated in the serum of CLL patients compared to healthy controls, and increased GRN levels to be associated with an increased hazard for disease progression and death. This raised the question of whether GRN is a functional driver of CLL. We observed that recombinant GRN did not directly affect viability, activation, or proliferation of primary CLL cells in vitro. However, GRN secretion was induced in co-cultures of CLL cells with stromal cells that enhanced CLL cell survival. Gene expression profiling and protein analyses revealed that primary mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in co-culture with CLL cells acquire a cancer-associated fibroblast-like phenotype. Despite its upregulation in the co-cultures, GRN treatment of MSCs did not mimic this effect. To test the relevance of GRN for CLL in vivo, we made use of the Emu-TCL1 CLL mouse model. As we detected strong GRN expression in myeloid cells, we performed adoptive transfer of Emu-TCL1 leukemia cells to bone marrow chimeric Grn(-/-) mice that lack GRN in hematopoietic cells. Thereby, we observed that CLL-like disease developed comparable in Grn(-/-) chimeras and respective control mice.

It was demonstrated that (+)-UA derivatives 6a-6g inhibited the proliferation of leukemia cells HL-60 and K562 with low micromolar IC50 values. Mechanisms of action were investigated to find that 6g induced apoptosis in HL-60 and K562 cell lines, and affected the expression of MNK/eIF4E axis-related proteins, such as Mcl-1, p-eIF4E, p-4E-BP1. Finally, kinase inhibition assay suggested 6g was a potential inhibitor of pan-Pim kinases. Meanwhile, the blocking of phosphorylation of BAD and 4E-BP1 by 6g, together with the proposed binding mode of 6g with Pim-1 further confirmed its Pim inhibition effects.

This inspired scientists to continuously explore anticancer agents from natural compounds. Kaempferol is an ordinary natural compound, the most common flavonoid, which is widely existed in vegetables and fruits. It has been reported to have various anticancer activities, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, leukemia, etc. Meanwhile, we found that there were more reports on breast cancer among these cancers although there are limited clinical studies that have addressed the benefits of kaempferol as an anti-cancer agent for breast cancer treatment. Then we realize that although kaempferol has been reported to have anti-breast cancer effect many times, it is still far from becoming a real anti-breast cancer agent. Therefore, in this review, we talk about the options for improving the anti-breast cancer effect of kaempferol, including various techniques and methods to improve the bioavailability of kaempferol, the idea of combining other compounds to produce synergistic effects, and the possibility of developing kaempferol into a targeted drug delivery system.","['Wang, Xueni', 'Yang, Yuting', 'An, Yating', 'Fang, Gang']","['Wang X', 'Yang Y', 'An Y', 'Fang G']",,"['Guangxi Zhuang Yao Medicine Center of Engineering and Technology, Guangxi University of Chinese Medicine, 13 Wuhe Road, Qingxiu District, Nanning, 530200, China.

All patients diagnosed with HCL between July/1987 and Jun/2018 were included in this analysis. Fifty-four patients were included in this analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 55 years (range, 26-88), with 37% being above 60 years-old. Most patients were treated with cladribine in our cohort (n=36; 68%), administered through intravenous continuous infusion. Remaining patients were firstly managed with splenectomy (n=7; 13%), IFN (n=6; 11%) and rituximab (n=2; 4%). In a univariate analysis, platelet count and B2M level at diagnosis were statistically associated with CR achievement (p=0.004 and p=0.024, respectively). A median follow-up time of 9 years was calculated. Estimated 10-year overall survival was 91.1% (95% confidence interval, 77-97). In this cohort, 10 patients had any second neoplasm, diagnosed before or after HCL. Regarding the sites of cancer, 69% were of skin - 8/16 carcinoma-type and 3/16 melanoma-type. Our response and survival data are similar to those reported by literature, which reaffirms the role of purine analogs in current HCL management.

Macrophages play a crucial role in host defense against invading pathogens. In the present study, whole transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host factors including genes, microRNA (miRNA), long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and their regulatory network in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). In total, 128 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and 15 DE miRNAs were identified in MDMs at 3h post infection (hpi), and 30 DE lncRNAs and 8 DE miRNAs were identified in MDMs at 36 hpi during ALV-J infection. We further constructed the DE lncRNAs-mRNAs, miRNA-mRNAs and lncRNAs-miRNA-mRNAs interaction networks. The results suggested that DE lncRNAs and miRNAs are involved in the regulation of CCND3 and SOCS5 in Jak-STAT signaling pathway via ceRNA network in ALV-J-infected MDMs at 3 hpi. In addition, lncRNAs including XLOC_672329, ALDBGALG0000001429, XLOC_016500 and ALDBGALG0000000253 cis-regulating CH25H, CISH, IL-1beta and CD80 respectively in MDMs at 3 hpi participated in host antiviral responses. Our findings give a comprehensive view of the connection between non-coding RNA and ALV-J in chicken primary macrophages, and provide an excellent resource for further studies of epigenetic effects on ALV-J disease resistance breeding as well as immune system and genomic researches.","['Dai, Manman', 'Feng, Min', 'Xie, Tingting', 'Zhang, Xiquan']","['Dai M', 'Feng M', 'Xie T', 'Zhang X']",,"[""College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.

The JAK2 R867Q somatic mutation is detected in a subset of AL patients. However, roles of JAK2 R867Q mutation in the pathogenesis of AL remain unclear. In this study, homology modeling analysis showed that loss of interaction between R867 and Y613 disrupted the JAK2 JH1/JH2 domain's interactions was responsible for its activation. JAK2 R867Q and mutations (R867A and R867G) abolished this interaction caused JAK2 constitutive activation.

Furthermore, our studies showed that abolished R867 and Y613 interaction disrupted JH1/JH2 domains' interactions and led to JAK2 constitutive activation. More importantly, mutations (R867Q, R867A and R867G) disrupted this interaction enhanced the activity of JAK2-STAT5 pathway and the proliferation of Ba/F3 and MV4-11 cells. Further study showed that JAK2 R867Q mutation promoted the expression of proliferation marker and inhibited the differentiation marker of Ba/F3 and MV4-11 cells.

Interestingly, we observed a group of mutations that expanded during remission, which we named the ""remission clone."" To determine the nature of the remission clones, we performed flow cytometry-based cell sorting followed by ultradeep sequencing. The remission clone repeatedly expanded after chemotherapeutic cycles and was suppressed during relapse in the myeloid lineage (multipotent hematopoietic stem, progenitor, and myeloid cells). On the other hand, the remission clone was consistently observed in lymphoid lineages (B and T cells) regardless of the disease state. When transfected into the HEK-293 cell line, the NR2C2(A93V) mutant exhibited a growth advantage (all p values < 0.05). The results indicate that the remission clone seems to be another form of clonal hematopoiesis, but without a clear association with leukemia. As the remission clone is present in both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, it likely originates from ancestral hematopoietic cell lineages. More importantly, the remission clone is distinct from the leukemic clone; therefore, mutations expanded during remission require special interpretation when performing next-generation sequencing-based measurable residual disease assessment.","['Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Kim, TaeHyung', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Cho, Young-Chang', 'Cho, SaYeon', 'Jung, Sung-Hoon', 'Ahn, Seo-Yeon', 'Jung, Seung-Yeon', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Choi, SeungHyun', 'Lee, Ja-Yeon', 'Shin, Myung-Geun', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Kim, Il-Chul', 'Zhang, Zhaolei', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Ahn JS', 'Kim T', 'Kim YK', 'Cho YC', 'Cho S', 'Jung SH', 'Ahn SY', 'Jung SY', 'Yang DH', 'Lee JJ', 'Choi S', 'Lee JY', 'Shin MG', 'Yoshida K', 'Ogawa S', 'Kim IC', 'Zhang Z', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim DDH']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea; The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Gwangju Veterans Hospital, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'College of Pharmacy, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'St. Carollo General Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumour Biology, Kyoto University Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumour Biology, Kyoto University Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Chonnam National University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.

However, the CLL patients who have discontinued the ibrutinib treatment in clinical trials have been reported to have poor prognosis. OBJECTIVES: In this retrospective study by the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG), we analyzed the reasons for ibrutinib cessation and outcomes after discontinuing ibrutinib in refractory or relapsed CLL patients treated in a compassionate use program in Poland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Polish CLL patients were included if they discontinued ibrutinib for any reason. The clinical data on the course of ibrutinib treatment was collected anonymously using electronic Case Report Forms (CRFs). The causes of discontinuation of ibrutinib as reported by the treating physicians were analyzed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients who discontinued ibrutinib were identified. The median duration of ibrutinib treatment in this group was 4.4 months (range: 0.2-25.2). The main reason for discontinuing ibrutinib was adverse events (n = 20, 54%), while 14 (38%) patients discontinued therapy due to disease progression and 3 (8%) due to other causes. The most common treatment complications that led to ibrutinib cessation were severe respiratory tract infections (9 patients, 24%). In the group discontinuing ibrutinib for progressive disease, 11 patients progressed with untransformed CLL, while in 3 patients, a rare type of Richter transformation to Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed. Twenty-nine patients (78%) died during the follow-up period, and median overall survival (OS) reached 2.0 months (95% CI = 0.8-5.5 months). Importantly, no significant survival difference was detected between patients who discontinued ibrutinib due to disease progression and due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this analysis indicate that ibrutinib discontinuation in relapsed or refractory CLL is associated with poor prognosis regardless of the reason for ibrutinib cessation.","['Iskierka-Jazdzewska, Elzbieta', 'Pula, Bartosz', 'Szeremet, Agnieszka', 'Hus, Marek', 'Golos, Aleksandra', 'Holojda, Jadwiga', 'Piszczek, Weronika', 'Steckiewicz, Pawel', 'Wojciechowska, Malgorzata', 'Zaucha, Jan Maciej', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Jamroziak, Krzysztof']","['Iskierka-Jazdzewska E', 'Pula B', 'Szeremet A', 'Hus M', 'Golos A', 'Holojda J', 'Piszczek W', 'Steckiewicz P', 'Wojciechowska M', 'Zaucha JM', 'Warzocha K', 'Jamroziak K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Neoplasms and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, Poland.', 'Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Medical University of Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Specialist District Hospital, Legnica, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Copernicus Hospital, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holycross Cancer Center, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Specialist District Hospital, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Oncological Propaedeutics, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland.', 'Gdynia Oncology Center, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warszawa, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', '*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', '*Compassionate Use Trials', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Poland', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/10/31 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/99911 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2019 Aug;28(8):1051-1057. doi: 10.17219/acem/99911.,8,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on apoptosis and autophagy 12-24 h after the start of treatment have not been conducted until now. OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic significance of autophagy and apoptosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 38 patients. Blood was collected before and 12-24 h after the start of treatment, since at that time point, the appropriate blast cell count was still available. Autophagy was measured with the expression of the ATG5, MAP1L3, LC3-I, and LC3-II proteins. The percentage of mononuclear cells in early and late apoptosis was evaluated with flow cytometry, using the annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) binding assay. RESULTS: The percentage of apoptotic blast cells before treatment was not associated with the response. However, in the remission group, the overall percentage of apoptotic cells measured 12-24 h after the start of treatment was higher than in non-remission patients, which was statistically significant. In neither group we found any difference in the level of autophagy before and 12-24 h after the start of treatment. Nevertheless, we observed an increasing tendency of the MAP1LC3 protein expression (not statistically significant) in the remission group 12-24 h after the start of treatment. Patients with a higher percentage of blast cells in apoptosis and with a higher expression of MAP1LC3 protein measured 12-24 h after the start of the therapy had longer overall survival (OS). CONCLUSIONS: A higher percentage of apoptotic as well as autophagic blast cells measured 12-24 h after the start of the chemotherapy is an independent factor associated with better outcomes.","['Deren-Wagemann, Izabela Elzbieta', 'Kuliczkowski, Kazimierz']","['Deren-Wagemann IE', 'Kuliczkowski K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Blood Cancers and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital No. 1, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Blood Cancers and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital No. 1, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Adv Clin Exp Med,Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University,101138582,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAP1LC3A protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', '*Blast Crisis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/08/31 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.17219/acem/93849 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Clin Exp Med. 2019 Jul;28(7):861-869. doi: 10.17219/acem/93849.,7,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy']",,,,,,,,,,,

Insertional mutagenesis (IM) in mice is a robust strategy for generating malignancies that recapitulate the extensive inter- and intra-tumoral genetic heterogeneity found in advanced human cancers. While the central role of ""driver"" viral insertions in IM models that aberrantly increase the expression of proto-oncogenes or disrupt tumor suppressors has been appreciated for many years, the contributions of cooperating somatic mutations and large chromosomal alterations to tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Integrated genomic studies of T lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) generated by IM in wild-type (WT) and Kras mutant mice reveal frequent point mutations and other recurrent non-insertional genetic alterations that also occur in human T-ALL. These somatic mutations are sensitive and specific markers for defining clonal dynamics and identifying candidate resistance mechanisms in leukemias that relapse after an initial therapeutic response. Primary cancers initiated by IM and resistant clones that emerge during in vivo treatment close key gaps in existing preclinical models, and are robust platforms for investigating the efficacy of new therapies and for elucidating how drug exposure shapes tumor evolution and patterns of resistance.","['Huang, Benjamin J', 'Wandler, Anica M', 'Meyer, Lauren K', 'Dail, Monique', 'Daemen, Anneleen', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Li, Qing', 'Wang, Xinyue', 'Wong, Jasmine C', 'Nakitandwe, Joy', 'Downing, James R', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Shannon, Kevin']","['Huang BJ', 'Wandler AM', 'Meyer LK', 'Dail M', 'Daemen A', 'Sampath D', 'Li Q', 'Wang X', 'Wong JC', 'Nakitandwe J', 'Downing JR', 'Zhang J', 'Taylor BS', 'Shannon K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6996-0833', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2404-3318', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2687-8829', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6287-7105', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9187-5472', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2564-8095', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3350-9682', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4299-1773']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Oncology Biomarker Development, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Bioinformatics & Computational Biology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Translational Oncology, Genentech, South San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, United States of America."", 'Marie-Josee and Henry R.

Here, we analyzed Polycomb group protein (PcG) complex integrity in response to heat shock (HS). Upon HS, various Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 and PRC2 subunits, including CBX proteins, but also other chromatin regulators, are found to accumulate in the nucleolus. In parallel, binding of PRC1/2 to target genes is strongly reduced, coinciding with a dramatic loss of H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 marks. Nucleolar-accumulated CBX proteins are immobile, but remarkably both CBX protein accumulation and loss of PRC1/2 epigenetic marks are reversible. This post-heat shock recovery of pan-nuclear CBX protein localization and reinstallation of epigenetic marks is HSP70 dependent. Our findings demonstrate that the nucleolus is an essential protein quality control center, which is indispensable for recovery of epigenetic regulators and maintenance of the epigenome after heat shock.","['Azkanaz, Maria', 'Rodriguez Lopez, Aida', 'de Boer, Bauke', 'Huiting, Wouter', 'Angrand, Pierre-Olivier', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Kampinga, Harm H', 'Bergink, Steven', 'Martens, Joost Ha', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'van den Boom, Vincent']","['Azkanaz M', 'Rodriguez Lopez A', 'de Boer B', 'Huiting W', 'Angrand PO', 'Vellenga E', 'Kampinga HH', 'Bergink S', 'Martens JH', 'Schuringa JJ', 'van den Boom V']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8452-8555', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1992-9608']","['Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Cell Plasticity & Cancer, Inserm U908, University of Lille, Lille, France.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences of Cells and Systems, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science and Medicine, Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Hematology, Cancer Research Center Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190614,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/*metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', '*Heat-Shock Response', 'Humans', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*metabolism']",PMC6570483,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7554/eLife.45205 [doi]', '45205 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Jun 14;8. pii: 45205. doi: 10.7554/eLife.45205.,,['RUG 2014-6832/KWF Kankerbestrijding/International'],,,"['(c) 2019, Azkanaz et al.']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Polycomb', '*biochemistry', '*chemical biology', '*chromosomes', '*epigenetics', '*gene expression', '*heat shock', '*human', '*leukemia', '*nucleolus', '*protein quality control']","['MA, AR, Bd, WH, PA, EV, HK, SB, JM, JS, Vv No competing interests declared']",,,['GEO/GSE121182'],,,,,,,

Most pediatric leukaemias and solid tumours of mesenchymal origin are characterized by a relatively low mutation burden at the single nucleotide level and the presence of recurrent chromosomal translocations. The genomic fusion sites resulting from translocations are stable molecular tumour markers; however, repeat-rich DNA sequences flanking intronic breakpoints limit the design of high sensitivity PCR assays for minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring. Here, we quantitatively evaluated the impact of repeat elements on assay selection and the feasibility of using extended amplicons (</=1330 bp) amplified by droplet digital PCR to monitor pediatric chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Molecular characterization of 178 genomic BCR-ABL1 fusion sites showed that 64% were located within sequence repeat elements, impeding optimal primer/probe design. Comparative quantification of DNA and RNA BCR-ABL1 copy numbers in 687 specimens from 55 pediatric patients revealed that their levels were highly correlated. The combination of droplet digital PCR, double quenched probes and extended amplicons represents a valuable tool for sensitive MRD assessment in CML and may be adapted to other translocation-positive tumours.","['Krumbholz, Manuela', 'Goerlitz, Katharina', 'Albert, Christian', 'Lawlor, Jennifer', 'Suttorp, Meinolf', 'Metzler, Markus']","['Krumbholz M', 'Goerlitz K', 'Albert C', 'Lawlor J', 'Suttorp M', 'Metzler M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4416-0394', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4523-1676']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Department of Biology, Division of Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Medical Faculty, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Technical University, Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190614,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/blood/genetics/metabolism', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6653534,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jcmm.14321 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2019 Aug;23(8):4955-4961. doi: 10.1111/jcmm.14321.

Functionalized CQDs were prepared and then linked to the recombinant gp85 protein. A total of 36 chickens were divided into 3 groups, namely, 2 experimental groups and 1 control group. Chickens from the experimental groups were inoculated twice intramuscularly with purified recombinant gp85 protein with CQDs as adjuvant or Freund's adjuvant emulsion at 14 and 21 D, whereas those from the control group were inoculated with an equivalent volume of PBS. At 35 D, the chickens were challenged with a 102.4 50% tissue culture infective dose of ALV-J. Blood samples were collected from each chicken at weekly intervals for serum antibody and viremia analyses. Results indicated that immunization with gp85-CQDs or gp85-Freund's adjuvant induced the inoculated chickens to produce positive serum antibodies (sample-to-positive ratio >0.6) at the 3rd week and persisted over 9 wk. Antibody levels in the gp85-CQDs group were higher than those in the gp85-Freund's adjuvant group. Differences were significant at 21 D (P < 0.05) and extremely significant from 28 D to 70 D (P < 0.01). Additionally, results of viremia showed higher protection in the gp85-CQDs group than in the Freund's adjuvant group. These findings highlighted the potential of CQDs as excellent candidate nanovehicles for vaccine delivery.","['Cheng, Jia', 'Xu, Yuliang', 'Zhou, Dong', 'Liu, Kangping', 'Geng, Na', 'Lu, Jianwei', 'Liu, Yongxia', 'Liu, Jianzhu']","['Cheng J', 'Xu Y', 'Zhou D', 'Liu K', 'Geng N', 'Lu J', 'Liu Y', 'Liu J']",,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100193, PR China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai`an 271018, PR China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University, Yangling 712100, China.', 'Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai`an 271018, PR China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai`an 271018, PR China.', 'Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai`an 271018, PR China.', 'Research Center for Animal Disease Control Engineering Shandong Province, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai`an 271018, PR China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai`an 271018, PR China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (glycoprotein 85, avian leukosis virus)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)""]",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Avian Leukosis/*prevention & control', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*immunology', 'Carbon', '*Chickens', ""Freund's Adjuvant/administration & dosage"", 'Male', 'Poultry Diseases/prevention & control', 'Quantum Dots/*administration & dosage', 'Random Allocation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology', 'Viral Vaccines/*immunology']",,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/01/09 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0032-5791(19)45733-7 [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pez313 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2019 Nov 1;98(11):5315-5320. doi: 10.3382/ps/pez313.,11,,,,['(c) 2019 Poultry Science Association Inc.'],['NOTNLM'],"['ALV-J', 'carbon quantum dots', 'chicken', 'gp85 protein', 'vaccine']",,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the role of cyclophosphamide in vasculitis treatment has been assessed and compared to rituximab. Paraneoplastic AAV seems to be an uncommon presentation of hemopathies. Hematologic malignancy risk in AAV is more likely to be increased by cyclophosphamide, although not yet definitely proven. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis has been reviewed with particular emphasis on the role of proteinase 3 (PR3) in fuelling granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) inflammation. PR3 is a bactericidal protein expressed by neutrophilic granules and on their plasma membrane. Derangements in its expression and function have been linked to leukemias and GPA alike. PR3-derived PR1 peptide is being studied as an immunotherapy target in leukemia and multiple myeloma. This study is aimed at bringing together various evidences from the field of immunological and hematological research, at exposing contradictions, and at revealing novel insights on the association between ANCA-associated vasculitis and hematologic malignancies.","['Folci, Marco', 'Ramponi, Giacomo', 'Shiffer, Dana', 'Zumbo, Aurora', 'Agosti, Michele', 'Brunetta, Enrico']","['Folci M', 'Ramponi G', 'Shiffer D', 'Zumbo A', 'Agosti M', 'Brunetta E']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5618-2876', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0676-1228']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.', 'University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Rheumatology Unit, ASST Fatebenefratelli Sacco, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Humanitas University, Milan, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine, Humanitas Research Hospital, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190506,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (Peptides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",IM,"['Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/metabolism', 'Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloblastin/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use']",PMC6526571,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/12/20 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1732175 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2019 May 6;2019:1732175. doi: 10.1155/2019/1732175. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Th17 cells are CD4+ cell subtype. They produce IL-17A and IL-17F. AIM: This study aims to trace the relation between IL-17A and IL-17F polymorphisms and AML incidence and to define the connection between IL-17 polymorphisms and its serum level. METHODS: A group of 100 acute myeloid leukaemia patients and 100 age and sex-matched healthy subjects (controls) were enrolled in the present work. Restriction fragment length polymorphism- polymerase chain reaction (PCR-RFLP) was done to detect IL-17A (rs2275913; G197A) and IL-17F (rs763780; A7488G). Serum IL-17 level was assessed by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis (ELISA) in both patients and controls. RESULTS: IL-17F, IL-17A mutant genotypes and alleles showed no significant relation with acute myeloid leukaemia incidence. Also, ELISA results proved that serum IL-17 did not vary between acute myeloid leukaemia patients and healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: Interleukin-17 gene polymorphisms did not consider a risk for acute myeloid leukaemia.","['Elsissy, Maha', 'Abdelhafez, Ahmed', 'Elmasry, Manal', 'Salah, Doaa']","['Elsissy M', 'Abdelhafez A', 'Elmasry M', 'Salah D']",,"['Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190515,North Macedonia,Open Access Maced J Med Sci,Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences,101662294,,,,PMC6542383,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/06/15 06:01,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3889/oamjms.2019.306 [doi]', 'OAMJMS-7-1425 [pii]']",epublish,Open Access Maced J Med Sci. 2019 May 15;7(9):1425-1429. doi: 10.3889/oamjms.2019.306. eCollection 2019 May 15.,9,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aml', 'Egypt', 'Elisa', 'IL-17', 'RFLP']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, recently observed that FMOD plays very important roles in the modulation of a variety of pivotal biological processes including angiogenesis, regulation of TGF-beta activity, and differentiation of human fibroblasts into pluripotent cells, inflammatory mechanisms, apoptosis and metastatic related phenotypes. Besides these roles, FMOD has been considered as a new tumor-related antigen in some malignancies such as lymphoma, leukemia, and leiomyoma. Taken together, these findings proposed that FMOD could be introduced as diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers in treatment of various cancers.

Furowanin A (Fur A), one of the active ingredients of Millettia pachycarpa Benth, has been found to exert pro-apoptotic activity in human leukemia cells. This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Fur A against OS. The effect of Fur A on cell viability was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) were performed to determine the protein and mRNA level of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1), respectively. To validate the role of SphK1 in the pro-apoptotic activity of Fur A, overexpressing SphK1 vector and siRNA targeting SphK1 were utilized to transfect OS cells. Moreover, an OS xenograft murine model was used to analyze the therapeutic efficacy of Fur A in vivo. Fur A treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in the number of viable cells. It also exhibited antiproliferative activity and significantly promoted apoptotic cell death in OS cell lines. Our results showed that the anticancer activity of Fur A was associated with downregulation of SphK1 and inactivation of its downstream signaling. The mediatory role of SphK1 was validated when the pro-apoptotic activity of Fur A was significantly blocked by SphK1 overexpression, while SphK1 knockdown sensitized the OS cells to Fur A. We concluded that Fur A can exhibit anti-growth and pro-apoptotic activities in vitro and in vivo in OS by downregulating SphK1. Our study highlights the possibility of utilizing Fur A as a chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of OS. Anat Rec, 302:1941-1949, 2019.

However, currently practiced standard FC-MRD has limited sensitivity (up to 0.01%) and higher false MRD-negative rate. Hence, a highly sensitive, widely applicable, and easily reproducible FC-MRD assay is needed, which can provide a reliable basis for therapeutic modifications. METHODS: A 10-color high-event analysis FC-MRD assay was studied for the evaluation of MRD status at postinduction, (PI; day-35), postconsolidation, (PC; day-78), and subsequent follow-up time-points (SFU) in bone marrow samples from pediatric B-ALL. RESULTS: One-thousand MRD samples (PI-62.2%; PC-26.5%; and SFU-11.3%) from 622 childhood B-ALL patients were studied. High-event analysis was performed with median 4,452,000 events (range, 839,000 to 8,866,000 events) and >4 million events in 71% samples. MRD was measurable in 43.2% of PI-samples, in 29.4% PC-samples, and in 32.7% SFU-samples. To simulate comparison with standard FC-MRD, we reanalyzed MRD results gating only first 500,000 and first 1000,000 events in 122 PI-MRD positive samples with MRD levels <0.02%. Of these samples gated for 500,000 events and 1000,000 events, 32% and 21.3% were found to be falsely MRD-negative, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We report an easily reproducible high-sensitivity 10-color FC-MRD assay with the sensitivity of 2-in-10(6) (0.0002%). It allowed the detection of low-level MRD in samples, which could have been reported negative using the standard FC-MRD with limited event analysis. Thus, this high-sensitivity MRD-methodology can provide a reliable basis for therapeutic modifications in B-ALL.

They can exploit signaling pathways which are critical for HSC development to support their own survival, homing, and maintenance. These interactions of leukemic cells with the microenvironment have an impact on therapy progress and patient outcome. Therefore, signals for homing and anchorage of leukemic cells to the bone marrow have to be investigated by using tools that allow the migration of cells toward critical signals. Here, we describe an in vitro migration assay for leukemic cells toward a chemoattractant in a 3D environment exemplified by migration of the cell line OCI-AML3 to a CXC motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) gradient. For this purpose, a chemotaxis slide is filled with a hydrogel system mimicking the extracellular matrix in vivo. The cells are encapsulated into the hydrogel network during polymerization, and a CXCL12 gradient is introduced in the enclosed chambers to trigger migration. Cell migration in the 3D network of the hydrogel is monitored by time-lapse microscopy. We describe the experimental setup and the tools for cell tracking and data analysis.","['Zippel, Sabrina', 'Raic, Annamarija', 'Lee-Thedieck, Cornelia']","['Zippel S', 'Raic A', 'Lee-Thedieck C']",,"['Institute of Functional Interfaces, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Interfaces, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.', 'Institute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Functional Interfaces, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany. lee-thedieck@cell.uni-hannover.de.', 'Institute of Cell Biology and Biophysics, Leibniz University Hannover, Hannover, Germany. lee-thedieck@cell.uni-hannover.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Hydrogels)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Tracking', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Chemotaxis', 'Humans', 'Hydrogels/chemistry', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-9574-5_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;2017:97-107. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9574-5_8.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*3D matrix', '*CXCR4/CXCL12 axis', '*Chemokine gradient', '*Leukemic cells', '*Migration', '*mu-Slides']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study included 21 older patients [median age 65 (58-73) years] with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome who underwent single CBT following a conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine (FLU) 125-175 mg/m(2), busulfan (BU) 9.6 mg/kg, and cyclophosphamide (CY) 90 mg/kg. Twelve patients (57.1%) were considered high or very high risk according to the disease risk index. Nineteen achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 19 days (range 14-29 days) after CBT (cumulative incidence 90.5%). During a median observation period of 24.3 months, the overall survival (OS) rates at 100 days and 2 years were 76.2% and 47.6%, respectively, with cumulative 2-year relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates of 19.0% and 38.1%, respectively. Infectious disease was the leading cause of NRM (n = 5) and occurred within 100 day post-transplantation in two patients. This suggested that the administration of a reduced BU/CY plus FLU regimen to older patients receiving CBT enables an early recovery with high neutrophil engraftment, relapse suppression, and acceptable NRM rates.","['Ohta, Takanori', 'Sugio, Yasuhiro', 'Imanaga, Hiroshi', 'Oku, Seidou', 'Ohno, Yuju']","['Ohta T', 'Sugio Y', 'Imanaga H', 'Oku S', 'Ohno Y']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, 2-1 Bashyaku, Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyushu, 802-0077, Japan. t_oota01@kmmc.jp.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, 2-1 Bashyaku, Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyushu, 802-0077, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, 2-1 Bashyaku, Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyushu, 802-0077, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, 2-1 Bashyaku, Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyushu, 802-0077, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Kitakyushu Municipal Medical Center, 2-1 Bashyaku, Kokurakita-ku, Kitakyushu, 802-0077, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20190613,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Allografts', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/mortality/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02688-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02688-w [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Sep;110(3):347-354. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02688-w.

This study evaluates the obesity- and age-related changes in the expression of local RAS components. Since RAS affects skeletal muscle remodelling, we also evaluated the muscle fibre type composition, defined by myosin heavy chain (MyHC) mRNAs and protein content. Gene expressions were determined by qPCR and/or Western blot analysis in musculus quadriceps of 3- and 8-month-old male obese Zucker rats and their lean controls. The enzymatic activity of aminopeptidase A (APA) was determined flourometrically. Activation of renin receptor (ReR)/promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (PLZF) negative feedback mechanism was observed in obesity. The expression of angiotensinogen and AT1 was downregulated by obesity, while neutral endopeptidase and AT2 expressions were upregulated in obese rats with aging. Skeletal muscle APA activity was decreased by obesity, which negatively correlated with the increased plasma APA activity and plasma cholesterol. The expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) positively correlated with MyHC mRNAs characteristic for fast-twitch muscle fibres. The obesity- and age-related alterations in the expression of both classical and alternative RAS components suggest an onset of a new equilibrium between ACE/AngII/AT1 and ACE2/Ang1-7/Mas at lower level accompanied by increased renin/ReR/PLZF activation. Increased APA release from the skeletal muscle in obesity might contribute to increased plasma APA activity. There is a link between reduced ACE expression and altered muscle MyHC proportion in obesity and aging.","['Lory, Viktoria', 'Balazova, Lucia', 'Krskova, Katarina', 'Horvathova, Lubica', 'Olszanecki, Rafal', 'Suski, Maciej', 'Zorad, Stefan']","['Lory V', 'Balazova L', 'Krskova K', 'Horvathova L', 'Olszanecki R', 'Suski M', 'Zorad S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4214-3216'],"['Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava 4, Slovakia. viktoria.lory@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava 4, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava 4, Slovakia.', 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava 4, Slovakia.', 'Chair of Pharmacology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-531, Krakow, Poland.', 'Chair of Pharmacology, Jagiellonian University Medical College, 31-531, Krakow, Poland.', 'Institute of Experimental Endocrinology, Biomedical Research Center, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 845 05, Bratislava 4, Slovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190613,Spain,J Physiol Biochem,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,9812509,['EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Aging/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Male', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/*metabolism', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*metabolism', 'Obesity/*metabolism', 'Prediabetic State/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Zucker', '*Renin-Angiotensin System']",,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13105-019-00689-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s13105-019-00689-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Physiol Biochem. 2019 Aug;75(3):351-365. doi: 10.1007/s13105-019-00689-1.

Dose reductions are also being considered in clinical trials prior to treatment-free remission (TFR) attempts. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent retrospective analyses of large clinical trials show that dose modification/reduction is safe. Efficacy is generally maintained and side effects are improved. Clinical trials such as DESTINY have demonstrated that dose reduction is safe for patients in deep molecular remission and may be considered prior to a TFR attempt. Dose modifications are widely used to prevent and manage the toxicities of TKIs. With adequate monitoring, dose optimization is safe, reduces side effects, and improves quality-of-life for patients. Clinical trials of dose optimization are currently recruiting across all approved TKIs and will lead to further personalization of therapy for CP-CML patients in the future.","['Copland, M']",['Copland M'],,"[""Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Gartnavel General Hospital, University of Glasgow, Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, 1053 Great Western Road, Glasgow, G12 0YN, Scotland. mhairi.copland@glasgow.ac.uk.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6647386,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/07/25 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00524-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00524-w [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Aug;14(4):337-345. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00524-w.,4,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Dose optimization', '*Elderly', '*Toxicity', '*Treatment-free remission', '*Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous results indicated that a decrease in myocardial cells and an increase in apoptotic cells leads to heart defects under hyperglycemia, but much work remains to elucidate this important mechanism of myocardial cell apoptosis induced by high glucose (HG). In this study, we found that a decrease in GSK3beta phosphorylation on Ser9 occurred concomitantly with HG-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and in the heart tissues of the offspring of diabetic rats in vitro and in vivo. Decreases in GSK3beta (Ser9) phosphorylation in response to HG were remarkably restored after treatment with SC79, an activator of the Akt signaling pathway. SB216763, an effective inhibitor of the GSK3beta signaling pathway, suppressed HG-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. Further studies showed a decrease in the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 was associated with GSK3beta-mediated apoptosis.

Recruitment and subsequent activation of IRAK4 upon TLR stimulation is mediated by the myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) adaptor protein. Around 3% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients have activating mutations of MYD88, a driver mutation in this disease. Here, we studied the effects of TLR activation and the pharmacological inhibition of IRAK4 with ND2158, an IRAK4 competitive inhibitor, as a therapeutic approach in CLL. Our in vitro studies demonstrated that ND2158 preferentially killed CLL cells in a dose-dependent manner. We further observed a decrease in NF-kappaB and STAT3 signaling, cytokine secretion, proliferation and migration of primary CLL cells from MYD88-mutated and -unmutated cases. In the Emicro-TCL1 adoptive transfer mouse model of CLL, ND2158 delayed tumor progression and modulated the activity of myeloid and T cells. Our findings show the importance of TLR signaling in CLL development and suggest IRAK4 as a therapeutic target for this disease.","['Gimenez, Neus', 'Schulz, Ralph', 'Higashi, Morihiro', 'Aymerich, Marta', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Delgado, Julio', 'Juan, Manel', 'Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Campo, Elias', 'Rosich, Laia', 'Seiffert, Martina', 'Colomer, Dolors']","['Gimenez N', 'Schulz R', 'Higashi M', 'Aymerich M', 'Villamor N', 'Delgado J', 'Juan M', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Campo E', 'Rosich L', 'Seiffert M', 'Colomer D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6538-4111', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3064-1648', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7486-8484']","[""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Anaxomics Biotech, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biosciences, Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Immunology, Hospital Clinic, HSJD-HCB Immunotherapy Platform, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain.', 'University Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. m.seiffert@dkfz.de.', ""Experimental Therapeutics in Lymphoid Malignancies Group, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer (IDIBAPS), CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain. dcolomer@clinic.cat."", 'Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, CIBERONC, Barcelona, Spain. dcolomer@clinic.cat.', 'University Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. dcolomer@clinic.cat.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190613,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (IRAK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism/pathology', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology', 'Toll-Like Receptors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC8075947,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2018/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0507-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0507-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):100-114. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0507-8.

The EuroClonality/BIOMED-2 assay is currently the gold standard for analyzing IG heavy chain (IGH) and kappa light chain (IGK) gene rearrangements of suspected B cell lymphomas. Here, the EuroClonality-NGS Working Group presents a multicentre technical feasibility study of a novel approach involving next-generation sequencing (NGS) of IGH and IGK loci rearrangements that is highly suitable for detecting IG gene rearrangements in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. By employing gene-specific primers for IGH and IGK amplifying smaller amplicon sizes in combination with deep sequencing technology, this NGS-based IG clonality analysis showed robust performance, even in DNA samples of suboptimal DNA integrity, and a high clinical sensitivity for the detection of clonal rearrangements. Bioinformatics analyses of the high-throughput sequencing data with ARResT/Interrogate, a platform developed within the EuroClonality-NGS Working Group, allowed accurate identification of clonotypes in both polyclonal cell populations and monoclonal lymphoproliferative disorders. This multicentre feasibility study is an important step towards implementation of NGS-based clonality assessment in clinical practice, which will eventually improve lymphoma diagnostics.","['Scheijen, Blanca', 'Meijers, Ruud W J', 'Rijntjes, Jos', 'van der Klift, Michele Y', 'Mobs, Markus', 'Steinhilber, Julia', 'Reigl, Tomas', 'van den Brand, Michiel', 'Kotrova, Michaela', 'Ritter, Julia-Marie', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Davi, Frederic', 'Darzentas, Nikos', 'Pott, Christiane', 'Fend, Falko', 'Hummel, Michael', 'Langerak, Anton W', 'Groenen, Patricia J T A']","['Scheijen B', 'Meijers RWJ', 'Rijntjes J', 'van der Klift MY', 'Mobs M', 'Steinhilber J', 'Reigl T', 'van den Brand M', 'Kotrova M', 'Ritter JM', 'Catherwood MA', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Bruggemann M', 'Davi F', 'Darzentas N', 'Pott C', 'Fend F', 'Hummel M', 'Langerak AW', 'Groenen PJTA']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1502-3032', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5394-1072']","['Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, 3015 CN, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, 3015 CN, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Pathology, D-10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital Tubingen, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Molecular Medicine Program, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, 62500, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Pathology, D-10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast BT9 7AB, UK.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, GR 57001 Thermi, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Pitie-Salpetriere and Sorbonne University, 75013, Paris, France.', 'Molecular Medicine Program, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, 62500, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, University Hospital Tubingen, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Institute of Pathology, D-10117, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Laboratory Medical Immunology, Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam, 3015 CN, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Radboud University Medical Center, 6525 GA, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.

ABO blood type compatibility has been reported to be associated with HSCT outcomes. However, few studies have investigated the role of ABO compatibility in haplo-identical HSCT of AML patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 42 adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who received unmanipulated haplo-identical peripheral blood HSCT at the Chinese PLA General Hospital between Jan 2013 and Dec 2017. We analyzed the role of ABO compatibility in engraftment, transfusion requirements, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), overall survival (OS), transplantation-related mortality (TRM), relapse, chronic GVHD, and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). RESULTS There were no significant differences between the ABO-matched group and the ABO-mismatched group in terms of engraftment, transfusion requirements, CMV and EBV viremia, OS, TRM, relapse, PTLD, and chronic GVHD. Univariate analysis revealed ABO incompatibility is not an independent risk factor of engraftment, transfusion requirements, CMV and EBV viremia, OS, TRM, relapse, PTLD, and chronic GVHD. We found a significantly higher cumulative incidence of aGVHD in the matched group compared with the mismatched group (80.95% vs. 42.86%, p=0.020). In multivariate analysis, ABO mismatch was associated with decreased risk of acute GVHD within 100 days after transplant (hazard ratio 0.492, 95% confidence interval 0.2123-1.14). However, the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.099). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrated ABO incompatibility is not an independent risk factor of outcomes for AML patients who received unmanipulated haplo-identical peripheral blood HSCT. ABO compatibility might have limited value in haplo-identical donor selection.","['Yang, Nan', 'Guan, Lixun', 'Liu, Zhanxiang', 'Ding, Yi', 'Zhu, Chengying', 'Luo, Lan', 'Wang, Feiyan', 'Fang, Shu', 'Gao, Zhe', 'Gu, Zhenyang', 'Gao, Chunji']","['Yang N', 'Guan L', 'Liu Z', 'Ding Y', 'Zhu C', 'Luo L', 'Wang F', 'Fang S', 'Gao Z', 'Gu Z', 'Gao C']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland)."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190614,United States,Ann Transplant,Annals of transplantation,9802544,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,"['*ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6589049,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/01/17 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['916004 [pii]', '10.12659/AOT.916004 [doi]']",epublish,Ann Transplant. 2019 Jun 14;24:350-358. doi: 10.12659/AOT.916004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the clinical characteristics and outcomes of a large series of biopsy-confirmed Richter transformation (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or high grade B-cell lymphoma, n=204) cases diagnosed from 1993 to 2018. After a median follow up of 67.0 months, the median overall survival (OS) was 12.0 months. Patients who received no prior treatment for CLL had significantly better OS (median 46.3 vs. 7.8 months; P<0.001). Patients with elevated lactate dehydrogenase (median 6.2 vs. 39.9 months; P<0.0001) or TP53 disruption (median 8.3 vs. 12.8 months; P=0.046) had worse OS than those without. Immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene mutation, cell of origin, Myc/Bcl-2 double expression and MYC/BCL2/BCL6 double-/triple-hit status were not associated with OS. In multivariable Cox regression, elevated lactate dehydrogenase [Hazard ratio (HR) 2.3, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.3-4.1; P=0.01], prior CLL treatment (HR 2.0, 95%CI: 1.2-3.5; P=0.01), and older age (HR 1.03, 95%CI: 1.01-1.05; P=0.01) were associated with worse OS. Twenty-four (12%) patients underwent stem cell transplant (20 autologous and 4 allogeneic), and had a median post-transplant survival of 55.4 months. In conclusion, the overall outcome of Richter transformation is poor. Richter transformation developed in patients with untreated CLL has significantly better survival.

We examined these associations in the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort. METHODS: Among 109,030 cancer-free participants (mean age 69.2, SD 6.1 years) in 1999, 409 were identified as having been diagnosed with a MN [n = 155 acute myeloid leukemia (AML), n = 154 myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), n = 100 other ML] through June 2013. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of MVPA (MET-h/wk) and sitting (h/d) with risk of all MN, myeloid leukemia only, MDS, and AML. RESULTS: Compared with insufficient MVPA [>0-<7.5 metabolic equivalent hours/week (MET)-h/wk], the HR (95% CI) for meeting physical activity guidelines (7.5-<15 MET-h/wk MVPA) and risk of MN was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.56-0.98) and for doubling guidelines (15-<22.5 MET-h/wk) was 0.75 (0.53-1.07); however, there was no statistically significant association for higher MVPA (22.5+ MET-h/wk, HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.73-1.20). Similarly, meeting/doubling guidelines was associated with lower risk of MDS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35-0.92/HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.27-0.98), but there was no association for 22.5+ MET-h/wk (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.63-1.37). MVPA was not associated with risk of myeloid leukemia or AML. Sitting time was not associated with risk of any outcome. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there may be a nonlinear association between MVPA and risk of MDS and possibly other MN. IMPACT: Further studies are needed to better understand the dose-response relationships between MVPA and risk of MDS, a highly fatal and understudied cancer.","['Rees-Punia, Erika', 'Patel, Alpa V', 'Fallon, Elizabeth A', 'Gapstur, Susan M', 'Teras, Lauren R']","['Rees-Punia E', 'Patel AV', 'Fallon EA', 'Gapstur SM', 'Teras LR']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9083-6682', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2419-8536']","['Behavioral and Epidemiology Research Group, American Cancer Society, 250 Williams St., Atlanta, Georgia.

We conducted an integrated safety analysis of single-agent ibrutinib from randomized phase 3 studies PCYC-1112 (RESONATE, n = 195) and PCYC-1115/1116 (RESONATE-2, n = 135), and examined longer-term safety separately in the phase 1b/2 PCYC-1102/1103 study (n = 94, 420 mg/d). In the integrated analysis (ibrutinib treatment up to 43 months), the most common adverse events (AEs) were primarily grade 1/2; diarrhea (n = 173, 52% any-grade; n = 15, 5% grade 3) and fatigue (n = 119, 36% any-grade; n = 10, 3% grade 3). The most common grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (n = 60, 18%) and pneumonia (n = 38, 12%). Over time, prevalence of AEs of interest (diarrhea, fatigue, grade >/=3 infection, bleeding, and neutropenia) trended down; prevalence of hypertension increased, but incidence decreased after year 1. AEs led to dose reductions in 42 (13%) patients and permanent discontinuations in 37 (11%); dose modifications due to AEs were most common during year 1 and decreased in frequency thereafter. The most common AEs (preferred term) contributing to discontinuation included pneumonia (n = 4), anemia (n = 3), and atrial fibrillation (n = 3). With long-term follow-up on PCYC-1102/1103 (ibrutinib treatment up to 67 months), grade 3/4 AEs were generally similar to those in the integrated analysis. Overall, AEs were primarily grade 1/2 and manageable during prolonged ibrutinib treatment in patients with CLL.

In-hospital outcomes of CHM patients presenting with STEMI are unclear. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample data files from 2003 to 2014 were used to extract adult patients who presented with a primary diagnosis of STEMI. Patients who had a diagnosis of CHM defined as chronic myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, chronic monocytic leukemia, and multiple myeloma were identified. The primary study outcome measure was in-hospital mortality. Inverse probability weighting-adjusted binary logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of in-hospital mortality. Of 2,715,807 STEMI patients included in the final analyses, 11,974 (0.4%) patients had a diagnosis of CHM. Patients with CHM were significantly older, had a higher prevalence of co-morbidities, and had a significantly higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality (14.9% vs 9.0%; p <0.001). After adjusting for co-morbidities, CHM did not independently predict a higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio=1.02, 95% confidence interval=0.96 to 1.09; p=0.461). In patients with CHM who presented with STEMI, percutaneous coronary intervention was found to be associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality (odds ratio=0.22, 95% confidence interval=0.18 to 0.27; p <0.001) (c-statistic=0.81). In conclusion, CHM patients presenting with STEMI should be treated with similar treatment strategies as those without CHM, including revascularization if indicated, as there appears to be a sizable outcome advantage with this approach.","['Patel, Gaurav', 'Pancholy, Neha', 'Thomas, Lisa', 'Rai, Anvit', 'Kher, Akhil', 'Peters, Christopher', 'Amin, Amit', 'Patel, Tejas M', 'Pancholy, Samir']","['Patel G', 'Pancholy N', 'Thomas L', 'Rai A', 'Kher A', 'Peters C', 'Amin A', 'Patel TM', 'Pancholy S']",,"['The Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education, Scranton, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, Pennsylvania.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, Ohio.', 'Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine, Scranton, Pennsylvania.', 'Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Apex Heart Institute, Ahmedabad, India.', 'The Wright Center for Graduate Medical Education, Scranton, Pennsylvania.

This study aimed to investigate at a molecular level a general mechanism underlying DFX beneficial effects on haematopoiesis, both in healthy and pathological conditions. METHODS: Human healthy haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HS/PCs) and three leukemia cell lines were treated with DFX. N-Acetyl cysteine (NAC) and fludarabine were added as antioxidant and STAT1 inhibitor, respectively. In vitro colony-forming assays were assessed both in healthy and in leukemia cells. Intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as mitochondrial content were assessed by cytofluorimetric and confocal microscopy analysis; mtDNA was assessed by qRT-PCR. Differentiation markers were monitored by cytofluorimetric analysis. Gene expression analysis (GEA) was performed on healthy HS/PCs, and differently expressed genes were validated in healthy and leukemia cells by qRT-PCR. STAT1 expression and phosphorylation were assessed by Western blotting. Data were compared by an unpaired Student t test or one-way ANOVA. RESULTS: DFX, at clinically relevant concentrations, increased the clonogenic capacity of healthy human CD34(+) HS/PCs to form erythroid colonies. Extension of this analysis to human-derived leukemia cell lines Kasumi-1, K562 and HL60 confirmed DFX capacity to upregulate the expression of specific markers of haematopoietic commitment. Notably, the abovementioned DFX-induced effects are all prevented by the antioxidant NAC and accompanied with overproduction of mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increase of mitochondrial content and mtDNA copy number. GEA unveiled upregulation of genes linked to interferon (IFN) signalling and tracked back to hyper-phosphorylation of STAT1. Treatment of leukemic cell lines with NAC prevented the DFX-mediated phosphorylation of STAT1 as well as the expression of the IFN-stimulated genes. However, STAT1 inhibition by fludarabine was not sufficient to affect differentiation processes in leukemic cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a significant involvement of redox signalling as a major regulator of multiple DFX-orchestrated events promoting differentiation in healthy and tumour cells. The understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying the haematological response by DFX would enable to predict patient's ability to respond to the drug, to extend treatment to other patients or to anticipate the treatment, regardless of the iron overload.","['Tataranni, Tiziana', 'Mazzoccoli, Carmela', 'Agriesti, Francesca', 'De Luca, Luciana', 'Laurenzana, Ilaria', 'Simeon, Vittorio', 'Ruggieri, Vitalba', 'Pacelli, Consiglia', 'Della Sala, Gerardo', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Capitanio, Nazzareno', 'Piccoli, Claudia']","['Tataranni T', 'Mazzoccoli C', 'Agriesti F', 'De Luca L', 'Laurenzana I', 'Simeon V', 'Ruggieri V', 'Pacelli C', 'Della Sala G', 'Musto P', 'Capitanio N', 'Piccoli C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9739-4680'],"['Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Department of Public, Clinical and Preventive Medicine, Medical Statistics Unit, University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Caserta, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy.', 'Hematology Department of Basilicata, IRCCS-CROB Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Pre-Clinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, PZ, Italy. claudia.piccoli@unifg.it.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy. claudia.piccoli@unifg.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190613,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Deferasirox/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/genetics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics']",PMC6567456,2019/06/15 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-019-1293-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-019-1293-y [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2019 Jun 13;10(1):171. doi: 10.1186/s13287-019-1293-y.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*DFX', '*Differentiation', '*Interferon signalling', '*ROS']",,,,,,,,,,,

Their repurposing in oncology is currently investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. However, the identification of a specific cancer type defined by a molecular signature to design targeted clinical trials with cardiac glycosides remains to be characterized. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac glycoside proscillaridin A specifically targets MYC overexpressing leukemia cells and leukemia stem cells by causing MYC degradation, epigenetic reprogramming and leukemia differentiation through loss of lysine acetylation. METHODS: Proscillaridin A anticancer activity was investigated against a panel of human leukemia and solid tumor cell lines with different MYC expression levels, overexpression in vitro systems and leukemia stem cells. RNA-sequencing and differentiation studies were used to characterize transcriptional and phenotypic changes. Drug-induced epigenetic changes were studied by chromatin post-translational modification analysis, expression of chromatin regulators, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and mass-spectrometry. RESULTS: At a clinically relevant dose, proscillaridin A rapidly altered MYC protein half-life causing MYC degradation and growth inhibition. Transcriptomic profile of leukemic cells after treatment showed a downregulation of genes involved in MYC pathways, cell replication and an upregulation of hematopoietic differentiation genes. Functional studies confirmed cell cycle inhibition and the onset of leukemia differentiation even after drug removal. Proscillaridin A induced a significant loss of lysine acetylation in histone H3 (at lysine 9, 14, 18 and 27) and in non-histone proteins such as MYC itself, MYC target proteins, and a series of histone acetylation regulators. Global loss of acetylation correlated with the rapid downregulation of histone acetyltransferases. Importantly, proscillaridin A demonstrated anticancer activity against lymphoid and myeloid stem cell populations characterized by MYC overexpression. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results strongly support the repurposing of proscillaridin A in MYC overexpressing leukemia.","['Da Costa, Elodie M', 'Armaos, Gregory', 'McInnes, Gabrielle', 'Beaudry,

Here, we investigated the effect of hispidulin on the immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergic responses in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells. When RBL-2H3 cells were sensitized with anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) IgE and subsequently stimulated with DNP-human serum albumin (HSA), histamine and beta-hexosaminidase were released from the cells by degranulation of activated mast cells. However, pretreatment with hispidulin before the stimulation of DNP-HSA markedly attenuated release of both in anti-DNP IgE-sensitized cells. Furthermore, we investigated whether hispidulin inhibits anti-DNP IgE and DNP-HSA-induced passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), as an animal model for Type I allergies. Hispidulin markedly decreased the PCA reaction and allergic edema of ears in mice. In addition, activated RBL-2H3 cells induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-4), which are critical for the pathogenesis of allergic disease, through the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Inhibition of JNK activation by hispidulin treatment reduced the induction of cytokine expression in the activated mast cells. Our results indicate that hispidulin might be a possible therapeutic candidate for allergic inflammatory diseases through the suppression of degranulation and inflammatory cytokines expression.","['Kim, Dong Eun', 'Min, Kyoung-Jin', 'Kim, Min-Jong', 'Kim, Sang-Hyun', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Kim DE', 'Min KJ', 'Kim MJ', 'Kim SH', 'Kwon TK']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1224-4507', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1204-2059']","['Department of Otolaryngology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 42601, Korea. entkde@dsmc.or.kr.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 42601, Korea. kyoungjin.min@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pharmacology, CMRI, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41944, Korea. wowdamien@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Pharmacology, CMRI, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41944, Korea. shkim72@knu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 1095 Dalgubeoldaero, Dalseo-Gu, Daegu 42601, Korea. kwontk@dsmc.or.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190605,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'N7F61604C2 (hispidulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', '*Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Flavones/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Hypersensitivity/complications/*drug therapy', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'Inflammation/complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects']",PMC6600596,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24112131 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24112131 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Jun 5;24(11). pii: molecules24112131. doi: 10.3390/molecules24112131.,11,"['2014R1A5A2010008/National Research Foundation of Korea', 'NRF-2017R1D1A1B03028366/National Research Foundation of Korea']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Hispidulin', 'allergy', 'inflammation', 'mast cells']",,,,,,,,,,,

We used three variants of L1210 cells: i) parental cells (S) negative for P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression; ii) P-glycoprotein positive cells (R), obtained by selection with vincristine; iii) P-glycoprotein positive cells (T), obtained by stable transfection with a human gene encoding P-glycoprotein. We identified the most effective derivative 11 with a median lethal concentration of approximately 13 muM in all three L1210 cell variants. The analysis of the apoptosis/necrosis induced by derivative 11 revealed that cell death was the result of apoptosis with late apoptosis characteristics. Derivative 11 did not induce a strong alteration in the proportion of cells in the G1, S or G2/M phase of the cell cycle, but a strong increase in the number of S, R and T cells in the subG1 phase was detected. These findings indicated that we identified the most effective inducer of cell death, derivative 11, and this derivative effectively induced cell death in S, R and T cells at similar inhibitory concentrations independent of P-gp expression.","['Kubickova, Jana', 'Elefantova, Katarina', 'Pavlikova, Lucia', 'Cagala, Martin', 'Seres, Mario', 'Safar, Peter', 'Marchalin, Stefan', 'Durisova, Kamila', 'Bohacova, Viera', 'Sulova, Zdena', 'Lakatos, Boris', 'Breier, Albert', 'Olejnikova, Petra']","['Kubickova J', 'Elefantova K', 'Pavlikova L', 'Cagala M', 'Seres M', 'Safar P', 'Marchalin S', 'Durisova K', 'Bohacova V', 'Sulova Z', 'Lakatos B', 'Breier A', 'Olejnikova P']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0107-9999', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2174-786X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9110-5526']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. jana.kubickova@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. katarina.elefantova@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia. lucia.pavlikova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia. martin.cagala@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia. mario.seres@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Organic chemistry, Faculty of Food and Chemical Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. peter.safar@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Organic chemistry, Faculty of Food and Chemical Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. stefan.marchalin@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. kamila.durisova@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia. viera.bohacova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Centre of Bioscience, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska Cesta 9, 840 05 Bratislava, Slovakia. zdena.sulova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. boris.lakatos@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. albert.breier@stuba.sk.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Faculty of Chemical and Food Technology, Slovak University of Technology in Bratislava, Radlinskeho 9, 812 37 Bratislava, Slovakia. petra.olejnikova@stuba.sk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190605,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Quinolizines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (phenanthroquinolizidine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Phenanthrolines/*analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Quinolizines/*analysis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6600356,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24112127 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24112127 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Jun 5;24(11). pii: molecules24112127. doi: 10.3390/molecules24112127.,11,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['L1210 cells', 'P-glycoprotein', 'apoptosis', 'multidrug resistance', 'phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, a sizable portion of patients treated with CD19-CAR T cells relapse with CD19-negative cancer cells, necessitating the quest for back-up antigens. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) expression has been reported on leukemic blasts bearing the ill-fated MLL 11q23 rearrangement. We aimed at exploring the use of CSPG4-specific CAR T cells against mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged leukemic blasts, using the precursor B cell leukemia cell line KOPN8 (MLL-MLLT1 translocation) as a model. First, we confirmed CSPG4 expression on KOPN8 cells. Bulk T cells electroporated with mRNA encoding a CSPG4-specific CAR upregulated activation markers and secreted the Th1 cytokines TNF and IFNgamma in an antigen-specific manner upon co-culture with KOPN8 cells. More importantly, CSPG4-specific CAR T cells evinced specific degranulation towards KOPN8 cells and specifically lysed KOPN8 target cells in chromium lysis experiments. CSPG4 is a well-established CAR target in cutaneous melanoma. Here, we provide proof-of-principle data for the use of CSPG4-specific CAR T cells against MLL-translocated leukemias.","['Harrer, Dennis C', 'Schuler, Gerold', 'Dorrie, Jan', 'Schaft, Niels']","['Harrer DC', 'Schuler G', 'Dorrie J', 'Schaft N']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5031-7562', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8236-9298']","['Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany. dennis.harrer@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany. gerold.schuler@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany. jan.doerrie@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Department of Dermatology, Universtitatsklinikum Erlangen, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Hartmannstrasse 14, 91052 Erlangen, Germany. niels.schaft@uk-erlangen.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190605,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)']",IM,"['Antigens/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology/*therapy', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Th1 Cells/immunology']",PMC6600602,2019/06/15 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/06/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20112764 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20112764 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 5;20(11). pii: ijms20112764. doi: 10.3390/ijms20112764.,11,['SCHA 1247/3-1/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAR T cells', 'CSPG4', 'MLL-translocated leukemias', 'back-up target antigen', 'high-risk childhood B cell precursor leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

IL-22 mediates recovery of TECs via a proregenerative effect, but the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. In this study, we found IL-22 improved thymus recovery after damage from irradiation in association with increased number of TECs. This effect was blocked by ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. IL-22 increased the number of TECs via a Stat3-dependent signaling in the mTEC1 murine thymic epithelial cell line. This, in turn, upregulated transcription of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (Mcl1), resulting in increased number of TECs. Similar effects were seen in irradiated mice given IL-22. Defects in IL-22 resulted in delayed thymus recovery in irradiated mice and had an impact on levels of thymus function-related genes such as Foxn1, Aire, and Kgf. In mice, post-transplant use of IL-22 improved repair of TECs, increased the numbers of thymus T cells, increased the intrathymic levels of Aire, and increased the proportion of natural regulatory T cells, resulting in decreased severity of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Our data highlight the critical role of the IL-22/Stat3/Mcl-1 pathway in the regeneration of TECs after damage from irradiation in mice and highlight circumstances where normalizing thymus T cell function with IL-22 decreases GVHD after allotransplants.","['Pan, Bin', 'Wang, Dong', 'Li, Lingling', 'Shang, Longmei', 'Xia, Fan', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Xu, Mengdi', 'Li, Zhenyu', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Pan B', 'Wang D', 'Li L', 'Shang L', 'Xia F', 'Zhang F', 'Zhang Y', 'Gale RP', 'Xu M', 'Li Z', 'Xu K']",,"['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Centre for Haematology Research, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China; Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.

Although many individuals with acute leukemia experience bone pain, lumbosacral pain as an early feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is rare. PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report a case of an adult who presented with a 7-month history of persistent lumbosacral pain which had become more severe during the previous month. DIAGNOSES: Prior to referral, his full blood count revealed no abnormalities, and a computerized tomography scan revealed mild bone hyperplasia of his lumbar vertebrae, with disc herniations of L3-S1. His blood biochemistry and urinary test results had been normal. After referral to our clinic, tests of the morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biology of his bone marrow led to a diagnosis of MLL-AF4 fusion positive B-cell ALL. INTERVENTIONS: Prior to his referral, he had been treated with painkillers by local doctors. The painkillers initially provided pain relief, but their effect wore off over time. After diagnosis, he was started on an adult ALL chemotherapy protocol. OUTCOMES: His symptoms resolved within a week of starting chemotherapy. At his most recent assessment, 10 months after diagnosis, he was on maintenance chemotherapy and in remission. LESSONS: This case illustrates that prolonged lumbosacral pain may be a symptom of a life-threatening condition, rather than only attributable to chronic inflammation or disk herniations. Therefore, clinicians need to pay attention to subtle differences in the clinical presentation of patients with lumbosacral pain.","['Li, Fanglin', 'Wang, Jinxia', 'Liu, Aifei', 'Xin, Liuyan', 'Zhong, Sisi', 'Hong, Yang', 'Chen, Yijian']","['Li F', 'Wang J', 'Liu A', 'Xin L', 'Zhong S', 'Hong Y', 'Chen Y']",,"['Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Blood Transfusion Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Gannan Medical University, Ganzhou, Jiangxi Province, PR China.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans', 'Intervertebral Disc Displacement/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Low Back Pain/*etiology', 'Lumbosacral Region/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6587475,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/27 06:00,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000015912 [doi]', '00005792-201906140-00022 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jun;98(24):e15912. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015912.,24,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though genetically heterogeneous, all AMLs are characterized by two interrelated features-blocked differentiation and high proliferative capacity. Despite significant progress in our understanding of the molecular and genetic basis of AML, the treatment of AMLs with chemotherapeutic regimens has remained largely unchanged in the past 30 years. In this review, we will consider the role of two cellular processes, metabolism and epigenetics, in the development and progression of AML and highlight the studies that suggest an interconnection of therapeutic importance between the two. Large-scale whole-exome sequencing of AML patients has revealed the presence of mutations, translocations or duplications in several epigenetic effectors such as DNMT3, MLL, ASXL1, and TET2, often times co-occuring with mutations in metabolic enzymes such as IDH1 and IDH2. These mutations often result in impaired enzymatic activity which leads to an altered epigenetic landscape through dysregulation of chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation. We will discuss the role of enzymes that are responsible for establishing these modifications, namely histone acetyl transferases (HAT), histone methyl transferases (HMT), demethylases (KDMs), and deacetylases (HDAC), and also highlight the merits and demerits of using inhibitors that target these enzymes. Furthermore, we will tie in the metabolic regulation of co-factors such as acetyl-CoA, SAM, and alpha-ketoglutarate that are utilized by these enzymes and examine the role of metabolic inhibitors as a treatment option for AML. In doing so, we hope to stimulate interest in this topic and help generate a rationale for the consideration of the combinatorial use of metabolic and epigenetic inhibitors for the treatment of AML.","['Dhall, Abhinav', 'Zee, Barry M', 'Yan, Fangxue', 'Blanco, M Andres']","['Dhall A', 'Zee BM', 'Yan F', 'Blanco MA']",,"[""Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."", ""Newborn Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States."", 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190522,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6540842,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:01,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00432 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 May 22;9:432. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00432. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML-acute myeloid leukaemia', 'HDACs', 'epigenetics (methylation/demethylation)', 'histone methlyation', 'metabolism']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we characterized the roles of ERp57 and alpha-integrins as CRT-interacting proteins that coordinately regulate CRT translocation from the ER to the surface during immunogenic cell death. Using T-lymphoblasts as a genetic cell model, we found that drug-induced surface CRT is dependent on ERp57, while drug-induced surface ERp57 is independent of CRT. Differential subcellular immunostaining assays revealed that ERp57(-/-) cells have minimal cytosolic CRT, indicating that ERp57 is indispensable for extra-ER accumulation of CRT. Stimulation of integrin activity, with either cell adhesion or molecular agonists, resulted in decreased drug-induced surface CRT and ERp57 levels. Similarly, surface CRT and ERp57 was reduced in cells expressing GFFKR, a conserved alpha-integrin cytosolic motif that binds CRT. Drug-induced surface ERp57 levels were consistently higher in CRT(-/-) cells, suggesting integrin inhibition of surface ERp57 is an indirect consequence of alpha-integrin binding to CRT within the CRT-ERp57 complex. Furthermore, beta1(-/-) cells with reduced expression of multiple alpha-integrins, exhibit enhanced levels of drug-induced surface CRT and ERp57. Our findings highlight the coordinate involvement of plasma membrane integrins as inhibitors, and ERp57 originating from the ER as promoters, of CRT translocation from the ER to the cell surface.","['Liu, Chi-Chao', 'Leclair, Pascal', 'Pedari, Foujan', 'Vieira, Heidi', 'Monajemi, Mahdis', 'Sly, Laura M', 'Reid, Gregor S', 'Lim, Chinten James']","['Liu CC', 'Leclair P', 'Pedari F', 'Vieira H', 'Monajemi M', 'Sly LM', 'Reid GS', 'Lim CJ']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', ""Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, BC Children's Hospital Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190528,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6546883,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:01,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00411 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 May 28;9:411. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00411. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ERp57', 'calreticulin', 'cell adhesion', 'immunogenic cell death', 'integrins', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,

This review highlights recent findings on metabolic deregulation in AML and summarizes their implications in leukemogenesis.","['Chapuis, Nicolas', 'Poulain, Laury', 'Birsen, Rudy', 'Tamburini, Jerome', 'Bouscary, Didier']","['Chapuis N', 'Poulain L', 'Birsen R', 'Tamburini J', 'Bouscary D']",,"['INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (LNCC), Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Paris, France."", 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (LNCC), Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (LNCC), Paris, France.', 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (LNCC), Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Paris, France."", 'INSERM U1016, Institut Cochin, Paris, France.', 'CNRS UMR8104, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Faculte de Medecine Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer (LNCC), Paris, France.', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopitaux Universitaires Paris Centre, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190522,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6540604,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:01,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00405 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 May 22;9:405. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00405. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'amino-acid', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'glycolysis', 'hematopoiesis', 'metabolism', 'oxidative phosphorylation', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,

Many elderly MDS patients do not tolerate intensive therapeutic regimens, and therefore have an unmet need for better tolerated therapies. Epigenetics is important in the pathogenesis of MDS/AML with DNA methylation, and histone acetylation the most widely studied modifications. Epigenetic therapeutic agents have targeted the reversible nature of these modifications with some clinical success. The aim of this study was to characterise the molecular consequences of treatment of MDS and AML cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) Romidepsin. Romidepsin as a single agent induced cell death with an increasing dose and time profile associated with increased acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and decreased HDAC activity. Gene expression profiling, qPCR, network and pathway analysis recognised that oxidation-reduction was involved in response to Romidepsin. ROS was implicated as being involved post-treatment with the involvement of TSPO and MPO. Genomic analysis uncoupled the differences in protein-DNA interactions and gene regulation. The spatial and temporal transcriptional differences associated with acetylated, mono- and tri-methylated H3K9, representative of two activation and a repression mark respectively, were identified. Bioinformatic analysis uncovered positional enrichment and transcriptional differences between these marks; a degree of overlap with increased/decreased gene expression that correlates to increased/decreased histone modification. Overall, this study has unveiled a number of underlying mechanisms of the HDACi Romidepsin that could identify potential drug combinations for use in the clinic.","['Clarke, Kathryn', 'Young, Christine', 'Liberante, Fabio', 'McMullin, Mary-Frances', 'Thompson, Alexander', 'Mills, Ken']","['Clarke K', 'Young C', 'Liberante F', 'McMullin MF', 'Thompson A', 'Mills K']",,"[""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", ""Current address: Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom."", ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", 'Current address: MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, United Kingdom.', ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", 'Current address: Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Wien, Austria.', ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", ""Centre for Medical Education, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Science, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom."", 'Current address: Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, Centre for Biomolecular Sciences, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', ""Blood Cancer Research Group, Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology (CCRCB), Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190528,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6544403,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:01,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26877 [doi]', '26877 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 May 28;10(37):3462-3471. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26877. eCollection 2019 May 28.,37,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HDAC inhibitor', 'epigenetic', 'myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)', 'transcriptional regulation']","['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no conflicts of interest in relation to', 'the work described in this manuscript.']",,,,,,,,,,

Downstream signaling typically activates STAT3 but also SHP2/Ras/MAPK pathways. Oncostatin M (OSM) is a unique cytokine in this family since the receptor (OSMR) activates a non-redundant signaling pathway by recruitment of the adapter Shc1. We have studied the functional relevance of Shc1 for OSM-induced bone resorption. Experimental Approach: Osteoblasts were stimulated with OSM and STAT3 and Shc1 activations were studied using real-time PCR and Western blots. The role of STAT3 and Shc1 for OSM-induced RANKL expression and osteoclast formation was studied by silencing their mRNA expressions. Effects of OSM were compared to those of the closely related cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Key Results: OSM, but not LIF, induced the mRNA and protein expression of Shc1 and activated phosphorylation of Shc1 in the osteoblasts. Silencing of Shc1 decreased OSM-induced activation of STAT3 and RANKL expression. Silencing of STAT3 had no effect on activation of Shc1, but prevented the OSM-mediated increase of RANKL expression. Silencing of either Shc1 or STAT3 in osteoblasts decreased formation of osteoclasts in OSM-stimulated co-cultures of osteoblasts and macrophages. In agreement with these observations, OSM was a more potent and robust stimulator than LIF of RANKL formation and bone resorption in mouse calvariae and osteoclast formation in bone marrow cultures. Conclusions and Implications: Activation of the Shc1-dependent STAT3 signaling is crucial for OSM-induced osteoclast formation. Inhibition of Shc1 is a potential mechanism to specifically inhibit OSM-induced bone resorption.","['Persson, Emma', 'Souza, Pedro P C', 'Floriano-Marcelino, Thais', 'Conaway, Howard Herschel', 'Henning, Petra', 'Lerner, Ulf H']","['Persson E', 'Souza PPC', 'Floriano-Marcelino T', 'Conaway HH', 'Henning P', 'Lerner UH']",,"['Department of Molecular Periodontology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Bone Biology Research Group, Department of Physiology and Pathology, School of Dentistry, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara, Brazil.', 'School of Dentistry, Federal University of Goias, Goiania, Brazil.', 'Bone Biology Research Group, Department of Physiology and Pathology, School of Dentistry, Sao Paulo State University (UNESP), Araraquara, Brazil.', 'Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, United States.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Centre for Bone and Arthritis Research, Institute for Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Molecular Periodontology, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Clinical Nutrition, Centre for Bone and Arthritis Research, Institute for Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190528,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RANK Ligand)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncostatin M/*pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RANK Ligand/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/genetics', 'Src Homology 2 Domain-Containing, Transforming Protein 1/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6547810,2019/06/14 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01164 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 May 28;10:1164. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01164. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*LIF', '*OSM', '*RANKL', '*Shc1', '*bone resorption', '*osteoclast']",,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of NLRP3 inflammasome is one of the major mechanisms in maturation and release of IL-1beta. Plectranthus amboinicus is a perennial herb. Several pharmacological activities of natural components and crude extracts from P. amboinicus have been reported including anti-inflammation; however, the underlying mechanism is not clear. Phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate-differentiated THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells were used as a reliable model in this study to examine the effect on inflammasome signaling pathway by PA-F4, an extract from Plectranthus amboinicus. PA-F4 inhibited ATP-induced release of caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18 from lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-primed cells. PA-F4 induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of both ASC dimerization and oligomerization in cells under LPS priming plus ATP stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation of NLRP3 and ASC demonstrated that PA-F4 significantly blunted the interaction between NLRP3 and ASC. Furthermore, PA-F4 completely abolished ATP-induced K(+) efflux reaction in LPS-primed cells. Taken together, PA-F4 displayed an inhibitory activity on NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Moreover, PA-F4 also inhibited LPS-induced p65 NF-kappaB activation, suggesting an inhibitory activity on LPS priming step. Further identification showed that rosmarinic acid, cirsimaritin, salvigenin, and carvacrol, four constituents in PA-F4, inhibited LPS-induced IL-6 release. In contrast, rosmarinic acid, cirsimaritin and carvacrol but not salvigenin inhibited ATP-induced caspase-1 release from LPS-primed cells. In conclusion, PA-F4 displayed an inhibitory activity on activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. PA-F4 inhibited LPS priming step through block of p65 NF-kappaB activation. It also inhibited ATP-induced signaling pathways in LPS-primed cells including the inhibition of both ASC dimerization and oligomerization, K(+) efflux reaction, and the release reaction of caspase-1, IL-1beta, and IL-18. Rosmarinic acid, cirsimaritin, salvigenin, and carvacrol could partly explain PA-F4-mediated inhibitory activity on blocking the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.","['Leu, Wohn-Jenn', 'Chen, Jui-Ching', 'Guh, Jih-Hwa']","['Leu WJ', 'Chen JC', 'Guh JH']",,"['School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Oneness Biotech Co., Ltd., Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Pharmacy, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190528,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6546882,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:01,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00573 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 May 28;10:573. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00573. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['NLRP3 inflammasome', 'Plectranthus amboinicus', 'carvacrol', 'cirsimaritin', 'rosmarinic acid']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to estimate the overall diagnostic accuracy of circulating miRNAs in haematological malignancies. Materials and Methods: Multiple databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library,) were searched until 19(th) August 2017. Results: The meta-analysis included 50 studies from 20 publications. The diagnostic accuracy was assessed by pooled specificity, sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and area under the curve area (AUC) by random effect model. We used QUADAS (Quality Assessment for diagnostic accuracy studies) to evaluate the quality of the included studies. To perform the meta-analysis, we used Meta-Disk 1.4, Revman 5.3 and Stata 12.0 software. High diagnostic accuracy was demonstrated, with a sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.85, a PLR of 5.28, an NLR of 0.22, a DOR of 30.39, and an AUC of 0.91.

But despite a low or high allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD, AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients belong to the favorable or intermediate risk, for whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation is not obligated. However, some latest studies pointing out that NPM1 and FLT3-ITD double mutation patients showed an inferior prognosis, which have raised concern about the risk categorization and more effective treatment of AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients. Methods: A total of 76 patients were selected for coexisting FLT3 and NPM1 mutations with normal cytogenetics. The prognostic risk factors were analyzed, and treatment strategies including allogeneic stem cell transplantati1on and chemotherapy were compared. Results: In 76 AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients, 36.8% of patients had hyperleukocytosis (HL) and DNMT3A R882 mutation was the most common concomitant gene (23.7%). For 53 patients in the complete remission (CR), 22 had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) on first complete remission (CR1). Patients in transplantation group had better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than chemotherapy only (P=0.002 and 0.001, respectively). In multivariable Cox model analyses, HL and DNMT3A R882 mutation were independent adverse prognostic factors (all P<0.05) for AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients. Nevertheless, allo-HSCT was an independent good factor of OS and DFS (P=0.001 and 0.000; HR =0.173 and 0.138; 95% CI were 0.062-0.483 and 0.049-0.389). And allo-HSCT could moderately improve the poor prognosis of AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+/DNMT3A R882+). Conclusion: Although, AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients are categorized as favorable or intermediate risk levels according to recent NCCN and ELN guidelines, these patients should receive allo-HSCT in CR1 for a longer survival. AML (FLT3-ITD+/NPM1+) patients with DNMT3A R882 mutation had a very poor prognosis, and allo-HSCT could moderately improve their survival.","['Huang, Yan', 'Hu, Juan', 'Lu, Ting', 'Luo, Yi', 'Shi,

However, the current understanding of the pathological process of CNSL is still limited. This study aimed to better understand the protein expression in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of ALL and discover valuable prognostic biomarkers. Materials and methods: CSF samples were obtained from ALL patients and healthy controls. Comparative proteomic profiling using label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was performed to detect differentially expressed proteins. Results: In the present study, 51 differentially expressed proteins were found. Among them, two core clusters including ten proteins (TIMP1, LGALS3BP, A2M, FN1, AHSG, HRG, ITIH4, CF I, C2, and C4a) might be crucial for tumorigenesis and progression of ALL and can be potentially valuable indicators of CNSL. Conclusion: These differentially expressed proteins of ALL children with central nervous system involvement and normal children may work as diagnostic and prognostic factors of ALL patients.","['Guo, Linghong', 'Ren, Honghong', 'Zeng, Hao', 'Gong, Yanqiu', 'Ma, Xuelei']","['Guo L', 'Ren H', 'Zeng H', 'Gong Y', 'Ma X']",,"[""Department of Biotherapy, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, People's Republic of China, drmaxuelei@gmail.com."", ""West China School of Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""West China School of Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""West China School of Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biotherapy, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu 610041, People's Republic of China, drmaxuelei@gmail.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190517,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,PMC6527054,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/06/14 06:01,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S193616 [doi]', 'ott-12-3859 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 May 17;12:3859-3868. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S193616. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'CSF', 'central nervous system leukemia', 'mass spectrometry', 'proteomics']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients enrolled on the phase 3 AML trial AAML1031 who were 2-18 years of age with English-speaking guardians were eligible. Instruments used were the PedsQL Generic Core Scales, Acute Cancer Module, and Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Assessments were obtained at the beginning of Induction 1 and following completion of cycles 2-4. Potential predictors of QoL included the total number of nonhematological grade 3-4 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) submissions. RESULTS: There were 505 eligible guardians who consented to participate and 348 of their children provided at least one self-report assessment. The number of submitted CTCAE toxicities was significantly associated with worse physical health summary scores (beta +/- standard error (SE) -3.00 +/- 0.69; P < 0.001) and general fatigue (beta +/- SE -2.50 +/- 0.66; P < 0.001). Older age was significantly associated with more fatigue (beta +/- SE -0.58 +/- 0.25; P = 0.022). Gender, white race, Hispanic ethnicity, private insurance status, risk status, bortezomib assignment, and duration of neutropenia were not significantly associated with QoL. DISCUSSION: The number of CTCAE toxicities was the primary factor influencing QoL among children with AML. Reducing toxicities should improve QoL; identifying approaches to ameliorate them should be a priority.","['Nagarajan, Rajaram', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Johnston, Donna L', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Kolb, Edward A', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Barakat, Lamia P', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Nagarajan R', 'Gerbing R', 'Alonzo T', 'Johnston DL', 'Aplenc R', 'Kolb EA', 'Meshinchi S', 'Barakat LP', 'Sung L']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0951-3091'],"[""Division of Oncology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio."", ""The Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", ""The Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, California."", 'Division of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Division of Oncology, AI Dupont, Wilmington, Delaware.', ""Division of Oncology, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190612,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bortezomib/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy/psychology', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/psychology', 'Male', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Self Report', 'Sorafenib/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",PMC6675729,2019/06/14 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2337 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Aug;8(9):4454-4464. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2337.

MicroRNA 155 (miR-155), one of the extensively studied multifunctional miRNAs, is important in several human malignancies such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Moreover, miR-155 orthologs KSHV-miR-K12-11 and MDV-miR-M4, encoded by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and Marek's disease virus (MDV), respectively, are also involved in oncogenesis. In MDV-induced T-cell lymphomas and in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from them, MDV-miR-M4 is highly expressed. Using excellent disease models of infection in natural avian hosts, we showed previously that MDV-miR-M4 is critical for the induction of T-cell lymphomas as mutant viruses with precise deletions were significantly compromised in their oncogenicity. However, those studies did not elucidate whether continued expression of MDV-miR-M4 is essential for maintaining the transformed phenotype of tumor cells. Here using an in situ CRISPR/Cas9 editing approach, we deleted MDV-miR-M4 from the MDV-induced lymphoma-derived lymphoblastoid cell line MDCC-HP8. Precise deletion of MDV-miR-M4 was confirmed by PCR, sequencing, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR), and functional analysis. Continued proliferation of the MDV-miR-M4-deleted cell lines demonstrated that MDV-miR-M4 expression is not essential for maintaining the transformed phenotype, despite its initial critical role in the induction of lymphomas. Ability to examine the direct role of oncogenic miRNAs in situ in tumor cell lines is valuable in delineating distinct determinants and pathways associated with the induction or maintenance of transformation in cancer cells and will also contribute significantly to gaining further insights into the biology of oncogenic herpesviruses.IMPORTANCE Marek's disease virus (MDV) is an alphaherpesvirus associated with Marek's disease (MD), a highly contagious neoplastic disease of chickens. MD serves as an excellent model for studying virus-induced T-cell lymphomas in the natural chicken hosts. Among the limited set of genes associated with MD oncogenicity, MDV-miR-M4, a highly expressed viral ortholog of the oncogenic miR-155, has received extensive attention due to its direct role in the induction of lymphomas. Using a targeted CRISPR-Cas9-based gene editing approach in MDV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, we show that MDV-miR-M4, despite its critical role in the induction of tumors, is not essential for maintaining the transformed phenotype and continuous proliferation. As far as we know, this was the first study in which precise editing of an oncogenic miRNA was carried out in situ in MD lymphoma-derived cell lines to demonstrate that it is not essential in maintaining the transformed phenotype.","['Zhang, Yaoyao', 'Tang, Na', 'Luo, Jun', 'Teng, Man', 'Moffat, Katy', 'Shen, Zhiqiang', 'Watson, Mick', 'Nair, Venugopal', 'Yao, Yongxiu']","['Zhang Y', 'Tang N', 'Luo J', 'Teng M', 'Moffat K', 'Shen Z', 'Watson M', 'Nair V', 'Yao Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4211-0358'],"['The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'School of Animal Science and Technology, Guangxi University, Nanning, China.', 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Binzhou Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine Academy & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Binzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Immunology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Henan Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Immunology, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, China.', 'College of Animal Science and Technology, Henan University of Science and Technology, Luoyang, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Animal Immunology of the Ministry of Agriculture, Henan Provincial Key Laboratory of Animal Immunology, Henan Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Zhengzhou, China.', 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom.', 'Binzhou Animal Science and Veterinary Medicine Academy & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Binzhou, China.', 'The Roslin Institute, R(D)SVS, University of Edinburgh, Midlothian, United Kingdom.', 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom venugopal.nair@pirbright.ac.uk yongxiu.yao@pirbright.ac.uk.', 'The Jenner Institute Laboratories, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'The Pirbright Institute & UK-China Centre of Excellence for Research on Avian Diseases, Pirbright, Guildford, Surrey, United Kingdom venugopal.nair@pirbright.ac.uk yongxiu.yao@pirbright.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190813,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Mardivirus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics']",PMC6694823,2019/06/14 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00713-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00713-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Aug 13;93(17). pii: JVI.00713-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00713-19.

Here, we show that EZH2 and NRAS(G12D) mutations cooperatively induce progression of myeloproliferative neoplasms to highly penetrant, transplantable, and lethal myeloid leukemias in mice. EZH1, an EZH2 homolog, is indispensable for EZH2-deficient leukemia-initiating cells and constitutes an epigenetic vulnerability. BCAT1, which catalyzes the reversible transamination of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), is repressed by EZH2 in normal hematopoiesis and aberrantly activated in EZH2-deficient myeloid neoplasms in mice and humans. BCAT1 reactivation cooperates with NRAS(G12D) to sustain intracellular BCAA pools, resulting in enhanced mTOR signaling in EZH2-deficient leukemia cells. Genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of BCAT1 selectively impairs EZH2-deficient leukemia-initiating cells and constitutes a metabolic vulnerability. Hence, epigenetic alterations rewire intracellular metabolism during leukemic transformation, causing epigenetic and metabolic vulnerabilities in cancer-initiating cells. SIGNIFICANCE: EZH2 inactivation and oncogenic NRAS cooperate to induce leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms by activating BCAT1 to enhance BCAA metabolism and mTOR signaling. We uncover a mechanism by which epigenetic alterations rewire metabolism during cancer progression, causing epigenetic and metabolic liabilities in cancer-initiating cells that may be exploited as potential therapeutics.See related commentary by Li and Melnick, p. 1158.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1143.","['Gu, Zhimin', 'Liu, Yuxuan', 'Cai, Feng', 'Patrick, McKenzie', 'Zmajkovic, Jakub', 'Cao, Hui', 'Zhang, Yuannyu', 'Tasdogan, Alpaslan', 'Chen, Mingyi', 'Qi, Le', 'Liu, Xin', 'Li, Kailong', 'Lyu, Junhua', 'Dickerson, Kathryn E', 'Chen, Weina', 'Ni, Min', 'Merritt, Matthew E', 'Morrison, Sean J', 'Skoda, Radek C', 'DeBerardinis, Ralph J', 'Xu, Jian']","['Gu Z', 'Liu Y', 'Cai F', 'Patrick M', 'Zmajkovic J', 'Cao H', 'Zhang Y', 'Tasdogan A', 'Chen M', 'Qi L', 'Liu X', 'Li K', 'Lyu J', 'Dickerson KE', 'Chen W', 'Ni M', 'Merritt ME', 'Morrison SJ', 'Skoda RC', 'DeBerardinis RJ', 'Xu J']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1220-2243', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4617-9651', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1988-7337']","[""Children's Medical Center Research Institute, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Harold C.

However, due to the complex regulatory machinery of the cell, gene regulatory network (GRN) model inference based on such data still manifests significant uncertainty. RESULTS: The goal of this paper is to develop optimal classification of single-cell trajectories accounting for potential model uncertainty. Partially-observed Boolean dynamical systems (POBDS) are used for modeling gene regulatory networks observed through noisy gene-expression data. We derive the exact optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC) for binary classification of single-cell trajectories. The application of the OBC becomes impractical for large GRNs, due to computational and memory requirements. To address this, we introduce a particle-based single-cell classification method that is highly scalable for large GRNs with much lower complexity than the optimal solution. CONCLUSION: The performance of the proposed particle-based method is demonstrated through numerical experiments using a POBDS model of the well-known T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) leukemia network with noisy time-series gene-expression data.","['Hajiramezanali, Ehsan', 'Imani, Mahdi', 'Braga-Neto, Ulisses', 'Qian, Xiaoning', 'Dougherty, Edward R']","['Hajiramezanali E', 'Imani M', 'Braga-Neto U', 'Qian X', 'Dougherty ER']",,"['Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, MS3128 TAMU, College Station, 77843, TX, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, MS3128 TAMU, College Station, 77843, TX, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, MS3128 TAMU, College Station, 77843, TX, USA.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, MS3128 TAMU, College Station, 77843, TX, USA. xqian@ece.tamu.edu.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Texas A&M University, MS3128 TAMU, College Station, 77843, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190613,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,,"['*Algorithms', '*Bayes Theorem', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Single-Cell Analysis/*methods', 'Uncertainty']",PMC6561847,2019/06/14 06:00,2019/08/24 06:00,['2019/06/14 06:00'],"['2019/06/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-019-5720-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-019-5720-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2019 Jun 13;20(Suppl 6):435. doi: 10.1186/s12864-019-5720-3.,Suppl 6,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Optimal Bayesian classification', 'Particle filter', 'Probabilistic Boolean networks', 'Single-cell trajectory classification']",,,,,,,,,,,

Often treatment modalities are tailored to individual patients based on age, presence of comorbidities and cytogenetics. The advent of ibrutinib has significantly changed the management of the disease in all patient groups and has had the largest impact on clinical practice to date. Over the last 15 years, a series of trials have established that chemoimmunotherapy improves both progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Despite its proven role, efficacy of ibrutinib has not been well established in young, fit patients and in comparison with standard care and as combination therapy with other agents such as venetoclax. New data have strengthened the role of ibrutinib in the front-line setting and establish its place in therapy. In addition, combination therapies are geared to achieve negative minimal residual disease and allow patients to potentially be off of therapy. The management of this leukemia has extensively changed over the past years, and this review article will aim to highlight key trials that have changed practice and led to guideline updates.

Twelve years after her diagnosis of CLL, routine follow-up chromosome analysis of peripheral blood revealed an abnormal metaphase with a dup(3)(q21q27) in 18 of 20 metaphase cells. To further characterize the abnormal chromosome 3, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed using the Abbott BCL6 probe for 3q27. An additional BCL6 signal was observed in 303 of the 500 interphase nuclei examined. The ISCN was reported as 46,XX,dup(3)(q21q27)[1]/46,XX[2]. nuc ish(5'BCL6, 3'BCL6)x3(5'BCL6 with 3'BCL6x3)[303/500]. This abnormality was seen again in one of three available metaphases in a follow-up peripheral blood study five years later, consistent with persistent disease. Molecular genetic analysis identified the presence of somatic hypermutation of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene variable region (IGH-V), which is recognized as an independent favorable prognostic marker in CLL. FISH analysis was negative for loss of SEC63 (6q21), amplification of MYC (8q24), loss of ATM (11q22.3), trisomy 12, loss of D13S319 (13q14.3), loss of TP53 (17p13.1) and CCND1/MYEOV IGH rearrangement [t(11;14)(q13;q32.30)]. Partial trisomy 3 is a relatively rare event seen in B-CLL, with commonly overrepresented segments including the q21-23 region and the q25-29 region of the long arm of chromosome 3, as well as changes leading to gains of 3q26- q27.

Of all CML patients, 5-10% show variant Philadelphia translocations (vPh) and are an area of research interest for their significance in predicting response to various therapies, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. They are also being studied for prognosticating multi-year survival outcomes in varied patient populations, with conflicting results. We included 238 patients for conventional cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization study from January 2018 to October 2018. Patients with vPh in CML-Chronic Phase (CML-CP) were analyzed with respect to their demographic parameters, response to imatinib therapy, and survival. Out of 238 patients diagnosed with CML-CP, 8 patients (3.3%) showed vPh. The most common chromosomes involved in these translocations were 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11 and 12. In almost all the cases with variant Ph chromosome, the BCR-ABL rearrangement was detected by molecular methods or by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). All patients were treated with imatinib as a first-line therapy. Rates of complete hematological response, complete cytogenetic response, and major molecular response were similar in all patients with classical Ph and variant Ph chromosome. Our data suggest that prognosis of CML patients with vPh in CML has no significant effect in predicting response to imatinib or in predicting survival.","['Trivedi, Pina', 'Varma, Priya', 'Patel, Dharmesh', 'Ladani, Dhara', 'Patel, Darshita', 'Kazi, Mahnaz', 'Patel, Nehal', 'Patel, Prabhudas']","['Trivedi P', 'Varma P', 'Patel D', 'Ladani D', 'Patel D', 'Kazi M', 'Patel N', 'Patel P']",,"['Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.', 'Cytogenetic Lab, Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Asarwa, Ahmedabad-380016, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,2019/06/13 06:00,2019/06/13 06:01,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2019;45(2):61-65.,2,,,,['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

PubMed, SCOPUS, EBSCO, LILACS, and other Latin-specific databases were searched for case-control studies that investigated the association between these polymorphisms and hematologic malignancies until November 2017. Genotype distributions were extracted and either fixed-effects or random-effects models were used to calculate the pooled crude odds ratios (ORs) for the heterozygous, homozygous, dominant, recessive, and allelic genetic models. No publication bias was detected by the Begg-Mazumdar's test and Egger's test. From 290 publications, we identified 15 studies on the C677T polymorphism and 13 studies on the A1298C polymorphism. We observed a significant decrease in risk for the C677T polymorphism (OR range=0.54-0.75, p<0.01) and a significant increase in risk for the A1298C polymorphism (OR range=1.28-2.52, p<0.05) in developing ALL for all genetic models. No associations were determined for CML, AML, or MM for either polymorphism. This meta-analysis demonstrated that the A1298C polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of developing ALL, whereas the C677T polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk (protective factor) in the Latino population.","['Garcia-Hernandez, Samanta Celeste', 'Meneses-Sanchez, Perla', 'Porchia, Leonardo Martin', 'Torres-Rasgado, Enrique', 'Perez-Fuentes, Ricardo', 'Gonzalez-Mejia, Martha Elba']","['Garcia-Hernandez SC', 'Meneses-Sanchez P', 'Porchia LM', 'Torres-Rasgado E', 'Perez-Fuentes R', 'Gonzalez-Mejia ME']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2569-1998'],"['Departamento de Genetica, Facultad de Medicina, Benemerita Universidad Autonoma de Puebla.

Our study focused on the comparative analysis of the expression of five genes and corresponding proteins (DDX39A, HMGA1, HMGA2, HOXC9 and PBX1) that have recently been discussed as possible predictive biomarkers of clinical response to retinoid differentiation therapy. Expression of these five candidate biomarkers was evaluated at both the mRNA and protein level in the same subset of 8 neuroblastoma cell lines after treatment with natural or synthetic retinoids. We found that the cell lines that were HMGA2-positive and/or HOXC9-negative have a reduced sensitivity to retinoids. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that the retinoid-sensitive cell lines showed a uniform pattern of change after treatment with both natural and sensitive retinoids: increased DDX39A and decreased PBX1 protein levels. Our results showed that in NBL cells, these putative protein biomarkers are associated with sensitivity or resistance to retinoids, and their endogenous or induced expression can distinguish between these two phenotypes.","['Dobrotkova, Viera', 'Chlapek, Petr', 'Jezova, Marta', 'Adamkova, Katerina', 'Mazanek, Pavel', 'Sterba, Jaroslav', 'Veselska, Renata']","['Dobrotkova V', 'Chlapek P', 'Jezova M', 'Adamkova K', 'Mazanek P', 'Sterba J', 'Veselska R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0048-9913'],"['Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska, Czech Republic."", 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Pathology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Jihlavska, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni, Czech Republic.', 'Laboratory of Tumor Biology, Department of Experimental Biology, Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, Kotlarska, Czech Republic.', ""International Clinical Research Center, St. Anne's University Hospital, Pekarska, Czech Republic."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Cernopolni, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190612,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (HMGA2 Protein)', '0 (HMGA2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxc9 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '124544-67-8 (HMGA1a Protein)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5352-74-9 (9,13-retinoic acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'A61RXM4375 (Bexarotene)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX39A protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bexarotene/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Fenretinide/pharmacology', 'HMGA1a Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'HMGA2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Isotretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Fixation', 'Tretinoin/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6561640,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0218269 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-01831 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jun 12;14(6):e0218269. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218269. eCollection 2019.,6,,,,,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,

The BCR gene (chromosome 22q11.2) and the ABL1 gene (chromosome 9q34) fuse together due to reciprocal chromosome translocation forming the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph). This fusion gene codes tyrosine kinase which accelerates the cell division and reduces DNA repair. Imatinib mesylate is a selective inhibitor of this tyrosine kinase. It is the first-line treatment for CML-patients. However, it became clear that Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) cells could evolve to elude inhibition due to point mutations within the BCR-ABL kinase domain. To date more than 40 mutations have been identified and their early detection is important for clinical treatment. With the development of the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), associated with these mutations, the resistance problem seems to diminish, as some of the new drugs are less prone to resistance.

Recent reports have shown that red blood cells (RBCs) can be associated with RCT, an interaction facilitated by albumin. However, the RCT function of RBCs has not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, the RCT function of RBCs was assessed using cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) assays, in which [3H]-labeled cholesterol-loaded human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) macrophages were incubated with RBCs as a cholesterol acceptor in the presence or absence of HDL or its main component protein apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I). The CEC of RBCs was found to be dose dependent, enabling uptake of cholesterol from THP-1 macrophages through apoA-I and HDL, and directly from apoA-I and HDL in medium without the presence THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, RBCs could exchange cholesterol with HDL in a bidirectional manner but could only exchange cholesterol with apoA-I in a single direction. Although albumin promoted the movement of cholesterol, synergistic effects were not observed for both apoA-I and HDL, in contrast to previous findings. These results strongly suggested that RBCs may play important roles in RCT by mediating cholesterol efflux as temporary cholesterol storage.","['Lai, Shao-Jui', 'Ohkawa, Ryunosuke', 'Horiuchi, Yuna', 'Kubota, Tetsuo', 'Tozuka, Minoru']","['Lai SJ', 'Ohkawa R', 'Horiuchi Y', 'Kubota T', 'Tozuka M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8584-133X'],"['Analytical Laboratory Chemistry, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Health Care Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Analytical Laboratory Chemistry, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Analytical Laboratory Chemistry, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Immunopathology, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Analytical Laboratory Chemistry, Field of Applied Laboratory Science, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', ""Life Science Research Center, Nagano Children's Hospital, 3100 Toyoshina, Azumino 399-8288, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (APOA1 protein, human)', '0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Apolipoprotein A-I/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'THP-1 Cells']",,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/hsz-2019-0244 [doi]', 'hsz-2019-0244 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Chem. 2019 Nov 26;400(12):1593-1602. doi: 10.1515/hsz-2019-0244.,12,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*albumin', '*atherosclerosis', '*cholesterol efflux capacity']",,,,,,,,,,,

Risk factors for allergic reactions to PEG-ASP remain unclear. Here, we identify risk factors for reactions in a front-line acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial and assess the usefulness of serum antibodies for diagnosing allergy and predicting rechallenge outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PEG-ASP was administered to 598 patients in St Jude's Total XVI study. Results were compared with Total XV study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00549848 and NCT00137111), which used native L-ASP. Serum samples (n = 5,369) were analyzed for anti-PEG-ASP immunoglobulin G by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Positive samples were tested for anti-polyethylene glycol (PEG) and anti-L-ASP. We analyzed potential risk factors for reactions and associations between antibodies and reactions, rechallenge outcomes, and PEG-ASP pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Grade 2 to 4 reactions were less common in the Total XVI study with PEG-ASP (81 [13.5%] of 598) than in the Total XV study with L-ASP (169 [41.2%] of 410; P = 1.4 x 10(-23)). For Total XVI, anti-PEG, not anti-L-ASP, was the predominant component of anti-PEG-ASP antibodies (96%). In a multivariable analysis, more intrathecal therapy (IT) predicted fewer reactions (P = 2.4 x 10(-5)), which is consistent with an immunosuppressant contribution of IT. Anti-PEG-ASP was associated with accelerated drug clearance (P = 5.0 x 10(-6)). Failure of rechallenge after initial reactions was associated with anti-PEG-ASP (P = .0078) and was predicted by the occurrence of angioedema with first reaction (P = .01). CONCLUSION: Less IT therapy was the only independent clinical risk factor for reactions to PEG-ASP. PEG, and not L-ASP, is the major antigen that causes allergic reactions. Anti-PEG-ASP has utility in predicting and confirming clinical reactions to PEG-ASP as well as in identifying patients who are most likely to experience failure with rechallenge.","['Liu, Yiwei', 'Smith, Colton A', 'Panetta, John C', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Thompson, Lauren E', 'Counts, Jacob P', 'Molinelli, Alejandro R', 'Pei, Deqing', 'Kornegay, Nancy M', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Swanson, Hope', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Karol, Seth E', 'Evans, William E', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Liu Y', 'Smith CA', 'Panetta JC', 'Yang W', 'Thompson LE', 'Counts JP', 'Molinelli AR', 'Pei D', 'Kornegay NM', 'Crews KR', 'Swanson H', 'Cheng C', 'Karol SE', 'Evans WE', 'Inaba H', 'Pui CH', 'Jeha S', 'Relling MV']",,"[""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", '2University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO.', '3University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""1St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190612,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6804844,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.02439 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Aug 10;37(23):2051-2061. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.02439.

Many AML patients now live long-term with the side effects of treatment. This study documents the prevalence and severity of AML treatment-related side effects. Methods: A national cross-sectional survey designed with the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society assessed patients' experiences with short-term (nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, hair loss, mouth sores, infection, rash) and long-term (organ dysfunction, chemobrain, fatigue, neuropathy) treatment side effects. Patient and caregiver participants rated side effect severity (none-severe). Results: Survey participants (n = 1182) were mostly female (65%), AML patients (76%), and had undergone chemotherapy (94%). Eighty-seven per cent of participants reported severe short-term effects, and 33% reported severe long-term effects of treatment. Only 11% of respondents did not have any severe effects. Hair loss and fatigue were the most common severe short- and long-term side effects (78%, 33%). There was a moderate correlation between having short- and long-term adverse effects (r = 0.41, p < 0.001). Caregivers were more likely than patients to report severe organ dysfunction, fatigue, and neuropathy (p-values < 0.05). Conclusions: Survivors experience a high burden of side effects from AML treatments highlighting the need for the development of less toxic therapies. Differences in patients' and caregivers' experiences illustrate the importance of sampling from diverse sources to understand the full burden of AML treatment, and the need for less toxic drugs. This study informs patients, patient-advocacy groups, clinicians, and regulators about AML treatment burdens and provides the community with information to inform PFDD.","['Crossnohere, Norah L', 'Richardson, Daniel R', 'Reinhart, Crystal', ""O'Donoghue, Bernadette"", 'Love, Susan M', 'Smith, B Douglas', 'Bridges, John F P']","['Crossnohere NL', 'Richardson DR', 'Reinhart C', ""O'Donoghue B"", 'Love SM', 'Smith BD', 'Bridges JFP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2811-1330'],"['Department of Health, Behavior, and Society, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center , Columbus , OH , USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill , NC , USA.', 'School of Social Work, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , Urbana , IL , USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society , Rye Brook , NY , USA.', 'Dr. Susan Love Research Foundation , Encino , CA , USA.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins School of Medicine , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'Department of Health, Behavior, and Society, The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , Baltimore , MD , USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center , Columbus , OH , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190626,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Alopecia/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/07/03 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2019.1631149 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2019 Nov;35(11):1965-1970. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2019.1631149.

Seven years after the CML diagnosis in 2004 and complete response, the patient experienced pain in the mandible and extremities. After this, imatinib was replaced by nilotinib, but generalized maculopapular rash was presented and successfully treated with antihistamines. The therapy was then discontinued due to planned pregnancy, and the patient experienced a relapse of CML with BCR-ABL/ABL1 transcripts of 18.9%. Dasatinib was introduced, and CML was in remission. Two years later, urine protein levels (6.19 g/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were elevated (ESR=90 mm/3.6 ks). The patient was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. With dasatinib dose reduction, urine protein level returned to the reference range. In order to determine the best genotype-guided therapy, the patient underwent pharmacogenomic testing, showing a homozygous CYP3A4 genotype *1/*1, associated with extensive metabolizer (EM) enzyme phenotype, typical for normal rates of drug metabolism for TKIs. However, this was inconsistent with nephrotic syndrome occurrence. A possible explanation would be CYP3A4 EM genotype coding a poor metabolizer enzyme phenotype, leading to the drug accumulation in the patient's blood. This transient phenoconversion can be explained by inflammation with elevated ESR during nephrotic syndrome. This case shows that a broader approach that recognizes genetic, clinical, and epigenomic factors is required for a quality decision on the personalized therapy regimen.","['Mandac Rogulj, Inga', 'Matisic, Vid', 'Arsov, Borna', 'Boban, Luka', 'Juginovic, Alen', 'Molnar, Vilim', 'Primorac, Dragan']","['Mandac Rogulj I', 'Matisic V', 'Arsov B', 'Boban L', 'Juginovic A', 'Molnar V', 'Primorac D']",,"['Inga Mandac Rogulj, Department of hematology, Clinical Hospital Merkur, Zajceva Street 19, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia, imandac@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Croatia,Croat Med J,Croatian medical journal,9424324,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/genetics', 'Dasatinib/*adverse effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",PMC6563182,2019/06/13 06:00,2019/08/29 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Croat Med J. 2019 Jun 13;60(3):250-254.,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A proposal of structural and functional classification.,e00772,10.1002/mgg3.772 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The human TET2 gene plays a pivotal role in the epigenetic regulation of normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Somatic TET2 mutations have been repeatedly identified in age-related clonal hematopoiesis and in myeloid neoplasms ranging from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to myeloproliferative neoplasms. However, there have been no attempts to systematically explore the structural and functional consequences of the hundreds of TET2 missense variants reported to date. METHODS: We have sequenced the TET2 gene in 189 Spanish AML patients using Sanger sequencing and NGS protocols. Next, we performed a thorough bioinformatics analysis of TET2 protein and of the expected impact of all reported TET2 missense variants on protein structure and function, exploiting available structure-and-function information as well as 3D structure prediction tools. RESULTS: We have identified 38 TET2 allelic variants in the studied patients, including two frequent SNPs: p.G355D (10 cases) and p.I1762V (28 cases). Four of the detected mutations are reported here for the first time: c.122C>T (p.P41L), c.4535C>G (p.A1512G), c.4760A>G (p.D1587G), and c.5087A>T (p.Y1696F). We predict a complex multidomain architecture for the noncatalytic regions of TET2, and in particular the presence of well-conserved alpha+beta globular domains immediately preceding and following the actual catalytic unit. Further, we provide a rigorous interpretation of over 430 missense SNVs that affect the TET2 catalytic domain, and we hypothesize explanations for ~700 additional variants found within the regulatory regions of the protein. Finally, we propose a systematic classification of all missense mutants and SNPs reported to date into three major categories (severe, moderate, and mild), based on their predicted structural and functional impact. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed classification of missense TET2 variants would help to assess their clinical impact on human neoplasia and may guide future structure-and-function investigations of TET family members.","['Bussaglia, Elena', 'Anton, Rosa', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F', 'Fuentes-Prior, Pablo']","['Bussaglia E', 'Anton R', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Fuentes-Prior P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6618-3204'],"['Hematology Department and Diagnostic Hematology Group, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Bases of Disease, The Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology Department and Diagnostic Hematology Group, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Molecular Bases of Disease, The Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190611,United States,Mol Genet Genomic Med,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Dioxygenases', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Mutation, Missense/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure']",PMC6625141,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/07/16 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mgg3.772 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomic Med. 2019 Jul;7(7):e00772. doi: 10.1002/mgg3.772.

Age-related clonal hematopoiesis of copy number variations (CNVs) is linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancies, but the clinical impact of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) harboring such CNVs, such as del(20q), is not clearly understood. Here, we report an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient with known del(20q) who acquired donor-derived del(20q) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The HSCs with del(20q) engrafted and expanded over time, but the patient did not clinically progress to myeloid neoplasm. Although donor-derived del(20q) from a healthy donor has been reported previously, our case is the first to review the clonal dynamics of a del(20q) clone and its post-transplantation impact. Since recurrent hematology neoplasm-associated CNVs, including del(20q), may not be rare among aged HSCT donors, identifying the origin of such a CNV is necessary for clinical decisions when clonal abnormality appears after HSCT, even in recipients who previously had the same abnormality.","['Yoon, Jung', 'Yun, Jae Won', 'Jung, Chul Won', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Sun-Hee']","['Yoon J', 'Yun JW', 'Jung CW', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9296-5085'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Genetics, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190611,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,,IM,"['*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC6757114,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22951 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2019 Sep;33(7):e22951. doi: 10.1002/jcla.22951.

However, up to 50% of patients relapse, often multiple times, and become progressively less sensitive to these myelotoxic and immune-suppressive drugs. At progression, viable therapeutic strategies include addition of rituximab to purine analogues, and treatment with the anti-CD22 immunotoxin moxetumomab pasudotox, which has been recently approved by the FDA in HCL patients after at least two prior therapies. Identification of the BRAF-V600E kinase mutation as the genetic cause of HCL has opened the way, in the relapsed/refractory experimental setting, to targeted and non-myelotoxic effective strategies that are based on inhibition of BRAF with vemurafenib, co-inhibition of BRAF and its target MEK with dabrafenib and trametinib, and BRAF inhibition with vemurafenib combined with anti-CD20 immunotherapy. In particular, vemurafenib plus rituximab is emerging as a short, safe, chemotherapy-free regimen able to induce deep complete remissions in most HCL patients refractory to, or relapsed multiple times, after chemo(immuno)therapy.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Tiacci, Enrico']","['Falini B', 'Tiacci E']",,"['Institute of Hematology and CREO (Center for Hemato-Oncological Research), Ospedale S.

We hypothesized that the addition of venetoclax, a BCL-2 inhibitor, to AML patients who previously failed HMA might overcome resistance. Adult patients (>/= 18 years) with AML were eligible if leukemia relapsed after, or was refractory to HMA. In general, in addition to venetoclax, patients continued HMA or other low-intensity therapies. Patients who previously underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) were also eligible. Data were analyzed in November 2018. Twenty-three patients were treated between October 2016 and October 2018 and were eligible for this study. Median age was 76 years and 6 patients had leukemia that relapsed post allogeneic HCT. None of the patients experienced tumor lysis syndrome and toxicities were as expected and manageable. Febrile neutropenia was the most common toxicity (78% of patients). Median hospitalization time was 13 days. Forty-three percent of the patients achieved CR/CRi. Overall survival (OS) was 74% at 6 months and median OS in patients who achieved remission was 10.8 months. Higher number of blasts in both bone marrow and peripheral blood was associated with lower chances of CR, while higher WBC, LDH, and bone marrow or peripheral blasts were associated with increased mortality rate. The addition of venetoclax to patients with HMA-refractory AML may result in a substantial anti-leukemic activity, specifically in those achieving complete remission. This should be further tested in a well-designed prospective trial.","['Ram, Ron', 'Amit, Odelia', 'Zuckerman, Tsila', 'Gurion, Ronit', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Bar-On, Yael', 'Avivi, Irit', 'Wolach, Ofir']","['Ram R', 'Amit O', 'Zuckerman T', 'Gurion R', 'Raanani P', 'Bar-On Y', 'Avivi I', 'Wolach O']",,"['BMT Unit, Tel Aviv Medical Center, 6 Weizman St., Tel Aviv, Israel.

The study reviewed the clinicopathological features and outcomes of patients who developed t-MN. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with t-MN by 2016 WHO classification, from a cohort of 521 patients who received PRRT/PRCRT over a 12-year period. Molecular next-generation sequencing using an in-house 26-gene panel was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-five of 521 (4.8%) patients were diagnosed with t-MN, including six acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 19 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The median time from first cycle PRRT/PRCRT to diagnosis of t-MN was 26 months (range 4-91). Twenty-two of 25 (88%) patients had grade 1-2 pancreatic or small bowel NEN with moderate metastatic liver burden. Six patients (24%) had prior chemotherapy. Median number of PRRT cycles = 5 (22/25 (88%) with concomitant radiosensitising chemotherapy). All 25 patients achieved disease stabilisation (68%) or partial response (32%) on RECIST 1.1 at 3 months post-PRRT. At t-MN diagnosis, all patients presented with thrombocytopenia (median nadir 33 x 10(9)/L, range 3-75) and 17 (68%) remained NEN progression-free. Marrow genetic analysis revealed unfavourable karyotype in 16/25 (66%) patients with tumour protein 53 (TP53) mutation in nine (36%). Azacitidine therapy was utilised in ten eligible patients, while four received induction chemotherapy for AML. The median overall survival from first PRRT was 62 months (19-94), but from t-MN diagnosis was only 13 months (1-56), with death due primarily to haematological disease progression. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of t-MN after PRRT/PRCRT is an infrequent but serious complication with poor overall survival. Most patients present with thrombocytopenia; unfavourable genetic mutations have a poor response to t-MN treatment. Prospective data are needed to explore potential pre-existing genetic factors and predictive biomarkers to minimise the risk of t-MN.","['Goncalves, Isaac', 'Burbury, Kate', 'Michael, Michael', 'Iravani, Amir', 'Ravi Kumar, Aravind S', 'Akhurst, Tim', 'Tiong, Ing S', 'Blombery, Piers', 'Hofman, Michael S', 'Westerman, David', 'Hicks, Rodney J', 'Kong, Grace']","['Goncalves I', 'Burbury K', 'Michael M', 'Iravani A', 'Ravi Kumar AS', 'Akhurst T', 'Tiong IS', 'Blombery P', 'Hofman MS', 'Westerman D', 'Hicks RJ', 'Kong G']",,"['Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, 3000, Australia. isaac.goncalves@petermac.org.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, 3000, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, 3000, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, 3000, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, 3000, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Nuclear Medicine Department, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Sir Peter MacCallum Department of Oncology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Neuroendocrine Tumour Service, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190611,Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Receptors, Peptide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Chemoradiotherapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/diagnostic imaging/*pathology/*therapy', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Receptors, Peptide/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/07/24 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00259-019-04389-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00259-019-04389-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2019 Aug;46(9):1902-1910. doi: 10.1007/s00259-019-04389-2.

This study aimed to explore the clinical implications of miR-500 expression status in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that had received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). miR-500 expression status and clinical data were obtained from 74 patients with AML in the The Cancer Genome Atlas database receiving allo-HSCT. Patients with low expression level of miR-500 (miR-500low) were significantly more likely to present with a French-American-British classification M2 subtype (P=0.003), and less likely to have the M5 subtype (P=0.040) compared with patients with high expression levels (miR-500high). miR-500low patients were associated with low-risk AML (P=0.003) and core-binding factor subunit b-myosin heavy chain 11 translocation mutation (P=0.021). There was a significant difference in nucleophosmin 1 (P=0.009), NRAS proto-oncogene GTPase/KRAS proto-oncogene GTPase (P=0.047) and PHD finger protein 6 (P=0.040) expression levels between the two groups. miR-500high patients had a decreased overall survival (OS) time compared with the low expression group (P=0.035). Multivariate analysis revealed that miR-500 expression significantly affected OS time independent of other classical prognostic factors, such as age and common mutations. The analysis of survival curves further substantiated this result. The results obtained in the current study suggested that miR-500 may be a suitable prognostic marker for patients with AML receiving allo-HSCT.","['Zhang, Gaoqi', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Yang, Xinrui', 'Zhang, Xinpei', 'Zhang, Lingxiu', 'Zhang, Jilei', 'Yang, Siyuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Hu, Kai', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Fu, Lin']","['Zhang G', 'Shi J', 'Yang X', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang J', 'Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Hu K', 'Ke X', 'Fu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, P.R.

A total of 162 AML patients were enrolled and divided into chemotherapy and allo-HSCT groups. Next, the overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were compared between patients with high and low miR-425 expression in each of the treatment groups. In the chemotherapy group, high miR-425 expression was favorable for EFS (P=0.001) and OS (P=0.001) in younger patients (<60 years), whereas it had no effect on EFS and OS in older patients (>/=60 years). In the allo-HSCT group, there was no association between miR-425 expression levels and clinical outcomes. Further analyses suggested that in the low miR-425 expression group, EFS and OS were longer in patients treated with allo-HSCT as compared with those treated with chemotherapy (both P<0.001), whereas no significant differences were observed in the high miR-425 expression group. In conclusion, the current data indicated that miR-425 is an independent favorable prognostic factor for younger AML patients undergoing chemotherapy, and its use may facilitate clinical decision-making in selecting treatment for AML patients. Patients with low miR-425 expression may benefit from allo-HSCT, whereas allo-HSCT did not appear to be beneficial in patients with high miR-425 expression.","['Zhang, Jilei', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Zhang, Gaoqi', 'Zhang, Xinpei', 'Yang, Xinrui', 'Yang, Siyuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Hu, Kai', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Fu, Lin']","['Zhang J', 'Shi J', 'Zhang G', 'Zhang X', 'Yang X', 'Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Hu K', 'Ke X', 'Fu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, P.R.

The present study demonstrated that PIM2 was highly expressed in CD34(+) cells derived from the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)/acute myeloid leukemia. The mRNA expression level of PIM2 was quantified in MDS cell lines and mRNA expression was significantly decreased compared with that in KG-1 cells. In vitro, downregulation of PIM2 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited cell proliferation and delayed G0/G1 cell cycle progression in the MDS cell line SKM-1. Western blotting revealed that cyclin dependent kinase 2 was markedly downregulated and cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A was markedly upregulated following transfection with PIM2 siRNA. Cell Counting Kit-8 analysis demonstrated that cell proliferation of si-PIM2-transfected cells was significantly decreased compared with control cells. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting revealed that PIM2 expression was negatively correlated with isocitrate dehydrogenase [NADP(+)]1 cytosolic (IDH1) and positively correlated with hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1A) in CD34(+) MDS cells. Collectively, these results suggested that the expression of PIM2 induced increased expression of HIF1A by decreasing the expression of IDH1, resulting in increased CD34(+) cell proliferation. Therefore, PIM2 may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of MDS and AML or a target for novel therapeutic agents.","['Liu, Zhaoyun', 'Tian, Mengyue', 'Ding, Kai', 'Liu, Hui', 'Wang, Yangyang', 'Fu, Rong']","['Liu Z', 'Tian M', 'Ding K', 'Liu H', 'Wang Y', 'Fu R']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, P.R.

Recently, a connection between BCR-ABL signaling with NF-kappaB activation mediated by CK2 has been hypothesized. Approximately 95% of patients with Ph+ ALL have the BCR-ABLp190 isoform, which causes aggressive leukemia with a high rate of chemotherapy resistance. Therefore, the use of compounds that could improve the efficacy of chemotherapy drugs is of particular interest. Curcumin is an active chemical in turmeric with antineoplastic potential; it regulates protein-kinases by modulating downstream molecular pathways. The present study evaluated the effect of curcumin in combination with the chemotherapeutic drugs vincristine, imatinib and daunorubicin in the human OP-1 cell line. Several doses of the chemotherapy drugs were examined, and the effects were evaluated following 12, 24 and 48 h of exposure. The interaction between the chemotherapy drugs and curcumin was determined by the dose-effect curve, which generated a combination index (CI); these data were represented in isobolograms. In addition, the individual effect of each drug was compared with its effect in combination with curcumin on cell viability, apoptosis degree, NF-kappaB activation and gene expression changes. The present study observed that curcumin potentiates the efficacy of vincristine and imatinib, generating an additive/synergistic effect in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These combinations significantly increased the apoptosis degree, decreased the activation of NF-kappaB and the expression of its regulated genes. Conversely treatment with daunorubicin + curcumin combination produced an antagonistic/additive effect in a dose-dependent manner, and this combination significantly increased the apoptosis degree. However, this effect seems not to be associated with NF-kappaB activity, as no significant changes were observed in its activation or in the expression of the genes that it regulates. The results of the present study demonstrate that curcumin may be used as an adjuvant agent for chemotherapy in patients with Ph+ ALL.","['Santana-Bejarano, Uriel Francisco', 'Bobadilla-Morales, Lucina', 'Mendoza-Maldonado, Lucero', 'Torres-Anguiano, Elizabeth', 'Brukman-Jimenez, Sinhue Alejandro', 'Barba-Barba, Cesar Cenobio', 'Corona-Rivera, Jorge Roman', 'Corona-Rivera, Alfredo']","['Santana-Bejarano UF', 'Bobadilla-Morales L', 'Mendoza-Maldonado L', 'Torres-Anguiano E', 'Brukman-Jimenez SA', 'Barba-Barba CC', 'Corona-Rivera JR', 'Corona-Rivera A']",,"[""Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Human Genetics Institute 'Dr. Enrique Corona Rivera', Health Sciences University Center, University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco 44340, Mexico."", 'PhD Program in Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Health Sciences University Center, University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco 44340, Mexico.', ""Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory, Human Genetics Institute 'Dr. Enrique Corona Rivera', Health Sciences University Center, University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco 44340, Mexico."", 'PhD Program in Molecular Biology and Human Genetics, Health Sciences University Center, University of Guadalajara, Guadalajara, Jalisco 44340, Mexico.', 'Cytogenetics Unit, Dr. Juan I.

The initial focus was on the role of stromal cell-derived C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12). Interference with CXCL12 production by stroma or blockade of its interactions with ALL by plerixafor did increase ALL cell death and in sensitive ALLs there was synergistic effect with conventional chemotherapy drugs. However, in contrast to most reports, there was considerable heterogeneity regarding the effect between 7 unique primary ALLs, with several exhibiting no sensitivity to CXCL12 blockade. The diversity in effect was not explained by differences in the expression of ALL cell surface receptors for CXCL12. The modest and variable effects of interference with CXCL12 on ALL led to the assessment of gene expression profiles of stromal cells and ALL cells. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways associated with metabolism and redox reactions as potentially important in the stromal cell: leukemia cell interaction. Exploratory imaging studies demonstrated bidirectional transfer of intracellular calcien-labelled molecules and also bidirectional transfer of mitochondria between stromal cells and ALL cells, providing potential means of metabolic interdependence of stromal cells and ALL cells.","['Usmani, Sana', 'Sivagnanalingam, Urmila', 'Tkachenko, Olena', 'Nunez, Leti', 'Shand, Jessica C', 'Mullen, Craig A']","['Usmani S', 'Sivagnanalingam U', 'Tkachenko O', 'Nunez L', 'Shand JC', 'Mullen CA']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY 14620, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190322,Greece,Oncol Lett,Oncology letters,101531236,,,,PMC6507394,2019/06/13 06:00,2019/06/13 06:01,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/ol.2019.10188 [doi]', 'OL-0-0-10188 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Lett. 2019 Jun;17(6):5039-5049. doi: 10.3892/ol.2019.10188.

To determine whether the expression of the long non-coding (lnc)RNA zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) antisense RNA 1 (ZEB2-AS1) is associated with clinical outcomes, its expression was analyzed in a retrospective cohort of 62 AML and 10 non-malignant cases. The results revealed that the expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA was notably high and closely associated with adverse clinical outcomes in AML cases compared with the non-malignant cases, based on either modified Medical Research Council or European Leukemia Net risk stratification systems. Univariate analyses indicated that patients with a higher expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA had significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P=0.036) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates (P=0.039) compared with patients with a lower expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA. In addition, patients with a higher expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA had a significant lower complete remission rate in response to induction by chemotherapy compared with patients with a lower expression of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA (P=0.031). In cases with low levels of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA, patients treated with allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation had significantly longer OS and DFS rates compared with that of chemotherapy-treated patients (P=0.037 and P=0.049 respectively). Furthermore, the knockdown of ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA effectively inhibited AML cell invasion and migration, which was closely associated with the downregulation of ZEB2 and upregulation of E-cadherin expression. Collectively, although its independent prognostic value for survival was not rigorously determined, ZEB2-AS1 lncRNA may function as a candidate marker to improve conventional risk stratification systems and the evaluation of therapeutic responses for AML.","['Shi, Xiaolan', 'Li, Jiao', 'Ma, Liang', 'Wen, Lijun', 'Wang, Qinrong', 'Yao, Hong', 'Ruan, Changgeng', 'Wu, Depei', 'Zhang, Xinyou', 'Chen, Suning']","['Shi X', 'Li J', 'Ma L', 'Wen L', 'Wang Q', 'Yao H', 'Ruan C', 'Wu D', 'Zhang X', 'Chen S']",,"['Department of Hematology, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Thrombosis and Hemostasis of Ministry of Health, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.R.

Various solid tumors, most notably breast cancer, can also metastasize into the CNS as a late stage complication causing devastating effects. Intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy consisting of methotrexate, cytarabine, or the two in combination is frequently used for the prophylaxis and treatment of CNS metastasis. Because of the high toxicity of these chemotherapeutic agents, however, their side effect profiles are potentially catastrophic. The incidence of neurotoxicity secondary to IT chemotherapy is well defined in the pediatric literature but is poorly reported in adults. Here, we investigated the incidence of neurologic and nonneurologic side effects secondary to IT chemotherapy in 109 consecutive adult patients over a two-year time period at hospitals associated with our institution. Of 355 IT chemotherapy treatments received by these patients, 11 (3.10%) resulted in paresthesias or paralysis, which we defined as significant neurologic events in our analysis. We also examined minor events that arose after IT chemotherapy, including back pain, headache, fever, vomiting, and asthenia. At least one of these occurred after 30.70% of IT chemotherapy doses. Clinicians involved in the care of patients receiving IT chemotherapy should be aware of these findings and consider treatment options lower rate of neurotoxicity such as high-dose systemic methotrexate.","['Byrnes, Diana M', 'Vargas, Fernando', 'Dermarkarian, Christopher', 'Kahn, Ryan', 'Kwon, Deukwoo', 'Hurley, Judith', 'Schatz, Jonathan H']","['Byrnes DM', 'Vargas F', 'Dermarkarian C', 'Kahn R', 'Kwon D', 'Hurley J', 'Schatz JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0781-7577', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4283-2070', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1842-228X']","['Hematology-Oncology Fellowship Program, Department of Medicine, Jackson Memorial Hospital, USA.', 'Miami Cancer Institute, Baptist Health South Florida, USA.', 'University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, USA.', 'University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, USA.', 'Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Core, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190502,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,PMC6521528,2019/06/13 06:00,2019/06/13 06:01,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/4047617 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 May 2;2019:4047617. doi: 10.1155/2019/4047617. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We performed proteomic profiling of CSF before and after the treatment of six sporadic paediatric patients diagnosed as ALL with central nervous system (CNS) involvement. CSF samples were properly processed and analyzed through the use of label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Results: Among identified 428 unique proteins in all CSF samples, we quantified 10 altered proteins with diverse biological functions after induction chemotherapy. Conclusions: The levels of those 10 proteins change during the treatment of CNSL. Some of the proteins are likely to play a vital biological role as biomarkers for the development of ALL. In addition, our results indicated the feasible and reproducible utility of CSF for diagnosis and prognosis of patients with CNSL.","['Mo, Fei', 'Ma, Xuelei', 'Liu, Xiaobei', 'Zhou, Ruofan', 'Zhao, Yunuo', 'Zhou, Hui']","['Mo F', 'Ma X', 'Liu X', 'Zhou R', 'Zhao Y', 'Zhou H']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9148-5001'],"['Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190502,Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,PMC6521476,2019/06/13 06:00,2019/06/13 06:01,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/13 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3283629 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 May 2;2019:3283629. doi: 10.1155/2019/3283629. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the herein identified 36 SHM target genes stratified DLBCL into four novel SHM subtypes. In a meta-analysis of patients with DLBCL treated with immunochemotherapy, the SHM subtypes were significantly associated with overall survival (1642 patients) and progression-free survival (795 patients). Multivariate analysis of survival indicated that the prognostic impact of the SHM subtypes is independent from the COO classification and the International Prognostic Index. Furthermore, the SHM subtypes had a distinct clinical outcome within each of the COO subtypes, and strikingly, even within unclassified DLBCL. The genetic landscape of the four SHM subtypes indicated unique associations with driver alterations and oncogenic signaling in DLBCL, which suggests a possibility for therapeutic exploitation.

Here, we integrate mRNA sequencing, ribosome footprinting, polysomal RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry datasets from a mouse lymphoid cell model to characterize the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) associated ribosomal RPL10 R98S mutation. Surprisingly, RPL10 R98S induces changes in protein levels primarily through transcriptional rather than translation efficiency changes. Phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPH), encoding a key serine biosynthesis enzyme, was the only gene with elevated transcription and translation leading to protein overexpression. PSPH upregulation is a general phenomenon in T-ALL patient samples, associated with elevated serine and glycine levels in xenograft mice. Reduction of PSPH expression suppresses proliferation of T-ALL cell lines and their capacity to expand in mice. We identify ribosomal mutation driven induction of serine biosynthesis and provide evidence supporting dependence of T-ALL cells on PSPH.","['Kampen, Kim R', 'Fancello, Laura', 'Girardi, Tiziana',

Still, little is known about the determinants of these factors. We show that LIF assumes a crucial role in the regulation of CD8(+) T cell tumor infiltration, while promoting the presence of protumoral tumor-associated macrophages. We observe that the blockade of LIF in tumors expressing high levels of LIF decreases CD206, CD163 and CCL2 and induces CXCL9 expression in tumor-associated macrophages. The blockade of LIF releases the epigenetic silencing of CXCL9 triggering CD8(+) T cell tumor infiltration. The combination of LIF neutralizing antibodies with the inhibition of the PD1 immune checkpoint promotes tumor regression, immunological memory and an increase in overall survival.","['Pascual-Garcia,

Arsenic trioxide (ATO), which has been proved to successfully treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), was recently reported to show therapeutic potential in solid tumors including HCC. However, its anticancer mechanisms in HCC still need further investigation. In this study, we demonstrated that ATO inhibits tumorigenesis and distant metastasis in mouse models, corresponding with a prolonged mice survival time. Also, ATO was found to significantly decrease the cancer stem cell (CSC)-associated traits. Minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM) 7 was further identified to be a potential target suppressed dramatically by ATO, of which protein expression is increased in patients and significantly correlated with tumor size, cellular differentiation, portal venous emboli, and poor patient survival. Moreover, MCM7 knockdown recapitulates the effects of ATO on CSCs and metastasis, while ectopic expression of MCM7 abolishes them. Mechanistically, our results suggested that ATO suppresses MCM7 transcription by targeting serum response factor (SRF)/MCM7 complex, which functions as an important transcriptional regulator modulating MCM7 expression. Taken together, our findings highlight the importance of ATO in the treatment of solid tumors. The identification of SRF/MCM7 complex as a target of ATO provides new insights into ATO's mechanism, which may benefit the appropriate use of this agent in the treatment of HCC.","['Wang, Hai-Yang',

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of female patients proceeding with a planned pregnancy were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 17 patients with CML who achieved at least a major molecular response (MMR) during imatinib (n = 13) or nilotinib (n = 4) therapy prior to a planned pregnancy were enrolled. At the time of TKI interruption, six were in MMR, two in molecular response 4 (MR(4)), and nine in molecular response 4.5 (MR(4.5)). TKI therapy was discontinued 6 weeks (range, 2-15 weeks) before conception in 4 patients and at gestational age of 4 weeks (range, 2-5 weeks) after determination of pregnancy in 13 patients. Apart from 1 patient who suffered a spontaneous abortion, 16 patients delivered uneventfully. A total of 10 patients lost MMR after stopping TKIs; 8 lost molecular response 2, and 3 lost complete hematological response. Log-rank analyses showed achieving MR(4) (p = .030) or MR(4.5) (p = .031), complete cytogenetic response duration >/=3.5 years (p = .049), and MMR duration >/=3.5 years (p = .040) were significantly associated with longer MMR-failure-free survival during TKI interruption. CONCLUSION: Planned pregnancy might be pragmatic in female patients with CML on TKIs. Achieving deep molecular response and, importantly, MMR duration >/=3.5 years were significantly associated with maintaining MMR during pregnancy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Female patients with chronic myeloid leukemia on tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) wishing to conceive are currently advised to discontinue TKIs before conception. However, the ideal degree and duration of response before stopping TKI, in addition to whether there will be any adverse effect caused by a short exposure of TKI, is unknown. Data of 17 female patients, who achieved at least a major molecular response (MMR) before TKI interruption, was revised, and it was found that achieving deep molecular response and MMR duration >/=3.5 years was significantly associated with maintaining MMR during pregnancy. This provides direct evidence for a planned pregnancy strategy, and stopping TKI immediately after determination of pregnancy in female patients might be pragmatic.","['Dou, Xuelin', 'Qin, Yazhen', 'Huang, Xiaojun', 'Jiang, Qian']","['Dou X', 'Qin Y', 'Huang X', 'Jiang Q']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, National Clinical Research Center for Hematologic Disease, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China jiangqian@medmail.com.cn."", ""Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, Suzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190611,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6853119,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2019-0109 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0109 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2019 Nov;24(11):e1141-e1147. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2019-0109.

Imbalanced Notch signaling leads to developmental disorders and cancer. To fully characterize the Notch signaling pathway and exploit it in novel therapeutic interventions, a comprehensive view on the regulation and requirements of Notch signaling is needed. Notch is regulated at different levels, ranging from ligand binding, stability to endocytosis. Using an array of different techniques, including reporter gene assays, immunocytochemistry, and ChIP-qPCR we show here, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, regulation of Notch signaling at the level of the nuclear pore. We found that the nuclear pore protein Nup214 (nucleoporin 214) and its interaction partner Nup88 negatively regulate Notch signaling in vitro and in vivo in zebrafish. In mammalian cells, loss of Nup88/214 inhibited nuclear export of recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappaJ region (RBP-J), the DNA-binding component of the Notch pathway. This inhibition increased binding of RBP-J to its cognate promoter regions, resulting in increased downstream Notch signaling. Interestingly, we also found that NUP214 fusion proteins, causative for certain cases of T-cell acute lymphatic leukemia, potentially contribute to tumorigenesis via a Notch-dependent mechanism. In summary, the nuclear pore components Nup88/214 suppress Notch signaling in vitro, and in zebrafish, nuclear RBP-J levels are rate-limiting factors for Notch signaling in mammalian cells, and regulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of RBP-J may contribute to fine-tuning Notch activity in cells.","['Kindermann, Bastian', 'Valkova, Christina', 'Kramer, Andreas', 'Perner, Birgit', 'Engelmann, Christian', 'Behrendt, Laura', 'Kritsch, Daniel', 'Jungnickel, Berit', 'Kehlenbach, Ralph H', 'Oswald, Franz', 'Englert, Christoph', 'Kaether, Christoph']","['Kindermann B', 'Valkova C', 'Kramer A', 'Perner B', 'Engelmann C', 'Behrendt L', 'Kritsch D', 'Jungnickel B', 'Kehlenbach RH', 'Oswald F', 'Englert C', 'Kaether C']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4920-9916', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6874-2276']","['Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Biochemie und Biophysik, Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Biochemie und Biophysik, Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Universitatsmedizin Gottingen, 37073 Gottingen, Germany.', 'Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Zentrum fur Innere Medizin, Abteilung fur Innere Medizin I, 89081 Ulm, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Institut fur Biochemie und Biophysik, Friedrich Schiller Universitat Jena, 07745 Jena, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institut fur Alternsforschung-Fritz Lipmann Institut, 07745 Jena, Germany ckaether@fli-leibniz.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190611,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein)', '0 (Morpholinos)', '0 (NUP214 protein, human)', '0 (NUP88 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (RBPJ protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin J Recombination Signal Sequence-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Morpholinos/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor HES-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Zebrafish/metabolism', 'Zebrafish Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6682737,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)30217-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.006357 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Aug 2;294(31):11741-11750. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.006357.

Here, we report the purification of murine leukemia virus (MLV) genomic RNA to homogeneity and show that this viral RNA contains levels of N (6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A), 5-methylcytosine (m(5)C), and 2'O-methylated (Nm) ribonucleotides that are an order of magnitude higher than detected on bulk cellular mRNAs. Mapping of m(6)A and m(5)C residues on MLV transcripts identified multiple discrete editing sites and allowed the construction of MLV variants bearing silent mutations that removed a subset of these sites. Analysis of the replication potential of these mutants revealed a modest but significant attenuation in viral replication in 3T3 cells in culture. Consistent with a positive role for m(6)A and m(5)C in viral replication, we also demonstrate that overexpression of the key m(6)A reader protein YTHDF2 enhances MLV replication, while downregulation of the m(5)C writer NSUN2 inhibits MLV replication.IMPORTANCE The data presented in the present study demonstrate that MLV RNAs bear an exceptionally high level of the epitranscriptomic modifications m(6)A, m(5)C, and Nm, suggesting that these each facilitate some aspect of the viral replication cycle. Consistent with this hypothesis, we demonstrate that mutational removal of a subset of these m(6)A or m(5)C modifications from MLV transcripts inhibits MLV replication in cis, and a similar result was also observed upon manipulation of the level of expression of key cellular epitranscriptomic cofactors in trans Together, these results argue that the addition of several different epitranscriptomic modifications to viral transcripts stimulates viral gene expression and suggest that MLV has therefore evolved to maximize the level of these modifications that are added to viral RNAs.","['Courtney, David G', 'Chalem, Andrea', 'Bogerd, Hal P', 'Law, Brittany A', 'Kennedy, Edward M', 'Holley, Christopher L', 'Cullen, Bryan R']","['Courtney DG', 'Chalem A', 'Bogerd HP', 'Law BA', 'Kennedy EM', 'Holley CL', 'Cullen BR']",,"['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA bryan.cullen@duke.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190611,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*chemistry', 'Cytosine/*chemistry', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/physiology', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",PMC6561033,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.01209-19 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01209-19 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2019 Jun 11;10(3). pii: mBio.01209-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01209-19.,3,"['U54 AI150470/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA046111/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI124973/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007101/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 GM103297/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Courtney et al.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*RNA editing', '*epitranscriptomic', '*murine leukemia virus', '*posttranscriptional gene regulation', '*retrovirus']",,['Cell Host Microbe. 2019 Aug 14;26(2):154-155.

In particular, SERINC5 inhibits the infectivity of progeny virions when incorporated. SERINC3 and SERINC5 are also counteracted by the unrelated murine leukemia virus glycosylated Gag (glycoGag) protein, which possesses a potent Nef-like activity on HIV-1 infectivity. We now report that a minimal glycoGag termed glycoMA can fully substitute for Nef in promoting HIV-1 replication in Jurkat T lymphoid cells, indicating that Nef enhances replication in these cells mainly by counteracting SERINCs. In contrast, the SERINC antagonist glycoMA was unable to substitute for Nef in MOLT-3 T lymphoid cells, in which HIV-1 replication was highly dependent on Nef, and remained so even in the absence of SERINC3 and SERINC5. As in MOLT-3 cells, glycoMA was unable to substitute for Nef in stimulating HIV-1 replication in primary human cells. Although the ability of Nef mutants to promote HIV-1 replication in MOLT-3 cells correlated with the ability to engage endocytic machinery and to downregulate CD4, Nef nevertheless rescued virus replication under conditions where CD4 downregulation did not occur. Taken together, our observations raise the possibility that Nef triggers the endocytosis of a novel antiviral factor that is active against both laboratory-adapted and primary HIV-1 strains.IMPORTANCE The Nef protein of HIV-1 and the unrelated glycoGag protein of a murine leukemia virus similarly prevent the uptake of antiviral host proteins called SERINC3 and SERINC5 into HIV-1 particles, which enhances their infectiousness. We now show that although both SERINC antagonists can in principle similarly enhance HIV-1 replication, glycoGag is unable to substitute for Nef in primary human cells and in a T cell line called MOLT-3. In MOLT-3 cells, Nef remained crucial for HIV-1 replication even in the absence of SERINC3 and SERINC5. The pronounced effect of Nef on HIV-1 spreading in MOLT-3 cells correlated with the ability of Nef to engage cellular endocytic machinery and to downregulate the HIV-1 receptor CD4 but nevertheless persisted in the absence of CD4 downregulation. Collectively, our results provide evidence for a potent novel restriction activity that affects even relatively SERINC-resistant HIV-1 isolates and is counteracted by Nef.","['Wu, Yuanfei', 'Olety, Balaji', 'Weiss, Eric R', 'Popova, Elena', 'Yamanaka, Hikaru', 'Gottlinger, Heinrich']","['Wu Y', 'Olety B', 'Weiss ER', 'Popova E', 'Yamanaka H', 'Gottlinger H']",,"['Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Department of Molecular, Cell and Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA heinrich.gottlinger@umassmed.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190611,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SERINC3 protein, human)', '0 (SERINC5 protein, human)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Glycosylation', 'HIV-1/*genetics/*physiology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Virus Replication/*genetics', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics']",PMC6561029,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.01071-19 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.01071-19 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2019 Jun 11;10(3). pii: mBio.01071-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.01071-19.,3,['R01 AI127263/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,['Copyright (c) 2019 Wu et al.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*Nef', '*SERINC5', '*human immunodeficiency virus', '*infectivity', '*virus replication']",,,,,,,,,,,

The mutational status of NPM1 has strong prognostic relevance to patients with point mutations of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (TKD), but the biological mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the coincidence of NPM1c and FLT3-TKD. Although expression of FLT3-TKD is not sufficient to induce a disease in mice, coexpression with NPM1c rapidly leads to an aggressive myeloproliferative disease in mice with a latency of 31.5 days. Mechanistically, we could show that FLT3-TKD is able to activate the downstream effector molecule signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) exclusively in the presence of mutated NPM1c. Moreover, NPM1c alters the cellular localization of FLT3-TKD from the cell surface to the endoplasmic reticulum, which might thereby lead to the aberrant STAT5 activation. Importantly, aberrant STAT5 activation occurs not only in primary murine cells but also in patients with AML with combined FLT3-TKD and NPM1c mutations. Thus, our data indicate a new mechanism, how NPM1c mislocalizes FLT3-TKD and changes its signal transduction ability.","['Rudorf, Alina', 'Muller, Tony Andreas', 'Klingeberg, Cathrin', 'Kreutmair, Stefanie', 'Poggio, Teresa', 'Gorantla, Sivahari Prasad', 'Ruckert, Tamina', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Gengenbacher, Anina', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Baldus, Claudia', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Bradley, Allan', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Illert, Anna Lena']","['Rudorf A', 'Muller TA', 'Klingeberg C', 'Kreutmair S', 'Poggio T', 'Gorantla SP', 'Ruckert T', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Gengenbacher A', 'Paschka P', 'Baldus C', 'Zeiser R', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Bradley A', 'Duyster J', 'Illert AL']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2560-8488', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5082-7979']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department for Pathology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany; and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Haematological Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center and German Cancer Consortium, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190611,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Gene Duplication', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Transport', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6659255,2019/06/13 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/06/13 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42386-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2018883140 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Jul 25;134(4):383-388. doi: 10.1182/blood.2018883140.

However, the possibility that the effect of statins may differ by their chemical or pharmacodynamic properties has not been investigated. METHODS: In this nested case-control study, all Manitobans ages >/=40 years when diagnosed with CLL (as a first cancer) from 1999 to 2014 (n = 1,385) were matched (on gender, age, residence, and duration of insurance coverage) to cancer-free controls (n = 6,841). Using conditional logistic regression, statin use was analyzed by individual statins and groups: hydrophilic, low-potency lipophilic (fluvastatin and lovastatin), and high-potency lipophilic statins. RESULTS: Statin users constituted 27% and 28% of the CLL cases and controls, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounding by indication, patterns of healthcare utilization, and use of other drugs, CLL incidence was not associated with use of hydrophilic [odds ratio (OR) = 1.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.86-1.34] or high-potency lipophilic (OR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.79-1.11) statins. Low-potency lipophilic statins were associated with a lower risk of CLL (OR = 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.92), with stronger association (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22-0.88) observed with more regular use (half to full standard dose on average). CONCLUSIONS: We found an association between low-potency lipophilic statin use and reduced CLL risk, with a possible dose-response effect. IMPACT: Although requiring replication in future studies, our findings suggest that the effect of statins on CLL risk may depend on their specific chemical or pharmacodynamic properties.","['Righolt, Christiaan H', 'Zhang, Geng', 'Ye, Xibiao', 'Banerji, Versha', 'Johnston, James B', 'Gibson, Spencer', 'Mahmud, Salaheddin M']","['Righolt CH', 'Zhang G', 'Ye X', 'Banerji V', 'Johnston JB', 'Gibson S', 'Mahmud SM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8472-932X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7415-8818', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6574-0574']","['Department of Community Health Sciences, Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute of Oncology and Hematology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences, Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

However, several studies indicated that PD-L1 is also overexpressed in myeloid malignancies. Successful treatment of the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is likely associated with elimination of the residual disease by the immune system, and possible involvement of PD-L1 in this process remains to be elucidated. We analyzed PD-L1 expression on AML primary cells by flow cytometry and, in parallel, transcript levels were determined for the transcription variants v1 and v2. The ratio of v1/v2 cDNA correlated with the surface protein amount, and high v1/v2 levels were associated with worse overall survival (p = 0.0045). The prognostic impact of PD-L1 was limited to AML with mutated nucleophosmin and concomitant internal tandem duplications in the FLT3 gene (p less than 0.0001 for this particular AML subgroup).","['Brodska, Barbora', 'Otevrelova, Petra', 'Salek, Cyril', 'Fuchs, Ota', 'Gasova, Zdenka', 'Kuzelova, Katerina']","['Brodska B', 'Otevrelova P', 'Salek C', 'Fuchs O', 'Gasova Z', 'Kuzelova K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3703-594X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9520-4935', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9628-6255']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 128 20, Czech Republic. brodska@uhkt.cz.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague 128 20, Czech Republic.

Eight months later he presented with new polydipsia and polyuria, lethargy and easy bruising. A full blood count showed 28% circulating blasts. A bone marrow biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) with additional monosomy 7. Central diabetes insipidus (DI) was diagnosed following a water deprivation test. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a slightly thickened pituitary stalk, stable Rathke's cyst, and new absence of the pituitary bright spot. The patient was commenced on desmopressin and induction chemotherapy, subsequently requiring a bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow examination at 100 days post-transplant revealed cytogenetic remission. All symptoms of DI resolved and magnetic resonance imaging showed return of the posterior bright spot and a pituitary stalk of normal thickness. Biochemical hypogonadotropic hypogonadism persisted but was uninterpretable in the context of systemic illness and recent chemotherapy. DI is a rare complication of haematological malignancies, and the prevalence and pathophysiology of DI in this context are poorly understood. Pathogenic mechanisms proposed include leukaemic infiltration of the pituitary, interference with antidiuretic hormone synthesis, and abnormal thrombopoiesis influencing hormone levels. Particular cytogenetic abnormalities such as inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) and monosomy 7 appear to be more commonly associated with DI and also appear to confer worse outcomes. Aetiologies in the literature remain elusive but as DI is a recognised association of haematological malignancies it should be considered in a patient presenting with polydipsia and polyuria.","['Bardin, Michele', 'Ritchie, David', 'McLachlan, Robert', 'Yates, Christopher J']","['Bardin M', 'Ritchie D', 'McLachlan R', 'Yates CJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3715-9643'],"['Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Monash IVF, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,['ENR1LLB0FP (Deamino Arginine Vasopressin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'Deamino Arginine Vasopressin/therapeutic use', 'Diabetes Insipidus/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/genetics/*pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Monosomy', 'Pituitary Gland/diagnostic imaging']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2018/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.14312 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2019 Jun;49(6):785-788. doi: 10.1111/imj.14312.,6,,,,['(c) 2019 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*diabetes insipidus', '*posterior pituitary']",,['Intern Med J. 2020 May;50(5):646.

Resveratrol (Res) as a phytochemical in grapes and red wine has diverse biological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-cancer. CXCR4 as a chemokine receptor has been found to be upregulated in cancer metastasis and has been used as a prognostic marker in various types of cancer, including leukemia, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. In this study, we focused on the role of DHT in the induction of prostate cancer progression by affecting the AR and CXCR4 pathway. Also, we investigated the inhibition effect of resveratrol on DHT-induced prostate cancer metastasis. In cell viability assay, DHT increased the cell viability of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, on the other hand, Res and its combination with bicalutamide (BCT) as an AR-antagonist or AMD3100 as a CXCR4 inhibitor significantly reduced the cell viability promoted by DHT. Trans-well migration assay and wound healing assay represented the similar results with cell viability assay. According to the results of TUNEL assay, the apoptotic activity was induced by treatment of Res. As results of western blot analysis, the expression of AR, CXCR4, p-PI3K, and p-AKT and the downstream genes related with cell cycle progression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were decreased and the expression of the apoptosis-related genes was increased by treatment of Res and its combination with BCT or AMD3100. This study would suggest that Res and its combination with AR and CXCR4 antagonists can be used in order to suppress the metastatic behaviors of prostate cancer.","['Jang, Yin-Gi', 'Go, Ryu-Eun', 'Hwang, Kyung-A', 'Choi, Kyung-Chul']","['Jang YG', 'Go RE', 'Hwang KA', 'Choi KC']",,"['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Republic of Korea.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, Republic of Korea.

This decision has become more complex with the discovery of new risk factors, such as genomic abnormalities and minimal residual disease, especially in younger populations. Patients younger than age 60 years who are considered fit and who do not harbor poor prognostic features are felt still to have a high likelihood of cure without having to undergo HCT.

The graft-derived donor lymphocytes are capable of eliminating the residual recipient malignant cells in the course of allogeneic immune response, thus decreasing the chances of a relapse of the disease. Foreign peptides of the recipient presented by the MHC molecules are able to elicit the immune response immunologically. These polymorphic peptides are known as minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs). MiHAs occur due to the nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in human genome. Transfusion of T cells specific to MiHAs presented predominantly in the cells of hematopoietic origin will allow the targeted elimination of residual malignant clones avoiding undesirable damage to healthy tissues. To induce the immune response, the donor must be homozygous by the MiHA allele and the recipient must either be homozygous or heterozygous by the alternative MiHA allele. The therapeutic mismatch occurs in 25% of cases under the optimal frequency of allelic variants. Minor antigen ACC-1Y originates from polymorphism in the BCL-2A1 gene; its immunogenic mismatch occurrence approaches the theoretical maximum. In addition, BCL2A1 is overexpressed in cells of various lymphomas. ACC-1Y is presented on allele HLA-A*24:02, which is relatively frequent in the Russian population. Combination of these factors makes the minor antigen ACC-1Y a promising target for immunotherapy. Transfusion of donor CD8^(+) lymphocytes modified with transgenic MiHA-specific TCR is one of the promising methods of posttransplant leukemia therapy and relapse prophylaxis. We obtained a sequence of high-affinity ACC-1Y-specific TCR after the antigen-specific expansion of T cells derived from a healthy ACC-IY^(-/-) donor. We cloned this sequence into the lentiviral vector and obtained the assembled viral particles. Further, we transduced the CD8^(+) lymphocyte culture and demonstrated its antigen-specific cytotoxic activity. It is suggested that CD8^(+) lymphocytes modified by the described method could be potentially transferred to recipients as a therapy against relapse after allo-HSCT.","['Pilunov, A M', 'Kuchmiy, A A', 'Sheetikov, S A', 'Filkin, S Y', 'Romaniuk, D S', 'Rosov, F N', 'Efimov, G A']","['Pilunov AM', 'Kuchmiy AA', 'Sheetikov SA', 'Filkin SY', 'Romaniuk DS', 'Rosov FN', 'Efimov GA']",,"['National Hematology Research Center, Moscow, 125167 Russia.', 'Biological Faculty, Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'a.pilunov@gmail.com.', 'National Hematology Research Center, Moscow, 125167 Russia.', 'National Hematology Research Center, Moscow, 125167 Russia.', 'Biological Faculty, Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'National Hematology Research Center, Moscow, 125167 Russia.', 'National Hematology Research Center, Moscow, 125167 Russia.', 'Biological Faculty, Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991 Russia.', 'National Hematology Research Center, Moscow, 125167 Russia.', 'Biological Faculty, Moscow State University, Moscow, 119991 Russia.']",['rus'],['Journal Article'],,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Allografts', '*Cell Engineering', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Russia', 'Secondary Prevention/methods', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/*metabolism']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1134/S0026898419030145 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2019 May-Jun;53(3):456-466. doi: 10.1134/S0026898419030145.,3,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['adoptive transfer', 'leukemias', 'lymphocyte modification', 'minor histocompatibility antigens']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An analysis of patient care of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at the Princess Noorah Oncology Center over 25 years was performed. A number of improvements were introduced over time including optimizing the cancer care delivery culture, improving access to care, optimizing supportive care, and refining diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities. Outcomes were evaluated over three time periods (period 1, 1989-2000; period 2, 2001-2007; and period 3, 2008-2014). These findings were compared with results of collaborative clinical trials (CCT). RESULTS: Of the 686 patients treated, the five-year overall survival (OS) rate improved from 74% +/- 2.7% in period 1 to 89.5% +/- 2.3% in period 3 (P < 0.0001). Among all patients, the five-year cumulative incidence of death decreased from 26% in period 1 to 10.5% in period 3 (P < 0.0001). This decrease was mainly due to reduction in the incidence of death from disease (P < 0.00001). In contrast, significant improvement in T-cell ALL survival outcomes (P < 0.0001) was observed overtime (from period 1 to period 3) as a result of significant reduction in both toxic deaths (P = 0.005) and disease-related deaths (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival outcomes in Saudi Arabia have improved with five-year OS rate now approaching 90%. However, further population-based research is needed to understand variance in outcomes from those reported by CCT groups.","['Jastaniah, Wasil']",['Jastaniah W'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-2495-8796'],"['College of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Umm AlQura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Princess Noorah Oncology Center, Ministry of National Guard-Health Affairs, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190611,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cancer Care Facilities/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Delivery of Health Care', 'Developing Countries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Income', 'Male', 'Patient Care Team', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/therapy', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Quality Improvement', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2018/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27782 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Nov;66(11):e27782. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27782.

However, the development of such immunotherapies requires the manufacture of large numbers of T-cells, which remains a major translational and commercial bottleneck due to the manual, small-scale, and often static culturing systems used for their production. Such systems are used because there is an unsubstantiated concern that primary T-cells are shear sensitive, or prefer static conditions, and therefore do not grow as effectively in more scalable, agitated systems, such as stirred-tank bioreactors, as compared with T-flasks and culture bags. In this study, we demonstrate that not only T-cells can be cultivated in an automated stirred-tank bioreactor system (ambr(R) 250), but that their growth is consistently and significantly better than that in T-flask static culture, with equivalent cell quality. Moreover, we demonstrate that at progressively higher agitation rates over the range studied here, and thereby, higher specific power inputs (P/M W kg(-1) ), the higher the final viable T-cell density; that is, a cell density of 4.65 +/- 0.24 x 10(6) viable cells ml(-1) obtained at the highest P/M of 74 x 10(-4) W kg(-1) in comparison with 0.91 +/- 0.07 x 10(6) viable cells ml(-1) at the lowest P/M of 3.1 x 10(-4) W kg(-1) . We posit that this improvement is due to the inability at the lower agitation rates to effectively suspend the Dynabeads(R), which are required to activate the T-cells; and that contact between them is improved at the higher agitation rates. Importantly, from the data obtained, there is no indication that T-cells prefer being grown under static conditions or are sensitive to fluid dynamic stresses within a stirred-tank bioreactor system at the agitation speeds investigated. Indeed, the opposite has proven to be the case, whereby, the cells grow better under higher agitation speeds while maintaining their quality. This study is the first demonstration of primary T-cell ex vivo manufacture activated by Dynabeads(R) in an automated stirred-tank bioreactor system such as the ambr(R) 250 and the findings have the potential to be applied to multiple other cell candidates for advanced therapy applications.","['Costariol, Elena', 'Rotondi, Marco', 'Amini, Arman', 'Hewitt, Christopher J', 'Nienow, Alvin W', 'Heathman, Thomas R J', 'Micheletti, Martina', 'Rafiq, Qasim A']","['Costariol E', 'Rotondi M', 'Amini A', 'Hewitt CJ', 'Nienow AW', 'Heathman TRJ', 'Micheletti M', 'Rafiq QA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3801-5684', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4400-9106']","['Department of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.', 'School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston Medical Research Institute, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston Medical Research Institute, Aston University, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Chemical Engineering, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Hitachi Chemical Advanced Therapeutics Solutions (HCATS), Allendale, New Jersey.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Biochemical Engineering, Advanced Centre for Biochemical Engineering, University College London, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190709,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,IM,"['*Bioreactors', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.27088 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 2019 Oct;116(10):2488-2502. doi: 10.1002/bit.27088.

Eleven untreated first line (1st L) and 47 relapsed/refractory(R/R) CLL patients received IB for 6.6(0.7-46.8) and 16.3(0.4-53.7) months, respectively. Nine percent of 1stL and 10.6% of R/R patients discontinued IB due to AEs. Atrial fibrillation (AF) was the most common discontinuation AE cause (3.5% of patients). Thirteen patients (24.5%) discontinued due to disease progression: 6 Richter transformation (RT) cases, after 10.6 months (1-35.9) and 7 CLL-progression cases, after 30.3 months (5.4-43.4) of IB initiation. IB had minimal impact on immunoglobulin G (IgG)-levels, CLL-related autoimmunity, and second primary malignancies (SPM).

Using the published information on HTLV-1, ATLL and HAM/TSP prevalence, we present comprehensive and accurate maps and tables, and developed an algorithm to assist in the prevention of HTLV-1 transmission through breastfeeding while considering socio-economic status. Latin America is an interesting scenario to study HTLV-1 because of the diverse origin of its population. Apart from the expected high prevalence in inhabitants of African ancestry, the presence of endemic foci affecting indigenous populations is particularly striking. ATLL prevention is the biggest challenge in this field. Most ATLL cases are transmitted through breastfeeding; thus, prevention methods to avoid ATLL in endemic countries have to be focused on this. In view of the high inequality in most Latin American countries, reduction in breastfeeding duration, freezing/thawing and pasteurisation of breastmilk can be suitable interventions in poor settings, considering that avoiding the risk of malnutrition and infant mortality must be the priority.","['Eusebio-Ponce, Emiliana', 'Candel, Francisco Javier', 'Anguita, Eduardo']","['Eusebio-Ponce E', 'Candel FJ', 'Anguita E']",,"['Research Department, Universidad Iberoamericana, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Department, Transplant Coordination Unit, IdISSC and IML Institutes, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Study Group of Infections in Emergency Departments (Infurgsemes, SEMES), Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM), Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Instituto de Medicina de Laboratorio (IML), Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria San Carlos (IdISSC), Hospital Clinico San Carlos, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190709,England,Trop Med Int Health,Tropical medicine & international health : TM & IH,9610576,,IM,"['HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Latin America/epidemiology']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tmi.13278 [doi]'],ppublish,Trop Med Int Health. 2019 Aug;24(8):934-953. doi: 10.1111/tmi.13278.

CD47 is also expressed on RBCs. Here, we report our experience of the RBC effects and the impact on blood bank testing and transfusion management in a Phase 1 trial of the humanized anti-CD47 monoclonal antibody Hu5F9-G4 in relapsed or primary refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (NCT02678338). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Nineteen patients with relapsed or primary refractory AML treated across five UK centers were included for analysis. Patients received escalating doses of Hu5F9-G4. Serial laboratory data were collected to evaluate impact on hemoglobin (Hb), markers of hemolysis (bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase, reticulocyte count), transfusion requirements, and blood compatibility testing. RESULTS: A decline in Hb was observed with drug administration (median Hb change, -1.0 g/dL; range, 0.4-1.6) with associated increase in transfusion requirements. Patients responded to transfusion with a median Hb increment per unit of 1.0 g/dL. RBC agglutination was seen in all cases without associated change in Hb, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, or reticulocyte count. Nine of 19 (47%) patients developed a newly positive antibody screen with a pan-agglutinin identified in plasma. Invalid ABO blood grouping occurred in 4 of 12 (33%) non-group O patients due to anomalous reactivity in the reverse ABO-type results. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with Hu5F9-G4 in patients with AML resulted in an Hb decline and increased transfusion requirements.

Besides the development of several herbal medicine-derived anti-cancer agents, such as paclitaxel, vincristine and podophyllotoxin, many recent laboratory findings demonstrated that brusatol, a quassinoid from the seeds of Brucea sumatrana, exhibits potent tumor suppressing effect with improved disease outcome. Our recent finding further demonstrated that brusatol synergizes with the intrinsic metabolic burden in cancer cells. Main body: Here, we summarized the recent investigations of brusatol as an experimental therapeutic for human malignancies, such as leukemia, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and brain tumor. We also discussed the molecular target brusatol, with a focus on the Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2)-guided gene transcription, as well as glutathione de novo synthesis. Further, we discussed the challenges and future applications of brusatol for cancer therapy. Conclusion: In conclusion, we believe increasing evidences have shown the value of brusatol as a novel strategy for cancer treatment, which may indicate future drug development and clinical translation.","['Cai, Sabrina J', 'Liu, Yang', 'Han, Sue', 'Yang, Chunzhang']","['Cai SJ', 'Liu Y', 'Han S', 'Yang C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6433-0867'],"['Neuro-Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Building 37, Room 1142E, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.0000 0004 0483 9129grid.417768.b', 'Neuro-Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Building 37, Room 1142E, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.0000 0004 0483 9129grid.417768.b', 'Neuro-Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Building 37, Room 1142E, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.0000 0004 0483 9129grid.417768.b', 'Neuro-Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Building 37, Room 1142E, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA.0000 0004 0483 9129grid.417768.b']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190606,England,Cell Biosci,Cell & bioscience,101561195,,,,PMC6554866,2019/06/12 06:00,2019/06/12 06:01,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13578-019-0309-8 [doi]', '309 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Biosci. 2019 Jun 6;9:45. doi: 10.1186/s13578-019-0309-8. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Brusatol', 'Cancer', 'NRF2', 'Oxidative stress', 'Synthetic lethality']",['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

The intestinal amebiasis in patients with acute leukemia of novo, after the start of chemotherapy (CT) in the Hematology Service of the CMN 20 de Noviembre is 12%, even if patients show a negative baseline coprological test. Objective: To find out if the administration of tinidazole, in patients with acute leukemia and negative coprological test, at the beginning of the CT, decreases the incidence of amoebic colitis during the induction to remission. Method: Prospective and not comparative study. Patients with de novo diagnosis of acute leukemia who initiate induction and initial coprological CT. Tinidazole was indicated, 2 g/day for 5 days in the first week of CT started. They were monitored until the induction was concluded and hematopoietic recovery started. Results: 38 patients, 15 women and 23 men with a mean age of 44 years (16-72), with acute lymphoblastic leukemia 19, myeloblastic 16 and promyelocytic 3. Cases without and with intestinal amebiasis were 35 and 3, respectively. Patients with amebiasis only received tinidazole for 3 days and it was given 2 days after the CT started. Conclusion: Tinidazole, in patients with acute de novo leukemia who initiate induction CT, is effective in the prevention of intestinal amebiasis, during the induction stage, if administered at 2 g/day, for five days, starting on day 1 of the CT.","['Arana-Luna, Luara Luz', 'Alvarez-Vera, Jose Luis', 'de la Pena-Celaya, Jose Antonio', 'Mena-Zepeda, Veronica', 'Ortiz-Zepeda, Maricela', 'Espitia-Rios, Maria Eugenia', 'Zuniga, Juan Manuel Perez', 'Alvarado-Ibarra, Martha']","['Arana-Luna LL', 'Alvarez-Vera JL', 'de la Pena-Celaya JA', 'Mena-Zepeda V', 'Ortiz-Zepeda M', 'Espitia-Rios ME', 'Zuniga JMP', 'Alvarado-Ibarra M']",,"['Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, Instituto de Seguridad y Servicios Sociales de los Trabajadores del Estado, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],,Mexico,Gac Med Mex,Gaceta medica de Mexico,0010333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '033KF7V46H (Tinidazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Colitis/complications/*parasitology/*prevention & control', 'Dysentery, Amebic/complications/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tinidazole/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/01/17 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/17 06:00 [medline]']","['j155/S1/S32 [pii]', '10.24875/GMM.19005135 [doi]']",ppublish,Gac Med Mex. 2019;155(Suppl 1):S32-S37. doi: 10.24875/GMM.19005135.,Suppl 1,,,,['Copyright: (c) 2019 SecretarIa de Salud.'],['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Amebiasis', 'Chemotherapy', 'Leucemia aguda', 'Quimioterapia', 'Tinidazol', 'Tinidazole']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study characterizes the role of CALCRL in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We analyzed CALCRL expression in collectively more than 1500 well-characterized AML patients from five international cohorts (AMLCG, HOVON, TCGA, Leucegene, and UKM) and evaluated associations with survival. In the AMLCG analytic cohort, increasing transcript levels of CALCRL were associated with decreasing complete remission rates (71.5%, 53.7%, 49.6% for low, intermediate, high CALCRL expression), 5-year overall (43.1%, 26.2%, 7.1%), and event-free survival (29.9%, 15.8%, 4.7%) (all P < 0.001). CALCRL levels remained associated with all endpoints on multivariable regression analyses. The prognostic impact was confirmed in all validation sets. Genes highly expressed in CALCRL(high) AML were significantly enriched in leukemic stem cell signatures and CALCRL levels were positively linked to the engraftment capacity of primary patient samples in immunocompromised mice. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of CALCRL significantly impaired colony formation in human myeloid leukemia cell lines. Overall, our study demonstrates that CALCRL predicts outcome beyond existing risk factors and is a potential therapeutic target in AML.","['Angenendt, Linus', 'Bormann, Eike', 'Pabst, Caroline',

Regulation of microRNA (miR)-dependent gene expression and mRNA splicing play significant roles in MM pathogenesis; however, to date an interplay between these processes is not yet delineated. Here we investigated miR-mediated regulation of splicing networks at the transcriptome level. Our studies show that a significant number (78%) of miRs which are either up- or down-regulated in patient CD138+ MM cells, but not in healthy donors (HD) CD138+ plasma cells (PC), target genes involved in early stages of pre-mRNA splicing. We also identified deregulated miRs that target core splicing factors (SF) and modifiers (SM, enhancers/silencers) which cause altered splicing in MM. Our studies suggest that Let-7f, in combination other miRs which are frequently and significantly deregulated in patients with overt MM, targets genes that regulate intron excision. Importantly, deregulated expression of certain miRs in MM promote increased intron retention, a novel characteristic of the MM genome, by inducing deregulated expression of the genes that regulate the splicing network.

Although FMOD has been considered as a cytoplasmic or secretory protein, we discovered the cell surface expression of FMOD in leukemic B cells via anchoring with glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate FMOD as a new biomarker in CLL patients in comparison with healthy individuals. METHODS: A monoclonal antibody was generated against human FMOD. The cell surface expression of FMOD in 52 CLL patients and 45 healthy individuals were compared by flow cytometry. A bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was used to determine the cell surface localization of FMOD using ELISA and flow cytometry techniques. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) was used to detect apoptosis induction in CLL PBMCs following in vitro incubation with anti-FMOD mAb. RESULTS: The results demonstrated the widespread cell surface expression of GPI-anchored FMOD in CLL patients (median: 79.9 %), although healthy individuals had low FMOD expression (median: 6.2 %) (p</=0.0001). The cut-off value of FMOD expression was estimated with high sensitivity and specificity at 17.9 %. Furthermore, in vitro apoptosis induction of leukemic cells following incubation with anti-FMOD mAb showed a direct apoptosis of CLL cells (27.9%) with very low effect on healthy PBMCs (6%). CONCLUSION: The membrane-anchoring of FMOD by means of a GPI moiety in leukemic cells supports FMOD as a highly potential diagnostic and therapeutic target in CLL patients.","['Farahi, Lia', 'Ghaemimanesh, Fatemeh', 'Milani, Saeideh', 'Razavi, Seyed Mohsen', 'Hadavi, Reza', 'Bayat, Ali Ahmad', 'Salimi, Ali', 'Akhondi, Mohammad Mehdi', 'Rabbani, Hodjattallah']","['Farahi L', 'Ghaemimanesh F', 'Milani S', 'Razavi SM', 'Hadavi R', 'Bayat AA', 'Salimi A', 'Akhondi MM', 'Rabbani H']",,"['Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '126468-95-9 (Fibromodulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Fibromodulin/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Binding', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['04 [pii]', '10.22034/IJI.2019.80256 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2019 Jun;16(2):127-141. doi: 10.22034/IJI.2019.80256.,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch signals delivered during the first 48 h after transplantation drive proinflammatory cytokine production in conventional T cells (Tconv) and inhibit the expansion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Short-term Notch inhibition induces long-term GVHD protection. However, it remains unknown whether Notch blockade blunts GVHD through its effects on Tconv, Tregs, or both and what early Notch-regulated molecular events occur in alloantigen-specific T cells. To address these questions, we engineered T cell grafts to achieve selective Notch blockade in Tconv versus Tregs and evaluated their capacity to trigger GVHD in mice. Notch blockade in Tconv was essential for GVHD protection as GVHD severity was similar in the recipients of wild-type Tconv combined with Notch-deprived versus wild-type Tregs. To identify the impact of Notch signaling on the earliest steps of T cell activation in vivo, we established a new acute GVHD model mediated by clonal alloantigen-specific 4C CD4(+) Tconv. Notch-deprived 4C T cells had preserved early steps of activation, IL-2 production, proliferation, and Th cell polarization. In contrast, Notch inhibition dampened IFN-gamma and IL-17 production, diminished mTORC1 and ERK1/2 activation, and impaired transcription of a subset of Myc-regulated genes. The distinct Notch-regulated signature had minimal overlap with known Notch targets in T cell leukemia and developing T cells, highlighting the specific impact of Notch signaling in mature T cells. Our findings uncover a unique molecular program associated with the pathogenic effects of Notch in T cells at the earliest stages of GVHD.","['Chung, Jooho', 'Radojcic, Vedran', 'Perkey, Eric', 'Parnell, Timothy J', 'Niknafs, Yashar', 'Jin, Xi', 'Friedman, Ann', 'Labrecque, Nathalie', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Brennan, Todd V', 'Siebel, Christian W', 'Maillard, Ivan']","['Chung J', 'Radojcic V', 'Perkey E', 'Parnell TJ', 'Niknafs Y', 'Jin X', 'Friedman A', 'Labrecque N', 'Blazar BR', 'Brennan TV', 'Siebel CW', 'Maillard I']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9699-1157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3632-3691', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7563-1542', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9608-9841', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5940-5262', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1312-6748']","['Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute Bioinformatic Analysis Shared Resource, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Centre de Recherche Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H1T 2M4, Canada.', 'Departement de Medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T IJ4, Canada.', 'Departement de Microbiologie, Infectiologie et Immunologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec H3T IJ4, Canada.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455.', 'Comprehensive Transplant Center, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA 90048.', 'Genentech, South San Francisco, CA 94080; and.', 'Life Sciences Institute, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109; imaillar@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190610,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Receptors, Notch/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",PMC6615974,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900192 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900192 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Jul 15;203(2):557-568. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900192.

We sought to define the functional and clinical significance of distinct KIT mutations in CBF pediatric AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Following transfection of exon 17 (E17) and exon 8 (E8) mutations into HEK293 and Ba/F3 cells, KIT phosphorylation, cytokine-independent growth, and response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) were evaluated. Clinical outcomes of patients treated on COG AAML0531 (NCT01407757), a phase III study of gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), were analyzed according to mutation status [KIT (+) vs. wild-type KIT (KIT (-))] and mutation location (E8 vs. E17). RESULTS: KIT mutations were detected in 63 of 205 patients (31%); 22 (35%) involved only E8, 32 (51%) only E17, 6 (10%) both exons, and 3 (5%) alternative exons. Functional studies demonstrated that E17, but not E8, mutations result in aberrant KIT phosphorylation and growth. TKI exposure significantly affected growth of E17, but not E8, transfected cells. Patients with KIT (+) CBF AML had overall survival similar to those with KIT (-) (78% vs. 81%, P = 0.905) but higher relapse rates (RR = 43% vs. 21%; P = 0.005). E17 KIT (+) outcomes were inferior to KIT (-) patients [disease-free survival (DFS), 51% vs. 73%, P = 0.027; RR = 21% vs. 46%, P = 0.007)], although gemtuzumab ozogamicin abrogated this negative prognostic impact. E8 mutations lacked significant prognostic effect, and GO failed to significantly improve outcome. CONCLUSIONS: E17 mutations affect prognosis in CBF AML, as well as response to GO and TKIs; thus, clinical trials using both agents should be considered for KIT (+) patients.","['Tarlock, Katherine', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Ries, Rhonda', 'Loken, Michael R', 'Pardo, Laura', 'Hylkema, Tiffany', 'Joaquin, Jason', 'Sarukkai, Leela', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Bernstein, Irwin', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Pollard, Jessica A']","['Tarlock K', 'Alonzo TA', 'Wang YC', 'Gerbing RB', 'Ries R', 'Loken MR', 'Pardo L', 'Hylkema T', 'Joaquin J', 'Sarukkai L', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch B', 'Sung L', 'Aplenc R', 'Bernstein I', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S', 'Pollard JA']",,"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.

Recent evidence has revealed a close association of periodontitis with atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction, and disruption of the microcirculation. However, the association between HTLV-1 and advanced periodontitis has not been investigated to date. Since hematopoietic activity is closely linked to endothelial maintenance activity and is known to decline with age, we hypothesized that the state of hematopoietic activity influenced the association between HTLV-1 and advanced periodontitis in elderly participants. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed including 822 elderly participants aged 60-99 years who participated in a dental health check-up. Advanced periodontitis was defined as a periodontal pocket >/= 6.0 mm. Participants were classified as having low or high hematopoietic activity according to the median values of reticulocytes. RESULTS: HTLV-1 infection was positively related to advanced periodontitis among participants with lower hematopoietic activity (lower reticulocyte count), but not among participants with higher hematopoietic activity (higher reticulocyte count). The adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) considering potential confounding factors was 1.92 (1.05-3.49) for participants with a lower reticulocyte count and 0.69 (0.35-1.36) for participants with a higher reticulocyte count. CONCLUSIONS: Among elderly participants, the association between HTLV-1 infection and advanced periodontitis is influenced by hematopoietic activity. Since hematopoietic activity is associated with endothelial maintenance, these findings provide an efficient tool for clarifying the underlying mechanism of the progression of periodontitis among elderly participants.","['Shimizu, Yuji', 'Yamanashi, Hirotomo', 'Kitamura, Masayasu', 'Furugen, Reiko', 'Iwasaki, Takahiro', 'Fukuda, Hideki', 'Hayashida, Hideaki', 'Kawasaki, Koji', 'Kiyoura, Kairi', 'Kawashiri, Shin-Ya', 'Saito, Toshiyuki', 'Kawakami, Atsushi', 'Maeda, Takahiro']","['Shimizu Y', 'Yamanashi H', 'Kitamura M', 'Furugen R', 'Iwasaki T', 'Fukuda H', 'Hayashida H', 'Kawasaki K', 'Kiyoura K', 'Kawashiri SY', 'Saito T', 'Kawakami A', 'Maeda T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3381-9288'],"['Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan. shimizu@osaka-ganjun.jp.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention, Osaka Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases Prevention, Osaka, Japan. shimizu@osaka-ganjun.jp.', 'Department of General Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Community Oral Health, School of Dentistry, Asahi University, Gifu, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Community Medical Network Center, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Health, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology and Rheumatology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki-shi, Sakamoto 1-12-4, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of General Medicine, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Island and Community Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190610,England,Environ Health Prev Med,Environmental health and preventive medicine,9609642,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*physiopathology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Periodontitis/*epidemiology/virology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6558682,2019/06/12 06:00,2019/11/02 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12199-019-0796-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12199-019-0796-6 [pii]']",epublish,Environ Health Prev Med. 2019 Jun 10;24(1):42. doi: 10.1186/s12199-019-0796-6.,1,"['18K06448/the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science', '17H03740/the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Elderly participants', 'HTLV-1', 'Hematopoietic activity', 'Periodontitis', 'Reticulocyte']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, the paucity of inhibitors has precluded the clinical validation of this approach. In this work we report a potent ICMT inhibitor, compound 3 [UCM-1336, IC50 = 2 muM], which is selective against the other enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications of Ras. Compound 3 significantly impairs the membrane association of the four Ras isoforms, leading to a decrease of Ras activity and to inhibition of Ras downstream signaling pathways. In addition, it induces cell death in a variety of Ras-mutated tumor cell lines and increases survival in an in vivo model of acute myeloid leukemia. Because ICMT inhibition impairs the activity of the four Ras isoforms regardless of its activating mutation, compound 3 surmounts many of the common limitations of available Ras inhibitors described so far. In addition, these results validate ICMT as a valuable target for the treatment of Ras-driven tumors.","['Marin-Ramos, Nagore I', 'Balabasquer, Moises', 'Ortega-Nogales, Francisco J', 'Torrecillas, Ivan R', 'Gil-Ordonez, Ana', 'Marcos-Ramiro, Beatriz', 'Aguilar-Garrido, Pedro', 'Cushman, Ian', 'Romero, Antonio', 'Medrano, Francisco J', 'Gajate, Consuelo', 'Mollinedo, Faustino', 'Philips, Mark R', 'Campillo, Mercedes', 'Gallardo, Miguel', 'Martin-Fontecha, Mar', 'Lopez-Rodriguez, Maria L', 'Ortega-Gutierrez, Silvia']","['Marin-Ramos NI', 'Balabasquer M', 'Ortega-Nogales FJ', 'Torrecillas IR', 'Gil-Ordonez A', 'Marcos-Ramiro B', 'Aguilar-Garrido P', 'Cushman I', 'Romero A', 'Medrano FJ', 'Gajate C', 'Mollinedo F', 'Philips MR', 'Campillo M', 'Gallardo M', 'Martin-Fontecha M', 'Lopez-Rodriguez ML', 'Ortega-Gutierrez S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0257-6754'],"['Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'CEI Campus Moncloa , UCM-UPM and CSIC , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Laboratori de Medicina Computacional, Unitat de Bioestadistica, Facultat de Medicina , Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , E-08193 Bellaterra , Barcelona , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit , Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO) , E-28029 Madrid , Spain.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology , Duke University Medical Center , Durham , North Carolina 27710 , United States.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Perlmutter Cancer Center , New York University School of Medicine , New York , New York 10016 , United States.', 'Laboratori de Medicina Computacional, Unitat de Bioestadistica, Facultat de Medicina , Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona , E-08193 Bellaterra , Barcelona , Spain.', 'H12O-CNIO Haematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit , Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO) , E-28029 Madrid , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.', 'Departamento de Quimica Organica I, Facultad de Ciencias Quimicas , Universidad Complutense de Madrid , E-28040 Madrid , Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190619,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Amides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Protein Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.100 (protein-S-isoprenylcysteine O-methyltransferase)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Amides/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Protein Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2019/06/12 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/06/12 06:00'],"['2019/06/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00145 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Jul 11;62(13):6035-6046. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00145.

We carried out an umbrella review to provide an overview and understand the strength of evidence, extent of potential biases, and validity of claimed associations between the use of statins and cancer incidence. We comprehensively re-analyzed the data of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies on associations between statin use and cancer incidence. We also assessed the strength of evidence of the re-analyzed outcomes, which were determined from the criteria including statistical significance of the p-value of random-effects, as well as fixed-effects meta-analyses, small study effects, between-study heterogeneity, and a 95% prediction interval. Using a conventional method to assess the significance of meta-analysis (p-value < 0.05), statins had a statistically significant effect on reducing cancer incidence in 10 of 18 types of cancer. When we graded the level of evidence, no cancer type showed convincing evidence, and four cancers (esophageal cancer, hematological cancer, leukemia, and liver cancer) showed suggestive evidence of a preventive effect. There was weak evidence of an association with six cancers, and no significance for the remaining eight cancers. None of the meta-analyses of RCTs on the association of statin and cancer incidence showed a statistical significance. Although there was a preventive effect of statin on cancer incidence in 10 of the 18 cancer types, the evidence supporting the use of statins to reduce cancer incidence was low. Therefore, the associations between statin use and cancer incidence should be carefully considered by clinicians.","['Jeong, Gwang Hun', 'Lee, Keum Hwa', 'Kim, Jong Yeob', 'Eisenhut, Michael', 'Kronbichler, Andreas', 'van der Vliet, Hans J', 'Hong, Sung Hwi', 'Shin, Jae Il', 'Gamerith, Gabriele']","['Jeong GH', 'Lee KH', 'Kim JY', 'Eisenhut M', 'Kronbichler A', 'van der Vliet HJ', 'Hong SH', 'Shin JI', 'Gamerith G']",,"['College of Medicine, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52727, Korea. gwangh.jeong@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Yonsei-ro 50, Seodaemun-gu, C.P.O.

The complexes have been characterized by elemental and conductivity analyses; infrared, NMR, and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopies; and X-ray diffraction of single crystal. Structural analyses reveal a distorted octahedral geometry around Ru(II) that is bound to two bpy (in 1) or two phen (in 2) via their two heterocyclic nitrogens and to two nitrogen atoms from sulfamethoxypyridazine-one of the methoxypyridazine ring and the sulfonamidic nitrogen, which is deprotonated. Both complexes inhibit the growth of chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. The interaction of the complexes with bovine serum albumin and DNA is described. DNA footprinting using an oligonucleotide as substrate showed the complexes' preference for thymine base rich sites. It is worth notifying that the complexes interact with the Src homology SH3 domain of the Abl tyrosine kinase protein.

Birth certificate controls were frequency matched (10:1) on birth year (n = 20,300). Three residential proximity measures were assessed: (1) distance to nearest major roadway, (2) residence within 500 meters of a major roadway, and (3) roadway density. Multivariate logistic regression was used to generate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Mothers who lived </=500 meters to a major roadway were not more likely to have a child who developed ALL (OR = 1.03; 95% CI: 0.91-1.16) or AML (OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.64-1.11). Mothers who lived in areas characterized by high roadway density were not more likely to have children who developed ALL (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.93-1.20) or AML (OR = 0.83, 95% CI: 0.61-1.13). Our results do not support the hypothesis that maternal proximity to major roadways is strongly associated with childhood acute leukemia. Future assessments evaluating the role of early-life exposure to environmental factors on acute leukemia risk should explore novel methods for directly measuring exposures during relevant periods of development.","['Peckham-Gregory, Erin C', 'Ton, Minh', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Danysh, Heather E', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Lupo, Philip J']","['Peckham-Gregory EC', 'Ton M', 'Rabin KR', 'Danysh HE', 'Scheurer ME', 'Lupo PJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7593-8381', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7774-3537', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4081-8195']","['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, MS: BCM622, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

Recent clinical trials of B cell leukemia have demonstrated a response rate of up to 90%. However, CAR cell therapy is frequently accompanied by severe side effects such as cytokine release syndrome and the development of target cell resistance. Consequently, further optimization of CARs to obtain greater long-term efficacy and increased safety is urgently needed. Here we high-light the various efforts of adjusting the intracellular signaling domains of CARs to these major requirements to eventually obtain high-level target cell cytotoxicity paralleled by the establishment of longevity of the CAR expressing cell types to guarantee for extended tumor surveillance over prolonged periods of time. We are convinced that it will be crucial to identify the molecular pathways and signaling requirements utilized by such 'efficient CARs' in order to provide a rational basis for their further hypothesis-based improvement. Furthermore, we here discuss timely attempts of how to: i) control 'on-tumor off-target' effects; ii) introduce Signal 3 (cytokine responsiveness of CAR cells) as an important building-block into the CAR concept; iii) most efficiently eliminate CAR cells once full remission has been obtained. We also argue that universal systems for the variable and pharmacokinetically-controlled attachment of extracellular ligand recognition domains of choice along with the establishment of 'off-the-shelf' cell preparations with suitability for all patients in need of a highly-potent cellular therapy may become future mainstays of CAR cell therapy. Such therapies would have the attraction to work independent of the patients' histocompatibility make-up and the availability of functionally intact patient's cells. Finally, we summarize the evidence that CAR cells may obtain a prominent place in the treatment of non-malignant and auto-reactive T and B lymphocyte expansions in the near future, e.g., for the alleviation of autoimmune diseases and allergies. After the introduction of red blood cell transfusions, which were made possible by the landmark discoveries of the ABO blood groups by Karl Landsteiner, and the establishment of bone marrow transplantation by E. Donnall Thomas to exchange the entire hematopoietic system of a patient suffering from leukemia, the introduction of patient-tailored cytotoxic cellular populations to eradicate malignant cell populations in vivo pioneered by Carl H. June, represents the third major and broadly applicable milestone in the development of human cellular therapies within the rapidly developing field of applied biomedical research of the last one hundred years.","['Zabel, Maja', 'Tauber, Peter A', 'Pickl, Winfried F']","['Zabel M', 'Tauber PA', 'Pickl WF']",,"['Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Immunology, Center for Pathophysiology, Infectiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.

While multiple studies have described neurocognitive outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors, relatively few have investigated their association with individual genetic constitution. METHODS: To further address this issue, genetic variants located in 99 genes relevant to the effects of anticancer drugs and in 360 genes implicated in nervous system function and predicted to affect protein function, were pooled from whole exome sequencing data of childhood ALL survivors (PETALE cohort) and analyzed for an association with neurocognitive complications, as well as with anxiety and depression. Variants that sustained correction for multiple testing were genotyped in entire cohort (n = 236) and analyzed with same outcomes. RESULTS: Common variants in MTR, PPARA, ABCC3, CALML5, CACNB2 and PCDHB10 genes were associated with deficits in neurocognitive tests performance, whereas a variant in SLCO1B1 and EPHA5 genes was associated with anxiety and depression. Majority of associations were modulated by intensity of treatment. Associated variants were further analyzed in an independent SJLIFE cohort of 545 ALL survivors. Two variants, rs1805087 in methionine synthase, MTR and rs58225473 in voltage-dependent calcium channel protein encoding gene, CACNB2 are of particular interest, since associations of borderline significance were found in replication cohort and remain significant in combined discovery and replication groups (OR = 1.5, 95% CI, 1-2.3; p = 0.04 and; OR = 3.7, 95% CI, 1.25-11; p = 0.01, respectively). Variant rs4149056 in SLCO1B1 gene also deserves further attention since previously shown to affect methotrexate clearance and short-term toxicity in ALL patients. CONCLUSIONS: Current findings can help understanding of the influence of genetic component on long-term neurocognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to confirm whether identified variants may be useful in identifying survivors at increased risk of these complications.","['Petrykey, Kateryna', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Robaey,

Here, we investigated the role and potential mechanism of the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) FENDRR in adriamycin resistance of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cells. FENDRR overexpression attenuates adriamycin resistance, as shown by increased Rhodamine 123 accumulation, promotion of cell apoptosis in vitro and suppression of tumour growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we identified that FENDRR reduces the interaction of the RNA-binding protein HuR with MDR1 via acting as a sponge, and miR-184 competitively binds to FENDRR with HuR. Thus, the HuR/FENDRR/miR-184 interaction contributes to MDR1 activity. These findings indicate that FENDRR is a potential target for reversing adriamycin resistance.","['Zhang, Feng', 'Ni, Haiwei', 'Li, Xiaoman', 'Liu, Hai', 'Xi, Tao', 'Zheng, Lufeng']","['Zhang F', 'Ni H', 'Li X', 'Liu H', 'Xi T', 'Zheng L']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8065-2639'],"['School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory for Pharmacology and Safety Evaluation of Chinese Materia Medical, School of Pharmacy, Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'School of Life Science and Technology, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190620,England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ELAV-Like Protein 1)', '0 (ELAVL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN184 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ELAV-Like Protein 1/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",,2019/06/11 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2019/06/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1873-3468.13480 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2019 Aug;593(15):1993-2007. doi: 10.1002/1873-3468.13480.

To understand the landscape of genomic changes and the dynamics of subclonal architecture associated with ibrutinib treatment, an ultra-deep next-generation sequencing analysis of 30 recurrently mutated genes was performed on sequential samples of 20 patients, collected before and during single-agent ibrutinib treatment. Mutations in the SF3B1, MGAand BIRC3 genes were enriched during ibrutinib treatment, while aberrations in the BTK, PLCG2, RIPK1, NFKBIE and XPO1 genes were exclusively detected in posttreatment samples. Besides the canonical mutations, four novel BTK mutations and three previously unreported PLCG2 variants were identified. BTK and PLCG2 mutations were backtracked in five patients using digital droplet PCR and were detectable on average 10.5 months before clinical relapse. With a median follow-up time of 36.5 months, 7/9 patients harboring BTK mutations showed disease progression based on clinical and/or laboratory features. In conclusion, subclonal heterogeneity, dynamic clonal selection and various patterns of clonal variegation were identified with novel resistance-associated BTK mutations in individual patients treated with ibrutinib.","['Gango, Ambrus', 'Alpar, Donat', 'Galik, Bence', 'Marosvari, Dora', 'Kiss, Richard', 'Fesus, Viktoria', 'Aczel, Dora', 'Eyupoglu, Ediz', 'Nagy, Noemi', 'Nagy, Akos',

Despite the success of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in treating CML patients, leukemia stem cells (LSCs) resist elimination and persist as a major barrier to cure. Previous studies suggest that overexpression of the sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase may contribute to LSC maintenance in CML. Here, by genetically deleting SIRT1 in transgenic CML mice, we definitively demonstrated an important role for SIRT1 in leukemia development. We identified a previously unrecognized role for SIRT1 in mediating increased mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in CML LSCs. We showed that mitochondrial alterations were kinase independent and that TKI treatment enhanced inhibition of CML hematopoiesis in SIRT1-deleted mice. We further showed that the SIRT1 substrate PGC-1alpha contributed to increased oxidative phosphorylation and TKI resistance in CML LSCs. These results reveal an important role for SIRT1 and downstream signaling mechanisms in altered mitochondrial respiration in CML LSCs.","['Abraham, Ajay', 'Qiu, Shaowei', 'Chacko, Balu K', 'Li, Hui', 'Paterson, Andrew', 'He, Jianbo', 'Agarwal, Puneet', 'Shah, Mansi', 'Welner, Robert', 'Darley-Usmar, Victor M', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Abraham A', 'Qiu S', 'Chacko BK', 'Li H', 'Paterson A', 'He J', 'Agarwal P', 'Shah M', 'Welner R', 'Darley-Usmar VM', 'Bhatia R']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Mitochondrial Medicine Laboratory, UAB, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Mitochondrial Medicine Laboratory, UAB, Birmingham, Alabama, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), Birmingham, Alabama, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190610,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirt1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitochondria/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Oxygen Consumption/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sirtuin 1/*biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC6597223,2019/06/11 06:00,2020/05/20 06:00,['2019/06/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/20 06:00 [medline]']","['127080 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI127080 [doi]']",epublish,J Clin Invest. 2019 Jun 10;129(7):2685-2701. doi: 10.1172/JCI127080. eCollection 2019 Jun 10.,7,"['P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult stem cells', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology']",,,,,,,,,,,

The design of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel using a comprehensive pool of primers, the establishment of a straightforward analytical protocol, a bioinformatic pipeline and the availability of the results of clinical studies have allowed the Clonoseq platform to be licensed as the first assay to measure minimal residual disease (MRD) both in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in multiple myeloma (MM). Areas covered: An extensive literature review (Pubmed search) on the applicability of the high-throughput sequencing (HTS) approach in lymphoid malignancies was conducted. This review discusses recent data in the field and compares this emerging molecular technique with standardized technologies. Expert Opinion: Real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR and multiparametric flow cytometry (MPFC) are still the gold standard methods of minimal residual disease assessment. New HTS methods as Clonoseq show a high concordance with the above-mentioned techniques and at the same time it provides potential advantages to detect clonal changes. Clonoseq could be helpful to optimize risk-stratification and adjusting treatments in lymphoid malignancies. Moreover, HTS could also be applied to the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) on the plasma in lymphomas.","['Monter, Anna', 'Nomdedeu, Josep F']","['Monter A', 'Nomdedeu JF']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9970-7641', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3399-346X']","['a Laboratori d Hematologia.

Terson's syndrome has been associated with many conditions that increase intracranial pressure such as venous sinus thrombosis, Moyamoya disease, leukemia, direct head trauma, and intraocular hemorrhage related to shaken baby syndrome. We present a novel case of a patient with recent viral prodrome found to have papilledema and multilayered retinal hemorrhages consistent with Terson syndrome. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance venography of the brain did not reveal any subdural, subarachnoid, or intracranial hemorrhages. However, cerebrospinal fluid analyses were significant for increased opening pressure and elevated protein levels, which were suggestive of viral meningoencephalitis. We describe this case as a Terson-like syndrome because the etiology of intraocular hemorrhage is increased intracranial pressure. However, this case does not fit the traditional presentation of Terson's syndrome as the intracranial pressure is secondary to meningeal inflammation instead of subdural, subarachnoid, or intracranial hemorrhage. We strongly feel that it is important for physicians to be aware of the link between viral meningoencephalitis and retinal conditions such as Terson-like syndrome because it can facilitate rapid diagnosis and treatment.","['Asahi, Masumi G', 'Weiss, Stephanie J', 'Peddada, Krishi', 'Malik, Deepika']","['Asahi MG', 'Weiss SJ', 'Peddada K', 'Malik D']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3722-6711'],"['Western University of Health Sciences, 309 E 2nd St., Pomona, CA 91766, USA.', 'Drexel University College of Medicine, 219 N.

An anti-human CD4 antibody (MAX.16H5) was applied intravenously in clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and acute late-onset rejection after transplantation of a renal allograft. The response rates were remarkable and no critical allergic problems or side effects were obtained. During the treatment of autoimmune diseases with the murine MAX.16H5 IgG1 antibody its effector mechanisms with effects on lymphocytes, cytokines, laboratory and clinical parameters, adverse effects as well as pharmacodynamics and kinetics were studied in detail. However, as the possibility of developing immune reactions against the murine IgG1 Fc-part remains, the murine antibody was chimerized, inheriting CD4-directed variable domains of the MAX.16H5 IgG1 connected to a human IgG4 backbone. Both antibodies were studied in vitro and in specific humanized mouse transplantation models in vivo with a new scope. By ex vivo incubation of an allogeneic immune cell transplant with MAX.16H5 a new therapy strategy has emerged for the first time enabling both the preservation of the graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect and the permanent suppression of the acute graft-vs.-host disease (aGVHD) without conventional immunosuppression. In this review, we especially focus on experimental data and clinical trials obtained from the treatment of autoimmune diseases with the murine MAX.16H5 IgG1 antibody. Insights gained from these trials have paved the way to better understand the effects with the chimerized MAX.16H5 IgG4 as novel therapeutic approach in the context of GVHD prevention.","['Stahl, Lilly', 'Duenkel, Anna', 'Hilger, Nadja', 'Tretbar, Uta Sandy', 'Fricke, Stephan']","['Stahl L', 'Duenkel A', 'Hilger N', 'Tretbar US', 'Fricke S']",,"['Immune Tolerance Unit, Fraunhofer Institute of Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance Unit, Fraunhofer Institute of Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Max-Burger Research Center, Institute for Clinical Immunology, University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance Unit, Fraunhofer Institute of Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Immune Tolerance Unit, Fraunhofer Institute of Cell Therapy and Immunology, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190524,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/*immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Mice']",PMC6543443,2019/06/11 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2019/06/11 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01035 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 May 24;10:1035. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01035. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*MAX.16H5', '*T cell modulation', '*anti-human CD4 antibody', '*autoimmune disease', '*graft-vs.-host disease', '*graft-vs.-leukemia effect']",,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we develop proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) degraders of the BAF ATPase subunits SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 using a bromodomain ligand and recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL. High-resolution ternary complex crystal structures and biophysical investigation guided rational and efficient optimization toward ACBI1, a potent and cooperative degrader of SMARCA2, SMARCA4 and PBRM1. ACBI1 induced anti-proliferative effects and cell death caused by SMARCA2 depletion in SMARCA4 mutant cancer cells, and in acute myeloid leukemia cells dependent on SMARCA4 ATPase activity. These findings exemplify a successful biophysics- and structure-based PROTAC design approach to degrade high profile drug targets, and pave the way toward new therapeutics for the treatment of tumors sensitive to the loss of BAF complex ATPases.","['Farnaby, William', 'Koegl, Manfred', 'Roy, Michael J', 'Whitworth, Claire', 'Diers, Emelyne', 'Trainor, Nicole', 'Zollman, David', 'Steurer, Steffen',

CASE SUMMARY: An 84-year-old man with a past medical history of myelomonocytic chronic leukemia (CMML) suffered from sudden bilateral hearing loss associated with vertigo. The audiogram revealed a left cophosis and a right profound deafness. Videonystagmography showed a left vestibular deficit. The MRI showed a spontaneous strong T1 weighted signal in the left and right labyrinths, corresponding to a bilateral inner ear hemorrhage (IEH). Dizziness resolved rapidly following vestibular physiotherapy, in contrast to hearing which did not improve at all and let the patient isolated in his environment. The patient successfully underwent cochlear implantation so that he could communicate. DISCUSSION: Most IEHs are unilateral and due to anticoagulants treatments and hematological diseases. Only rare cases have described bilateral labyrinth hemorrhage. This is the first case reported of bilateral labyrinth hemorrhage due to CMML.","['Meunier, A', 'Clavel, P', 'Aubry, K', 'Lerat, J']","['Meunier A', 'Clavel P', 'Aubry K', 'Lerat J']",,"['Department of otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery, university hospital Center, 2, avenue Martin-Luther-King, 87042 Limoges cedex, France.

The effect of cryopreservation on CART characteristics is unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the effect of cryopreservation on product release criteria and in vivo characteristics in 158 autologous CART products from 6 single-center clinical trials. Further, from 3 healthy donor manufacturing runs, we prospectively identified differentially expressed cell surface markers and gene signatures among fresh versus cryopreserved CARTs. Within 2 days of culture initiation, cell viability of the starting fraction (peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMNCs]) decreased significantly in the cryo-thawed arm compared to the fresh arm. Despite this, PBMNC cryopreservation did not affect final CART fold expansion, transduction efficiency, CD3%, or CD4:CD8 ratios. In vivo CART persistence and clinical responses did not differ among fresh and cryopreserved final products. In healthy donors, compared to fresh CARTs, early apoptotic cell-surface markers were significantly elevated in cryo-thawed CARTs. Cryo-thawed CARTs also demonstrated significantly elevated expression of mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis signaling, and cell cycle damage pathways. Cryopreservation during CART manufacture is a viable strategy, based on standard product release parameters. The clinical impact of cryopreservation-related subtle micro-cellular damage needs further study.","['Panch, Sandhya R', 'Srivastava, Sandeep K', 'Elavia, Nasha', 'McManus, Andrew', 'Liu, Shutong', 'Jin, Ping', 'Highfill, Steven L', 'Li, Xiaobai', 'Dagur, Pradeep', 'Kochenderfer, James N', 'Fry, Terry J', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Lee, Daniel', 'Shah, Nirali N', 'Stroncek, David F']","['Panch SR', 'Srivastava SK', 'Elavia N', 'McManus A', 'Liu S', 'Jin P', 'Highfill SL', 'Li X', 'Dagur P', 'Kochenderfer JN', 'Fry TJ', 'Mackall CL', 'Lee D', 'Shah NN', 'Stroncek DF']",,"['Center for Cellular Engineering, NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD, USA.

The differentiation and maturation of human leukemic granulocytic cells in patients suffering from the chronic phase of the chronic granulocytic leukemia (CML) represented a convenient model for such study because of the large number of cells for the diameter measurements at the single cell level. Early and advanced differentiation or maturation stages of these cells are well defined and nucleolar bodies and nuclear outlines are easily seen by simple cytochemical methods for the visualization of RNA and silver stained proteins in smear preparations. During the cell differentiation and maturation, the estimated size of the nuclear region occupied by nucleolar bodies decreased in both untreated and treated patients with the anti-leukemic therapy. However, the size reduction of nucleolar bodies in differentiated and mature cells was larger than that of the nucleus.

Herein, the aim was to establish the early diagnosis of cardiotoxicity through the periodic evaluation of the left ventricular (LV) and vascular remodeling parameters, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population included 35 patients diagnosed with ALL, evaluated before and 3 months after starting chemotherapy, measuring systolic and diastolic parameters of the LV and intima-media thickness (IMT), arterial stiffness aortic pulse wave velocity (PWVAo) and ankle-brachial index (ABI). RESULTS: After the first 2 cycles of chemotherapy, all patients experienced a drop in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (p<0.001), and 12 patients suffered a decrease of LVEF<50%. The ABI (p<0.05) and the global longitudinal strain (GLS) (p<0.001) decreased, while IMT and PWVAo (p<0.001) increased, proving a subclinical deterioration of the LV function and vascular remodeling. CONCLUSION: Assessment of cardiovascular risk factors before chemotherapy initiation in ALL patients may be helpful for an early diagnosis of chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity, thus contributing to early treatment and a subsequent decrease of death caused by such cardiovascular complications.","['Militaru, Anda', 'Zus, Sebastian', 'Cimpean, Anca Maria', 'Iurciuc, Stela', 'Matusz, Petru', 'Iurciuc, Mircea', 'Lighezan, Daniel', 'Militaru, Marius']","['Militaru A', 'Zus S', 'Cimpean AM', 'Iurciuc S', 'Matusz P', 'Iurciuc M', 'Lighezan D', 'Militaru M']",,"['Medical Semiology I, Department of Internal Medicine I, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Cardiovascular Disease Institute, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Microscopic Morphology/Histology, Angiogenesis Research Center, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania ancacimpean1972@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Cardiology, Preventive Medicine and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Anatomy and Embriology, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Cardiology, Preventive Medicine and Cardiovascular Rehabilitation, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Medical Semiology I, Department of Internal Medicine I, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.', 'Department of Neuroscience - Municipal Emergency Hospital, Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adult', '*Ankle Brachial Index', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/*diagnosis/physiopathology', 'Early Diagnosis', '*Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Contraction/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Risk Factors', 'Stroke Volume/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Remodeling/drug effects', 'Vascular Stiffness/drug effects', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/10 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2019/06/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['39/6/3255 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13467 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Jun;39(6):3255-3264. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13467.,6,,,,"['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiotoxicity', 'LV dysfunction', 'anthracyclines', 'vascular rigidity']",,,,,,,,,,,

According to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics staging system, 13, 21, and 8 patients were classified as having stage IB2, II, and III disease, respectively. Baseline immunohistochemical biomarkers, including those for hypoxia, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, immunogenicity, and evasion of apoptosis, were analyzed using tissue microarrays from biopsy specimens. RESULTS: Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL1) overexpression and the presence of pelvic lymph node metastasis were two prognostic factors for inferior cancer-specific survival. A higher H-score for c-MYC proto-oncogene, bHLH transcription factor (c-MYC) was associated with lower pelvic relapse-free survival.

Q192R and L55M PON1 polymorphisms reduce catalytic activity of the encoded protein. These polymorphisms were studied in 300 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and 106 healthy donors. They were also associated with patients' cytogenetic findings, to investigate their possible implication in CLL pathogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SNP genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Karyotypic analysis was also performed by chromosome G-banding analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. RESULTS: Genotypic and allelic distribution of Q192R polymorphism showed a statistically significant higher frequency of mutant genotypes and mutant alleles in patients compared to controls. The same observation was noted in patients with abnormal karyotypes and those carrying abn14q32 and del(6q). A statistically increased frequency for the mutant allele was also revealed in patients with del(11q). On the contrary, L55M polymorphism showed a similar distribution between patients and controls.

The role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with s-AML and the extent to which HCT is performed in these patients has been little studied to date. We used the population-based Swedish AML Registry comprising 3337 intensively treated adult patients over a 17-year period to study the role of HCT within the group of patients with s-AML as well as compared with patients with de novo AML. HCT was performed in 576 patients (22%) with de novo AML, in 74 patients (17%) with AHD-AML, and in 57 patients (20%) with t-AML. At 5 years after diagnosis, there were no survivors among patients with previous myeloproliferative neoplasms who did not undergo HCT, and corresponding survival for patients with antecedent myelodysplastic syndromes and t-AML was and 2% and 4%, respectively. HCT was compared with chemotherapy consolidation in s-AML using 3 models: (1) a 200-day landmark analysis, in which HCT was favorable compared with conventional consolidation (P=.04, log-rank test); (2) a multivariable Cox regression with HCT as a time-dependent variable, in which the hazard ratio for mortality was 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.83) for HCT and favored HCT in all subgroups; and (3) a propensity score matching analysis, in which the 5-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival in patients with s-AML in first complete remission (CR1) was 48% and 43%, respectively, for patients undergoing HCT versus 20% and 21%, respectively, for those receiving chemotherapy consolidation (P=.01 and .02, respectively, log-rank test).

Since 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) metabolites reduced growth of breast, colon, prostate, lung and leukemia cancer cells in 2D cell culture, we were intrigued by the direct comparison of 15-LOX metabolite efficacy in 2D and 3D culture including a stroma equivalent. Herein, we studied the effects of 15-LOX metabolites 13-HpOTrE, 13-HpODE, and 15-HpETE on cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells. All metabolites reduced the viability of cancer cells in 2D culture below 10% at 100microM of each substance. 13-HpOTrE, being the most active agent with respect to cytotoxicity and apoptosis was selected for further experiments. Other than with the 2D culture, we did not obverse cell death, neither from lactate dehydrogenase release, nor from morphology when applying 13-HpOTrE onto the surface of the 3D tumor constructs for one week. Next, we investigated the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma, for which the ligand is 13-HpOTrE, and Bcl-2 protein, an apoptosis regulator, but did not find any change following 13-HpOTrE administration. However, 13-HpOTrE treatment reduced the release of interleukin-6, bringing it closer to the level of tumor-free constructs. In conclusion, 13-HpOTrE reduces viability of skin cancer cells in 2D cultures only but modulates inflammatory cytokine levels in the corresponding 3D tumor constructs, too. These studies highlight the need for screening of anticancer drugs employing 3D tumors and including tumor microenvironment in the screening process to increase the low success rate of clinical trials in oncology.","['Wolff, Christopher', 'Zoschke, Christian', 'Kalangi, Suresh Kumar', 'Reddanna, Pallu', 'Schafer-Korting, Monika']","['Wolff C', 'Zoschke C', 'Kalangi SK', 'Reddanna P', 'Schafer-Korting M']",,"['Freie Universitat Berlin, Institute of Pharmacy (Pharmacology & Toxicology), Konigin-Luise-Str. 2+4, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.', 'Freie Universitat Berlin, Institute of Pharmacy (Pharmacology & Toxicology), Konigin-Luise-Str. 2+4, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.', 'University of Hyderabad, Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, Hyderabad, 500046, India.', 'University of Hyderabad, Department of Animal Biology, School of Life Sciences, Hyderabad, 500046, India.', 'Freie Universitat Berlin, Institute of Pharmacy (Pharmacology & Toxicology), Konigin-Luise-Str. 2+4, D-14195 Berlin, Germany.

Animal transplantation models used by us and others have demonstrated that the adoptive transfer of allospecific Tregs offers greater protection from graft rejection than that of polyclonal Tregs. This finding is in contrast to those of autoimmune models, where adoptive transfer of polyspecific Tregs had very limited effects, while antigen-specific Tregs were promising. However, antigen-specific Tregs in autoimmunity cannot be isolated in sufficient numbers. Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) can modify T cells and redirect their specificity toward needed antigens and are currently clinically used in leukemia patients. A major benefit of CAR technology is its ""off-the-shelf"" usability in a translational setting in contrast to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted T cell receptors. We used CAR technology to redirect T cell specificity toward insulin and redirect T effector cells (Teffs) to Tregs by Foxp3 transduction. Our data demonstrate that our converted, insulin-specific CAR Tregs (cTregs) were functional stable, suppressive and long-lived in vivo. This is a proof of concept for both redirection of T cell specificity and conversion of Teffs to cTregs.","['Tenspolde, Michel', 'Zimmermann, Katharina', 'Weber, Leonie C', 'Hapke, Martin', 'Lieber, Maren', 'Dywicki, Janine', 'Frenzel, Andre', 'Hust, Michael', 'Galla, Melanie', 'Buitrago-Molina, Laura E', 'Manns, Michael P', 'Jaeckel, Elmar', 'Hardtke-Wolenski, Matthias']","['Tenspolde M', 'Zimmermann K', 'Weber LC', 'Hapke M', 'Lieber M', 'Dywicki J', 'Frenzel A', 'Hust M', 'Galla M', 'Buitrago-Molina LE', 'Manns MP', 'Jaeckel E', 'Hardtke-Wolenski M']",,"['Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Institut fur Biochemie, Biotechnologie und Bioinformatik, Abteilung Biotechnologie, Braunschweig, Germany; YUMAB GmbH, Science Campus Braunschweig-Sud, Inhoffenstr. 7, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Technische Universitat Braunschweig, Institut fur Biochemie, Biotechnologie und Bioinformatik, Abteilung Biotechnologie, Braunschweig, Germany; YUMAB GmbH, Science Campus Braunschweig-Sud, Inhoffenstr. 7, 38124, Braunschweig, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Haematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Dept. of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Endocrinology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany; Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Essen, University of Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.

Results show that based on the data available, the statistical model indicates that the highest percentage of FeLV or FIV infected cats live in areas of lower PPP (p</=.001) with a decreasing rate of infection of FeLV and FIV with increasing income. Two theories for this could be that the lower PPP locations in this study were also in areas of greater feral cat and cat colony populations, as well as were areas with less emphasis on animal welfare and animal control programs.

Oxidative stress may be an underlying reason of cancer occurring, while diverse antioxidants can protect the bone marrow cells (BMCs) from damaged. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) is an important member of the peroxiredoxin family, can remove reactive oxygen species (ROS), and is closely related with the occurrence of tumor. The present study aimed to detect a possible relationship between Prx gene and FA-induced bone marrow toxicity. METHODS: The BMCs were taken out from BALB/c mice, then exposed to control and different doses of FA (50, 100, 200mumol/L). The cell viability, ROS level and expressions of Prx gene were examined. Afterwards, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to inhibit the expression of Prx gene, and chose 100mumol/L FA for exposure dose, to examine the cell viability, ROS level, cell cycle, apoptotic rate, expressions of Prx gene in BMCs. RESULTS: After a 24h exposure to different doses of FA, the cell viability, expressions of Prx gene were decreased with the increasing of FA concentration, while the ROS level was increased. Inhibiting Prx gene's expression could enhance above FA-induced events. Additionally, siRNA targeting of Prxcould aggravate cell cycle arrest to inhibit cell's growth and development, as well as increase apoptotic rates induced by FA. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that Prx gene was involved in FA-induced bone marrow toxicity, and siRNA targeting of Prxcould enhance this toxic process.","['Yu, Guangyan', 'Zhang, Yixin', 'Liu, Shimeng', 'Fan, Lida', 'Yang, Yixue', 'Huang, Yulu', 'Song, Jiayi']","['Yu G', 'Zhang Y', 'Liu S', 'Fan L', 'Yang Y', 'Huang Y', 'Song J']",,"['(Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin Province130021, China.

Since primary neutrophils are terminally differentiated and not genetically tractable, leukemia cells such as HL-60 are differentiated into neutrophil-like cells to study mechanisms underlying neutrophil migration. However, constitutive overexpression or inhibition in this cell line does not allow the characterization of the genes that affect the differentiation process. Here we apply the tet-on system to induce the expression of a zebrafish microRNA, dre-miR-722, in differentiated HL-60. Overexpression of miR-722 reduced the mRNA level of genes in the chemotaxis and inflammation pathways, including Ras-Related C3 Botulinum Toxin Substrate 2 (RAC2). Consistently, polarization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell migration and generation of the reactive oxygen species are significantly inhibited upon induced miR-722 overexpression. Together, zebrafish miR-722 is a suppressor for migration and signaling in human neutrophil like cells.","['Hsu, Alan Y', 'Liu, Sheng', 'Syahirah, Ramizah', 'Brasseale, Kent A', 'Wan, Jun', 'Deng, Qing']","['Hsu AY', 'Liu S', 'Syahirah R', 'Brasseale KA', 'Wan J', 'Deng Q']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Collaborative Core for Cancer Bioinformatics, Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Collaborative Core for Cancer Bioinformatics, Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA; Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA; Purdue Institute for Inflammation, Immunology, & Infectious Disease, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA; Purdue University Center for Cancer Research, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907, USA.

Here, we evaluated the effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) on chordoma progression and clinical outcome. METHODS: Chordoma cells were treated with TNF-alpha after which its short- and long-term effects were evaluated. Functional assays, qRT-PCR and microarray-based expression analyses were carried out to assess the effect of TNF-alpha on chemo-resistance, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion and cancer stem cell-like properties. Finally, relationships between TNF-alpha expression and clinicopathological features were assessed in a chordoma patient cohort. RESULTS: We found that TNF-alpha treatment increased the migration and invasion of chordoma cells. Also, NF-kappaB activation was observed along with increased EMT marker expression. In addition, enhanced tumor sphere formation and soft agar colony formation were observed, concomitantly with increased chemo-resistance and CD338 marker expression. The TNF-alpha and TNFR1 expression levels were found to be significantly correlated with LIF, PD-L1 and Ki67 expression levels, tumor volume and a short survival time in patients. In addition, a high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was found to be associated with recurrence and a decreased overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: From our data we conclude that TNF-alpha may serve as a prognostic marker for chordoma progression and that tumor-promoting inflammation may be a major factor in chordoma tumor progression.","['Gulluoglu, Sukru', 'Tuysuz, Emre Can', 'Sahin, Mesut', 'Yaltirik, Cumhur Kaan', 'Kuskucu, Aysegul', 'Ozkan, Ferda', 'Dalan, Altay Burak', 'Sahin, Fikrettin', 'Ture, Ugur', 'Bayrak, Omer Faruk']","['Gulluoglu S', 'Tuysuz EC', 'Sahin M', 'Yaltirik CK', 'Kuskucu A', 'Ozkan F', 'Dalan AB', 'Sahin F', 'Ture U', 'Bayrak OF']",,"['Department of Medical Genetics, Yeditepe University Medical School, Koftuncu Sok.

The importance of chemotherapy in the pathogenesis of this increased risk is enhanced by the fact that thrombosis rarely occurs at diagnosis. Our study aims at investigating the effect of chemotherapy on pro-coagulant activity (PCA), phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, tissue factor (TF) activity and derived extracellular vesicles (EV) of Jurkat cells. Jurkat cells were treated with two commonly used chemotherapeutics: Vincristine (VCR) or Daunorubicin (DNR), at relevant concentrations. PCA of cells and derived EV were evaluated using Thrombin generation Assay (TGA). Cells or EV were incubated with annexin V or anti TF antibodies to assess the respective contribution of TF and PS. PS exposure on cells was analysed by flow cytometry. Derived EV were evaluated in fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Untreated Jurkat cells and EV support thrombin generation. Thrombin generation was abolished when PS activity was inhibited by annexin V. VCR treatment resulted in a time dependent increase of thrombin generation. After VCR exposure, TF activity increased as well as PS exposure increased on the cell surface. The increase in TF activity was abolished by annexin V indicating that PS was required. A spontaneous release of EV from Jurkat cells was observed and VCR treatment increased the number of generated EV. Our results indicate that VCR increased the PCA of Jurkat cells predominantly through PS exposure and increased EV generation. Lymphoid blasts derived EV could be biomarkers to determine high thrombotic risk ALL patients.","['Pluchart, Claire', 'Poitevin, Gael', 'Colinart-Thomas, Maud', 'Guimard, Gregory', 'Audonnet, Sandra', 'Terryn, Christine', 'Nguyen, Philippe']","['Pluchart C', 'Poitevin G', 'Colinart-Thomas M', 'Guimard G', 'Audonnet S', 'Terryn C', 'Nguyen P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5500-969X'],"['Department of Paediatric Oncology/Hematology, American Hospital, CHU de Reims, 47 rue Cognacq Jay, 51095, Reims, France. cpluchart@chu-reims.fr.', 'EA3801-HERVI, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France. cpluchart@chu-reims.fr.', 'EA3801-HERVI, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Hematology, American Hospital, CHU de Reims, 47 rue Cognacq Jay, 51095, Reims, France.', 'EA3801-HERVI, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology/Hematology, American Hospital, CHU de Reims, 47 rue Cognacq Jay, 51095, Reims, France.', 'EA3801-HERVI, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.', 'Plateau technique de cytometrie en flux - URCACyt, Pole Sante, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.', 'Plateau technique en Imagerie Cellulaire et Tissulaire (PICT), Pole Sante, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.', 'EA3801-HERVI, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, Reims, France.', 'Department of Hematology Laboratory, CHU Reims, Reims, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Thromb Thrombolysis,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,9502018,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic', 'Blood Coagulation/*drug effects', 'Extracellular Vesicles/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Thromboplastin/metabolism', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",,2019/06/09 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/06/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11239-019-01894-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11239-019-01894-x [pii]']",ppublish,J Thromb Thrombolysis. 2019 Aug;48(2):195-202. doi: 10.1007/s11239-019-01894-x.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Extracellular vesicles', 'Microparticles', 'Phosphatidylserine', 'Thrombin generation assay', 'Vincristine']",,,,,,,,,,,

STAT5B(N642H), a frequently-occurring oncogenic driver mutation, promotes aggressive T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in patient carriers, although the molecular origins remain unclear. Herein, we emphasize the aggressive nature of STAT5B(N642H) in driving T-cell neoplasia upon hematopoietic expression in transgenic mice, revealing evidence of multiple T-cell subset organ infiltration. Notably, we demonstrate STAT5B(N642H)-driven transformation of gammadelta T-cells in in vivo syngeneic transplant models, comparable to STAT5B(N642H) patient gammadelta T-cell entities. Importantly, we present human STAT5B and STAT5B(N642H) crystal structures, which propose alternative mutation-mediated SH2 domain conformations. Our biophysical data suggests STAT5B(N642H) can adopt a hyper-activated and hyper-inactivated state with resistance to dephosphorylation. MD simulations support sustained interchain cross-domain interactions in STAT5B(N642H), conferring kinetic stability to the mutant anti-parallel dimer. This study provides a molecular explanation for the STAT5B(N642H) activating potential, and insights into pre-clinical models for targeted intervention of hyper-activated STAT5B.","['de Araujo, Elvin

Unfavorable prognosis is attributed to insufficiently characterized subpopulations of leukemia stem cells (LSC) that drive chemoresistance and leukemia relapse. Here we utilized a genetic reporter that assesses stemness to enrich and functionally characterize LSCs. We observed heterogeneous activity of the ERG+85 enhancer-based fluorescent reporter in human leukemias. Cells with high reporter activity (tagBFP(High)) exhibited elevated expression of stemness and chemoresistance genes and demonstrated increased clonogenicity and resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy as compared with their tagBFP(Neg) counterparts. The tagBFP(High) fraction was capable of regenerating the original cellular heterogeneity and demonstrated increased invasive ability. Moreover, the tagBFP(High) fraction was enriched for leukemia-initiating cells in a xenograft assay. We identified the ubiquitin hydrolase USP9X as a novel ERG transcriptional target that sustains ERG+85-positive cells by controlling ERG ubiquitination. Therapeutic targeting of USP9X led to preferential inhibition of the ERG-dependent leukemias. Collectively, these results characterize human leukemia cell functional heterogeneity and suggest that targeting ERG via USP9X inhibition may be a potential treatment strategy in patients with leukemia. SIGNIFICANCE: This study couples a novel experimental tool with state-of-the-art approaches to delineate molecular mechanisms underlying stem cell-related characteristics in leukemia cells.","['Aqaqe, Nasma', 'Yassin, Muhammad', 'Yassin, Abed Alkader', 'Ershaid, Nour', 'Katz-Even, Chen', 'Zipin-Roitman, Adi', 'Kugler, Eitan', 'Lechman, Eric R', 'Gan, Olga I', 'Mitchell, Amanda', 'Dick, John E', 'Izraeli, Shai', 'Milyavsky, Michael']","['Aqaqe N', 'Yassin M', 'Yassin AA', 'Ershaid N', 'Katz-Even C', 'Zipin-Roitman A', 'Kugler E', 'Lechman ER', 'Gan OI', 'Mitchell A', 'Dick JE', 'Izraeli S', 'Milyavsky M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9527-8317', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5083-0809']","['Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Schneider Children Medical Center Petah-Tikva, Israel.', ""The Gene Development and Environment Pediatric Research Institute, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel."", 'Department of Molecular Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network and Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Schneider Children Medical Center Petah-Tikva, Israel.', ""The Gene Development and Environment Pediatric Research Institute, Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel."", 'Department of Molecular Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pathology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. mmilyavsky@post.tau.ac.il.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190607,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ERG protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous/*methods']",,2019/06/09 06:00,2020/04/16 06:00,['2019/06/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['0008-5472.CAN-18-3215 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3215 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2019 Aug 1;79(15):3862-3876. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-18-3215.

We aimed to assess whether single-agent quizartinib, an oral, highly potent and selective type II FLT3 inhibitor, improves overall survival versus salvage chemotherapy. METHODS: QuANTUM-R is a randomised, controlled, phase 3 trial done at 152 hospitals and cancer centres in 19 countries. Eligible patients aged 18 years or older with ECOG performance status 0-2 with relapsed or refractory (duration of first composite complete remission </=6 months) FLT3-ITD acute myeloid leukaemia after standard therapy with or without allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation were randomly assigned (2:1; permuted block size of 6; stratified by response to previous therapy and choice of chemotherapy via a phone-based and web-based interactive response system) to quizartinib (60 mg [30 mg lead-in] orally once daily) or investigator's choice of preselected chemotherapy: subcutaneous low-dose cytarabine (subcutaneous injection of cytarabine 20 mg twice daily on days 1-10 of 28-day cycles); intravenous infusions of mitoxantrone (8 mg/m(2) per day), etoposide (100 mg/m(2) per day), and cytarabine (1000 mg/m(2) per day on days 1-5 of up to two 28-day cycles); or intravenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (300 mug/m(2) per day or 5 mug/kg per day subcutaneously on days 1-5), fludarabine (intravenous infusion 30 mg/m(2) per day on days 2-6), cytarabine (intravenous infusion 2000 mg/m(2) per day on days 2-6), and idarubicin (intravenous infusion 10 mg/m(2) per day on days 2-4 in up to two 28-day cycles). Patients proceeding to haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation after quizartinib could resume quizartinib after haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02039726, and follow-up is ongoing. FINDINGS: Between May 7, 2014, and Sept 13, 2017, 367 patients were enrolled, of whom 245 were randomly allocated to quizartinib and 122 to chemotherapy. Four patients in the quizartinib group and 28 in the chemotherapy group were not treated. Median follow-up was 23.5 months (IQR 15.4-32.3). Overall survival was longer for quizartinib than for chemotherapy (hazard ratio 0.76 [95% CI 0.58-0.98; p=0.02]). Median overall survival was 6.2 months (5.3-7.2) in the quizartinib group and 4.7 months (4.0-5.5) in the chemotherapy group. The most common non-haematological grade 3-5 treatment-emergent adverse events (within </=30 days of last dose or >30 days if suspected to be a treatment-related event) for quizartinib (241 patients) and chemotherapy (94 patients) were sepsis or septic shock (46 patients [19%] for quizartinib vs 18 [19%] for chemotherapy), pneumonia (29 [12%] vs eight [9%]), and hypokalaemia (28 [12%] vs eight [9%]). The most frequent treatment-related serious adverse events were febrile neutropenia (18 patients [7%]), sepsis or septic shock (11 [5%]), QT prolongation (five [2%]), and nausea (five [2%]) in the quizartinib group, and febrile neutropenia (five [5%]), sepsis or septic shock (four [4%]), pneumonia (two [2%]), and pyrexia (two [2%]) in the chemotherapy group. Grade 3 QT prolongation in the quizartinib group was uncommon (eight [3%] by central reading, ten [4%] by investigator report); no grade 4 events occurred. There were 80 (33%) treatment-emergent deaths in the quizartinib group (31 [13%] of which were due to adverse events) and 16 (17%) in the chemotherapy group (nine [10%] of which were due to adverse events). INTERPRETATION: Treatment with quizartinib had a survival benefit versus salvage chemotherapy and had a manageable safety profile in patients with rapidly proliferative disease and very poor prognosis. Quizartinib could be considered a new standard of care. Given that there are only a few available treatment options, this study highlights the value of targeting the FLT3-ITD driver mutation with a highly potent and selective FLT3 inhibitor.

In this study, we used oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) to stimulate rat adrenal medulla-derived pheochromocytoma cell line PC-12 to construct an in vitro IS cell model and investigated the role of ANRIL and the underlying mechanism. PC-12 cells were stimulated by OGD and/or transfected with pc-ANRIL, si-ANRIL, miR-127 mimic, miR-127 inhibitor, pEX-Mcl-1, sh-Mcl-1 and their negative controls. Cell viability, apoptosis, mRNA and protein expression was detected using CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry assay, qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Results showed that OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury and decreased ANRIL expression. ANRIL overexpression significantly reduced OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury evidenced by increasing cell viability and decreasing apoptosis, while ANRIL silence led to the opposite results. Meanwhile, dysregulation of ANRIL altered the expression of apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, ANRIL negatively regulated miR-127 expression. miR-127 overexpression significantly enhanced OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury. In addition, Mcl-1 expression was negatively regulated by miR-127, besides ANRIL up-regulated Mcl-1 expression by down-regulation of miR-127. Mcl-1 overexpression alleviated cell injury and miR-127 silence up-regulated Mcl-1 expression. In conclusion, lncRNA ANRIL alleviated OGD-induced PC-12 cell injury as evidenced.

The proposed molecule is a simple modification of nilotinib and has a docking energy of 4.2kJ/mol better than the best intuitive molecule.","['Malkhasian, Aramice Y S', 'Howlin, Brendan J']","['Malkhasian AYS', 'Howlin BJ']",,"['Department of Chemistry, King Abdulaziz University, Faculty of Science, Jeddah, 21589, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Chemistry, FEPS, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.

The influence of the enzymes and temperature activity was studied. By determination of ideal reaction conditions, byproduct formation is minimized; this made it possible to prepare enantiomerically enriched allylic alcohols in high ee's and good yields. Enantiomerically enriched allylic alcohols were used for enantiomerically enriched oxazolidinone synthesis. Using benzoate as a leaving group means that 1mol % of potassium osmate is necessary and can be obtained high yields 98%. Inhibitory activities of enantiomerically enriched oxazolidinones (8, 10 and 12) were tested against human carbonic anhydrase I and II isoenzymes (hCA I and hCA II), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and alpha-glycosidase (alpha-Gly) enzymes. These enantiomerically enriched oxazolidinones derivatives had Ki values in the range of 11.6+/-2.1-66.4+/-22.7nM for hCA I, 34.1+/-6.7-45.2+/-12.9nM for hCA II, 16.5+/-2.9 to 35.6+/-13.9 for AChE, and 22.3+/-6.0-70.9+/-9.9nM for alpha-glycosidase enzyme. Moreover, they had high binding affinity with -5.767, -6.568, -9.014, and -8.563kcal/mol for hCA I, hCA II, AChE and alpha-glycosidase enzyme, respectively. These results strongly supported the promising nature of the enantiomerically enriched oxazolidinones as selective hCA, AChE, and alpha-glycosidase inhibitors. Overall, due to these derivatives' inhibitory potential on the tested enzymes, they are promising drug candidates for the treatment of diseases like glaucoma, leukemia, epilepsy; Alzheimer's disease; type-2 diabetes mellitus that are associated with high enzymatic activity of CA, AChE, and alpha-glycosidase.","['Atmaca, Ufuk', 'Kaya, Ruya', 'Karaman, Halide Sedef', 'Celik, Murat', 'Gulcin, Ilhami']","['Atmaca U', 'Kaya R', 'Karaman HS', 'Celik M', 'Gulcin I']",,"['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey; Oltu Vocational School, Ataturk University, 25400 Oltu-Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey; Central Research and Application Laboratory, Agri Ibrahim Cecen University, 04100 Agri, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, Ataturk University, 25240 Erzurum, Turkey.

We investigated optimal time points, thresholds, and candidates for the bone marrow WT1 MRD assay in 425 consecutive patients with AML who underwent allo-HSCT. WT1 expression kinetics before allo-HSCT and at 1 or 3 months after allo-HSCT were determined by real-time PCR using the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) normalized method. Relapsed patients had significantly higher WT1 levels before allo-HSCT and at 3 months after allo-HSCT. The best time point for the WT1 MRD assay was before allo-HSCT by the receiver operating characteristic curve. Among various thresholds, 250 copies recommended from ELN researchers were mostly predictive of post-transplant relapse. In multivariate analysis, WT1 MRD positivity independently predicted relapse, resulting in inferior survival. In subgroup analyses, pretransplant WT1 MRD positivity was predictive of post-transplant relapse in the intermediate group, whereas WT1 MRD positivity occurred at 3 months after allo-HSCT in favorable and adverse risk groups. Among MRD-positive patients before allo-HSCT, all patients who were MRD positive at 3 months relapsed within 6 months. The WT1 MRD assay before allo-HSCT or 3 months after allo-HSCT is useful for predicting post-transplant relapse with a different significance in each risk group by time points, showing the benefit of multiple tests over time. Such monitoring is particularly available in patients with AML without specific molecular targets.","['Cho, Byung-Sik', 'Min, Gi-June', 'Park, Sung-Su', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Yahng, Seung-Ah', 'Jeon, Young-Woo', 'Yoon, Jae-Ho', 'Lee, Sung-Eun', 'Eom, Ki-Seong', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Cho, Seok-Goo', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Kim, Myungsin', 'Kim, Younggu', 'Kim, Hee-Je']","['Cho BS', 'Min GJ', 'Park SS', 'Shin SH', 'Yahng SA', 'Jeon YW', 'Yoon JH', 'Lee SE', 'Eom KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK', 'Cho SG', 'Kim DW', 'Lee JW', 'Kim M', 'Kim Y', 'Kim HJ']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Division of acute leukemia, Catholic Hematology Hospital, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea;

This drug-drug interaction study assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK) of quizartinib when coadministered with strong or moderate cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitors. METHODS: In this parallel-group study, subjects were randomised to receive: (i) quizartinib + ketoconazole; (ii) quizartinib + fluconazole; or (iii) quizartinib alone. On Days 1-28, subjects received ketoconazole 200 mg or fluconazole 200 mg twice daily, and on Day 8, all subjects received a single 30-mg quizartinib dose. Blood samples were collected for PK analyses, steady-state PK parameters were simulated by superpositioning, and safety was assessed. RESULTS: Ninety-three healthy subjects were randomised; 86 completed the study. When administered with ketoconazole, geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for quizartinib maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time 0 extrapolated to infinity were 117% (105%, 130%) and 194% (169%, 223%), respectively, vs quizartinib alone. Steady-state PK simulation demonstrated ~2-fold increase of both steady-state Cmax and AUC from time 0 to the end of the dosing interval when quizartinib was administered with ketoconazole due to accumulation of quizartinib at steady state. When administered with fluconazole, geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for quizartinib Cmax and AUC from time 0 extrapolated to infinity were 111% (100%, 124%) and 120% (104%, 138%), respectively, vs quizartinib alone. Overall, 5.4% of subjects experienced quizartinib-related adverse events; no serious adverse events or deaths occurred. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest reducing the dose of quizartinib when coadministered with a strong CYP3A inhibitor, but not with a moderate or weak CYP3A inhibitor. This dose reduction was implemented in phase 3 evaluation of quizartinib.","['Li, Jianke', 'Kankam, Martin', 'Trone, Denise', 'Gammon, Guy']","['Li J', 'Kankam M', 'Trone D', 'Gammon G']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2643-8644'],"['Daiichi Sankyo, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Vince & Associates Clinical Research, Overland Park, KS, USA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo, Inc, San Diego, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190723,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benzothiazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/drug therapy/immunology', 'Ketoconazole/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",PMC6710528,2019/06/08 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.14022 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Sep;85(9):2108-2117. doi: 10.1111/bcp.14022.

Hyperdiploidy in adult B-ALL is much less common and its clinical significance has not been well studied. Among the 1205 patients with B-ALL (1018 adults and 187 children) from our institution, 78 had a hyperdiploid karyotype, including 45 (4.4%) adults and 33 (17.6%) children (P < 0.0001). Among the patients with hyperdiploid B-ALL, the adult group had a significantly inferior survival (similar to the patients with a normal karyotype) compared with the pediatric group (median survival: 42 months vs undefined, P = 0.0029). Hyperdiploidy in adults B-ALL tended to more frequently harbor structural abnormalities (two or more) than children (53% vs 33%). Two or more structural abnormalities in a hyperdiploidy correlated with an adverse survival in adult patients (33 months vs undefined, P = 0.0008), similar to the survival of patients with a complex karyotype. We conclude that hyperdiploidy in adults with B-ALL is less favorable and more commonly contains structural abnormalities comparing to pediatric patients. We suggest that hyperdiploidy with two or more structural abnormalities are best considered as a complex karyotype in adults with B-ALL.","['Chen, Zhining', 'Sun, Yi', 'Xie, Wei', 'Wang, Sa A', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Tang, Zhenya', 'Toruner, Gokce', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Tang, Guilin']","['Chen Z', 'Sun Y', 'Xie W', 'Wang SA', 'Hu S', 'Li S', 'Tang Z', 'Toruner G', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Tang G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9818-8640', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1815-7666', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9482-4806']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20190607,United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Young Adult']",PMC6675728,2019/06/08 06:00,2020/08/04 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2255 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Aug;8(9):4093-4099. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2255.

We propose a new method for precise renal involvement detection using 3-D enhanced computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. METHODS: Twenty-five children with ALL were evaluated utilizing 3-D enhanced CT reconstruction to measure renal volume before and after induction therapy, renal mass lesions and renal axis at diagnosis. Renal involvement was defined as a marked decrease of renal volume or the presence of mass lesions. RESULTS: According to the 3D-CT criteria, nine of 25 patients (36%) had renal involvement. All of them had bilateral mass lesions except for one who had diffuse nephromegaly alone. This method detected renal involvement more accurately than ultrasonography. When using conventional criteria based on the length of the renal axis, 19 of 25 (76%) had renal involvement, including many cases of false-positive nephromegaly. Patients with renal involvement had significantly more extramedullary involvement according to the 3D-CT-based criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The use of 3D-CT reconstruction was accurate in detecting renal involvement in childhood ALL, most of which consisted of piled up mass lesions. Patients with renal involvement should be worked up for the detection of other extramedullary lesions.","['Fujiki, Toshihiro', 'Nishimura, Ryosei', 'Mase, Shintaro', 'Kuroda, Rie', 'Ikawa, Yasuhiro', 'Araki, Raita', 'Maeba, Hideaki', 'Yachie, Akihiro']","['Fujiki T', 'Nishimura R', 'Mase S', 'Kuroda R', 'Ikawa Y', 'Araki R', 'Maeba H', 'Yachie A']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3526-4618', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7204-1766']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/mortality', 'Male', '*Models, Anatomic', 'Multidetector Computed Tomography/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,2019/06/08 06:00,2020/01/23 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13907 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2019 Jul;61(7):679-687. doi: 10.1111/ped.13907.,7,,,,['(c) 2019 Japan Pediatric Society.'],['NOTNLM'],"['3-D reconstruction', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'computed tomography', 'kidney', 'renal involvement']",,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to establish human primitive neural stem cells (pNSCs) from exogene-free hiPSCs without EB formation. To derive pNSCs, we optimized N2B27 neural differentiation medium through supplementation of two inhibitors, CHIR99021 (GSK-3 inhibitor) and PD0325901 (MEK inhibitor), and growth factors including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and human leukemia inhibitory factor (hLIF). Consequently, pNSCs were efficiently derived and cultured over a long term. pNSCs displayed differentiation potential into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. These early NSC types potentially promote the clinical application of hiPSCs to cure human neurological disorders.","['Shin, Woo Jung', 'Seo, Ji-Hye', 'Choi, Hyun Woo', 'Hong, Yean Ju', 'Lee, Won Ji', 'Chae, Jung Il', 'Kim, Sung Joo', 'Lee, Jeong Woong', 'Hong, Kwonho', 'Song, Hyuk', 'Park, Chankyu', 'Do, Jeong Tae']","['Shin WJ', 'Seo JH', 'Choi HW', 'Hong YJ', 'Lee WJ', 'Chae JI', 'Kim SJ', 'Lee JW', 'Hong K', 'Song H', 'Park C', 'Do JT']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6721-1441'],"['Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Dental Pharmacology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, BK21 Plus, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Animal Science, College of Agricultural Life Science, Chonbuk National University, Jeonbuk, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Dental Pharmacology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Oral Bioscience, BK21 Plus, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Department of Surgery, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Research Center of Integrative Cellulomics, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Daejeon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Stem Cell and Regenerative Biotechnology, KU Institute of Science and Technology, Konkuk University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190620,United States,J Comp Neurol,The Journal of comparative neurology,0406041,,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Neural Stem Cells/*physiology']",,2019/06/08 06:00,2020/10/10 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cne.24727 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comp Neurol. 2019 Dec 15;527(18):3023-3033. doi: 10.1002/cne.24727.

Resveratrol (Resv) is a natural botanical ingredient involved in several biological activities. It is still unclear in terms of whether Resv may exert anti-leukemia effects by regulating the PTEN-PI3K/AKT pathway. This study investigated the effect of Resv on leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis by regulating PTEN-PI3K/AKT pathway. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Human normal peripheral blood PBMC cells, and human acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB-4 and HL-60 cells were cultured in vitro. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mRNA expression. Western blot was adopted to test PTEN protein expression. HL-60 and NB-4 cells were treated with 0, 5, 10, and 20 muM Resv, respectively. Cell proliferation was analyzed by cell counting kit8 (CCK-8) assay. The level of caspase-3 was measured by Western blot. HL-60 cells were divided into control group, 20 muM Resv treatment group, and Resv+PTEN inhibitor SF1670 group. Cell apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was assessed by EdU staining. RESULTS: Compared with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), PTEN mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in NB-4 and HL-60 cells. Resv significantly inhibited the proliferation activity in HL-60 and NB-4 cells, and increased the activity of caspase-3. Resv treatment up-regulated the expression of PTEN and reduced the expression of p-AKT protein in HL-60 cells. However, Resv treatment markedly suppressed the proliferation of HL-60 and induced apoptosis. SF1670 treatment in the presence of Resv significantly antagonized the down-regulation of p-AKT protein expression induced by Resv, resulting in decreased apoptosis and enhanced cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Resv can up-regulate PTEN expression and inhibit the activity of PI3K/AKT pathway to play an anti-leukemia effect through suppressing cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis.","['Meng, J', 'Liu, G-J', 'Song, J-Y', 'Chen, L', 'Wang, A-H', 'Gao, X-X', 'Wang, Z-J']","['Meng J', 'Liu GJ', 'Song JY', 'Chen L', 'Wang AH', 'Gao XX', 'Wang ZJ']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Weifang Medical College, Weifang, Shandong, China. ko44cqw2@sina.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'M03GIQ7Z6P (Sincalide)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/*genetics', 'Sincalide/metabolism']",,2019/06/08 06:00,2020/09/18 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201905_17933 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 May;23(10):4285-4292. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201905_17933.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, valuable molecular diagnostic research is rare. In the present study, plasmids silencing and overexpressing highmobility group AThook 2 (HMGA2) were respectively transfected in HL60 and NB4 cells. The effects of HMGA2 on AML cell viability, apoptosis, migration and invasion were determined by preforming MTT, flow cytometry, wound scratch and Transwell assays, respectively. Genes associated with apoptosis and Wnt signaling were evaluated by reverse transcriptionquantitative (RTq)PCR and western blotting. AML cell sensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR) and the regulatory effects of the Wnt signaling pathway via HMGA2 following treatment with the agonist LiCl or antagonist XAV939 were detected by MTT, RTqPCR and western blot analysis. The results revealed that the expression of HMGA2 was elevated more so in HL60, KG1, U937, Kasumi1, THP1 and K562 cells than in NB4 cells. Silencing HMGA2 suppressed cell viability, migration and invasion, enhanced cell apoptosis and sensitivity to DNR, and almost restored the DNR inhibitory function that was promoted by LiCl treatment. In addition, low expression of HMGA2 attenuated Xlinked inhibitor of apoptosis and Bcl2 mRNA and protein levels, and upregulated the expression of Bax and cleavedcaspase3. Furthermore, silencing HMGA2 not only decreased Wnt and nonphosphobetacatenin expressions, but also partially reversed the increased expressions of these proteins induced by LiCl treatment. On the other hand, overexpression of HMGA2 exhibited the opposite results after transfection in NB4 cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that HMGA2 played important roles in driving AML progression and chemosensitivity in HL60 and NB4 cells, potentially by activating the Wnt/betacatenin signaling pathway. Therefore, it was suggested that HMGA2 may be a promising molecular marker for AML diagnosis.","['Yang, Shuo', 'Gu, Yueli', 'Wang, Genjie', 'Hu, Qingzhu', 'Chen, Shuxia', 'Wang, Yong', 'Zhao, Mingfeng']","['Yang S', 'Gu Y', 'Wang G', 'Hu Q', 'Chen S', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao M']",,"['First Center Clinic College of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300192, P.R.

We have developed an innovative Bayesian approach that efficiently identifies clusters of proteins that exhibit similar patterns of expression. Motivated by the availability of ion mobility mass spectrometry data on cell line experiments in myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia, our methodology can identify proteins that follow biologically meaningful trends of expression.

Bone marrow (BM), peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC), and cord blood (CB) are the predominant sources of stem cells. Recently a new type of stem cell with a pluripotent potential has been identified. These cells were named ""very small embryonic like stem cells (VSELs)"". It is claimed that VSEL stem cells can be found in adult BM, peripheral blood (PB), CB and other body tissues. This study is designed to characterize and isolate VSEL stem cells from different human hematopoietic sources; CB, PB and apheresis material (PBPC). VSEL stem cells were isolated from MNC and erythrocyte layers for all materials by using centrifugation and ficoll gradient method. We determined embryonic markers by flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and western blotting methods. Results from western blotting and immunofluorescence show high level of NANOG and OCT4 protein expression in PB, apheresis material and CB. Immunofluorescence images showed cytoplasmic and nuclear presence of these proteins. Flow cytometry results exhibited a higher expression of VSELs markers on debris area than CD45- population and higher expression on CB than PB. As a result, these findings have shown that it is necessary to investigate the function of pluripotent stem cell markers in differentiated adult cells. We further conclude that erythrocyte lysis method had the highest cell recovery amount among erythrocyte lysis and ficoll gradient methods. Consequently, this study gives us new information and viewpoints about expression of pluripotent stem cell (PSC) markers in adult tissues.","['Kuruca, Serap Erdem', 'Celik, Dolay Damla', 'Ozerkan, Dilsad', 'Erdemir, Gokce']","['Kuruca SE', 'Celik DD', 'Ozerkan D', 'Erdemir G']",,"['Deparment of Physiology, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Deparment of Physiology, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetic and Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, Kastamonu University, Kastamonu, Turkey. dilsadokan@gmail.com.', 'Deparment of Molecular Medicine, The Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/growth & development', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/08/05 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-019-09896-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-019-09896-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2019 Oct;15(5):730-742. doi: 10.1007/s12015-019-09896-1.,5,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apheresis', '*Cord blood', '*Peripheral blood', '*Pluripotent stem cell markers', '*Very small embryonic-like (VSEL) stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We present a patient with HS, which appeared as a breast mass 12 months after the initial diagnosis of B-ALL. RESULTS: Both HS and the B-ALL shared IGH-MYC and IGK gene rearrangements. Next-generation sequencing and whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies detected 35 common mutations, as well as mutations unique to B-ALL (16) and HS (15), including BRAF D594G. The patient achieved complete remission of B-ALL, but HS failed to respond to many cycles of intensive chemotherapy regimens. A partial response was achieved with sorafenib, a BRAF-targeted therapy. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate by WES that clonally related B-ALL and HS arise through divergent evolution from a common precursor. We present our findings together with a discussion of the previously reported cases of HS in patients with B-ALL.","['Geyer, Julia T', 'Yigit, Nuri', 'Miyaguchi, Ayako', 'Cheng, Shuhua', 'Casano, Joseph', 'Mathew, Susan', 'Desai, Pinkal', 'Gergis, Usama', 'Tam, Wayne']","['Geyer JT', 'Yigit N', 'Miyaguchi A', 'Cheng S', 'Casano J', 'Mathew S', 'Desai P', 'Gergis U', 'Tam W']",,"['Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.', 'Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine/NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)'],IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['5512257 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz056 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Sep 9;152(4):486-494. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz056.,4,,,,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Vitamin B12 deficiency most commonly presents as megaloblastic anemia but can also be associated with pancytopenia. It can present with a range of symptoms associated with anemia and gastrointestinal or neurological systems. Understanding the etiology of the deficiency is crucial for initiating proper treatments. Case Report: A 19-year-old patient presented with complaints of dyspnea and fever, myalgia and generalized tiredness. Examinations found him to suffer pancytopenia and esophageal candidiasis caused by vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency can be associated to inadequate intake and the diet of the patient as a vegetarian. Parenteral B12 treatment led the patient to symptomatically improve. Conclusion: Vitamin B12 deficiency is a reversible cause of bone marrow failure and can be easily treated if diagnosed early enough. Eggs and animal-derived foods constitute the usual source of this vitamin. Vitamin B12 deficiency should therefore be of high index suspicion to a clinician if the patient presents in similar conditions with a vegetarian diet. In the event of the deficiency being caused by inadequate intake or intrinsic factor deficiency, the treatment can be started quickly leading to the dramatic improvement of the patient's condition.","['Bhattacharjee, Atasi', 'Easo Samuel, Arpith']","['Bhattacharjee A', 'Easo Samuel A']",,"['Department of Emergency Medicine, Baby Memorial Hospital, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Baby Memorial Hospital, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20181117,Iran,Adv J Emerg Med,Advanced journal of emergency medicine,101745107,,,,PMC6548118,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/06/07 06:01,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22114/AJEM.v0i0.103 [doi]'],epublish,Adv J Emerg Med. 2018 Nov 17;3(2):e19. doi: 10.22114/AJEM.v0i0.103. eCollection 2019 Spring.,2,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anemia', 'Dyspnea', 'Megaloblastic', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency']",,,,,,,,,,,

MYC plays a central role by coordinating hyperactive protein synthesis with upregulated transcription in order to support rapid proliferation of tumor cells. Translation initiation inhibitor rocaglates have been identified as the most potent drugs in MYC-driven lymphomas as they efficiently inhibit MYC expression and tumor cell viability. We found that this class of compounds can overcome eIF4A abundance by stabilizing target mRNA-eIF4A interaction that directly prevents translation. Proteome-wide quantification demonstrated selective repression of multiple critical oncoproteins in addition to MYC in B-cell lymphoma including NEK2, MCL1, AURKA, PLK1, and several transcription factors that are generally considered undruggable. Finally, (-)-SDS-1-021, the most promising synthetic rocaglate, was confirmed to be highly potent as a single agent, and displayed significant synergy with the BCL2 inhibitor ABT199 in inhibiting tumor growth and survival in primary lymphoma cells in vitro and in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. Overall, our findings support the strategy of using rocaglates to target oncoprotein synthesis in MYC-driven lymphomas.","['Zhang, Xuan', 'Bi, Chengfeng', 'Lu, Ting', 'Zhang, Weiwei', 'Yue, Ting', 'Wang, Cheng', 'Tian, Tian', 'Zhang, Xiaoyan', 'Huang, Yuhua', 'Lunning, Matthew', 'Hao, Xinbao', 'Brown, Lauren E', 'Devine, William G', 'Vose, Julie', 'Porco, John A Jr', 'Fu, Kai']","['Zhang X', 'Bi C', 'Lu T', 'Zhang W', 'Yue T', 'Wang C', 'Tian T', 'Zhang X', 'Huang Y', 'Lunning M', 'Hao X', 'Brown LE', 'Devine WG', 'Vose J', 'Porco JA Jr', 'Fu K']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9489-484X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1015-7434']","['Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Departments of Hematology and Pathology, Sino-US lymphoma Center, Hainan Medical University First Affiliated Hospital, Haikou, Hainan, China.', 'Center for Molecular Discovery (BU-CMD), Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Discovery (BU-CMD), Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Center for Molecular Discovery (BU-CMD), Boston University, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology, Hematology and Oncology, Fred & Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA. kfu@unmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190606,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Aglaia', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6895415,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0503-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0503-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):138-150. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0503-z.

We recently showed that ethanol exposure can lead to pre-mRNA missplicing of Mcl-1, a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family, by downregulating the expression levels of serine/arginine rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1). Little is known about the physiological expression of these isoforms in neuronal cells and their role in toxicity induced by alcohol exposure during the developmental period. In order to investigate the impact of alcohol exposure on alternative splicing of Mcl-1 pre-mRNA and its role in neurotoxicity, we developed a unique primary human neuronal culture model where neurospheres (hNSPs), neural progenitors (hNPCs), immature neurons, and mature neurons were cultured from the matching donor fetal brain tissues. Our data suggest that neural progenitors and immature neurons are highly sensitive to the toxic effects of ethanol, while mature neuron cultures showed resistance to ethanol exposure. Further analysis of Mcl-1 pre-mRNA alternative splicing by semi-quantitative and quantitative analysis revealed that ethanol exposure causes a significant decrease in Mcl-1L/Mcl-1S ratio in a dose and time dependent manner in neural progenitors. Interestingly, ectopic expression of Mcl-1L isoform in neural progenitors was able to recover the viability loss and apoptosis induced by alcohol exposure. Altogether, these observations suggest that alternative splicing of Mcl-1 may play a crucial role in neurotoxicity associated with alcohol exposure in the developing fetal brain.","['Donadoni, Martina', 'Cicalese, Stephanie', 'Sarkar, Dipak K', 'Chang, Sulie L', 'Sariyer, Ilker Kudret']","['Donadoni M', 'Cicalese S', 'Sarkar DK', 'Chang SL', 'Sariyer IK']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6212-2447'],"['Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA.', 'The Endocrine Program, Department of Animal Sciences, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 67 Poultry Lane, New Brunswick, NJ, 08901, USA.', 'Institute of NeuroImmune Pharmacology and Department of Biological Sciences, Seton Hall University, South Orange, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Neuroscience, Center for Neurovirology, Temple University Lewis Katz School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, 19140, USA. isariyer@temple.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190606,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SRSF1 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Brain/drug effects/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ethanol/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Neurons/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Organoids/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/analysis/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6554352,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/07/18 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1673-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1673-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Jun 6;10(6):447. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1673-3.,6,"['R37 AA008757/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 MH092177/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AA025398/AA/NIAAA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed 126 patients with HR-AML after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCST). RESULTS The disease-free survival (DFS) rates of 1 year and 3 years were 58.83% (95%CI: 50.75-68.20%) and 53.09% (95%CI: 44.59-63.22%) respectively. The cumulative relapse rates of 1 year and 3 years were 21.1% (95%CI: 14.4-28.8%) and 25.9% (95%CI: 18.1-34.5%) respectively. The cumulative incidences of III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) for 100 days was 8.70% (95%CI: 4.6-14.5%). The cumulative rate of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) for 1-year was 4.1% (95%CI: 1.5-8.7%). The cumulative transplantation related mortality rate of 1 year and 3 years were 20.1% (95%CI: 13.6-27.6%) and 21.0% (95%CI: 14.3-28.6%) respectively. Univariate analysis revealed that lower overall survival was correlated with age, bacterial or fungal infection, disease status at transplantation, III-IV aGVHD, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), white blood cell engraftment, and extramedullary involvement (P<0.05). The results of multivariate analysis were that the aforementioned factors were also related to lower overall survival except for PTLD (P<0.05). The results of univariate and multivariate analysis were that extramedullary involvement, III-IV aGVHD, and status pre-transplantation influenced DFS (P<0.05). The risk factors for relapse were status pre-transplantation and extramedullary involvement by univariate and multivariate analysis (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS HR-AML has inferior prognosis. Our study indicated the necessity of achieving remission status prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and administration of preventive treatments on high-risk patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

One of the hallmarks of ALT cancer is the excessively clustered telomeres in promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, represented as large bright telomere foci. Here, we present a model system that generates telomere clustering in nuclear polySUMO (small ubiquitin-like modification)/polySIM (SUMO-interacting motif) condensates, analogous to PML bodies, and thus artificially engineered ALT-associated PML body (APB)-like condensates in vivo. We observed that the ALT-like phenotypes (i.e., a small fraction of heterogeneous telomere lengths and formation of C circles) are rapidly induced by introducing the APB-like condensates together with BLM through its helicase domain, accompanied by ssDNA generation and RPA accumulation at telomeres. Moreover, these events lead to mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) at telomeres mediated by RAD52 through its highly conserved N-terminal domain. We propose that the clustering of large amounts of telomeres in human cancers promotes ALT that is mediated by MiDAS, analogous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae type II ALT survivors.","['Min, Jaewon', 'Wright, Woodring E', 'Shay, Jerry W']","['Min J', 'Wright WE', 'Shay JW']",,"['Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, 75390, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190606,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (RAD52 protein, human)', '0 (Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', '*Mitosis', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Transport', 'Rad52 DNA Repair and Recombination Protein/*metabolism', 'RecQ Helicases/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics/metabolism', 'Telomere Homeostasis/*genetics']",PMC6601508,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/09/13 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.324905.119 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.324905.119 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2019 Jul 1;33(13-14):814-827. doi: 10.1101/gad.324905.119.

Recently, ibrutinib has been associated with the occurrence of invasive fungal infections, in particular invasive aspergillosis. The mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility to fungal infections associated with exposure to ibrutinib are currently unknown. Innate immunity, in particular polymer-phonuclear neutrophils, represents the cornerstone of anti-Aspergillus immunity; however, the potential impact of ibrutinib on neutrophils has been little studied. Our study investigated the response to Aspergillus fumigatus and neutrophil function in patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia or lymphoma, who were undergoing ibrutinib therapy. We studied the consequences of ibrutinib exposure on the functions and anti-Aspergillus responses of neutrophils obtained from healthy donors and 63 blood samples collected at different time points from 32 patients receiving ibrutinib for lymphoid malignancies. We used both flow cytometry and video-microscopy approaches to analyze neutrophils' cell surface molecule expression, cytokine production, oxidative burst, chemotaxis and killing activity against Aspergillus Ibrutinib is associated, both in vitro and in patients under treatment, with multiple functional defects in neutrophils, including decreased production of reactive oxygen species, impairment of their capacity to engulf Aspergillus and inability to efficiently kill germinating conidia. Our results demonstrate that ibrutinib-exposed neutrophils develop significant functional defects that impair their response against Aspergillus fumigatus, providing a plausible explanation for the emergence of invasive aspergillosis in ibrutinib-treated patients.","['Blez, Damien', 'Blaize, Marion', 'Soussain, Carole', 'Boissonnas, Alexandre', 'Meghraoui-Kheddar, Aida', 'Menezes, Natacha', 'Portalier, Anais', 'Combadiere, Christophe', 'Leblond, Veronique', 'Ghez, David', 'Fekkar, Arnaud']","['Blez D', 'Blaize M', 'Soussain C', 'Boissonnas A', 'Meghraoui-Kheddar A', 'Menezes N', 'Portalier A', 'Combadiere C', 'Leblond V', 'Ghez D', 'Fekkar A']",,"[""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris."", ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris."", 'Hematologie, Institut Curie - Site de Saint-Cloud, Saint-Cloud.', ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris."", ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris."", 'Service de Parasitologie Mycologie, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris.', ""Service d'Hematologie, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris."", ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris."", ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris."", ""Service d'Hematologie, AP-HP, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France."", ""Sorbonne Universite, INSERM, CNRS, Centre d'Immunologie et des Maladies Infectieuses, Cimi-Paris, Paris arnaud.fekkar@aphp.fr."", 'Service de Parasitologie Mycologie, Assistance Publique - Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20200131,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Piperidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', '*Aspergillosis/drug therapy', '*Aspergillus fumigatus', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils', 'Piperidines', 'Spores, Fungal']",PMC7012467,2019/06/07 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.219220 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.219220 [doi]']",epublish,Haematologica. 2020 Jan 31;105(2):478-489. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.219220.

PFS was significantly associated with age, EQ-5D index, baseline World Health Organization classification, bone marrow blast count, cytogenetic risk category, number of cytopenias, and country. Transfusion dose density was inversely associated with PFS (P<1x10(-4)): dose density had an increasing effect on hazard until a dose density of 3 units/16 weeks. The transfusion dose density effect continued to increase beyond 8 units/16 weeks after correction for the impact of treatment with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, lenalidomide and/or iron chelators. In conclusion, the negative effect of transfusion treatment on PFS already occurs at transfusion densities below 3 units/16 weeks. This indicates that transfusion dependency, even at relatively low dose densities, may be considered as an indicator of inferior PFS.

We aimed to examine the robustness of EFS, specifically timing of complete remission (CR) in defining induction failure and impact of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The study included 1884 untreated AML patients enrolled across 5 trials conducted through Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology using anthracycline and cytarabine induction chemotherapy. EFS was defined as time from randomization/registration to induction failure, relapse, or death. Three definitions of induction failure were evaluated: failure to achieve CR by 60 days after randomization/registration, failure to achieve CR by the end of all protocol-defined induction courses, and failure to achieve CR by the end of all protocol-defined treatment. We considered either censoring or no censoring at time of non-protocol-mandated HCT. Although relapse and death are firm end points, the determination of induction failure was not consistent across studies. There was minimal impact of censoring at HCT on EFS estimates; however, median EFS estimates differed considerably based on the timing of CR in defining induction failure, with the magnitude of difference being large enough in most cases to lead to incorrect conclusions about efficacy in a single-arm trial, if the trial definition was not consistent with the definition used for the historical control. Timing of CR should be carefully examined in the historical control data used to guide the design of single-arm trials using EFS as the primary end point.

TFR is now a treatment goal for select patients who have experienced a sustained deep molecular response. An expected result of TFR would be a decrease in the frequency or intensity of adverse events (AEs) associated with TKI therapy. Unexpectedly, however, some clinical trials have reported new or worsening AEs, typically described as musculoskeletal pain, in patients attempting TFR. These AEs are hypothesized to be a TKI withdrawal syndrome, although the underlying mechanism is not known. Overall, musculoskeletal pain has been reported in approximately 20% to 30% of patients attempting TFR and is typically transient and easily managed. TKI cessation would be expected to improve patients' quality of life (QOL); however, in studies assessing QOL, patients have reported little change after ceasing TKI therapy, perhaps because they must tolerate long-term TKI therapy before they can attempt TFR. Here we review reports of musculoskeletal pain during TFR and changes in QOL after TKI cessation in clinical trials. As more patients attempt TFR in routine practice, the health care community will play an important role in helping these patients understand the benefits and risks of TFR, the effect it may have on their QOL, and the potential for musculoskeletal pain.","['Kota, Vamsi', 'Atallah, Ehab']","['Kota V', 'Atallah E']",,"['Section of Hematology and Oncology, Georgia Cancer Center, Augusta University, Augusta, GA.

This study aimed to detect the alterations in the topological organization of structural covariance networks of ALL patients. METHODS: This study included 28 ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy and 20 matched healthy controls. We calculated the gray matter volume of 90 brain regions based on an automated anatomical labeling template and applied graph theoretical analysis to compare the topological parameters of the gray matter structural networks between the two groups. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that both the ALL and healthy control groups exhibited a small-world topology across the range of densities. Compared to healthy controls, ALL patients had less highly interactive nodes and a reduced degree/betweenness in temporal regions, which may contribute to impaired memory and executive functions in these patients. CONCLUSION: These results reveal that ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment may have decreased regional connectivity and reduced efficiency of their structural covariance network. This is the first report of anomalous large-scale gray matter structural networks in ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment and provides new insights regarding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the chemo-brain network.","['Wang, Longsheng', 'Zou, Liwei', 'Chen, Qi', 'Su, Lianzi', 'Xu, Jiajia', 'Zhao, Ru', 'Shan, Yanqi', 'Zhang, Qing', 'Zhai, Zhimin', 'Gong, Xijun', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Tao, Fangbiao', 'Zheng, Suisheng']","['Wang L', 'Zou L', 'Chen Q', 'Su L', 'Xu J', 'Zhao R', 'Shan Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Zhai Z', 'Gong X', 'Zhao H', 'Tao F', 'Zheng S']",,"['Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; Medical Image Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; Medical Image Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Radiology, the Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; Medical Image Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, School of Public Health, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China; Anhui Provincial Key Laboratory of Population Health and Aristogenics, Hefei, Anhui, China.

However, the prognostic value of mRNA expressions of these CD markers in AML remains unclear. Through our pilot evaluation, IL2RA mRNA expression appeared to be the best candidate as a prognostic biomarker. Therefore, the aim of this study is to characterize the prognostic value of IL2RA mRNA expression and evaluate its potential to refine prognostification in AML. METHODS: In a cohort of 239 newly diagnosed AML patients, IL2RA mRNA expression were measured by TaqMan realtime quantitative PCR. Morphological, cytogenetics and mutational analyses were also performed. In an intermediate-risk AML cohort with 66 patients, the mRNA expression of prognostic biomarkers (BAALC, CDKN1B, ERG, MECOM/EVI1, FLT3, ID1, IL2RA, MN1 and WT1) were quantified by NanoString technology. A TCGA cohort was analyzed to validate the prognostic value of IL2RA. For statistical analysis, Mann-Whitney U test, Fisher exact test, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used. RESULTS: In AML cohort of 239 patients, high IL2RA mRNA expression independently predicted shorter relapse free survival (RFS, p < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, p < 0.001) irrespective of age, cytogenetics, FLT3-ITD or c-KIT D816V mutational status. In core binding factor (CBF) AML, high IL2RA mRNA expression correlated with FLT3-ITD status (p = 0.023). Multivariable analyses revealed that high IL2RA expression (p = 0.002), along with c-KIT D816V status (p = 0.013) significantly predicted shorter RFS, whereas only high IL2RA mRNA expression (p = 0.014) significantly predicted shorter OS in CBF AML. In intermediate-risk AML in which multiple gene expression markers were tested by NanoString, IL2RA significantly correlated with ID1 (p = 0.006), FLT3 (p = 0.007), CDKN1B (p = 0.033) and ERG (p = 0.030) expressions. IL2RA (p < 0.001) and FLT3 (p = 0.008) expressions remained significant in predicting shorter RFS, whereas ERG (p = 0.008) and IL2RA (p = 0.044) remained significant in predicting shorter OS. Similar analyses in TCGA intermediate-risk AML showed the independent prognostic role of IL2RA in predicting event free survival (p < 0.001) and OS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: High IL2RA mRNA expression is an independent and adverse prognostic factor in AML and specifically stratifies patients to worse prognosis in both CBF and intermediate-risk AML.","['Du,

This is based on the expression of antigens associated with the pro-B and pre-B stages of B-cell development. Antigenic markers can be detected by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry (IHC), but no comparison of results from these techniques has been reported for murine B-ALL/LBL. In our analysis of 30 cases induced by chemical or viral mutagenesis on a WT or Pax5(+/-) background, 18 (60%) were diagnosed as pro-B by both flow cytometry and IHC. Discordant results were found for 12 (40%); 6 were designated pro-B by IHC and pre-B by flow cytometry and the reverse for the remaining 6 cases. Discordance occurred because different markers were used to define the pro-B-to-pre-B transition by IHC vs flow cytometry. IHC expression of cytoplasmic IgM (muIgM) defined the pre-B stage, whereas the common practice of using CD25 as a surrogate marker in flow cytometry was employed here. These results show that CD25 and muIgM are not always concurrently expressed in B-ALL/LBL, in contrast to normal B-cell development. Therefore, when subtyping B-ALL/LBL in mice, an IHC panel of B220, PAX5, TdT, c-Kit/CD117, CD43, IgM, and KappaLC should be considered. For flow cytometry, cytoplasmic IgM may be an appropriate marker in conjunction with the surface markers B220, CD19, CD43, c-Kit/CD117, BP-1, and CD25.","['Janke, Laura J', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Dang, Jinjun', 'Rehg, Jerold E']","['Janke LJ', 'Mullighan CG', 'Dang J', 'Rehg JE']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9871-6239'],"[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190606,United States,Vet Pathol,Veterinary pathology,0312020,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7140381,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/06/08 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0300985819852138 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Pathol. 2019 Nov;56(6):950-958. doi: 10.1177/0300985819852138.

Methods: This single center, retrospective study included 211 patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2016, who received 10-day decitabine, low-intensity therapy or high-intensity therapy. Cox regression examined the impact of therapy on OS. Results: Younger patients were more likely to receive high-intensity therapy. Patients who received low-intensity therapy had worse OS compared with high-intensity therapy (median OS: 1.2 vs 8.5 months; p < 0.01). OS was similar with 10-day decitabine (median OS of 6.3 months) compared with either low-intensity therapy or high-intensity therapy.

Among the synthesized compounds, methyl (Z)-2-(isothioureidomethyl)-2-pentenoate hydrobromide (IS-MF08) showed conspicuous activity. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of action of IS-MF08. Our results showed that its mechanism most likely is related with the membrane receptor Fas and subsequent activation of the extrinsic cell death pathway, triggered by a decrease in the levels of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and caspase-8 and -3 cascade activation, causing DNA damage and mitotic arrest. IS-MF08 also caused an increase in intracellular ROS, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, resulting in organelle degradation as an attempt to reestablish cell homeostasis. Furthermore, cells exposed to IS-MF08 combined to an autophagy inhibitor were less susceptible to compound's cytotoxicity, suggesting that autophagy makes part of its mechanism of action. These data support the hypothesis that IS-MF08 acts by the apoptosis extrinsic pathway and possibly by autophagy as mechanisms of cell death.","['Assuncao, Laura Sartori', 'Kretzer, Iara Fabricia', 'Sierra Restrepo, Jelver Alexander', 'de Mello Junior, Leonidas Joao', 'Silva, Adny Henrique', 'de Medeiros Oliveira, Eliana', 'Ferreira, Misael', 'Sa, Marcus Mandolesi', 'Creczynski-Pasa, Tania Beatriz']","['Assuncao LS', 'Kretzer IF', 'Sierra Restrepo JA', 'de Mello Junior LJ', 'Silva AH', 'de Medeiros Oliveira E', 'Ferreira M', 'Sa MM', 'Creczynski-Pasa TB']",,"['Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Fisica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio Central de Microscopia Eletronica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Quimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Farmaceuticas, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil; Departamento de Bioquimica, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brazil.

The nano-bioconjugates (AONP-ASNase and TONP-ASNase) were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and UV-Vis spectral analysis that revealed the successful immobilization. The nano-bioconjugates were optimally active at pH7.0 and 40 degrees C. TONP-ASNase activity was enhanced in the presence of NH4(+) (160%) and Mn(2+) (165%) while AONP-ASNase bioconjugates showed increased relative activity with ethyl acetate (142%) and toluene (160%). The nano-bioconjugates displayed excellent reusability and maintained >90% average activity after nine successive cycles. Maximum cytotoxicity (61%) was noticed with AONP-ASNase (10mug/ml) against human leukemia MOLT-4 cells. Regarding kinetic values, AONP-ASNase showed better affinity (Km 1.9mumol) to L-asparagine as compared to free L-ASNase.

Though having been discovered more than 50 years ago, and having been widely used in bone marrow transplantation to treat blood disorders including leukemia, expansion of HSCs remains an unmet task, thus affecting its more effective usage in clinical practice. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review article is to summarize past efforts in ex-vivo HSC expansion and to compare recent advances in expanding murine and human HSCs by targeting the N-methyladenosine (mA) pathway. RECENT FINDINGS: Unlike past many efforts that mainly target single or limited pathways and often lead to lineage bias or expansion of progenitor cells or limited long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), the blocking the degradation of mA pathway has an advantage of stabilizing hundreds of key factors required for maintaining HSCs, thus resulting in expansion of functional LT-HSCs. SUMMARY: The new approach of targeting the mA pathway has a promising application in clinical HSC-based transplantation.","['Li, Zhenrui', 'He, Xi C', 'Li, Linheng']","['Li Z', 'He XC', 'Li L']",,"['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.', 'Stowers Institute for Medical Research, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Missouri, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Self Renewal', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000506 [doi]', '00062752-201907000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2019 Jul;26(4):258-265. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000506.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined CXCR4 expression in 134 de novo AML and 21 controls by flow cytometry, evaluated the relationship between CXCR4 expression and clinical characteristics, and elucidated the prognostic significance of CXCR4 expression in AML prospectively. We found that the CXCR4 expression was significantly higher in AML patients than controls (P = .000). One hundred thirty four cases of de novo AML patients were divided into 2 groups according to the median of CXCR4 relative fluorescence intensity (RFI). CXCR4 high group (RFI >4.23) had markedly shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) than CXCR4 low group (RFI </=4.23) in 106 AML patients who received chemotherapy (P = .002; .026, respectively). Furthermore, in the 87 non-M3 patients who received induction therapy, there was a significant decrease for OS but not for DFS in the CXCR4 high group (P = .047 and .178, respectively). Moreover, high levels of CXCR4 expression independently increased the risk of relapse in both all AML and non-M3 patients who achieved complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy (odds ratio = 1.090, P = .010; odds ratio = 1.068, P = .048, respectively). Collectively, our data suggest that CXCR4 overexpression was an independent prognostic factor for disease relapse and poorer OS in both all AML and non-M3 patients. CXCR4 expression levels can be determined at disease presentation by the flow rapidly and easily. As such, CXCR4 could be used as a potential therapeutic target in AML patients with poor prognosis.","['Cao, Tingyong', 'Ye, Yuanxin', 'Liao, Hongyan', 'Shuai, Xiao', 'Jin, Yongmei', 'Su, Jun', 'Zheng, Qin']","['Cao T', 'Ye Y', 'Liao H', 'Shuai X', 'Jin Y', 'Su J', 'Zheng Q']",,"['Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Young Adult']",PMC6571391,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/06/18 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000015948 [doi]', '00005792-201906070-00052 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jun;98(23):e15948. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015948.,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invasion of the pancreas is extremely rare in adults. PATIENT CONCERNS: In this article, we report a case presenting that ALL invades the pancreas, as well as liver, kidney, and duodenum detected by magnetic resonance image. The patient was misdiagnosed as pancreatic tumor at initial since hemogram was unremarkable. DIAGNOSES: The diagnosis of ALL was established based on the endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration and bone marrow examination, showing BCR/ABL gene positive. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was actively treated with chemotherapy. Hematological remission was obtained and the lesions in the pancreas disappeared. OUTCOMES: The patient finally died of complication from fungal pneumonia and central nervous system involvement 12 months after diagnosis. LESSONS: Under the context of infection, persistent or intermittent fever and complete blood count are not significant prognoses of pancreatic involvement for adult with ALL. We hope that this case will help hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeon to be aware of this kind of disease as pancreatic carcinoma and pancreas involvement by ALL have totally different treatment strategy.","['Wang, Yinghao', 'Zhang, Xuzhao', 'Dong, Linping', 'Tang, Kezhong', 'Fang, Heqing', 'Tang, Zhe', 'Zhang, Bo']","['Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Dong L', 'Tang K', 'Fang H', 'Tang Z', 'Zhang B']",,"['Department of Surgery.', 'Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.', 'Department of Surgery.', 'Department of Surgery.', 'Department of Surgery.', 'Department of Surgery.', 'Department of Surgery.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Pancreas/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/pathology']",PMC6571396,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000015685 [doi]', '00005792-201906070-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jun;98(23):e15685. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000015685.,23,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to develop a Markov model with a lifetime time horizon to assess the cost effectiveness of ponatinib for third-line chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib) or alloHSCT from the public healthcare system perspective in Germany, Sweden, and Canada. METHODS: Clinical outcomes were derived from the literature, and from patient-level data (phase II PACE trial) for ponatinib. Resource use included drugs, alloHSCT, monitoring and follow-up, adverse events, and end-of-life care; costs were based on national tariffs. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using chronic myeloid leukemia health-state utilities from an international time-trade-off study. Costs and benefits were discounted at 3% per annum for Germany and Sweden, and 5% for Canada. RESULTS: Ponatinib yielded more discounted QALYs than any second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor/alloHSCT in all three countries, mainly owing to better response rates and longer durations of response. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors were US$21,543-37,755/QALY in Germany, $24,018-38,227/QALY in Sweden, and $43,001-58,515/QALY in Canada. Ponatinib was dominant over alloHSCT in Germany, while incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for ponatinib vs. alloHSCT in Sweden and Canada were $715/QALY and $31,534/QALY, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Ponatinib may improve outcomes (mainly because of higher response rates and longer response durations) at an acceptable cost level compared with other third-line treatment options for chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia in Germany, Sweden, and Canada; however, the lack of an indirect comparison is a limitation of our study.","['Hirt, Carsten', 'Iannazzo, Sergio', 'Chiroli, Silvia', 'McGarry, Lisa J', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Dahlen, Torsten', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H']","['Hirt C', 'Iannazzo S', 'Chiroli S', 'McGarry LJ', 'le Coutre P', 'Stenke L', 'Dahlen T', 'Lipton JH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3226-5954'],"['Department of Internal Medicine C, Hematology and Oncology, Greifswald University Medical Center, Greifswald, Germany.', 'SIHS Health Economics Consulting, SIHS SRL, Via Spalato 68, Turin, Italy. sergio.iannazzo@icloud.com.', 'Incyte Biosciences International Sarl, Epalinges, Switzerland.', 'Prothena Switzerland GmbH, Zug, Switzerland.', 'ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Charite, University of Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska University Hospital and Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Cancer Clinical Research Unit, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)']",IM,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*economics', 'Internationality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*economics', 'Pyridazines/*economics', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/07/04 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40258-019-00489-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s40258-019-00489-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2019 Aug;17(4):555-567. doi: 10.1007/s40258-019-00489-0.,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The clinical impact of SF3B1 mutation on CLL remains controversial especially for patients of Asian descent. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the frequency of SF3B1 mutation by Sanger sequencing in 399 newly diagnosed Chinese CLL patients. Results: SF3B1 mutation was detected in 5.5% (22/399) of the studied cohort with 59.1% of them being c.A2098G (p.K700E). SF3B1 mutation was common in patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene, positive CD38 and positive ZAP-70. Survival analysis showed that SF3B1 mutation was associated with short treatment-free survival (TFS), but not overall survival (OS). We then developed 2 new risk models, named CLL-IPI-S and CLL-PI, according to the SF3B1 mutation status and CLL-international prognostic index (CLL-IPI); CLL-PI showed greater power to predict TFS than CLL-IPI in Chinese CLL patients.

The true incidence of ibrutinib-related AF (IRAF) is not well known and its therapeutic management poses unique challenges especially due to the inherent risk of bleeding. We aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of IRAF, and to analyse its management and outcome. Methods: A standardised monitoring was applied at two cardio-oncology clinics in consecutive patients referred before and during ibrutinib therapy. The primary endpoint was the incidence of IRAF. The excess of AF incidence with ibrutinib was studied by comparing the incidence of IRAF with the expected incidence of AF in general population and in patients with CLL not exposed to ibrutinib. Results: 53 patients were included. The incidence of IRAF was 38% at 2 years and the risk was 15-fold higher than the AF risk in both the general population and patients with CLL not exposed to ibrutinib (p<0.0001). The majority of cases occurred in asymptomatic patients within the first 6 months. Left atrial volume index >/=40 mL/m(2) at treatment initiation identified patients at high risk of developing IRAF.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely reported to be involved in tumorigenesis of AML. Here, we define an important role of lncRNA HOTAIR in AML in relation to HOXA5 methylation. Methods: Firstly, the expression of HOTAIR was examined in AML samples and cells collected. Next, gain- or loss-of function experiments were conducted in AML cells to explore the effect of HOTAIR on AML. Then, relationship among HOXA5 promoter methylation, HOTAIR and Dnmt3b was measured. Expression of HOXA5 and cell proliferation/apoptosis-related genes was also detected. A last, in vivo assay was performed to assess the tumor formation in nude mice in order to explore the roles of HOTAIR and HOXA5 in cell apoptosis and proliferation. Results: LncRNA HOTAIR was found to be upregulated in AML cells and tissues. With silencing of HOTAIR and overexpression of HOXA5, AML cell proliferation was decreased while the apoptosis was induced. Furthermore, HOTAIR was observed to recruit Dnmt3b and to increase HOXA5 promoter methylation. Moreover, silencing HOTAIR and upregulating HOXA5 were found to induce apoptosis and reduce proliferation of AML cells in vivo. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the anti-tumor ability of HOTAIR silencing in AML, suggesting that silencing HOTAIR was able to inhibit AML progression through HOXA5 promoter demethylation by decreasing Dnmt3b.","['Wang, Si-Li', 'Huang, Yun', 'Su, Rui', 'Yu, Yong-Yang']","['Wang SL', 'Huang Y', 'Su R', 'Yu YY']",,"[""1Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, No. 55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, 361003 Fujian People's Republic of China.grid.412625.6"", ""2Department of Clinical Medicines, Fujian Medical University, No. 1, Xuefu North Road, Fuzhou, 350108 Fujian People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1797 9307grid.256112.3"", ""1Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, No. 55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, 361003 Fujian People's Republic of China.grid.412625.6"", ""1Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, No. 55, Zhenhai Road, Xiamen, 361003 Fujian People's Republic of China.grid.412625.6"", ""3Department of General Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361003 People's Republic of China.grid.412625.6""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190429,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6489230,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/06/07 06:01,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2018/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0808-z [doi]', '808 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Apr 29;19:114. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0808-z. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Dnmt3b', 'HOXA5', 'Long noncoding RNA HOTAIR', 'Proliferation', 'Promoter methylation']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the underlying mechanisms of relapsed/refractory childhood ALL, researchers urgently need to establish novel cell models from patients with relapsed ALL after treatment with contemporary chemotherapy. Methods: Cell culture technique was used to establish the HXEX-ALL1 cell line from primary B cell precursor ALL (BCP-ALL) cells. Molecular and cellular biological techniques including flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, conventional cytogenetics, and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) were used to characterize the HXEX-ALL1 cell line. Nude mice were used for xenograft studies. Results: A stable ALL cell line, HXEX-ALL1, derived from a 6-year-old boy of Han nationality with BCP-ALL at the second relapse, was established and maintained in culture for more than 18 months. The HXEX-ALL1 cell line was authenticated as being derived from primary leukemia cells based on morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic and STR analyses and demonstrated tumorigenicity in nude mice. WGS data showed that there were 27,006 novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 193,951 novel insertion/deletions (InDels) in HXEX-ALL1 cells. Compared with the other BCP-ALL cell lines in use, the HXEX-ALL1 cells have a special karyotype represented by trisomy 8 and 9p and 17p deletions with a multidrug resistance phenotype, especially highly resistant to asparaginase. Conclusions: The HXEX-ALL1 cell line may prove to be a useful model for the study of relapsed/refractory childhood ALL, particularly for the researches on asparaginase resistance.","['Zhu, Yiping', 'Yang, Rong', 'Gao, Ju', 'Zhang, Yanle', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Gu, Ling']","['Zhu Y', 'Yang R', 'Gao J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang G', 'Gu L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2410-1696'],"['1Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '1Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '1Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '1Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '1Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '2Department of Laboratory Medicine, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '1Laboratory of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Key Laboratory of Birth Defects and Related Diseases of Women and Children (Sichuan University), Ministry of Education, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38', '3Joint Laboratory of West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University and School of Life Science, Fudan University for Pulmonary Development and Disease, West China Second University Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, 610041 China.0000 0001 0807 1581grid.13291.38']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190429,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6489226,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/06/07 06:01,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0834-x [doi]', '834 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Apr 29;19:113. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0834-x. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chromosome 17p deletion', 'Chromosome 9p deletion', 'Complex karyotype', 'Leukemia cell line']",['The authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,

Bendamustine is currently approved for rituximab-resistant indolent NHL and CLL in patients not fit for conventional chemotherapy. Recent studies have shown superiority of bendamustine combination with rituximab (B-R) in first line treatment of indolent NHLs and mantle cell lymphoma, suggesting a shift of the standard of care in this setting. B-R regimen has also shown efficacy in relapsed setting suggesting the possible treatment option for patients failing conventional chemotherapy. In rituximab-resistant NHL, the recent GADOLIN study exploring the addition of obinutuzumab to bendamustine has yielded impressive result changing the standard of care in this hard-to-treat population. Concerning CLL, despite inferiority to the standard of care in young fit patients, as defined in CLL10 study, B-R has yielded a more beneficial toxicity profile and its use in first line treatment should be decided individually. In relapsed setting, the addition of ibrutinib to B-R has shown superior results compared to B-R alone, possibly changing the paradigm of treatment of relapsed CLL. In conclusion, bendamustine as a single agent or in combinations has shown activity with acceptable toxic profile in the treatment of patients with indolent NHLs or CLL without del(17p) mutation.","['Bogeljic Patekar, Martina', 'Milunovic, Vibor', 'Misura Jakobac, Karla', 'Perica, Drazen', 'Mandac Rogulj, Inga', 'Kursar, Marin', 'Planinc-Peraica, Ana', 'Ostojic Kolonic, Slobodanka']","['Bogeljic Patekar M', 'Milunovic V', 'Misura Jakobac K', 'Perica D', 'Mandac Rogulj I', 'Kursar M', 'Planinc-Peraica A', 'Ostojic Kolonic S']",,"['1Division of Hematology, Merkur University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia; 2Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Georgetown University, Washington.

Clinical Findings: KMT2A mutations cause Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome, a very rare genetic disorder characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, short stature, intellectual disability, and distinct facial features. Treatment and Outcome: Whole exome sequencing identified a novel frameshift variant: c. 4177dupA (p.Ile1393Asnfs * 14) in KMT2A; this change generates an alteration of the specific binding to non-methylated CpG motifs of the DNA to the protein. The genotype and phenotype of the patient were compared with those of earlier reported patients in the literature. Clinical Relevance: In diseases with low frequency, it is necessary to establish a genotype-phenotype correlation that allows the establishment of therapeutic and follow-up goals. The phenotype comparation with other reported cases did not show differences attributable to sex or age among patients with Wiedemann-Steiner Syndrome.

Moreover, we conducted combined analyses of methylation data using our previous expression and mutation data. Based on DNA methylation profiles, pediatric T-ALL was clustered into four distinct subtypes, which exhibited remarkable association with genetic signatures and expression features, as well as profiles of normal T-cell development. Furthermore, our study revealed the importance of methylation status at binding sites of polycomb-repressive complex components and transcription factors, such as SPI1, in the classification of pediatric T-ALL based on DNA methylation status.

As SM-AML with the KIT D816 mutation in adults exhibits a poor prognosis, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is recommended. Owing to a few reports of SM-AML in children, the standard therapy for pediatric cases has not been established to date. Based on our experience and the related literature, the prognosis of childhood SM-AML could be as poor as in adults. Hence, further investigation, including mutational analyses of the KIT gene, is warranted to establish a risk-oriented strategy for managing childhood SM-AML.","['Harao, Takuro', 'Yamada, Ai', 'Kinoshita, Mariko', 'Sawa, Daisuke', 'Saito, Yusuke', 'Kamimura, Sachiyo', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Ogino, Takashi', 'Kodama, Yuichi', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi', 'Moritake, Hiroshi']","['Harao T', 'Yamada A', 'Kinoshita M', 'Sawa D', 'Saito Y', 'Kamimura S', 'Miyachi H', 'Ogino T', 'Kodama Y', 'Okamoto Y', 'Kawano Y', 'Moritake H']",,"['Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine.', 'Medipolis Proton Therapy and Research Center.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Hospital.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Hospital.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Hospital.', 'Division of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/*complications/drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.60.378 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2019;60(5):378-381. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.60.378.,5,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'KIT mutation', 'Systemic mastocytosis']",,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanism for the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. According to a recent clinical trial, a humanized antibody that targets CCR4(+) cells ameliorates inflammation by reducing the number of infected cells in the central nervous system; this result suggests that the transmigration of HTLV-1-infected cells plays a crucial role in HAM/TSP. Partly due to the blood-brain barrier, current treatments for HAM/TSP are mostly palliative. Pentosan polysulfate (PPS), a semisynthetic glycosaminoglycan, has recently been used to treat HAM/TSP and was found to alleviate the symptoms. In this study, we investigated the effect of PPS on HTLV-1-infected cells and provide evidence for its efficacy in HAM/TSP. PPS was cytotoxic to certain HTLV-1-infected cells and significantly suppressed HTLV-1 virion production. PPS also efficiently inhibited HTLV-1 cell-cell transmission in T cells. In addition, PPS blocked HTLV-1 infection of primary endothelial cells (human umbilical vascular endothelial cells) and suppressed the subsequent induction of proinflammatory cytokine expression. Furthermore, PPS was found to inhibit the adhesion and transmigration of HTLV-1-infected cells. We also confirmed the anti-HTLV-1 effect of PPS in vivo using two mouse models. PPS blocked HTLV-1 infection in a mouse model with peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-humanized NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) (huPBMC NSG) mice. PPS was also found to suppress the development of dermatitis and lung damage in HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ)-transgenic (HBZ-Tg) mice, an HTLV-1 transgenic mouse model in which the mice develop systemic inflammation.IMPORTANCE HTLV-1 is the first human retrovirus to have been identified and is endemic in certain areas worldwide. HTLV-1 infection leads to the development of an inflammatory disease called HAM/TSP, a myelopathy characterized by slowly progressive spastic paraparesis. There have been no effective therapeutics available for HAM/TSP, but recently, a semisynthetic glycosaminoglycan, named pentosan polysulfate (PPS), has been found to alleviate the symptoms of HAM/TSP. Here we conducted a comprehensive study on the effect of PPS both in vitro and in vivo PPS demonstrated anti-HTLV-1 potential in infected cell lines, as shown by its suppressive effects on HTLV-1 replication and transmission and on the transmigration of infected T cells. Moreover, results obtained from two HTLV-1 mouse models demonstrate that PPS inhibits HTLV-1 infection and inflammation development in vivo Our work offers insights into the treatment of HAM/TSP by PPS and also suggests its possible use for treating other HTLV-1-induced inflammatory diseases.","['Ma, Guangyong', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Ohshima, Koichi', 'Matsumoto, Tadashi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Ma G', 'Yasunaga JI', 'Ohshima K', 'Matsumoto T', 'Matsuoka M']",,"['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan ma.guangyong.54u@st.kyoto-u.ac.jp.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume, Japan.', 'ReqMed Co., Ltd., Machida City, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Frontier Life and Medical Sciences, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190730,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '37300-21-3 (Pentosan Sulfuric Polyester)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelial Cells/virology', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy/transmission/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pentosan Sulfuric Polyester/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",PMC6675881,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/06/04 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00413-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00413-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Jul 30;93(16). pii: JVI.00413-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00413-19.

We attempted to identify alternative agents that may target abnormalities within malignant hematopoietic stem (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs). Previously, MDM2 protein levels were shown to be upregulated in PV/ET CD34(+) cells, and exposure to a nutlin, an MDM2 antagonist, induced activation of the TP53 pathway and selective depletion of PV HPCs/HSCs. This anticlonal activity was mediated by upregulation of p53 and potentiated by the addition of interferon-alpha2a (IFN-alpha2a). Therefore, we performed an investigator-initiated phase 1 trial of the oral MDM2 antagonist idasanutlin (RG7388; Roche) in patients with high-risk PV/ET for whom at least 1 prior therapy had failed. Patients not attaining at least a partial response by European LeukemiaNet criteria after 6 cycles were then allowed to receive combination therapy with low-dose pegylated IFN-alpha2a. Thirteen patients with JAK2 V617F(+) PV/ET were enrolled, and 12 (PV, n = 11; ET, n = 1) were treated with idasanutlin at 100 and 150 mg daily, respectively, for 5 consecutive days of a 28-day cycle. Idasanutlin was well tolerated; no dose-limiting toxicity was observed, but low-grade gastrointestinal toxicity was common. Overall response rate after 6 cycles was 58% (7 of 12) with idasanutlin monotherapy and 50% (2 of 4) with combination therapy. Median duration of response was 16.8 months (range, 3.5-26.7). Hematologic, symptomatic, pathologic, and molecular responses were observed. These data indicate that idasanutlin is a promising novel agent for PV; it is currently being evaluated in a global phase 2 trial.

We prospectively recruited 448 patients aged 75 years and older presenting for initial consultation at the myelodysplastic syndrome/leukemia, myeloma, or lymphoma clinic of a large tertiary hospital, who agreed to assessment of gait and grip. A subset of 314 patients followed for >/=6 months at local institutions was evaluated for unplanned hospital or emergency department (ED) use. We used Cox proportional hazard models calculated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for survival, and logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for hospital or ED use. Mean age was 79.7 (+/- 4.0 standard deviation) years. After adjustment for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, cognition, treatment intensity, and cancer aggressiveness/type, every 0.1-m/s decrease in gait speed was associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.12-1.29), odds of unplanned hospitalizations (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.16-1.51), and ED visits (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.17-1.53). Associations held among patients with good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 or 1). Every 5-kg decrease in grip strength was associated with worse survival (adjusted HR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.07-1.43) but not hospital or ED use. A model with gait speed and all covariates had comparable predictive power to comprehensive validated frailty indexes (phenotype and cumulative deficit) and all covariates. In summary, gait speed is an easily obtained ""vital sign"" that accurately identifies frailty and predicts outcomes independent of performance status among older patients with blood cancers.","['Liu, Michael A', 'DuMontier, Clark', 'Murillo, Anays', 'Hshieh, Tammy T', 'Bean, Jonathan F', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Abel, Gregory A', 'Driver, Jane A']","['Liu MA', 'DuMontier C', 'Murillo A', 'Hshieh TT', 'Bean JF', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Stone RM', 'Abel GA', 'Driver JA']",,"['Harvard T.H.

Five of the patients' placentas were small for gestational age (SGA). Pathologic examination revealed inflammatory changes in 4 of the placentas: 2 from the SGA placentas and 2 from non-SGA placentas. Examination revealed 3 placentas with villitis of unknown etiology (VUE) and 1 with intervillositis; all were negative for bacterial and viral cultures and by immunohistochemical (IHC) stains. In the VUE cases, IHC stains showed positivity of CD25+/FOXP3+ with focal positivity and CD3 and CD4 IHC were focally to strongly positive.

We suggest that the inflammatory process noted in the placentas is due to chemotherapy-induced toxic effects.","['Kantarovich, Diana', 'Archer, Sydney', 'Khoshnam, Nasim', 'Al-Haddad, Eman', 'Moncaleano, Daniela', 'Demian, Sherry', 'Jacob, Angela M', 'Shehata, Bahig M']","['Kantarovich D', 'Archer S', 'Khoshnam N', 'Al-Haddad E', 'Moncaleano D', 'Demian S', 'Jacob AM', 'Shehata BM']",,"['Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', 'Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", 'Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan."", ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, Michigan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190605,United States,Pediatr Dev Pathol,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,9809673,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Chorionic Villi/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Placenta Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis/epidemiology/pathology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2019/06/07 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1093526619853179 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Dev Pathol. 2019 Nov-Dec;22(6):540-545. doi: 10.1177/1093526619853179.

The Wnt pathway and its downstream targets are tightly regulated by beta-catenin. We recently discovered a new protein, FLYWCH1, which can directly bind nuclear beta-catenin. Herein, we studied the FLYWCH1/beta-catenin pathway in AML cells using qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, the stemness activity and cell cycle were analysed by the colony-forming unit (CFU) using methylcellulose-based and Propidium iodide/flow cytometry assays. We found that FLYWCH1 mRNA and protein were differentially expressed in the AML cell lines. C-Myc, cyclin D1, and c-Jun expression decreased in the presence of higher FLYWCH1 expression, and vice versa. There appeared to be the loss of FLYWCH1 expression in dividing cells. The sub-G0 phase was prolonged and shortened in the low and high FLYWCH1 expression cell lines, respectively. The G0/G1 arrest correlated with FLYWCH1-expression, and these cell lines also formed colonies, whereas the low FLYWCH1 expression cell lines could not. Thus, FLYWCH1 functions as a negative regulator of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in AML.","['Almars, Amany', 'Chondrou, Panagiota S', 'Onyido, Emenike K', 'Almozyan, Sheema', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Babaei-Jadidi, Roya', 'Nateri, Abdolrahman S']","['Almars A', 'Chondrou PS', 'Onyido EK', 'Almozyan S', 'Seedhouse C', 'Babaei-Jadidi R', 'Nateri AS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6422-6813'],"['Cancer Genetics & Stem Cell Group, Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. ttxaial@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Genetics & Stem Cell Group, Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. msxpc4@nottingham.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Genetics & Stem Cell Group, Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. e.k.onyido@swansea.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Genetics & Stem Cell Group, Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. ttxsa97@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk.', 'Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG5 1PB, UK. mrzcs@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Genetics & Stem Cell Group, Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. mszrb3@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk.', 'Respiratory Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. mszrb3@exmail.nottingham.ac.uk.', 'Cancer Genetics & Stem Cell Group, Cancer Biology, Division of Cancer and Stem Cells, School of Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK. a.nateri@nottingham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190604,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FLYWCH1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/*metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",PMC6600431,2019/06/07 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/06/07 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20112739 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20112739 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jun 4;20(11). pii: ijms20112739. doi: 10.3390/ijms20112739.,11,['G0700763/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLYWCH1', 'WNT/beta-catenin', 'acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)', 'leukemic stem cell (LSC)']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, not all AML patients show thrombocytopenia at the time of diagnosis, and the association of PLT count with patient survival is largely unknown. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to determine PLT counts at diagnosis in the peripheral blood in 291 newly diagnosed AML patients and assess the association of PLT counts with the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of these patients. RESULTS: Low PLT counts (</=40 x 109/L) were associated with better outcomes for the whole cohort (5-year OS, 55.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 35.3 +/- 3.5%, p < 0.001; 5-year DFS, 49.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 25.7 +/- 4.0%, p < 0.001) and intermediate-risk patients (5-year OS, 64.5 +/- 5.4 vs. 41.0 +/- 4.8%, p < 0.001; 5-year DFS, 60.8 +/- 5.6 vs. 28.6 +/- 5.6%, p < 0.001). Moreover, low PLT counts were related to deeper molecular remission. Low PLT counts correlated with better survival of intermediate-risk AML patients treated with chemotherapy only. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation attenuated the negative impact of high PLT counts on the survival of intermediate-risk patients. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that PLT count at diagnosis was an independent prognostic factor for intermediate-risk AML. CONCLUSION: PLT count at diagnosis predicts survival for patients with intermediate-risk AML.","['Zhang, Yimin', 'Gu, Haihui', 'Chen, Qi', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Cheng, Hui', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Wang, Jianmin', 'Hu, Xiaoxia']","['Zhang Y', 'Gu H', 'Chen Q', 'Zhang Y', 'Cheng H', 'Yang J', 'Wang J', 'Hu X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Health Statistics, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China, hu_xiaoxia@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190605,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/06 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['000500230 [pii]', '10.1159/000500230 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2020;143(1):9-18. doi: 10.1159/000500230.

We show that this amplicon is generated by breakage-fusion-bridge during mitosis and arises distinctly in T cell lymphomas originating from an early progenitor stage. Notably, we report amplification of the corresponding syntenic region (11q23) in a subset of human leukemia leading to the overexpression of several cancer genes, including MLL/KMT2A.

With the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), survival of patients with CML has dramatically improved and approached that of the normal population. In recent years, several studies demonstrated that patients who achieve a deep molecular response while receiving TKI therapy could safely attempt treatment-free remission (TFR), the new treatment goal in patients with CML. The objective is to estimate the budget impact of TFR at the MoPH. METHODS: Analyses were done on 162 patients with CML receiving imatinib, nilotinib, or dasatinib, as first-line or second-line therapy, over a 4-year time horizon using MoPH drug pricing. The model assumed that patients could attempt TFR after 36 months of TKI therapy, where the last 24 months were at stable molecular response as per MoPH and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Duration of TFR was based on European Stop Kinase Inhibitor treatment-free survival curve. RESULTS: Out of the 162 patients, 83 were eligible to attempt TFR, 36 patients were not eligible, 32 patients were lost to follow-up, two patients died as a result of CML progression, and five died as a result of other causes. The total cost of CML treatment with TFR from the time of analysis and over 4 years can be reduced by more than 7 million US dollars (57%). CONCLUSION: The model can be used to inform health care decision makers on the importance of TFR and the potential savings.","['Elias, Fadia', 'Gebran, Anthony', 'Said, Christina', 'Beker, Russell V', 'Ammar, Walid']","['Elias F', 'Gebran A', 'Said C', 'Beker RV', 'Ammar W']",,"['Ministry of Public Health, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Russell Becker Consulting, Chicago, IL.', 'Ministry of Public Health, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Glob Oncol,Journal of global oncology,101674751,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/economics/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Economics', 'Female', '*Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/economics/therapeutic use', 'Lebanon', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/economics', 'Lost to Follow-Up', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/economics/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6613662,2019/06/06 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JGO.19.00012 [doi]'],ppublish,J Glob Oncol. 2019 Jun;5:1-7. doi: 10.1200/JGO.19.00012.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we investigated fixed-duration treatment with venetoclax and obinutuzumab in patients with previously untreated CLL and coexisting conditions. Patients with a score of greater than 6 on the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (scores range from 0 to 56, with higher scores indicating more impaired function of organ systems) or a calculated creatinine clearance of less than 70 ml per minute were randomly assigned to receive venetoclax-obinutuzumab or chlorambucil-obinutuzumab. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The safety of each regimen was also evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 432 patients (median age, 72 years; median Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score, 8; median creatinine clearance, 66.4 ml per minute) underwent randomization, with 216 assigned to each group. After a median follow-up of 28.1 months, 30 primary end-point events (disease progression or death) had occurred in the venetoclax-obinutuzumab group and 77 had occurred in the chlorambucil-obinutuzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.53; P<0.001). The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the percentage of patients with progression-free survival at 24 months was significantly higher in the venetoclax-obinutuzumab group than in the chlorambucil-obinutuzumab group: 88.2% (95% CI, 83.7 to 92.6) as compared with 64.1% (95% CI, 57.4 to 70.8). This benefit was also observed in patients with TP53 deletion, mutation, or both and in patients with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 52.8% of patients in the venetoclax-obinutuzumab group and in 48.1% of patients in the chlorambucil-obinutuzumab group, and grade 3 or 4 infections occurred in 17.5% and 15.0%, respectively. All-cause mortality was 9.3% in the venetoclax-obinutuzumab group and 7.9% in the chlorambucil-obinutuzumab group. These differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with untreated CLL and coexisting conditions, venetoclax-obinutuzumab was associated with longer progression-free survival than chlorambucil-obinutuzumab. (Funded by F.

Gene polymorphisms involved in thiopurine degradation are predictors of toxicity in patients treated with 6-MP. We investigated the effects of nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X (nudix) type motif 15 (NUDT15) polymorphism NUDT15c.415C>T on neutropenia incidence, dose adjustment for 6-MP, and survival rates in Thai children with ALL. METHODS: Children diagnosed with ALL who received 6-MP in the maintenance phase of treatment, in 2005-2016, were retrospectively enrolled. RESULTS: The subjects consisted of 102 patients (median age, 5.2 years; 58 boys). On genetic testing 78, 22, and two patients were normal (CC), heterozygous (CT), and homozygous (TT), respectively. The incidence of neutropenia at 3 months was significantly higher in the CT/TT than CC polymorphism groups (OR, 12; 95%CI: 3.781-38.085, P < 0.001). The mean dose of 6-MP at 3, 6, and 12 months was significantly lower in the CT/TT versus the CC group (P < 0.001). The 5 year overall survival (OS) rate for CC was 80.4%, and for CT/TT, 95.5% (P = 0.34). The 5 year event-free survival (EFS) for CC and CT/TT was 75.1% and 85.7%, respectively (P = 0.17). After adjusted risk classification, no significant differences were observed for OS or EFS between the CC and CT/TT groups. CONCLUSION: Patients harboring the CT/TT polymorphism of NUDT15 had a significantly higher incidence of neutropenia during the first 3 months of maintenance, resulting in significantly lower doses of 6-MP.","['Buaboonnam, Jassada', 'Sripatanatadasakul, Pariwan', 'Treesucon, Ajjima', 'Glomglao, Waraporn', 'Siraprapapat, Preeyanun', 'Narkbunnam, Nattee', 'Vathana, Nassawee', 'Takpradit, Chayamon', 'Phuakpet, Kamon', 'Pongtanakul, Bunchoo', 'Tongsai, Sasima', 'Sinlapamongkolkul, Phakatip', 'Sanpakit, Kleebsabai']","['Buaboonnam J', 'Sripatanatadasakul P', 'Treesucon A', 'Glomglao W', 'Siraprapapat P', 'Narkbunnam N', 'Vathana N', 'Takpradit C', 'Phuakpet K', 'Pongtanakul B', 'Tongsai S', 'Sinlapamongkolkul P', 'Sanpakit K']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5240-1071'],"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology, Office for Research and Development, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Thammasat University, Pathum Thani, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190814,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (NUDT15 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Pyrophosphatases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Dosage Calculations', 'Female', 'Genetic Markers', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*adverse effects/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced/epidemiology/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Pyrophosphatases/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",,2019/06/06 06:00,2020/02/13 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13905 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2019 Aug;61(8):754-758. doi: 10.1111/ped.13905.

31165931,NLM,MEDLINE,20191016,20210903,1433-7339 (Electronic) 0941-4355 (Linking),27,2019 Sep,High incidence of invasive fungal infection during acute myeloid leukemia treatment in a resource-limited country: clinical risk factors and treatment outcomes.,3613-3622,10.1007/s00520-019-04720-5 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Invasive fungal infection (IFI) causes high morbidity and mortality during acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treatment. Interventions to prevent fungal infection, including air filtration systems and antifungal prophylaxis, may improve outcomes in this group of patients. However, they are expensive and therefore inapplicable in resource-limited countries. The benefit of antifungal therapy is also dependent on the local epidemiology. That led us to conduct the study to evaluate the characteristics and impact of IFI in AML patients without prophylaxis in our setting. METHODS: Clinical data from patients with AML who have been treated with chemotherapy without antifungal prophylaxis were retrieved during a 5-year period at Thailand's hematology referral center. Incidence and risk factors of IFI and outcomes of patients were evaluated. RESULTS: Among 292 chemotherapy courses, there were 65 (22.3%) episodes of IFI. Of those, 10 (15.4%) were proven, 19 (29.2%) were probable, and 36 (55.4%) were categorized as being possible IFI. Molds were the most commonly observed causative pathogens (93.1%). The incidence of probable/proven IFI was highest during first induction (20.5%), followed by second induction (6.1%), and consolidation (2.7%). A long duration of neutropenia, old age, and low serum albumin were the strongest predictors of IFI. Compared with patients who had no IFI, patients with probable/proven IFI had a longer length of hospital stay and higher in-hospital mortality. Patients with proven IFI had a significantly worse outcome at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the change in health policy to implement IFI preventive measures to improve outcomes of AML treatment.","['Nganthavee, Variya', 'Phutthasakda, Woraphun', 'Atipas, Kawita', 'Tanpong, Sirikul', 'Pungprasert, Teeramet', 'Dhirachaikulpanich, Dhanach', 'Krithin, Saran', 'Tanglitanon, Supang', 'Jutidamronphang, Warissara', 'Owattanapanich, Weerapat', 'Chayakulkeeree, Methee', 'Phikulsod, Ployploen']","['Nganthavee V', 'Phutthasakda W', 'Atipas K', 'Tanpong S', 'Pungprasert T', 'Dhirachaikulpanich D', 'Krithin S', 'Tanglitanon S', 'Jutidamronphang W', 'Owattanapanich W', 'Chayakulkeeree M', 'Phikulsod P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5389-1896'],"['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 2 Wanglang Road, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, 2 Wanglang Road, Bangkoknoi, Bangkok, 10700, Thailand. ployploen.phi@mahidol.ac.th.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190605,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Resources', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Induction Chemotherapy/adverse effects', '*Invasive Fungal Infections/drug therapy/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/pathology', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Thailand', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2019/06/06 06:00,2019/10/17 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-019-04720-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-019-04720-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Sep;27(9):3613-3622. doi: 10.1007/s00520-019-04720-5.

The neomorphic mutation in IDH generates an oncometabolite product, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), which has been linked to the disruption of metabolic and epigenetic mechanisms responsible for cellular differentiation and is likely an early and critical contributor to oncogenesis. In the past 2 years, two mutant IDH (mutIDH) inhibitors, Enasidenib (AG-221), and Ivosidenib (AG-120), have been FDA-approved for IDH-mutant relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) based on phase 1 safety and efficacy data and continue to be studied in trials in hematologic malignancies, as well as in glioma, cholangiocarcinoma, and chondrosarcoma. In this review, we will summarize the molecular pathways and oncogenic consequences associated with mutIDH with a particular emphasis on glioma and AML, and systematically review the development and preclinical testing of mutIDH inhibitors. Existing clinical data in both hematologic and solid tumors will likewise be reviewed followed by a discussion on the potential limitations of mutIDH inhibitor monotherapy and potential routes for treatment optimization using combination therapy.","['Golub, Danielle', 'Iyengar, Nishanth', 'Dogra, Siddhant', 'Wong, Taylor', 'Bready, Devin', 'Tang, Karen', 'Modrek, Aram S', 'Placantonakis, Dimitris G']","['Golub D', 'Iyengar N', 'Dogra S', 'Wong T', 'Bready D', 'Tang K', 'Modrek AS', 'Placantonakis DG']",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Science Institute, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Clinical and Translational Science Institute, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Kimmel Center for Stem Cell Biology, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Laura and Isaac Perlmutter Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Brain Tumor Center, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.', 'Neuroscience Institute, New York University School of Medicine, NYU Langone Health, New York, NY, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190517,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6534082,2019/06/06 06:00,2019/06/06 06:01,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00417 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 May 17;9:417. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00417. eCollection 2019.,,"['R01 NS102665/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001445/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NOTNLM'],"['IDH', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'enasidenib', 'glioma', 'isocitrate dehydrogenase', 'ivosidenib']",,,,,,,,,,,

It was developed as a new class of anti-cancer drug to treat resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia. Recent studies suggest that c-Abl inhibition would provide a neuroprotective effect in animal models of Parkinson's disease as well as in clinical trials. However, the role of c-Abl and effects of GNF-2 in glia-mediated neuroinflammation or pain hypersensitivity has not been investigated. Thus, in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that c-Abl inhibition by GNF-2 may attenuate the inflammatory activation of glia and the ensuing pain behaviors in animal models. Our results show that GNF-2 reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in cultured glial cells in a c-Abl-dependent manner. The small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of c-Abl attenuated LPS-induced nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cell (NF-kappaB) activation and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators in glial cell cultures. Moreover, GNF-2 administration significantly attenuated mechanical and thermal hypersensitivities in experimental models of diabetic and inflammatory pain. Together, our findings suggest the involvement of c-Abl in neuroinflammation and pain pathogenesis and that GNF-2 can be used for the management of chronic pain.","['Song, Gyun Jee', 'Rahman, Md Habibur', 'Jha, Mithilesh Kumar', 'Gupta, Deepak Prasad', 'Park, Sung Hee', 'Kim, Jae-Hong', 'Lee, Sun-Hwa', 'Lee, In-Kyu', 'Sim, Taebo', 'Bae, Yong Chul', 'Lee, Won-Ha', 'Suk, Kyoungho']","['Song GJ', 'Rahman MH', 'Jha MK', 'Gupta DP', 'Park SH', 'Kim JH', 'Lee SH', 'Lee IK', 'Sim T', 'Bae YC', 'Lee WH', 'Suk K']",,"['Department of Medical Science, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University, Gangneung-si, South Korea.', ""Translational Brain Research Center, International St. Mary's Hospital, Catholic Kwandong University, Incheon, South Korea."", 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science and Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science and Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Neurology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States.', 'Department of Medical Science, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University, Gangneung-si, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science and Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Medical Science, College of Medicine, Catholic Kwandong University, Gangneung-si, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science and Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'New Drug Development Center, Daegu Gyeongbuk Medical Innovation Foundation, Daegu, and VORONOI Inc., Incheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'KU-KIST Graduate School of Converging Science and Technology, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Chemical Kinomics Research Center, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, School of Dentistry, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, School of Life Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Brain Science and Engineering Institute, BK21 Plus KNU Biomedical Convergence Program, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190520,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6535676,2019/06/06 06:00,2019/06/06 06:01,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00543 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 May 20;10:543. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00543. eCollection 2019.,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GNF-2', 'c-Abl', 'glia', 'neuroinflammation', 'pain']",,,,,,,,,,,

A better understanding of how those mechanisms orchestrate disease might improve diagnostic and prognostic tools, allowing for improvements in treatment efficacy. Replacement of canonical histones, an epigenetic mechanism, is highly conserved among species and altered expression of histones variants (e.g., MacroH2A1) has been associated with tumorigenesis. H2AFY gene encodes two isoforms of H2A histone variant MacroH2A1: MacroH2A1.1 and MacroH2A1.2. Specifically, MacroH2A1.1 isoform inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cellular differentiation. Because the contribution of this histone variant to carcinogenesis has been reported in several cancer types, but not for PCa, we aimed to investigate the contribution of MacroH2A1 for prostate carcinogenesis. Methods: MacroH2A1, MacroH2A1.1 and MacroH2A1.2 isoforms and the corresponding splicing regulators transcript levels were evaluated by RT-qPCR, in a tissue cohort composed by PCa, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and normal prostate cases. Knockdown for MacroH2A1 and MacroH2A1.1 was performed through lentiviral transduction in DU145 cells, and MacroH2A1.1 overexpression was achieved in LNCaP cells by plasmid transfection, followed by functional assays. Biological and/or experimental replicates were performed when necessary, and specific statistical tests were applied to perform data analysis. Results: MacroH2A1.1 transcript levels were downregulated in PIN and primary PCa compared to normal prostate tissues. The same was found for QKI, a MacroH2A1.1's splicing regulator. Moreover, lower MacroH2A1.1 and QKI expression levels associated with less differentiated tumors (Gleason score >/= 7). Interestingly, MacroH2A1.1, but more impressively DDX17 (AUC = 0.93; p < 0.0001) and QKI (AUC = 0.94; p < 0.0001), accurately discriminated cancerous from noncancerous prostate tissues. Furthermore, in PCa cell lines, total MacroH2A1 knockdown augmented malignant features, whereas MacroH2A1.1 overexpression impressively attenuated the malignant phenotype. Conclusions: Overall, our data, derived from primary PCa tissues and cell lines, anticipate a tumor suppressive role for MacroH2A1, particularly for the MacroH2A1.1 isoform, in prostate carcinogenesis.","['Vieira-Silva, Tania Soraia', 'Monteiro-Reis, Sara', 'Barros-Silva, Daniela', 'Ramalho-Carvalho, Joao', 'Graca, Ines', 'Carneiro, Isa', 'Martins, Ana Teresa', 'Oliveira, Jorge',

Methylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4), together with acetylation of H3K27, is closely associated with open chromatin and gene transcription. H3K4 methylation is catalyzed by KMT2 lysine methyltransferases that include the mixed-lineage leukemia 1-4 (MLL1-4) and SET1A and B enzymes. For efficient catalysis, all six require a core complex of four proteins, WDR5, RBBP5, ASH2L, and DPY30. We report that targeted disruption of Ash2l in the murine hematopoietic system results in the death of the mice due to a rapid loss of mature hematopoietic cells. However, lin(-)Sca1(+)Kit(+) (LSK) cells, which are highly enriched in hematopoietic stem and multi-potent progenitor cells, accumulated in the bone marrow. The loss of Ash2l resulted in global reduction of H3K4 methylation and deregulated gene expression, including down-regulation of many mitosis-associated genes. As a consequence, LSK cells accumulated in the G2-phase of the cell cycle and were unable to proliferate and differentiate. In conclusion, Ash2l is essential for balanced gene expression and for hematopoietic stem and multi-potent progenitor cell physiology.","['Luscher-Firzlaff, Juliane', 'Chatain, Nicolas', 'Kuo, Chao-Chung', 'Braunschweig, Till', 'Bochynska, Agnieszka', 'Ullius, Andrea', 'Denecke, Bernd', 'Costa, Ivan G', 'Koschmieder, Steffen', 'Luscher, Bernhard']","['Luscher-Firzlaff J', 'Chatain N', 'Kuo CC', 'Braunschweig T', 'Bochynska A', 'Ullius A', 'Denecke B', 'Costa IG', 'Koschmieder S', 'Luscher B']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9265-8536', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4485-3120', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2890-8697', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1011-8171', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9622-8709']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'QIAGEN GmbH, Qiagen Str. 1, 40724, Hilden, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research Aachen, Faculty of Medicine, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Institute for Computational Genomics, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Hemostaseology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany. skoschmieder@ukaachen.de.', 'Institute of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, RWTH Aachen University, Pauwelsstrasse 30, 52074, Aachen, Germany. luescher@rwth-aachen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190604,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Ash2l protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",PMC6547667,2019/06/06 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-44720-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-44720-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jun 4;9(1):8262. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-44720-3.,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient was a 60s man with a chief complainant of low-grade fever following a dental implant. Although he underwent intensive antibiotic treatment, including levofloxacin, meropenem, and vancomycin, no significant decline in fever was observed. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed an LDA occupying the majority of his spleen, which was diagnosed as a splenic abscess. Although a CT-guided biopsy and drainage for the spleen were considered, a puncture of the spleen was not performed due to the substantial concern of bleeding. Subsequently, a splenectomy was performed and HE staining revealed mitosis of tumor cells and massive necrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor cells were positive for myeloperoxidase, CD43, CD45, and CD68. Finally, the splenic LDA was diagnosed as MS instead of a splenic abscess.

However, studies on leukemia are limited, and there is still a lack of comprehensive analysis of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA regulatory network of AML based on high-throughput sequencing and large-scale sample size. We obtained RNA-Seq data and compared the expression profiles between 407 normal whole blood (GTEx) and 151 bone marrows of AML (TCGA). The similarity between two sets of genes with trait in the network was analyzed by weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA). MiRcode, starBase, miRTarBase, miRDB and TargetScan was used to predict interactions between lncRNAs, miRNAs and target mRNAs. At last, we identified 108 lncRNAs, 10 miRNAs and 8 mRNAs to construct a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network, which might act as prognostic biomarkers of AML. Among the network, a survival model with 8 target mRNAs (HOXA9+INSR+KRIT1+MYB+SPRY2+UBE2V1+WEE1+ZNF711) was set up by univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard regression analysis, of which the AUC was 0.831, indicating its sensitivity and specificity in AML prognostic prediction.

By definition, these premalignant clones do not meet criteria for haematopoietic neoplasms listed in the Revised Fourth Edition of the WHO classification. CH is fairly common in elderly individuals and is associated with higher risks for haematological cancers, in particular myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), as well as cardiovascular events. Similar small clones have also been detected during follow-up in patients with AML in morphological remission, in individuals with aplastic anaemia, and in pre-chemotherapy blood samples from patients with other types of cancers. In each of these contexts, the presence of mutations carries different clinical implications, and sometimes demonstrates unique genetic profiles. Emerging research suggests that the number and identity of mutations, the size of the mutant clones and various other factors, including age, immune status and history of exogenous drugs/toxins, are important for disease biology and progression. This review focuses specifically on the subset of CH with gene mutations detected by sequencing, and includes discussions of nomenclature and molecular technologies that detect and quantify gene mutations.","['Capo-Chichi, Jose-Mario', 'Michaels, Phillip', 'Tremblay-Le May, Rosemarie', 'Abelson, Sagi', 'Hasserjian, Robert Paul', 'Xia, Daniel']","['Capo-Chichi JM', 'Michaels P', 'Tremblay-Le May R', 'Abelson S', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Xia D']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3825-0577'],"['Department of Molecular Genetics, Toronto General Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada daniel.xia@uhn.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190604,England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",,2019/06/06 06:00,2019/07/03 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['jclinpath-2019-205851 [pii]', '10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205851 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2019 Jul;72(7):453-459. doi: 10.1136/jclinpath-2019-205851.

However, the techniques used to identify and measure prognostic lncRNAs (i.e., RNA sequencing and microarrays) are not tailored for clinical testing. Herein, we report on an assay (based on the nCounter platform) that is designed to produce targeted measurements of prognostic lncRNAs in a clinically applicable manner. We analyzed a new cohort of 76 older patients with CN-AML and found that the nCounter assay yielded reproducible measurements and that the lncRNA score retained its prognostic value; patients with high lncRNA scores had lower complete remission (CR) rates (P = 0.009; 58% vs. 87%), shorter disease-free (P = 0.05; 3-year rates: 0% vs. 21%), overall (OS; P = 0.02, 3-year rates: 10% vs. 29%), and event-free survival (EFS; P = 0.002, 3-year rates: 0% vs. 18%) than patients with low lncRNA scores. In multivariable analyses, the lncRNA score independently associated with CR rates (P = 0.02), OS (P = 0.02), and EFS (P = 0.02). To gain biological insights, we examined our initial cohort of 71 older patients with CN-AML, previously analyzed with RNA sequencing. Genes involved in immune response and B-cell receptor signaling were enriched in patients with high lncRNA scores. We conclude that clinically applicable lncRNA profiling is feasible and potentially useful for risk stratification of older patients with CN-AML. Furthermore, we identify potentially targetable molecular pathways that are active in the high-risk patients with high lncRNA scores.","['Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Ozer, Hatice G', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Volinia, Stefano', 'Fadda, Paolo', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Garzon, Ramiro', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Papaioannou D', 'Nicolet D', 'Ozer HG', 'Mrozek K', 'Volinia S', 'Fadda P', 'Carroll AJ', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Wang ES', 'Stone RM', 'Byrd JC', 'Garzon R', 'Bloomfield CD']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0910-3893', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9844-730X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5465-7591']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Monter Cancer Center, Hofstra Northwell School of Medicine, Lake Success, New York.', 'Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, New York.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners Cancer Care, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.

Recently, DNMT3A(R882mut) has been shown to have hypomorphic, dominant-negative, and/or gain-of-function effects on DNA methylation under different biological contexts. However, the causal role for such a multifaceted effect of DNMT3A(R882mut) in leukemogenesis remains undetermined. Here, we report TF-1 leukemia cells as a robust system useful for modeling the DNMT3A(R882mut)-dependent transformation and for dissecting the cause-effect relationship between multifaceted activities of DNMT3A(R882mut) and leukemic transformation. Ectopic expression of DNMT3A(R882mut) and not wild-type DNMT3A promoted TF-1 cell transformation characterized by cytokine-independent growth, and induces CpG hypomethylation predominantly at enhancers. This effect was dose dependent, acted synergistically with the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation, and resembled what was seen in human leukemia patients carrying DNMT3A(R882mut). The transformation- and hypomethylation-inducing capacities of DNMT3A(R882mut) relied on a motif involved in heterodimerization, whereas its various chromatin-binding domains were dispensable. Mutation of the heterodimerization motif that interferes with DNMT3A(R882mut) binding to endogenous wild-type DNMT proteins partially reversed the CpG hypomethylation phenotype caused by DNMT3A(R882mut), thus supporting a dominant-negative mechanism in cells. In mice, bromodomain inhibition repressed gene-activation events downstream of DNMT3A(R882mut)-induced CpG hypomethylation, thereby suppressing leukemogenesis mediated by DNMT3A(R882mut). Collectively, this study reports a model system useful for studying DNMT3A(R882mut), shows a requirement of the dominant-negative effect by DNMT3A(R882mut) for leukemogenesis, and describes an attractive strategy for the treatment of leukemias carrying DNMT3A(R882mut). SIGNIFICANCE: These findings highlight a model system to study the functional impact of a hotspot mutation of DNMT3A at R882 in leukemia.","['Lu, Rui', 'Wang, Jun', 'Ren, Zhihong', 'Yin, Jiekai', 'Wang, Yinsheng', 'Cai, Ling', 'Wang, Gang Greg']","['Lu R', 'Wang J', 'Ren Z', 'Yin J', 'Wang Y', 'Cai L', 'Wang GG']",,"['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program, University of California, Riverside, California.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California.', 'Environmental Toxicology Graduate Program, University of California, Riverside, California.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of California, Riverside, California.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Genetics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina. greg_wang@med.unc.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190604,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', '0 (GSK1210151A)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

However, approximately 50% patients could not be accurately predicted by existing risk factors. It is necessary to identify novel prognostic factors to subdivide the intermediate-risk group or patients without any cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities. METHODS: Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression were used for survival analyses in three independent AML datasets. Analyses integrating both bioinformatics and ChIP-qPCR experiments were performed to explore the role of CEBPE in regulating the expression of known prognostic factors. RESULTS: CEBPE expression was an independent predictor for both overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of AML patients. Moreover, low-expression of CEBPE was found to be associated with high relapse rate. We also proved that differential expression of CEBPE stratified the wild-type patients of multiple genes into good and poor outcomes. In addition, the results showed that no obvious improvement was achieved by allogeneic transplantation in CEBPE high-expressed group, while the survival rate (both OS and EFS) was significantly increased in transplanted patients that with low expression of CEBPE. Finally, we found that CEBPE might regulate the expression of known prognostic factors by localizing on their promoters. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that CEBPE expression was an independent prognostic factor for AML survival, relapse and allogeneic transplantation, which will provide useful information for outcome prediction and therapeutic decisions.","['Li, Kening', 'Du, Yuxin', 'Wei, Dong-Qing', 'Zhang, Fang']","['Li K', 'Du Y', 'Wei DQ', 'Zhang F']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4200-7502'],"['State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism and School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China. dqwei@sjtu.edu.cn.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Center for Systems Biomedicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China. zhangfang@sjtu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190604,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '142805-41-2 (CEBPE protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6549322,2019/06/06 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/06/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-019-1944-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-019-1944-x [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2019 Jun 4;17(1):188. doi: 10.1186/s12967-019-1944-x.,1,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Allogeneic transplantation', '*Prognostic factors', '*Relapse', '*Survival']",,,,,,,,,,,
