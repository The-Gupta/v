Natural killer (NK)-cell alloreactivity, determined by donor killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) and recipient HLA, correlates with successful HCT for AML. Hypothesizing that donor KIR genotype (A/A: 2 A KIR haplotypes; B/x: at least 1 B haplotype) would affect outcomes, we genotyped donors and recipients from 209 HLA-matched and 239 mismatched T-replete URD transplantations for AML. Three-year overall survival was significantly higher after transplantation from a KIR B/x donor (31% [95% CI: 26-36] vs 20% [95% CI: 13-27]; P = .007). Multivariate analysis demonstrated a 30% improvement in the relative risk of relapse-free survival with B/x donors compared with A/A donors (RR: 0.70 [95% CI: 0.55-0.88]; P = .002). B/x donors were associated with a higher incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; RR: 1.51 [95% CI: 1.01-2.18]; P = .03), but not of acute GVHD, relapse, or TRM. This analysis demonstrates that unrelated donors with KIR B haplotypes confer significant survival benefit to patients undergoing T-replete HCT for AML. KIR genotyping of prospective donors, in addition to HLA typing, should be performed to identify HLA-matched donors with B KIR haplotypes.","['Cooley, Sarah', 'Trachtenberg, Elizabeth', 'Bergemann, Tracy L', 'Saeteurn, Koy', 'Klein, John', 'Le, Chap T', 'Marsh, Steven G E', 'Guethlein, Lisbeth A', 'Parham, Peter', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Weisdorf, Daniel J']","['Cooley S', 'Trachtenberg E', 'Bergemann TL', 'Saeteurn K', 'Klein J', 'Le CT', 'Marsh SG', 'Guethlein LA', 'Parham P', 'Miller JS', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA. cool0023@umn.edu']",['eng'],"['U24 CA076518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 111412/PHS HHS/United States', 'U24-CA76518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20081022,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Haplotypes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Tissue Donors']",PMC2628378,2008/10/24 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/10/24 09:00'],"['2008/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37865-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-171926 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 15;113(3):726-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-07-171926.

Whereas a high level of GC receptor (GR) protein is associated with the sensitivity of ALL cells to steroid-mediated apoptosis, the auto-up-regulation of human (h)GR mRNA and protein is also found in hormone-sensitive ALL cell lines. We have characterized the hGR gene-proximal promoters for DNA sequences and transcription factors required for hormone responsiveness in T lymphoblasts. Sequences at -4559/-4525 and -2956/-2916, relative to the translation start site, function as strong composite GC response units (GRUs). Both GRUs include adjacent protein recognition sequences for the c-Myb transcription factor and the GR as a DNA cassette. An Ets-binding sequence overlaps the GR-binding site in the -4559/-4525 GRU, whereas an Ets-binding site present in the -2956/-2916 GRU does not overlap the GR/c-Myb-binding cassette. The Ets protein family member, PU.1, blocks hormonal activation of the -4559/-4525 GR/c-Myb-binding cassette but does not interfere with the responsiveness of the -2956/-2916 GRU. Thus, the hGR 1A GRU (described previously), the -4559/-4525 GRU, and the -2956/-2916 GRU have a similar structure and can mediate cell type-specific hormonal auto-up-regulation of hGR promoter activity in steroid-sensitive ALL cells. However, subtle differences in the GRU architecture result in differential sensitivity of the promoters to Ets family members such as PU.1. The architecture of the GRU and the spectrum of specific transcription factors present in different types of ALL might allow the development of a tailored therapy to enhance steroid sensitivity in ALL patients.","['Geng, Chuan-dong', 'Schwartz, Jason R', 'Vedeckis, Wayne V']","['Geng CD', 'Schwartz JR', 'Vedeckis WV']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Stanley S.

It blocks inhibition of viral-gene expression by interferon, a function dependent on the degradation of the ND10 components PML and SP100 by the ubiquitin ligase expressed by the RING finger (RF), and it blocks silencing of viral DNA mediated by the HDAC1/2-CoREST-REST complex. In the latter case, a mutant CoREST lacking the HDAC1 binding site compensates totally or in part for the absence of ICP0 in a cell-type-dependent manner. Here, we compare the phenotypes of an ICP0 mutant containing disabling amino acid substitutions in the RF with those of a mutant with substitutions in the CoREST binding site (R8507). We report the following: (i) the onset of replication of both mutants was delayed, but the RF mutant yields did not reach wild-type virus levels even as late as 48 h after infection, and (ii) in infected cells, PML is rapidly degraded by wild-type virus, with some delay by the R8507 mutant, and is spared by the RF mutant. The translocation of ICP0 to the cytoplasm is impaired in cells infected with the RF mutant or delayed in cells infected with the R8507 mutant. Finally, in contrast to wild-type viruses, both mutants are inhibited by alpha or gamma interferon. The results indicate that both sets of events, the degradation of PML and the blocking of silencing, are interdependent and in large measure dependent on events in the ND10 nuclear bodies.","['Gu, Haidong', 'Roizman, Bernard']","['Gu H', 'Roizman B']","['The Marjorie B.

We report here that Egre, but not the GRE, affects disease induction by the murine T-lymphomagenic SL3-3 virus. Mutating all three copies of Egre prolonged the tumor latency period from 60 to 109 days. Further mutating an E-box motif (Ea/s) outside the enhancer prolonged the latency period to 180 days, suggesting that Ea/s works as a backup site for Egre. While wild-type SL3-3 and GRE and Ea/s mutants exclusively induced T-cell lymphomas with wild-type latencies mainly of the CD4(+) CD8(-) phenotype, Egre as well as the Egre and Ea/s mutants induced B-cell lymphomas and myeloid leukemia in addition to T-cell lymphomas. T-cell lymphomas induced by the two Egre mutants had the same phenotype as those induced by wild-type SL3-3, indicating the incomplete disruption of T-cell lymphomagenesis, which is in contrast to previous findings for a Runx site mutant of SL3-3. Mutating the Egre site or Egre and Ea/s triggered several tumor phenotype-associated secondary enhancer changes encompassing neighboring sites, none of which led to the regeneration of an E-box motif. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for the E-box but not the GRE in T lymphomagenesis by SL3-3, unveil an inherent broader disease specificity of the virus, and strengthen the notion of selection for more potent enhancer variants of mutated viruses during tumor development.","['Ejegod, Ditte', 'Sorensen, Karina Dalsgaard', 'Mossbrugger, Ilona', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia', 'Schmidt, Jorg', 'Pedersen, Finn Skou']","['Ejegod D', 'Sorensen KD', 'Mossbrugger I', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Schmidt J', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Aarhus, C.

It triggers p53-mediated apoptosis, although the mutational status of p53 does not fully account for heterogeneity in responsiveness to treatment. The aim of this study was to identify new genes implicated in fludarabine action as well as to determine the role of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT) in the transcriptomic response triggered by this drug in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells bearing wild type p53. DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed gene expression profiling in cells from two fludarabine-sensitive and two fludarabine-resistant cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia treated with fludarabine either in the presence or the absence of nitrobenzylthioinosine, a hENT1-specific blocker. Twenty selected fludarabine-inducible genes were validated using Taqman low-density arrays in cells from 20 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with the same experimental design. RESULTS: Sixteen of the twenty genes (DDB2, GADD45A, TYMS, BAX, TIGAR, FAS, TNFSF7, TNFSF9, CCNG1, CDKN1A, MDM2, SESN1, MAP4K4, PPM1D, OSBPL3 and WIG1) correlated with the ex vivo sensitivity of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to fludarabine, TIGAR (TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator) being the gene that showed the strongest correlation (p<0.0001; r2= 0.6022).We observed that the transcriptomic response was weakly sensitive to the hENT1 blocker nitrobenzylthioinosine. Interestingly, we also found a correlation between hENT2 expression and induction of TIGAR after fludarabine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate a correlation between the recently described p53-inducible apoptosis gene TIGAR and both sensitivity to fludarabine and hENT2 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. These results, as well as the variability in fludarabine response among chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with wild type p53, support the major role of hENT2 in the uptake of fludarabine into chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.","['Lopez-Guerra, Monica', 'Trigueros-Motos, Laia', 'Molina-Arcas, Miriam', 'Villamor, Neus', 'Casado, F Javier', 'Montserrat, Emili', 'Campo, Elias', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Pastor-Anglada, Marcal']","['Lopez-Guerra M', 'Trigueros-Motos L', 'Molina-Arcas M', 'Villamor N', 'Casado FJ', 'Montserrat E', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D', 'Pastor-Anglada M']","[""Unitat d'Hematopatologia, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081022,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (TIGAR protein, human)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Equilibrative-Nucleoside Transporter 2/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",,2008/10/24 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/10/24 09:00'],"['2008/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13186 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13186 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Dec;93(12):1843-51. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13186.

Therefore, the authors systematically reviewed all published reports describing the effect of NQO1 in de novo childhood leukemia and conducted a meta-analysis of 7 case-control studies that examined the association between NQO1*2 and childhood leukemia. Although a family-based study previously demonstrated over-transmission of this allele among childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases, the meta-analysis showed that the presence of a NQO1*2 variant allele, which reduces the activity of the enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), had no significant effect on childhood leukemia. However, there was an increased risk associated with having at least 1 copy of the NQO1*2 allele in a subset of cases with MLL translocations (summary odds ratio = 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 0.98, 1.97). Heterogeneity between studies may be due to differences in population exposures to NQO1 substrates and small sample sizes, as well as potential population stratification in non-family-based studies. Therefore, further research is warranted on the role of NQO1 polymorphisms in the etiology of childhood leukemia, especially among MLL-positive leukemias.","['Guha, Neela', 'Chang, Jeffrey S', 'Chokkalingam, Anand P', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Smith, Martyn T', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Guha N', 'Chang JS', 'Chokkalingam AP', 'Wiemels JL', 'Smith MT', 'Buffler PA']","['Division of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94704, USA. neela@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA 112355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",20081022,United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NQO1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology/epidemiology/*genetics']",PMC2727266,2008/10/24 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/10/24 09:00'],"['2008/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['kwn246 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwn246 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2008 Dec 1;168(11):1221-32. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwn246.

From this fitted curve, estimates of the seasonal intensity of occurrence (i.e., peak-to-low ratio of the fitted curve) can be generated. METHODS: We discuss various approaches to the estimation of seasonal intensity assuming Edwards's periodic model, including maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), least squares, weighted least squares, and a new closed-form estimator based on a second-order moment statistic and non-transformed data. Through an extensive Monte Carlo simulation study, we compare the finite sample performance characteristics of the estimators discussed in this paper. Finally, all estimators and confidence interval procedures discussed are compared in a re-analysis of data on the seasonality of monocytic leukemia. RESULTS: We find that Edwards's estimator is substantially biased, particularly for small numbers of events and very large or small amounts of seasonality. For the common setting of rare events and moderate seasonality, the new estimator proposed in this paper yields less finite sample bias and better mean squared error than either the MLE or weighted least squares. For large studies and strong seasonality, MLE or weighted least squares appears to be the optimal analytic method among those considered. CONCLUSION: Edwards's estimator of the seasonal relative risk can exhibit substantial finite sample bias. The alternative estimators considered in this paper should be preferred.","['Brookhart, M Alan', 'Rothman, Kenneth J']","['Brookhart MA', 'Rothman KJ']","[""Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital & Harvard Medical School Boston, MA, USA. mbrookhart@partners.org""]",['eng'],"['K25 AG027400/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG-027400/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20081022,England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,,IM,"['Confidence Intervals', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Monte Carlo Method', '*Seasons']",PMC2596789,2008/10/24 09:00,2009/01/29 09:00,['2008/10/24 09:00'],"['2007/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2288-8-67 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2288-8-67 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2008 Oct 22;8:67. doi: 10.1186/1471-2288-8-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reprogramming entails multiple transgene integrations and occurs apparently stochastically in rare cells over many days. Tissue stem cells may be subject to less-stringent epigenetic restrictions than other cells and might therefore be more amenable to deprogramming. We report that brain-derived neural stem (NS) cells acquire undifferentiated morphology rapidly and at high frequency after a single round of transduction with reprogramming factors. However, critical attributes of true pluripotency--including stable expression of endogenous Oct4 and Nanog, epigenetic erasure of X chromosome silencing in female cells, and ability to colonise chimaeras--were not attained. We therefore applied molecularly defined conditions for the derivation and propagation of authentic pluripotent stem cells from embryos. We combined dual inhibition (2i) of mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) with the self-renewal cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). The 2i/LIF condition induced stable up-regulation of Oct4 and Nanog, reactivation of the X chromosome, transgene silencing, and competence for somatic and germline chimaerism. Using 2i /LIF, NS cell reprogramming required only 1-2 integrations of each transgene. Furthermore, transduction with Sox2 and c-Myc is dispensable, and Oct4 and Klf4 are sufficient to convert NS cells into chimaera-forming iPS cells. These findings demonstrate that somatic cell state influences requirements for reprogramming and delineate two phases in the process. The ability to capture pre-pluripotent cells that can advance to ground state pluripotency simply and with high efficiency opens a door to molecular dissection of this remarkable phenomenon.","['Silva, Jose', 'Barrandon, Ornella', 'Nichols, Jennifer', 'Kawaguchi, Jitsutaro', 'Theunissen, Thorold W', 'Smith, Austin']","['Silva J', 'Barrandon O', 'Nichols J', 'Kawaguchi J', 'Theunissen TW', 'Smith A']","['Wellcome Trust Centre for Stem Cell Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G9806702/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,PLoS Biol,PLoS biology,101183755,,IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain/cytology/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Reprogramming/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Mice', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology']",PMC2570424,2008/10/24 09:00,2009/01/06 09:00,['2008/10/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['08-PLBI-RA-2877 [pii]', '10.1371/journal.pbio.0060253 [doi]']",ppublish,PLoS Biol. 2008 Oct 21;6(10):e253. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0060253.,['PLoS Biol. 2008 Oct;6(10):e275.

To account for the local variations near the biomolecular surfaces due to interactions between solvent molecules, and between solvent and solute molecules, we propose potential driven geometric flows, which balance the intrinsic geometric forces that would occur for a surface separating two homogeneous materials with the potential forces induced by the atomic interactions. Stochastic geometric flows are introduced to account for the random fluctuation and dissipation in density and pressure near the solvent-solute interface. Physical properties, such as free energy minimization (area decreasing) and incompressibility (volume preserving), are realized by some of our geometric flow equations. The proposed approach for geometric and potential forces driving the formation and evolution of biological surfaces is illustrated by extensive numerical experiments and compared with established minimal molecular surfaces and molecular surfaces. Local modification of biomolecular surfaces is demonstrated with potential driven geometric flows. High order geometric flows are also considered and tested in the present work for surface generation. Biomolecular surfaces generated by these approaches are typically free of geometric singularities. As the speed of surface generation is crucial to implicit solvent model based molecular dynamics, four numerical algorithms, a semi-implicit scheme, a Crank-Nicolson scheme, and two alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes, are constructed and tested. Being either stable or conditionally stable but admitting a large critical time step size, these schemes overcome the stability constraint of the earlier forward Euler scheme. Aided with the Thomas algorithm, one of the ADI schemes is found to be very efficient as it balances the speed and accuracy.","['Bates, P W', 'Chen, Zhan', 'Sun, Yuhui', 'Wei, Guo-Wei', 'Zhao, Shan']","['Bates PW', 'Chen Z', 'Sun Y', 'Wei GW', 'Zhao S']","['Department of Mathematics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA. bates@math.msu.edu']",['eng'],['CA127189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20081022,Germany,J Math Biol,Journal of mathematical biology,7502105,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Escherichia coli Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Neurotoxins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Rho Factor)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (TRPR protein, E coli)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '78783-34-3 (crambin protein, Crambe abyssinica)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Apoproteins/chemistry', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Computer Simulation', 'Escherichia coli Proteins/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/chemistry', '*Models, Molecular', 'Neurotoxins/chemistry', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry', 'Nucleic Acids/*chemistry', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteins/*chemistry', 'Receptors, LDL/chemistry', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry', 'Rho Factor/chemistry', 'Solvents/chemistry', 'Static Electricity', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Surface Properties', 'Thermodynamics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/09/08 06:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/04 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00285-008-0226-7 [doi]'],ppublish,J Math Biol. 2009 Aug;59(2):193-231. doi: 10.1007/s00285-008-0226-7.

Although evidences for tumor-specific T cell immunity exist, factors related to tumor microenvironment and the presence of immunosuppressive cytokines in patients' sera have been related to its aggressive behavior. Carcinoembryonic Ag (CEA) is overexpressed in 80-90% of pancreatic carcinomas and contains epitopes recognized by CD4(+) T cells. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent of cancer-immune surveillance and immune suppression in pancreatic carcinoma patients by comparing the anti-CEA and antiviral CD4(+) T cell immunity. CD4(+) T cells from 23 normal donors and 44 patients undergoing surgical resection were tested for recognition of peptides corresponding to CEA and viral naturally processed promiscuous epitopes by proliferation and cytokine release assays. Anti-CEA CD4(+) T cell immunity was present in a significantly higher number of normal donors than pancreatic cancer patients. Importantly, whereas CD4(+) T cells from normal donors produced mainly GM-CSF and IFN-gamma, CD4(+) T cells from the patients produced mainly IL-5, demonstrating a skew toward a Th2 type. On the contrary, the extent of antiviral CD4(+) T cell immunity was comparable between the two groups and showed a Th1 type. The immunohistochemical analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes showed a significantly higher number of GATA-3(+) compared with T-bet(+) lymphoid cells, supporting a Th2 skew also at the tumor site. Collectively, these results demonstrate that Th2-immune deviation in pancreatic cancer is not generalized but tumor related and suggests that the skew might be possibly due to factor(s) present at the tumor site.","['Tassi, Elena', 'Gavazzi, Francesca', 'Albarello, Luca', 'Senyukov, Vladimir', 'Longhi, Renato', 'Dellabona, Paolo', 'Doglioni, Claudio', 'Braga, Marco', 'Di Carlo, Valerio', 'Protti, Maria Pia']","['Tassi E', 'Gavazzi F', 'Albarello L', 'Senyukov V', 'Longhi R', 'Dellabona P', 'Doglioni C', 'Braga M', 'Di Carlo V', 'Protti MP']","['Tumor Immunology Unit, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (EBNA-2 protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/blood/*immunology', 'Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal/immunology/pathology/virology', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis/*immunology/metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/immunology', 'Female', 'Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Th2 Cells/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/01/22 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/9/6595 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6595 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Nov 1;181(9):6595-603. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6595.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collaborative mutations causing a reduction in Ikaros activity and an increase in Notch activation promote T cell leukemogenesis. Although the molecular mechanisms of this cooperation have been studied, its consequences in thymocyte development remain unexplored. In this study, we show that Ikaros regulates expression of a subset of Notch target genes, including Hes1, Deltex1, pTa, Gata3, and Runx1, in both Ikaros null T cell leukemia lines and Ikaros null primary thymocytes. In Ikaros null leukemia cells, Notch deregulation occurs at both the level of Notch receptor cleavage and expression of Notch target genes, because re-expression of Ikaros in these cells down-regulates Notch target gene expression without affecting levels of intracellular cleaved Notch. In addition, abnormal expression of Notch target genes is observed in Ikaros null double-positive thymocytes, in the absence of detectable intracellular cleaved Notch. Finally, we show that this role of Ikaros is specific to double-positive and single-positive thymocytes because derepression of Notch target gene expression is not observed in Ikaros null double-negative thymocytes or lineage-depleted bone marrow. Thus, in this study, we provide evidence that Ikaros and Notch play opposing roles in regulation of a subset of Notch target genes and that this role is restricted to developing thymocytes where Ikaros is required to appropriately regulate the Notch program as they progress through T cell development.","['Chari, Sheila', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Chari S', 'Winandy S']","['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 GM08061/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008061/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104962-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104962-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hes1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (pre-T cell receptor alpha)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Dtx1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Notch/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",PMC2778602,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/01/22 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/9/6265 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6265 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Nov 1;181(9):6265-74. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6265.,,,,['NIHMS157018'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL cells strongly express intracellular melanoma differentiation-associated gene-7 (MDA7)/IL-24. However, adenovirus-delivered MDA7 was reported to be cytotoxic in several tumor cell lines. We report herein that rIL-24 alone had no effect; however, sequential incubation with rIL-2 and rIL-24 reduced thymidine incorporation by 50% and induced apoptosis of CLL cells in S and G(2)/M phases of the cell cycle, but not of normal adult blood or tonsil B cells. IL-24 stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation in IL-24R1-transfected cells but not in normal or CLL B cells. In contrast, IL-24 reversed the IL-2-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in CLL, and this effect was neutralized by anti-IL-24 Ab. Phospho- (P)STAT3 inhibition induced by IL-24 was reversed by pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases. The addition of rIL-24 to IL-2-activated CLL B cells resulted in increases of transcription, protein synthesis. and phosphorylation of p53. The biological effects of IL-24 were reversed by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha and partly by the caspase inhibitor zvad. Troglitazone (a protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B activator) phosphatase inhibited PSTAT3 and augmented p53 expression. PSTAT3 is a transcriptional repressor of p53, and therefore IL-24 induction of p53 secondary to PSTAT3 dephosphorylation may be sensed as a stress signal and promote apoptosis in cycling cells. This model explains why IL-24 can protect some resting/differentiated cells and be deleterious to proliferating cells.","['Sainz-Perez, Alexander', 'Gary-Gouy, Helene', 'Gaudin, Francoise', 'Maarof, Ghyath', 'Marfaing-Koka, Anne', 'de Revel, Thierry', 'Dalloul, Ali']","['Sainz-Perez A', 'Gary-Gouy H', 'Gaudin F', 'Maarof G', 'Marfaing-Koka A', 'de Revel T', 'Dalloul A']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U764, IFR 13, Universite Paris XI, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (interleukin-24)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Interleukins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Phosphorylation/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*genetics/*metabolism']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/01/22 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/9/6051 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6051 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Nov 1;181(9):6051-60. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6051.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the genetic algorithm based on killer cell Ig-like receptor (KIR) and HLA genes used to predict NK cell alloreactivity have yielded discrepant results. Accordingly, it has been difficult to define transplantation settings that favor NK cell alloreactivity. In this study, we have used multiparameter flow cytometry to simultaneously analyze the cell surface expression of all four major inhibitory KIR and CD94/NKG2A to determine the size of the alloreactive NK cell repertoires in 31 individuals homozygous for the group A KIR haplotype. We observed a vast variability in the frequencies of cells with an alloreactive potential, ranging from 0 to 62% of the total NK cell population depending on which, and how many, KIR ligands were missing in theoretical recipients. This analysis required a functional examination of KIR3DL2-single positive NK cells, showing that this subset was hyporesponsive in individuals harboring the cognate ligands HLA-A3/A11. The results provide new insights into the variability of the functional alloreactive NK cell repertoire and have implications for donor selection in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and adoptive NK cell-based immunotherapy.","['Fauriat, Cyril', 'Andersson, Sandra', 'Bjorklund, Andreas T', 'Carlsten, Mattias', 'Schaffer, Marie', 'Bjorkstrom, Niklas K', 'Baumann, Bettina C', 'Michaelsson, Jakob', 'Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf', 'Malmberg, Karl-Johan']","['Fauriat C', 'Andersson S', 'Bjorklund AT', 'Carlsten M', 'Schaffer M', 'Bjorkstrom NK', 'Baumann BC', 'Michaelsson J', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Malmberg KJ']","['Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-A11 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-A3 Antigen)', '0 (KIR3DL2 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (Receptors, KIR3DL2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/metabolism', 'HLA-A11 Antigen', 'HLA-A3 Antigen/metabolism', '*Haplotypes', '*Histocompatibility Testing/methods', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/biosynthesis/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR3DL2/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/01/22 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/9/6010 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Nov 1;181(9):6010-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.9.6010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We addressed the clinical significance and mechanisms behind in vitro cellular responses to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks in 74 pediatric patients with ALL. We found an apoptosis-resistant response in 36% of patients characterized by failure to cleave caspase-3, -7, -9, and PARP1 by 24 hours after IR and an apoptosis-sensitive response with the cleavage of the same substrates in the remaining 64% of leukemias. Resistance to IR in vitro was associated with poor early blast clearance at day 7 or 15 and persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 28 of induction treatment. Global gene expression profiling revealed abnormal up-regulation of multiple prosurvival pathways in response to IR in apoptosis-resistant leukemias and differential posttranscriptional activation of the PI3-Akt pathway was observed in representative resistant cases. Importantly, pharmacologic inhibition of selected prosurvival pathways sensitized apoptosis-resistant ALL cells to IR in vitro. We suggest that abnormal prosurvival responses to DNA damage provide one of the mechanisms of primary resistance in ALL, and that they should be considered as therapeutic targets in children with aggressive disease.","['Marston, Eliot', 'Weston, Victoria', 'Jesson, Jennifer', 'Maina, Esther', 'McConville, Carmel', 'Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Skowronska, Anna', 'Mapp, Katie', 'Sameith, Katrin', 'Powell, Judith E', 'Lawson, Sarah', 'Kearns, Pamela', 'Falciani, Francesco', 'Taylor, Malcolm', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Marston E', 'Weston V', 'Jesson J', 'Maina E', 'McConville C', 'Agathanggelou A', 'Skowronska A', 'Mapp K', 'Sameith K', 'Powell JE', 'Lawson S', 'Kearns P', 'Falciani F', 'Taylor M', 'Stankovic T']","['Cancer Research UK Institute for Cancer Studies, Birmingham University, Vincent Drive, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081021,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/radiation effects', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Signal Transduction']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37921-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-142950 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 1;113(1):117-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-142950.

We studied miR-34a and miR-34b/c expression in a large cohort to define their potential role in refractory CLL. While no expression of miR-34b/c could be detected, we found variable expression levels of miR-34a. miR-34a levels were up-regulated after DNA damage in the presence of functional p53, but not in cases with 17p deletion (P < .001). We found a strong correlation of low miR-34a levels with impaired DNA damage response, TP53 mutations (without 17p deletion), and fludarabine-refractory disease (also in the absence of 17p deletion). Up-regulation of miR-34a after irradiation was associated with induction of Bax and p21, but not Puma. CLL cells with reduced miR-34a expression showed increased viability after DNA damage independently of 17p status. Therefore, low expression of miR-34a in CLL is associated with p53 inactivation but also chemotherapy-refractory disease, impaired DNA damage response, and apoptosis resistance irrespective of 17p deletion/TP53 mutation.

Here, we studied the contribution of miRNAs in a well-characterized human myeloid leukemia, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), targeted by retinoic acid and trioxide arsenic therapy. We identified several miRNAs transcriptionally repressed by the APL-associated PML-RAR oncogene which are released after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid. These coregulated miRNAs were found to control, in a coordinated manner, crucial pathways linked to leukemogenesis, such as HOX proteins and cell adhesion molecules whose expressions are thereby repressed by the chemotherapy. Thus, APL appears linked to transcriptional perturbation of miRNA genes, and clinical protocols able to successfully eradicate cancer cells may do so by restoring miRNA expression. The identification of abnormal miRNA biogenesis in cancer may therefore provide novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in myeloid leukemias.","['Saumet, Anne', 'Vetter, Guillaume', 'Bouttier, Manuella', 'Portales-Casamar, Elodie', 'Wasserman, Wyeth W', 'Maurin, Thomas', 'Mari, Bernard', 'Barbry, Pascal', 'Vallar, Laurent', 'Friederich, Evelyne', 'Arar, Khalil', 'Cassinat, Bruno', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Lecellier, Charles-Henri']","['Saumet A', 'Vetter G', 'Bouttier M', 'Portales-Casamar E', 'Wasserman WW', 'Maurin T', 'Mari B', 'Barbry P', 'Vallar L', 'Friederich E', 'Arar K', 'Cassinat B', 'Chomienne C', 'Lecellier CH']","['Institut de Genetique Humaine, CNRS UPR1142, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081021,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37890-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-158139 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 8;113(2):412-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-158139.

Overall, case-control studies published in the last decade have reported positive associations with home use of insecticides, mostly before the child's birth, while findings for herbicides are mixed. Previous studies relied solely on self-reports, therefore lacking information on active ingredients and effects of potential recall bias. Few series to date have examined the influence of children's genetic susceptibility related to transport and metabolism of pesticides. To overcome these limitations, investigators of the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study (NCCLS) have undertaken, in collaboration with a multidisciplinary team, a comprehensive assessment of residential pesticide exposure, including: (1) quality control of self-reports; (2) home pesticide inventory and linkage to the Environmental Protection Agency to obtain data on active ingredients; (3) collection and laboratory analyses of approximately 600 home dust samples for over 60 pesticides and (4) geographic information studies using California environmental databases to assess exposure to agricultural pesticides. The NCCLS is also conducting large-scale genotyping to evaluate the role of genes in xenobiotic pathways relevant to the transport and metabolism of pesticides. A better quantification of children's exposures to pesticides at home is critical to the evaluation of childhood leukaemia risk, especially for future gene-environment interaction studies.","['Metayer, Catherine', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Metayer C', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, 2150 Shattuck Avenue, Suite 500, Berkeley, CA 94720-7080, USA. cmetayer@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Intramural NIH HHS/United States', '7590-S-04/PHS HHS/United States', 'P-42-ES-04705-18/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', '7590-S-01/PHS HHS/United States', '5R01 CA092683-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-CP-11015/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA0092674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081021,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Body Burden', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Environmental Monitoring/statistics & numerical data', 'Epidemiological Monitoring', 'Housing/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Pesticides/*analysis', '*Registries', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC2879096,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn266 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn266 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):212-9. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn266.

Hypotheses proposed by both Greaves and Kinlen describe childhood leukaemia to be a rare response to one or more common infections acquired through personal contacts. Previous epidemiological studies have used day-care attendance as an indicator of the increased likelihood of early and frequent exposure to infections. It is well-documented that in developed countries, exposures to common infections occur more frequently in this type of setting. Within the Northern California Childhood Leukaemia Study, the role of social contact has been assessed and a unique 'child-hours' summary measure incorporating information on the number of months attending a day-care, mean hours per week at this day-care and the number of children in the day-care setting was constructed. In this review, the previously reported day-care results have been described, showing that in non-Hispanic White children, children in the highest category of total child-hours of exposure had a reduced risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), particularly common B-cell precursor ALL (c-ALL), compared with children without such exposures, with evidence of a dose-response effect. In addition, a literature review of relevant studies has been conducted, examining the relationship between day-care attendance and risk of childhood ALL. Overall, the 14 studies identified provided consistent support for this hypothesis, with the majority of studies reporting some evidence of a reduced risk. A meta-analysis is currently underway, which will provide a quantitative evaluation of the overall consistency and strength of the association between day-care attendance or social contact and risk of childhood ALL.","['Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Buffler, Patricia A']","['Urayama KY', 'Ma X', 'Buffler PA']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 2150 Shattuck Avenue, Suite 500, Berkeley, CA 94704, USA. kurayama@berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['PS42 ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081021,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['California/epidemiology', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Child Day Care Centers/*statistics & numerical data', 'Comorbidity', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC2879097,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn271 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn271 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):259-66. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn271.

EMF are imperceptible, ubiquitous, have multiple sources, and can vary greatly over time and distances. Childhood leukaemia and high average exposures to magnetic fields are both quite rare. Thus, a major challenge in EMF epidemiology is the small number of highly exposed cases and the necessity for retrospective assessment of exposure. Only studies designed to minimize bias while maximizing our ability to detect an association, should one exist, would have a potential to contribute to our understanding. New approaches are needed; the most promising in the extremely low-frequency range involves a study of a highly exposed cohort of children who have lived in apartments next to built-in transformers or electrical equipment rooms. Another promising avenue is an investigation of possible joint effects of environmental exposures and genetic co-factors. An exposure assessment methodology for residential radiofrequency fields is still in its infancy. Rapid changes in technology and exponential increases in its use make exposure assessment more difficult and urgent.","['Kheifets, L', 'Oksuzyan, S']","['Kheifets L', 'Oksuzyan S']","['UCLA School of Public Health, Department of Epidemiology, Los Angeles, CA, USA. kheifets@ucla.edu']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081021,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['*Body Burden', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Monitoring/*methods/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation, Nonionizing', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn260 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn260 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):139-47. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn260.

Subcutaneous immunoglobulin pharmacokinetics have been studied only during replacement therapy for primary immunodeficiency. Published studies vary greatly with respect to the nature of the patients studied, dose regimens, sampling schedules, and pharmacokinetic models, making comparisons difficult. With either route of administration, there is large variation in individual IgG elimination rates. Periodic measurement of serum IgG concentration is critical to monitor the adequacy of replacement during therapy.","['Bonilla, Francisco A']",['Bonilla FA'],"[""Division of Immunology, Children's Hospital Boston, Fegan Building, 6th Floor, 300 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA. francisco.bonilla@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Immunol Allergy Clin North Am,Immunology and allergy clinics of North America,8805635,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Sepsis/immunology/*therapy']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0889-8561(08)00068-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.iac.2008.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,"Immunol Allergy Clin North Am. 2008 Nov;28(4):803-19, ix. doi: 10.1016/j.iac.2008.06.006.",,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further analyses of cycle progression will open up new approaches in antineoplastic therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The following bibliographic databases were consulted: Central Medical Library Cologne, PubMed (English), the last search was done on April 23,2008 and key words searched were: cell cycle, cell memory, DNA methylation, embryonal/neoplastic stem cells, enzyme-modulated chromatin, G(1)-G(1)/S checkpoint, genomic/epigenomics, genomic viral DNA, histones, telomere/telomerases, transcription factors, neoplastic transformation, senescence. RESULTS: Gene transcription and epigenomic surveillance form a functional entity. In proliferation programs, transcriptional information is mediated by chromatin and DNA methylation, analyzed and processed in G(1) phase, and converged on the parental checkpoint G(1)/S for final decision-making on DNA replication. Genomic reorientation appears to be associated with transcriptional instability, which normally is corrected, possibly during the G(2)/M phase, to new levels of epigenomic equilibria. We speculate that daughter stem cells inherit persistent neoplasm-specific transcriptional instabilities through failure of the parental G(1)/S checkpoint. Foreign, silenced, potentially oncogenic DNA sequences, i.e. regular components of the human genome such as endogenous retroviruses, could conceivably be activated for expression in neoplastic transformation by epigenomic histone deacetylase/acetyl transferase/histone methyltransferase-mixed lineage leukemia deregulations. CONCLUSIONS: Failure of cell cycle G(1)/S decision-making for DNA replication is the final and possibly a major cause in neoplastic transformation. Therefore, further analysis of the dynamics of G(1)-G(1)/Sphases could provide new opportunities for therapeutic strategies.","['Prindull, Gregor']",['Prindull G'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Gottingen, Gottingen, Germany.

Family attendance at three group-oriented family information service sessions provided intensive education about this disease. Blood and skin fibroblasts were obtained for molecular genetic studies of DNA leading to the discovery of the DAPK1 mutation in the family.

Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) complements conventional cytogenetics (CC) through its sensitivity and ability to detect chromosome aberrations in nondividing cells. To overcome the limits of manual I-FISH, we developed an automated four-color I-FISH approach and assessed its ability to detect concurrent aneuploidies in ALL. I-FISH was performed using centromeric probes for chromosomes 4, 6, 10, and 17. Parameters established for nucleus selection and signal detection were evaluated. Cutoff values were determined. Combinations of aneuploidies were considered relevant when each aneuploidy was individually significant. Results obtained in 10 patient samples were compared with those obtained with CC. Various combinations of aneuploidies were identified. All clones detected by CC were observed also by I-FISH, and I-FISH revealed numerous additional abnormal clones in all patients, ranging from < or =1% to 31.6% of cells analyzed. We conclude that four-color automated I-FISH permits the identification of concurrent aneuploidies of potential prognostic significance. Large numbers of cells can be analyzed rapidly. The large number of nuclei scored revealed a high level of chromosome variability both at diagnosis and relapse, the prognostic significance of which is of considerable clinical interest and merits further evaluation.","['Blandin, Anna Talamo', 'Muhlematter, Dominique', 'Bougeon, Sandrine', 'Gogniat, Celine', 'Porter, Sarah', 'Beyer, Valerie', 'Parlier, Valerie', 'Beckmann, Jacques S', 'van Melle, Guy', 'Jotterand, Martine']","['Blandin AT', 'Muhlematter D', 'Bougeon S', 'Gogniat C', 'Porter S', 'Beyer V', 'Parlier V', 'Beckmann JS', 'van Melle G', 'Jotterand M']","['Cancer Cytogenetics Unit, Medical Genetics Service, University Hospital and University of Lausanne (CHUV-UNIL), Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Aneuploidy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Trisomy']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(08)00396-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2008 Oct 15;186(2):69-77. doi: 10.1016/j.cancergencyto.2008.06.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, between April 2002 and August 2007. METHODOLOGY: All patients of chronic myeloid leukaemia in chronic phase having HLA identical donor and age under 55 years, normal hepatic, renal and cardiac functions with good performance status were selected. Patients in accelerated phase or blast crisis, poor performance status, impaired hepatic, renal, cardiac functions or pregnancy were excluded. Survival was calculated from the date of transplant to death or last follow-up according to Kaplan-Meier and Cox (proportional hazard) regression analysis methods. RESULTS: Thirty seven patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia underwent allogeneic stem cell transplant from HLA identical sibling donors. Thirty two patients were male and five were females. Median age of patients was 28 years. All patients and donors were CMV positive. Post-transplant complications encountered were acute GvHD (Grade II-IV) (n=13, 35.1%), chronic GvHD in 18.9% (n=7), Veno Occlusive Disease (VOD) in 5.4% (n=2), acute renal failure in 2.7% (n=1), haemorrhagic cystitis in 2.7% (n=1), bacterial infections in 40.5% (n=15), fungal infections in 16.2% (n=6), CMV infection in 5.4% (n=2), tuberculosis in 5.4% (n=2), Herpes Zoster infection 2.7% (n=1) and relapse in 2.7% (n=1). Mortality was observed in 27% (n=10). Major causes of mortality were GvHD, VOD, septicemia, CMV infection and disseminated Aspergillosis. Overall Disease Free Survival (DFS) was 73% with a median duration of follow-up of 47.4 +/-12 months. DFS was 81% in standard risk and 54.5% in high-risk group. CONCLUSION: Results of allogeneic stem cell transplant in standard risk group CML patients were good and comparable with other international centres, however, results in high-risk CML patients need further improvement, although, number of patients in this group is small.","['Raza, Shahid', 'Ullah, Khalil', 'Ahmed, Parvez', 'Khan, Badshah', 'Kamal, Muhammad Khalid']","['Raza S', 'Ullah K', 'Ahmed P', 'Khan B', 'Kamal MK']","['Department of Transplant MED/Haematology, Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2008/10/23 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2008/10/23 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['040579197 [pii]', '10.2008/JCPSP.615619 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2008 Oct;18(10):615-9. doi: 10.2008/JCPSP.615619.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Admission MR imaging revealed an L-5 vertebral body lesion and a lumbar epidural lesion extending from L-3 to S-2. An [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET study showed numerous sites of osseous involvement. The patient underwent minimally invasive surgical biopsy sampling of the epidural lesion. Histopathological examination revealed extranodal HCL. After treatment with a 5-day course of cladribine, the patient's symptoms resolved, and at the 16-week follow-up visit there was no radiographic or metabolic evidence of disease.

The suitability and efficiency of such tests depend on the susceptibility of CEF to the various subgroups of exogenous as well as endogenous ALV. The ideal CEF for such tests should be not only susceptible to all retroviruses, but also free of endogenous viruses so that such tests are immune to any interference that may occur between the endogenous and the tested (exogenous) viruses. CEF and/or chickens free of endogenous viruses are also desirable for gene transfer studies using retroviral vectors, such as RNA interference (RNAi) experiments and transgenic work. The absence of ev genes in CEF or chickens can empower clean detection of successful RNAi construct delivery or gene transfer. CEF free of ev genes are also essential reagents routinely used in growing and detecting unknown retroviruses in varied viral assays.

A new class of analogs of vitamin D(3) has been synthesized, having two side-chains attached to carbon-20 (Gemini) and deuterium substituted on one side-chain. We have examined six of these analogs for their ability to inhibit growth of myeloid leukemia (HL-60), prostate (LNCaP, PC-3, DU145), lung (H520), colon (HT-29), and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. Dose-response clonogenic studies showed that all six analogs had greater antiproliferative activities against cancer cells than 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Although they had similar potency, the most active of these analogs was BXL-01-0120. BXL-01-0120 was 529-fold more potent than 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in causing 50% clonal growth inhibition (ED(50)) of HL-60 cells. Pulse-exposure studies demonstrated that exposure to BXL-01-120 (10(-9)M, 48h) resulted in 85% clonal inhibition of HL-60 growth. BXL-01-0120 (10(-11)M, 4 days) induced the differentiation marker, CD11b. Also, morphologically differentiation was more prominent compared to 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). Annexin V assay showed that BXL-01-0120 (10(-10)M, 4 days) induced significantly (p<0.05) more apoptosis than 1,25(OH)(2)D(3). In summary, these analogs have a unique structure resulting in extremely potent inhibition of clonal proliferation of various types of cancer cells, especially HL-60 cells.","['Saito, Tsuyako', 'Okamoto, Ryoko', 'Haritunians, Talin', ""O'Kelly, James"", 'Uskokovic, Milan', 'Maehr, Hubert', 'Marczak, Stanislaw', 'Jankowski, Pawel', 'Badr, Riem', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Saito T', 'Okamoto R', 'Haritunians T', ""O'Kelly J"", 'Uskokovic M', 'Maehr H', 'Marczak S', 'Jankowski P', 'Badr R', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA026038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA026038-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109295/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA109295-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080930,England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans']",PMC2648831,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/03/07 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-0760(08)00232-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2008 Nov;112(1-3):151-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jsbmb.2008.09.012.

In an attempt to understand other biological activities of this compound, the chemical synthesized DHA and its analogues (compounds 1-3) were employed to test this possibility by using adriamycin-resistant K562/A02 cells. Among the tested compounds (1-4), DHA showed the strongest potency to increase adriamycin cytotoxicity toward K562/A02 cells by MTT assays and its reversal fold is 8.18 (20 microM). Mechanisms of DHA on p-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) were further investigated. Based on the flow cytometry, we detected the significant increase of adriamycin and rhodamine123 accumulation in K562/A02 cells exposed to various concentrations of DHA, meanwhile, notable decrease of rhodamine123 efflux was also observed, which revealed DHA caused a decline of P-gp activity. Furthermore, P-gp expression was analyzed by the flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Dose-dependent reduction of P-gp expression was measured in K562/A02 cells pretreated with DHA for 24h. No such results were found in parental K562 cells.

Recently, using a chemical proteomics approach another tyrosine kinase, the collagen receptor Discoidin Domain Receptor1 (DDR1) has also been identified as a potential target of these compounds. To further investigate the interaction of imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib with DDR1 kinase we cloned and expressed human DDR1 and developed biochemical and cellular functional assays to assess their activity against DDR1 and the related receptor tyrosine kinase Discoidin Domain Receptor2 (DDR2). Our studies demonstrate that all 3 compounds are potent inhibitors of the kinase activity of both DDR1 and DDR2. In order to investigate the question of selectivity among DDR1, DDR2 and other tyrosine kinases we have aligned DDR1 and DDR2 protein sequences to other closely related members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family such as Muscle Specific Kinase (MUSK), insulin receptor (INSR), Abelson kinase (c-ABL), and the stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT) and have built homology models for the DDR1 and DDR2 kinase domains. In spite of high similarity among these kinases we show that there are differences within the ATP-phosphate binding loop (P-loop), which could be exploited to obtain kinase selective compounds. Furthermore, the potent DDR1 and DDR2 inhibitory activity of imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib may have therapeutic implications in a number of inflammatory, fibrotic and neoplastic diseases.","['Day, Elizabeth', 'Waters, Beatrice', 'Spiegel, Katrin', 'Alnadaf, Tanja', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Buchdunger, Elisabeth', 'Walker, Christoph', 'Jarai, Gabor']","['Day E', 'Waters B', 'Spiegel K', 'Alnadaf T', 'Manley PW', 'Buchdunger E', 'Walker C', 'Jarai G']","['Novartis Institutes of Biomedical Research, Respiratory Disease Area, Wimblehurst Road, Horsham, RH12 5AB, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081011,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (DDR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Discoidin Domain Receptor 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Discoidin Domain Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Discoidin Domain Receptor 1', 'Discoidin Domain Receptors', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Models, Molecular', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Mitogen/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Structural Homology, Protein', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/10/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(08)01025-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.10.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Dec 3;599(1-3):44-53. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.10.014.

Biomarkers are needed to diagnose and/or predict patients who are at risk for HAM/TSP or ATLL. Therefore, we investigated using luciferase immunoprecipitation technology (LIPS) antibody responses to seven HTLV-I proteins in non-infected controls, asymptomatic HTLV-I-carriers, ATLL and HAM/TSP sera samples. Antibody profiles were correlated with viral load and examined in longitudinal samples. RESULTS: Anti-GAG antibody titers detected by LIPS differentiated HTLV-infected subjects from uninfected controls with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, but did not differ between HTLV-I infected subgroups. However, anti-Env antibody titers were over 4-fold higher in HAM/TSP compared to both asymptomatic HTLV-I (P < 0.0001) and ATLL patients (P < 0.0005). Anti-Env antibody titers above 100,000 LU had 75% positive predictive value and 79% negative predictive value for identifying the HAM/TSP sub-type. Anti-Tax antibody titers were also higher (P < 0.0005) in the HAM/TSP compared to the asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers. Proviral load correlated with anti-Env antibodies in asymptomatic carriers (R = 0.76), but not in HAM/TSP. CONCLUSION: These studies indicate that anti-HTLV-I antibody responses detected by LIPS are useful for diagnosis and suggest that elevated anti-Env antibodies are a common feature found in HAM/TSP patients.","['Burbelo, Peter D', 'Meoli, Elise', 'Leahy, Hannah P', 'Graham, Jhanelle', 'Yao, Karen', 'Oh, Unsong', 'Janik, John E', 'Mahieux, Renaud', 'Kashanchi, Fatah', 'Iadarola, Michael J', 'Jacobson, Steven']","['Burbelo PD', 'Meoli E', 'Leahy HP', 'Graham J', 'Yao K', 'Oh U', 'Janik JE', 'Mahieux R', 'Kashanchi F', 'Iadarola MJ', 'Jacobson S']","['Neurobiology and Pain Therapeutics Section, Laboratory of Sensory Biology, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. burbelop@nidcr.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081020,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Carrier State', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation/*methods', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/diagnosis/*immunology/virology', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/diagnosis/*immunology/virology', 'Viral Load', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",PMC2580768,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-96 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-96 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Oct 20;5:96. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-96.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A loss-of-function single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position 1513 (1513 A-->C) of the P2X(7) gene has recently been identified in both healthy and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B-cells, translating into a loss of P2X(7)-mediated apoptosis in these cells. This antiapoptotic effect results in increased B-cell numbers, thereby potentially contributing to the survival of B-CLL clones.

A 33-year-old man was suffering from febrile neutropenia (FN) on day 15 after the start of remission-induction therapy for biphenotypic acute leukemia under gut decontamination with polymyxin B and nystatin. Meropenem, a carbapenem, was administered according to the guideline for FN. Two days later (on day 17), he complained of severe abdominal pain, lost consciousness, went into sudden cardiopulmonary arrest, and died. Autopsy showed multiple spots of hemorrhage and necrosis caused by bacterial plaque in the brain, lungs, and liver. B. cereus was isolated from a blood sample obtained in the morning on day 17 and it was after his death that the isolated B. cereus was revealed to be resistant to carbapenem. B. cereus obtained from blood samples has been reported to be usually sensitive to carbapenem and also to vancomycin, new quinolones, and clindamycin. If B. cereus resistant to carbapem increases, our method of gut decontamination with polymyxin B and nystatin may have to be changed to one containing a new quinolone for the prevention of septicemia. Careful watching to determine whether B. cereus resistant to carbapem increases may be also important for empiric therapy, because carbapenem is often selected as the initial therapy for FN in patients with severe neutropenia.","['Kiyomizu, Kazunobu', 'Yagi, Toshinari', 'Yoshida, Hitoshi', 'Minami, Ryota', 'Tanimura, Akira', 'Karasuno, Takahiro', 'Hiraoka, Akira']","['Kiyomizu K', 'Yagi T', 'Yoshida H', 'Minami R', 'Tanimura A', 'Karasuno T', 'Hiraoka A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases, 1-3-3 Nakamichi, Osaka, 537-8511, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081021,Netherlands,J Infect Chemother,Journal of infection and chemotherapy : official journal of the Japan Society of Chemotherapy,9608375,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Carbapenems)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacillus cereus/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Bacteremia/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Brain Stem/microbiology/pathology', 'Carbapenems/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fever/drug therapy', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/complications/diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Liver/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Lung/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Neutropenia/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'beta-Lactam Resistance']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/02/03 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10156-008-0627-y [doi]', 'S1341-321X(08)70741-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Infect Chemother. 2008 Oct;14(5):361-7. doi: 10.1007/s10156-008-0627-y.

This review is directed to an audience of clinical and laboratory professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of myeloid neoplasms, and it aims to succinctly present the most important genes that have been shown to be important in these disorders. In addition to the information about mutations, their significance, and the methods used in their diagnosis, the normal patterns of expression of these genes, their normal functions, and their structures are also discussed.","['Cotta, Claudiu V', 'Tubbs, Raymond R']","['Cotta CV', 'Tubbs RR']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44122, USA. cottac@ccf.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Diagn Mol Pathol,"Diagnostic molecular pathology : the American journal of surgical pathology, part B",9204924,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/genetics', 'ras Proteins/genetics']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PDM.0b013e31817d5327 [doi]'],ppublish,Diagn Mol Pathol. 2008 Dec;17(4):191-9. doi: 10.1097/PDM.0b013e31817d5327.,,,91,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, early relapses and the emergence of imatinib-resistant disease are problematic. Evidence suggests that imatinib and other inhibitors may not effectively eradicate leukemic stem/progenitor cells, and that combination therapy directed to complimentary targets may improve treatment. Abelson helper integration site 1 (Ahi-1)/AHI-1 is a novel oncogene that is highly deregulated in CML stem/progenitor cells where levels of BCR-ABL transcripts are also elevated. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of Ahi-1/AHI-1 in murine and human hematopoietic cells confer growth advantages in vitro and induce leukemia in vivo, enhancing effects of BCR-ABL. Conversely, RNAi-mediated suppression of AHI-1 in BCR-ABL-transduced lin(-)CD34(+) human cord blood cells and primary CML stem/progenitor cells reduces their growth autonomy in vitro. Interestingly, coexpression of Ahi-1 in BCR-ABL-inducible cells reverses growth deficiencies exhibited by BCR-ABL down-regulation and is associated with sustained phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and enhanced activation of JAK2-STAT5. Moreover, we identified an AHI-1-BCR-ABL-JAK2 interaction complex and found that modulation of AHI-1 expression regulates phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and JAK2-STAT5 in CML cells. Importantly, this complex mediates TKI response/resistance of CML stem/progenitor cells. These studies implicate AHI-1 as a potential therapeutic target downstream of BCR-ABL in CML.","['Zhou, Liang L', 'Zhao, Yun', 'Ringrose, Ashley', 'DeGeer, Donna', 'Kennah, Erin', 'Lin, Ann E-J', 'Sheng, Guoqing', 'Li, Xiao-Jiang', 'Turhan, Ali', 'Jiang, Xiaoyan']","['Zhou LL', 'Zhao Y', 'Ringrose A', 'DeGeer D', 'Kennah E', 'Lin AE', 'Sheng G', 'Li XJ', 'Turhan A', 'Jiang X']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver V5Z 1L3, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081020,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport)', '0 (Ahi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Vesicular Transport', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines', 'RNA Interference', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC2571939,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['jem.20072316 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20072316 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2008 Oct 27;205(11):2657-71. doi: 10.1084/jem.20072316.

The present paper first describes the COMARE study, which was based on data from the National Registry of Children's Tumours (NRCT); in particular, the methodology used in this study is described. Although the results of the COMARE study were negative for childhood leukaemia, this apparent discrepancy could be accounted for by a number of differences in approach, especially those relating to the distances from the power stations and the ages of the children studied. The present study was designed to match the KiKK study as far as possible. The incidence observed (18 cases within 5 km against 14.58 expected, p = 0.21) was not significantly raised. The risk estimate for proximity in the regression fitted was actually negative, though the confidence intervals involved are so wide that the difference from that reported in the KiKK study is only marginally statistically significant (p = 0.063).","['Bithell, J F', 'Keegan, T J', 'Kroll, M E', 'Murphy, M F G', 'Vincent, T J']","['Bithell JF', 'Keegan TJ', 'Kroll ME', 'Murphy MF', 'Vincent TJ']","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HJ, UK. john.bithell@spc.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20081020,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['Body Burden', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', '*Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Nuclear Power Plants/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Monitoring/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment/methods', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn254 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn254 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):191-7. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn254.

Within the study, it was shown that the observed trend in risk decreases over time. That could be indicative of some agent being involved for which the prevalence is reduced over time. Previous ecological studies showed increased risks among the youngest age groups in the closest vicinity of the sites, but no elevated risks for children of all ages (0-14).

Leukaemia incidence and mortality risks are also surveyed in 16 other studies of persons who received appreciable doses of ionizing radiation in the course of treatment in childhood and for whom there is adequate dosimetry and cancer incidence or mortality follow-up. Relative risks tend to be lower in the medical series than in the Japanese A-bomb survivors. The relative risks in the medical studies tend to diminish with increasing average therapy dose. After taking account of cell sterilisation and dose fractionation, the apparent differences between the relative risks for leukaemia in the Japanese A-bomb survivors and in the medical series largely disappear. This suggests that cell sterilisation largely accounts for the discrepancy between the relative risks in the Japanese data and the medical studies. Excess absolute risk has also been assessed in four studies, and there is found to be more variability in this measure than in excess relative risk. In particular, there is a substantial difference between the absolute risk in the Japanese atomic bomb survivor data and those in three other (European) populations. In summary, the relative risks of leukaemia in studies of persons exposed to appreciable doses of ionizing radiation in the course of treatment for a variety of malignant and non-malignant conditions in childhood are generally less than those in the Japanese A-bomb survivor data. The effects of cell sterilisation can largely explain the discrepancy between the Japanese and the medical series.","['Little, M P']",['Little MP'],"[""Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, St Mary's Campus, Norfolk Place, London W2 1PG, UK. mark.little@imperial.ac.uk""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081020,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['Body Burden', 'Child', 'Environmental Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Nuclear Medicine/*statistics & numerical data', 'Nuclear Warfare/*statistics & numerical data', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn264 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn264 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):156-65. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn264.

Fgl2 has been reported to play a vital role in the pathogenesis in MHV-3 (mouse hepatitis virus) induced fulminant and severe hepatitis, spontaneous abortion, allo- and xeno- graft rejection by mediating ""immune coagulation"". METHODS: Tumor tissues from 133 patients with six types of distinct cancers and the animal tumor tissues from human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) model on nude mice (established from high metastasis HCC cell line MHCC97LM6) were obtained. RESULTS: Hfgl2 was detected in tumor tissues from 127 out of 133 patients as well as tumor tissues collected from human HCC nude mice. Hfgl2 was highly expressed both in cancer cells and interstitial inflammatory cells including macrophages, NK cells, and CD8(+) T lymphocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Hfgl2 mRNA was localized in cells that expressed hfgl2 protein. Fibrin (nogen) co-localization with hfgl2 expression was determined by dual immunohistochemical staining. In vitro, IL-2 and IFN-gamma increased hfgl2 mRNA by 10-100 folds and protein expression in both THP-1 and HUVEC cell lines. One-stage clotting assays demonstrated that THP-1 and HUVEC cells expressing hfgl2 had increased procoagulant activity following cytokines stimulation. CONCLUSION: The hfg12 contributes to the hypercoagulability in cancer and may induce tumor angiogenesis and metastasis via cytokine induction.","['Su, Kai', 'Chen, Fang', 'Yan, Wei-Ming', 'Zeng, Qi-Li', 'Xu, Li', 'Xi, Dong', 'Pi, Bin', 'Luo, Xiao-Ping', 'Ning, Qin']","['Su K', 'Chen F', 'Yan WM', 'Zeng QL', 'Xu L', 'Xi D', 'Pi B', 'Luo XP', 'Ning Q']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Tongji Hospital of Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Hubei Province, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (FGL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Thrombophilia/*metabolism', 'Thromboplastin/*metabolism']",PMC2760190,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/02/13 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3748/wjg.14.5980 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2008 Oct 21;14(39):5980-9. doi: 10.3748/wjg.14.5980.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there is a considerable knowledge regarding the character of the ""first hit,"" the nature of the ""second hit"" remains unanswered in most of the cases including leukemias with MLL gene rearrangement. We demonstrate here a striking sequence of events, which include a covert, protracted preleukemic phase characterized by a dominant MLL/FOXO3A clone with intact myeloid differentiation and the subsequent acquisition of a secondary genetic abnormality, leading to overt lymphoblastic leukemia. Backtracking of the secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (sALL) with the MLL rearrangement showed no blasts in the bone marrow (BM) during the protracted preleukemic phase. However, at the same time (more than 1 year before the sALL diagnosis) the MLL/FOXO3A was present in up to 90% of BM cells including myeloid lineage, suggesting that the fusion arose in a multipotent progenitor. To identify potential ""second hit"" precipitating sALL we compared DNA in preleukemic versus fully leukemic samples. The analysis revealed a 10 Mb gain on 19q13.32 in the sALL, absent in the preleukemic specimen. These data provide insight into the dynamics of leukemogenesis in secondary leukemia with MLL rearrangement.","['Zuna, Jan', 'Burjanivova, Tatiana', 'Mejstrikova, Ester', 'Zemanova, Zuzana', 'Muzikova, Katerina', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Horsley, Sharon W', 'Kearney, Lyndal', 'Colman, Susan', 'Ptoszkova, Hana', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Stary, Jan', 'Greaves, Mel', 'Trka, Jan']","['Zuna J', 'Burjanivova T', 'Mejstrikova E', 'Zemanova Z', 'Muzikova K', 'Meyer C', 'Horsley SW', 'Kearney L', 'Colman S', 'Ptoszkova H', 'Marschalek R', 'Hrusak O', 'Stary J', 'Greaves M', 'Trka J']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Charles University Prague, 2nd Medical School, Czech Republic. jan.zuna@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Fusion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Preleukemia/*genetics']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.20622 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2009 Jan;48(1):98-107. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20622.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro and ex vivo observations suggest that increases in intracellular ara-C levels influenced by administration of fludarabine and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) increase the effect of ara-C, prompting us to clinically evaluate the efficacy of such combinations. METHODS: We analyzed the event-free survival of patients with newly diagnosed CBF AML treated with fludarabine and ara-C (FA) (N = 45) or with FA and GCSF (FLAG) (N = 22) and compared results to patients treated with regimens consisting of idarubicin and ara-C with or without GCSF (IA/IAG) (N = 47). RESULTS: After accounting for prognostic covariates other than treatment (including year in which treatment was administered), FA, and in particular FLAG, were associated with longer event-free survival than IA/IAG.

METHODS: Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry was used to evaluate BMD in 74 randomly selected, long-term childhood ALL survivors initially treated in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. Growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone-arginine stimulation testing was conducted to evaluate peak GH level, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and other markers of endocrine functioning were also evaluated in relation to BMD. RESULTS: The mean age at the time of interview was 30 years, and the mean time since diagnosis was 24 years. Low BMD (Z-score, < or = -1) was present in 24% of subjects, including 1 with osteoporosis. Low BMD was substantially more prevalent in men than in women and was strongly associated with short height. The mean height Z-score for those with low BMD was -1.44, compared with a height Z-score of -0.39 (P < .01) for those with normal BMD. GH insufficiency, low IGF-I Z-score, and current smoking were also suggestive risk factors for low BMD. CONCLUSIONS: In this long-term follow-up study of childhood ALL survivors, low BMD was found to be more prevalent than expected based on population normative data, specifically in men. The health consequences of early-onset BMD problems in childhood ALL survivors need to be carefully monitored.","['Thomas, Inas H', 'Donohue, Janet E', 'Ness, Kirsten K', 'Dengel, Donald R', 'Baker, K Scott', 'Gurney, James G']","['Thomas IH', 'Donohue JE', 'Ness KK', 'Dengel DR', 'Baker KS', 'Gurney JG']","['Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['M01 RR000400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR00400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA106778/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA106778/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA106778-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Body Height', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Human Growth Hormone/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/therapy', 'Sex Factors', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",PMC2597561,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23912 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Dec 1;113(11):3248-56. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23912.,['Cancer. 2009 Oct 15;115(20):4885; author reply 4885-6.

The vast majority of CML patients have a BCR-ABL translocation that yields a 210 kD (p210) oncoprotein, whereas adult Ph-positive ALL cases can present with either a p190 or a p210 oncoprotein, or both. Considering that 30% of the patients with CML that progress to blast crisis will have a lymphoblastic presentation, adults presenting with a p210 ALL may have either a de novo ALL or CML presenting for the first time in lymphoblastic phase. To identify the distinguishing features, cases of p190-ALL, p210-ALL, and lymphoblastic CML were compared. In spite of significant overlap between the three entities, a number of features were found to aid in their differentiation. p210-ALL patients present at a younger age with blasts that frequently show loss of expression of CD34, whereas p190-ALL patients present with marked increase in peripheral blast percentage. Interestingly, bone marrow findings characteristic of a myeloproliferative disorder are specific, but are not sensitive for lymphoblastic CML. This study suggests that despite the similarities between these leukemias, p190-ALL, p210-ALL, and lymphoblastic phase CML likely represent three distinct diseases.","['Klco, Jeffery M', 'Kreisel, Friederike H', 'Zehnbauer, Barbara A', 'Kulkarni, Shashikant', 'Hassan, Anjum', 'Frater, John L']","['Klco JM', 'Kreisel FH', 'Zehnbauer BA', 'Kulkarni S', 'Hassan A', 'Frater JL']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21291 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Dec;83(12):901-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21291.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Cytokines, biomarkers of inflammation, may moderate both health outcomes, but published data are limited. We looked at the role of cytokines in modulating QOL and fatigue in an older AML population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 34 English-speaking patients (23 men, 11 women) aged 50 or older with AML within 1 year of diagnosis. QOL and fatigue were assessed with validated questionnaires. Blood was simultaneously drawn for quantitative measurement of a 13-cytokine panel. Repeat measurements were done 4-6 weeks later (n = 28 patients). Spearman correlations between health measures and cytokine levels were examined at baseline, as were changes in variables between time points. A potentially clinically important correlation was defined as an r > or = 0.30. RESULTS: At baseline, potentially clinically important correlations were noted between global QOL and interferon (IFN)-gamma (r = -0.376, p = 0.031), interleukin (IL)-2 (r = -0.340, p = 0.053), IL-5 (r = -0.368, p = 0.035), IL-8 (r = -0.312, p = 0.077), and TNF-alpha (r = -0.326, p = 0.064). A similar correlation was observed between IL-6 and fatigue (r = 0.332, p = 0.059). Between time points, there were no potentially important correlations between changes in global QOL and any cytokine. However, potentially important correlations with fatigue were seen with both IL-5 (r = 0.344, p = 0.073) and IL-10 (r = 0.326, p = 0.091) between time points.

PML is essential for the proper assembly of a nuclear macromolecular structure called the PML nuclear body (PML-NB). PML and PML-NBs are functionally promiscuous and have been associated with the regulation of several cellular functions. Above all these is the control of apoptosis, a function of PML whose physiological relevance is emphasized by in vivo studies that demonstrate that mice and cells lacking Pml are resistant to a vast variety of apoptotic stimuli. The function of PML in regulating apoptosis is not confined to a linear pathway; rather, PML works within a regulatory network that finely tunes various apoptotic pathways, depending on the cellular context and the apoptotic stimulus. Here, we will summarize earlier and recent advances on the molecular mechanisms by which PML regulates apoptosis and the implication of these findings for cancer pathogenesis.","['Bernardi, R', 'Papa, A', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Bernardi R', 'Papa A', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Cancer Genetics Program, Beth Israel Deaconess Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism/*physiology']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008305 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.305 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Oct 20;27(48):6299-312. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.305.,,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of Aurora-A kinase has been shown to correlate with tumor proliferation and chromosomal instability. We investigated Aurora-A kinase expression in peripheral blood and bone marrow of 47 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients and 20 age-matched hematologically healthy subjects. Western blot analysis showed significantly higher Aurora-A levels in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (42 of 47) compared with lymphocytes of healthy subjects. However, Aurora-A mRNA expression in three chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients was similar to or lower than that of healthy control subjects. In 28 of 42 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with elevated Aurora-A kinase expression, one or more chromosomal abnormalities were detected, including trisomy 12 in 9 patients and deletion of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated gene in 9 patients. Aurora-A was also detected in all (100%) chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases by immunohistochemistry, with a nuclear staining pattern. The larger prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts showed stronger Aurora-A kinase expression than did small lymphocytes. In contrast, normal bone marrow reactive lymphocytes were negative for Aurora-A with positive histiocytes and immature myeloid cells. Immunostaining for acetylated histone H3 showed a nuclear pattern in all 38 chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases and double labeling showed coexpression of acetylated histone H3 and Aurora-A. In summary, Aurora-A kinase is overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The expression of acetylated histone H3 suggests that Aurora-A kinase may be active (functional). Thus, Aurora-A kinase overexpression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia may be involved in the genesis of chromosomal abnormalities and is a potential target for therapeutic intervention.","['Inamdar, Kedar V', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Sen, Subrata', 'Keating, Michael', 'Nguyen, Martin H', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Fernandez, Michael', 'Thomazy, Vilmos', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E']","['Inamdar KV', ""O'Brien S"", 'Sen S', 'Keating M', 'Nguyen MH', 'Wang X', 'Fernandez M', 'Thomazy V', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Bueso-Ramos CE']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20081017,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Aurora Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aurora Kinases', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/03/04 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['modpathol2008173 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2008.173 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2008 Dec;21(12):1428-35. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2008.173.

Chromosome translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23) is one of the most common genetic aberrations and results in the formation of the MLL-AF9 fusion gene that functions as a facilitator of cell growth directly. In order to study this type of AML, the cell lines with cytogenetically diagnosed t(9;11)(p22;q23), such as Mono Mac 6 (MM6), have been widely used. To examine whether there is any difference in gene expression between the primary human t(9;11) AML cells and MM6 cell line, genome-wide transcriptome analysis was performed on MM6 cell line using SAGE and the results were compared to the profile of primary human t(9;11) AML cells. 884 transcripts which were alternatively expressed between MM6 cells and primary human t(9;11) cells were identified through statistical analysis (P < 0.05) and 4-fold expression change. Of these transcripts, 830 (94%) matched to known genes or EST were classified by functional categories (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). The majority of alternatively expressed genes in MM6 were involved in biosynthetic and metabolic processes, but HRAS, a protein that is known to be associated with leukemogenesis, was expressed only in MM6 cells and several other genes involved in Erk1/Erk2 MAPK pathway were also over-expressed in MM6. Therefore, since MM6 cell line has a similar expression profile to primary human t(9;11) AML in general and expresses uniquely a strong Erk1/Erk2 MAPK pathway including HRAS, it can be used as a model for HRAS-positive t(9;11) AML.","['Lee, Jinseok', 'Hwang, Junmo', 'Kim, Hyung-Soo', 'Kim, Seonggon', 'Kim, Young Hun', 'Park, So-Young', 'Kim, Kil Soo', 'Ryoo, Zae Young', 'Chang, Kyu-Tae', 'Lee, Sanggyu']","['Lee J', 'Hwang J', 'Kim HS', 'Kim S', 'Kim YH', 'Park SY', 'Kim KS', 'Ryoo ZY', 'Chang KT', 'Lee S']","['School of Life Science and Biotechnology, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Genes Genet Syst,Genes & genetic systems,9607822,,IM,"['*Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/ggs/83.339 [pii]', '10.1266/ggs.83.339 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Genet Syst. 2008 Aug;83(4):339-45. doi: 10.1266/ggs.83.339.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In search for mechanisms of resistance, we measured the half maximal (50%) inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of DAC and found it differed 1000-fold among a panel of cancer cell lines. The IC(50) was correlated with the doses of DAC that induced the most hypomethylation of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE; R = 0.94, P < .001), but not with LINE methylation or DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), 3a, and 3b expression at baseline. Sensitivity to DAC showed a low correlation (R = 0.44, P = .11) to that of 5-azacytidine (AZA), but a good correlation to that of cytarabine (Ara-C; R = 0.89, P < .001). The 5 cell lines most resistant to DAC had a combination of low dCK, hENT1, and 2 transporters, and high cytosine deaminase. In an HL60 clone, resistance to DAC could be rapidly induced by drug exposure and was related to a switch from heterozygous to homozygous mutation of DCK. Transfection of wild-type DCK restored DAC sensitivity. DAC induced DNA breaks as evidenced by H2AX phosphorylation and increased homologous recombination rates by 7- to 10-fold. These results suggest that in vitro resistance to DAC can be explained by insufficient incorporation into DNA.","['Qin, Taichun', 'Jelinek, Jaroslav', 'Si, Jiali', 'Shu, Jingmin', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Qin T', 'Jelinek J', 'Si J', 'Shu J', 'Issa JP']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Twenty-six patients received a total of 74 cycles. Dose-limiting reactions were neurologic (somnolence, euphoria, ataxia) and associated with the infusion. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 28 mg/m(2) over 3 hours every 3 weeks. One (4%) of 26 patients achieved a partial response. Patients with anemia (3/11) or thrombocytopenia (4/14) experienced improvements in hemoglobin and platelet counts.

In HTLV-transformed cells, Tax upregulates interleukin (IL)-13, a cytokine with proliferative and anti-apoptotic functions that is linked to leukaemogenesis. Tax-stimulated IL-13 is thought to result in autocrine stimulation of HTLV-infected cells and thus may be relevant to their growth. The causal transactivation of the IL-13 promoter by Tax is predominantly dependent on a nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-binding P element. Here, it was shown that the isolated IL-13 Tax-responsive element (IL13TaxRE) was sufficient to mediate IL-13 transactivation by Tax and NFAT1. However, cyclosporin A, a specific NFAT inhibitor, revealed that Tax transactivation of IL13TaxRE or wild-type IL-13 promoter was independent of NFAT and that NFAT did not contribute to IL-13 upregulation in HTLV-transformed cells. By contrast, Tax stimulation was repressible by an efficient nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB inhibitor (IkBaDN), indicating the requirement for NF-kappaB. The capacity of NF-kappaB to stimulate IL13TaxRE was demonstrated by a strong response to NF-kappaB in reporter assays and by direct binding of NF-kappaB to IL13TaxRE. Thus, IL13TaxRE in the IL-13 promoter represents a dually active promoter element responsive to NF-kappaB and NFAT. Together, these results indicate that Tax causes IL-13 upregulation in HTLV-1-infected cells via NF-kappaB.","['Silbermann, Katrin', 'Schneider, Grit', 'Grassmann, Ralph']","['Silbermann K', 'Schneider G', 'Grassmann R']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'TATA Box', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.2008/003699-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2008 Nov;89(Pt 11):2788-2798. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.2008/003699-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet such measures can be used in nested case-control approaches or for validating exposure models that can be applied to large populations.

Herein, we investigated NEGN's pro-apoptotic effect on human leukemia THP-1 cells. NGEN treatment inhibited THP-1 cells' growth a concentration-dependent manner by inducing apoptosis, as evidenced by the formation of apoptotic bodies and the accumulation of cells in the sub-G1 phase. NGEN-induced apoptosis was accompanied by increased hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, downregulation of Bcl-2, upregulation of Bax, activation of caspases and subsequent poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavages. z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, significantly inhibited both the cytotoxic effect and apoptotic characteristics induced by NGEN treatment demonstrating caspase-3's important role in the observed cytotoxic effect. The induction of apoptosis was also associated with the inactivation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt, and PI3K inhibitor LY29004 significantly increases NGEN-induced cell death. These findings provide evidence that NEGN's pro-apoptotic effect is mediated by the activation of caspases and mitochondria dysfunctions that correlate with the inactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in THP-1 cells. Therefore, NGEN has a strong potential as a therapeutic agent for preventing cancers such as leukemia.","['Park, Joon Hee', 'Jin, Cheng-Yun', 'Lee, Bok Kyu', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Jeong, Yong Kee']","['Park JH', 'Jin CY', 'Lee BK', 'Kim GY', 'Choi YH', 'Jeong YK']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Dongeui University, South Korea.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081001,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Estrogen Antagonists)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Indoles)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'HN5425SBF2 (naringenin)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Estrogen Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Genes, bcl-2/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(08)00543-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2008.09.056 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2008 Dec;46(12):3684-90. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2008.09.056.

Of interest, are the human childhood acute leukemias harboring specific fusion oncogenes such as MLL-AF4, TEL-AML1 or BCR-ABL wherein clinically significant manifestations arise in utero. The mechanisms of transformation are not amenable to analysis with patient samples and, many mouse models for pediatric leukemias have fallen short in illuminating the human disease because they do not recapitulate key aspects of the actual disease, suggesting that the mouse models are missing essential components of oncogenesis present in the human embryo. Prior to using hESCs as a tentative system for modeling leukemia, robust studies aimed at demonstrating their genetic stability are required; otherwise, cooperating mutations already present could prime hESCs susceptible to transformation. We performed an extensive molecular cytogenetic and cellular in vitro and in vivo analysis which reveals an overall genomic stability of HS181 and HS293 hESCs maintained long-term by mechanical dissociation in human feeders. Importantly, we show for the first time that the genetically stable HS181 hESC line differentiates into CD45+ hematopoietic cells and clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors. This data should encourage stem cell researchers to implement robust cytogenetic tools when assessing hESC genetic stability, in order to detect tiny but relevant biological functional or structural chromosome abnormalities and, paves the way for generating fusion oncogene-expressing transgenic hESCs as a human-specific system for studying the early in utero events leading to normal hematopoietic specification versus childhood leukemic transformation.","['Catalina, P', 'Bueno, C', 'Montes, R', 'Nieto, A', 'Ligero, G', 'Sanchez, L', 'Jara, M', 'Rasillo, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Cigudosa, J', 'Hovatta, O', 'Greaves, M', 'Menendez, P']","['Catalina P', 'Bueno C', 'Montes R', 'Nieto A', 'Ligero G', 'Sanchez L', 'Jara M', 'Rasillo A', 'Orfao A', 'Cigudosa J', 'Hovatta O', 'Greaves M', 'Menendez P']","['Andalucian Stem Cell Bank, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081017,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Spectral Karyotyping', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00388-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.08.028 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Jul;33(7):980-90. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.08.028.

In the past few decades, the crucial role of GATA-1 in normal human hematopoiesis has been delineated. As would be expected, mutations in GATA-1 have subsequently been found to have important clinical significance, and are directly linked to deregulated formation of certain blood cell lineages. This paper reviews the functional consequences of GATA-1 mutations by linking specific errors in the gene, or its downstream protein products, to documented human diseases. These five human diseases are: X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT), X-linked thrombocytopenia with thalassemia (XLTT), congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) and acute megarakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) associated with Trisomy 21, and, lastly, a particular subtype of anemia associated with the production of GATA-1s, a shortened, mutant isoform of the wild-type GATA-1. The different phenotypic expressions associated with GATA-1 mutations illustrate the integral function of the transcription factor in overall body homeostasis. Furthermore, these direct genotype-phenotype correlations reinforce the importance of unraveling the human genome, as such connections may lead to important therapeutic or preventive therapies.","['Ciovacco, Wendy A', 'Raskind, Wendy H', 'Kacena, Melissa A']","['Ciovacco WA', 'Raskind WH', 'Kacena MA']","['Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 DK072442/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR055269/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK0724429/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK072442-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AR055269/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR055269-01/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 AR055269-02/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080930,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Down Syndrome', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Porphyria, Erythropoietic/genetics', 'Thrombocytopenia/genetics']",PMC2601579,2008/10/22 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(08)00485-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2008.09.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2008 Dec 31;427(1-2):1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2008.09.018.

The organization began in the mid 1950s as a multi-institutional collaboration between investigators at the National Cancer Institute, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, and the Children's Hospital in Buffalo New York. In 1956 the group was officially designated as the Acute Leukemia Group B (ALGB) and for most of its first decade focused largely on leukemia research. Reflecting an expansion of its research portfolio during the 1960s and 70s, the name was changed in 1976 to Cancer and Leukemia Group B. Currently, the organization has hundreds of members, including nurses, clinical research associates, statisticians, physicians, translational scientists, and an administrative staff from a nationwide network of academic and community based organizations and medical practices. Disease areas within the scope of CALGB research include hematologic malignancies, as well as breast, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and respiratory cancers. Modality expertise includes quality of life, medical oncology, surgery, radiation oncology, pathology, imaging, oncology nursing, health outcomes, geriatrics, biostatistics, data management, and an extensive array of correlative sciences.

Two cases and literature review].,311-6,10.1016/j.annpat.2007.11.009 [doi],"We report the clinical and immunohistological features of two cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) with Hodgkin's transformation. These cases occurred in a 70-year-old man with a three-year history of CLL and in a 76-year-old man with a few months history of CLL. Microscopic examination showed the presence of large tumor cells with the morphological and immunophenotypic features of classical Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (R-S) cells, in a background of otherwise typical B-CLL. The transformation of CLL into large B cell lymphoma (Richter's syndrome) is a well-documented phenomenon. Only rarely does CLL transform into Hodgkin's lymphoma, but this diagnosis is often easy and offers few differential diagnoses. The major points of interest lie in the pathogenetic relationship between CLL and Hodgkin's disease, and in the potential clinical implications of this peculiar condition. Literature on the subject indicates that identical IgH gene rearrangements in micromanipulated R-S and CLL cells have been identified in 7/12 cases. In these patients, the R-S and CLL cells belong to the same clonal population, suggesting a progression from the underlying CLL cells. This group appears to have a poor prognosis, identical to classical Richter's syndrome. In other cases, the R-S cells were often Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positive and did not share the clonal rearrangements identified in CLL cells, suggesting that Hodgkin's disease in these patients could represent a second malignancy, EBV-related and favored by immunosuppression, associated with a better prognosis.","['Dujardin, Fanny', 'Lefrancq, Thierry', 'Blechet, Claire', 'Boni-Boka, Michel', 'Senecal, Delphine', 'Desmoulins, Isabelle', 'Guyetant, Serge']","['Dujardin F', 'Lefrancq T', 'Blechet C', 'Boni-Boka M', 'Senecal D', 'Desmoulins I', 'Guyetant S']","[""Service d'anatomie et de cytologie pathologiques, hopital Trousseau, CHRU de Tours, 37044 Tours cedex 09, France.""]",['fre'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080826,France,Ann Pathol,Annales de pathologie,8106337,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'CD79 Antigens/immunology', '*Genetic Variation', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/pathology']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/12/31 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0242-6498(08)00099-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annpat.2007.11.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Pathol. 2008 Sep;28(4):311-6. doi: 10.1016/j.annpat.2007.11.009.

Prospective registry study.,401-5,,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in patients diagnosed with acute leukemias (AL) is an uncommon complication with poor prognosis. The indication and the schedules of prophylaxis and treatment of CNS involvement in AL are not homogenous among countries and within the same country. The aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to analyze and report the practice of CNS prophylaxis and treatment in patients with AL in Spain. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Prospective study conducted from June 2005 to June 2006. Adult patients (> or = 18 yr.) diagnosed with AL who received CNS prophylaxis or treatment were consecutively included through online registration. RESULTS: 265 patients from 32 hospitals were included. Mean (standard deviation) age was 44 (16) yr. and 133 (50%) were males. For acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients (n = 158), CNS therapy was given to 12 cases (10 at diagnosis and 2 at relapse) and consisted of triple intrathecal therapy (TIT, methotrexate, cytarabine and hydrocortisone) in 11 and liposomal depot cytarabine in one. CNS prophylaxis (n = 146) consisted of TIT in 135 cases, intrathecal methotrexate in 7, intrathecal cytarabine in 2 and intrathecal liposomal depot cytarabine in 2. No cranial irradiation either for prophylaxis or therapy was given in any case. In acute myeloblastic leukemia patients (n = 107), CNS therapy was administered to 17 cases (9 at diagnosis and 8 at relapse). Intrathecal therapy consisted of TIT in 11, intrathecal liposomal depot cytarabine in 5 and intrathecal cytarabine in one. One patient also received craniospinal irradiation. CNS prophylaxis (n = 90) consisted of TIT in 68 cases and intrathecal methotrexate in 22. CONCLUSIONS: In Spain, the patterns of CNS prophylaxis and therapy for AL are homogeneous. TIT was the most frequent schedule for CNS prophylaxis and therapy. The lack of use of cranial or craniospinal irradiation and the administration of new drugs (i.e.: liposomal depot cytarabine) for CNS therapy and prophylaxis is of note.","['Sancho, Juan-Manuel', 'Morgades, Mireia', 'Arranz, Reyes', 'Fernandez-Abellan, Pascual', 'Deben, Guillermo', 'Alonso, Natalia', 'Blanes, Margarita', 'Rodriguez, Maria Jose', 'Nicolas, Concepcion', 'Sanchez, Eva', 'Fernandez de Sevilla, Alberto', 'Conde, Eulogio', 'Ribera, Josep-Maria']","['Sancho JM', 'Morgades M', 'Arranz R', 'Fernandez-Abellan P', 'Deben G', 'Alonso N', 'Blanes M', 'Rodriguez MJ', 'Nicolas C', 'Sanchez E', 'Fernandez de Sevilla A', 'Conde E', 'Ribera JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia Clinica, ICO-Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol, Badalona, Barcelona, Espana.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', '*Registries', 'Spain']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-7753(08)72433-3 [pii]', '10.1157/13126214 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2008 Oct 4;131(11):401-5. doi: 10.1157/13126214.,,,,,,,,,,,,"['QUIT Study (PETHEMA, GELTAMO and GOTEL Groups)']",,,,,

Because many pediatric malignancies arise from dysregulated development, roles for Notch signaling in these cancers are to be expected. Evidence to support this is now emerging as the Notch pathway is being explored in more pediatric cancers. Not surprisingly, Notch appears to play diverse roles in different malignancies, effecting differentiation, metastasis, cancer ""stem cells,"" and angiogenesis. As examples, although activating mutations of Notch1 are found in the majority of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases, Notch/HES1 signaling appears to play a tumor suppressor role in precursor B-cell ALL; although Notch/HES1 signaling appears to contribute to osteosarcoma metastasis, Notch signaling also promotes medulloblastoma ""stem cell"" survival and contributes to angiogenesis in neuroblastoma. Further understanding of the roles of Notch signaling in specific pediatric cancers will provide a rationale for Notch-based therapeutic strategies.","['Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A']",['Zweidler-McKay PA'],"[""The Children's Cancer Hospital, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 853, Houston, TX 77030, USA.

However, most relapse patients do achieve a second complete remission, followed by therapeutic options including further chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The level of minimal residual disease after achieving second remission or before transplant may predict outcomes. The substantial likelihood of achieving second remission with familiar drug combinations may discourage participation in formal relapse studies.

Increased number of cells were counted by trypan-blue staining; the killing activity was detected by MTT assay; immunophenotype changes were analyzed by flow cytometry; the IL-12 and INF-gamma levels of the cultured supernatants were detected by ELISA kits. The results showed that the proliferation capability of DC-CIK cells was significantly higher than that of CIK cells (p < 0.05). Under the same condition, the ratio of double positive cells such as CD3(+) CD8(+), CD3(+) CD56(+) in CIK cells was significantly enhanced by co-cultured with DC cells (p < 0.05). The levels of IL-12 and INF-gamma in cultured supernatants of DC-CIK cells increased noticeably on day 3 as compared with CIK cells cultured alone (p < 0.01, p < 0.05). Within the effector-target ratio range between 5:1 to 40:1, the activity of DC-CIK cells against leukemia cells were much higher than that of CIK cells (p < 0.05), and this effect showed a positive correlation with the effector-target ratio. It is concluded that the proliferation capability of DC-CIK cells, the level of their secreted cytokines and their activity against leukemia cells are significantly higher than those of CIK cells.

This study was purposed to enhance the weak immunological function of dendritic cells (DCs) derived from the patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) by blockade of the expression of PD-L1. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) of CML patients were induced into DCs in the presence of cytokine cocktail of rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4 and TNF-alpha. The phenotypes of DCs were detected by flow cytometry, mixed lymphocyte reaction was analyzed by MTT assay and IFN-gamma, IL-2 and IL-10 in the cell culture supernatant were detected by ELISA. The results showed that the expression of PD-L1 on CML-DCs was upregulated with the maturation of CML-DCs. PD-L1-blockaded DCs could enhance T lymphocyte proliferation, increase the secretion of IL-2 and IFN-gamma, and inhibit the production of IL-10. Taken together, PD-L1-blockaded DCs originated from CML cells had more potent immunostimulatory capability. It is concluded that PD-L1 blockaded can enhance the function of CML-DCs.

The leukemia cell line HL-60 was used as target cells. The inhibitory effects of HDI on proliferation of HL-60 cells were observed by MTT assay. The positive rate of cell apoptosis and the surface marker of granulocytic differentiation (CD33 and CD15) were measured by flow cytometry. The expressions of anti-apoptosis related gene (survivin and bcl-2) were detected by RT-PCR. The results showed that the growth of HL-60 cells was inhibited by higher concentration of HDI (3.12 - 12.5 ml/L) and inhibited obviously in dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01), but not suppressed by low concentration of HDI (1.56 ml/L) in liquid culture system (p > 0.05). The FCM and DNA Ladder results showed that the phenomenon of typical apoptosis did not detected after HL-60 cells were treated with the different concentrations of HDI for 24, 48 and 72 hours respectively. After HL-60 cells were treated with HDI (1.56, 3.12, 6.25 and 12.5 ml/L) for one week, the expression level of CD15 surface marker was all enhanced obviously. When treated with HDI (6.25 ml/L) for 3 weeks, the expression levels of survivin and bcl-2 gene were also decreased obviously by 60% and 44% respectively. It is concluded that HDI can inhibit HL-60 cells in the presence of its higher concentrations. The mechanisms of HDI may induce HL-60 cells differentiation, and suppress the expression of anti-apoptosis related gene (survivin or bcl-2) to inhibit the growth of HL-60 cells.","['Chen, Xiao-Hong', 'Gao, Rui-Lan', 'Qian, Xu-Dai', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Tan, Pan-Li', 'Yin, Li-Ming', 'Zhou, Yu-Hong']","['Chen XH', 'Gao RL', 'Qian XD', 'Wang X', 'Tan PL', 'Yin LM', 'Zhou YH']","['Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang Provincial Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Survivin']",,2008/10/22 09:00,2011/07/13 06:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2011/07/13 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['1009-2137(2008)05-1035-04 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 Oct;16(5):1035-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that the remission rate in AML was 60.7% (complete remission rate was 43% and partial remission rate was 17.7%), and that was 52.4% in MDS. The incidence of granulocyte deficiency was 25% during 3.5 days. The severe infection rate was 3%, without severe bleeding, with mild digest effect, and slight damage of function in heart, liver, and kidney. The therapy-related mortality was zero. The higher CR rate was in AML-M(2) and AML-M(5) (60.9%, 61.9%), and the longest remission period was 4 years; expression rate of costimulatory molecule B7.1 displayed large variance (0% - 66.7%) and had positive correlation with efficiency of priming chemotherapy. The rate of B7.1 expression was higher in AML-M(2) and AML-M(5) and lower in other AML groups and normal control.

Also, we have monitored the prognostic value of this gene as a minimal residual disease (MRD). METHODS: All bone marrow samples of eighty patients diagnosed as CD 10 positive B-ALL in South Egypt Cancer Institute were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for t(12;21) in newly diagnosed cases and after morphological complete remission as a minimal residual disease (MRD). We determined the prognostic significance of TEL-AML1 fusion represented by disease course and survival. RESULTS: TEL-AML1 fusion gene was positive in (37.5%) in newly diagnosed patients. There was a significant correlation between TEL-AML1 fusion gene both at diagnosis (r = 0.5, P = 0.003) and as a MRD (r = 0.4, P = 0.01) with favorable course. Kaplan-Meier curve for the presence of TEL-AML1 fusion at the diagnosis was associated with a better probability of overall survival (OS); mean survival time was 47 +/- 1 month, in contrast to 28 +/- 5 month in its absence (P = 0.006). Also, the persistence at TEL-AML1 fusion as a MRD was not significantly associated with a better probability of OS; the mean survival time was 42 +/- 2 months in the presence of MRD and it was 40 +/- 1 months in its absence. So, persistence of TEL-AML1 fusion as a MRD had no additive prognostic value over its measurement at diagnosis in terms of predicting the probability of OS. CONCLUSION: For most patients, the presence of TEL-AML1 fusion gene at diagnosis suggests a favorable prognosis. The present study suggests that persistence of TEL-AML1 fusion as MRD has no additive prognostic value.","['Mosad, Eman', 'Hamed, Hosny B', 'Bakry, Rania M', 'Ezz-Eldin, Azza M', 'Khalifa, Nesrine M']","['Mosad E', 'Hamed HB', 'Bakry RM', 'Ezz-Eldin AM', 'Khalifa NM']","['Clinical Pathology Department, South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. eman_mosaad@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081017,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",PMC2577682,2008/10/22 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/10/22 09:00'],"['2008/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-17 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Oct 17;1:17. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pituitary gland integrates some of these signals by responding to the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and LIF and to a negative Gc feedback loop. The present work used whole-genome approaches to define the LIF/STAT3 regulatory network and to delineate cross-talk between this pathway and Gc action. Genome-wide ChIP-chip identified 3,449 STAT3 binding sites, whereas 2,396 genes regulated by LIF and/or Gc were found by expression profiling. Surprisingly, LIF on its own changed expression of only 85 genes but the joint action of LIF and Gc potentiated the expression of more than a thousand genes. Accordingly, activation of both LIF and Gc pathways also potentiated STAT3 and GR recruitment to many STAT3 targets. Our analyses revealed an unexpected gene cluster that requires both stimuli for delayed activation; 83% of the genes in this cluster are involved in different cell defense mechanisms. Thus, stressors that trigger both general stress and inflammatory responses lead to activation of a stereotypic innate cellular defense response.","['Langlais, David', 'Couture, Catherine', 'Balsalobre, Aurelio', 'Drouin, Jacques']","['Langlais D', 'Couture C', 'Balsalobre A', 'Drouin J']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire, Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081017,United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '126469-30-5 (Lcn2 protein, mouse)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Feedback, Physiological', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/drug effects', 'Genome', 'Glucocorticoids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/drug effects/physiology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*genetics/immunology/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Multigene Family', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/drug effects/physiology', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/immunology/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC2562516,2008/10/18 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pgen.1000224 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS Genet. 2008 Oct;4(10):e1000224. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000224.

As is the case for many cancers, apoptosis of leukaemic cells in response to chemotherapeutic drugs such as doxorubicin is dependent upon FOXO activation. Surprisingly, prolonged FOXO activity paradoxically promotes drug-resistance in leukaemia by enhancing the expression of critical signal intermediates that drive the activity of the Class 1A PI3-K/Akt survival pathway. Additionally, under continuous stress, FOXO factors also induce the expression of genes important for drug efflux, antioxidant defence, and DNA damage repair. Thus, the same effector molecules, FOXOs, are responsible for not only the initial therapeutic response to cancer drugs but also the subsequent acquisition of resistance. This emerging evidence demonstrates that FOXO factors have a dual role in stress response and function at the axis of cancer drug sensitivity and resistance. Nevertheless, the mechanism that allows FOXO to escape the negative control of the PI3-K/Akt pathway in response to persistent cytotoxic stress and to switch its control from pro-apoptotic to pro-survival target genes is not well understood but likely to involve a series of defined post-translational protein modifications.","['Gomes, Ana R', 'Brosens, Jan J', 'Lam, Eric W-F']","['Gomes AR', 'Brosens JJ', 'Lam EW']","['Department of Oncology, Cancer Research-UK labs, MRC Cyclotron Building, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital Campus, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081005,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/physiology', '*Drug Therapy', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",,2008/10/18 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['6920 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.20.6920 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 Oct;7(20):3133-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.20.6920.

Perforin disruption of target cell membranes is hypothesized to require binding of a calcium-dependent, lipid-inserting, C2 domain. In a family affected by hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, a severe inflammatory disorder caused by perforin deficiency, we identified 2 amino acid substitutions in the perforin C2 domain: T435M, a previously identified mutant with disputed pathogenicity, and Y438C, a novel substitution. Using biophysical modeling, we predicted that the T435M substitution, but not Y438C, would interfere with calcium binding and thus cytotoxic function. The capacity for cytotoxic function was tested after expression of the variant perforins in rat basophilic leukemia cells and murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes. As predicted, cells transduced with perforin-T435M lacked cytotoxicity, but those expressing perforin-Y438C displayed intact cytotoxic function. Using novel antibody-capture and liposome-binding assays, we found that both mutant perforins were secreted; however, only nonmutated and Y438C-substituted perforins were capable of calcium-dependent lipid binding. In addition, we found that perforin-Y438C was capable of mediating cytotoxicity without apparent proteolytic maturation. This study clearly demonstrates the pathogenicity of the T435M mutation and illustrates, for the first time, the critical role of the human perforin C2 domain for calcium-dependent, cytotoxic function.","['Urrea Moreno, Ramon', 'Gil, Juana', 'Rodriguez-Sainz, Carmen', 'Cela, Elena', 'LaFay, Victor', 'Oloizia, Brian', 'Herr, Andrew B', 'Sumegi, Janos', 'Jordan, Michael B', 'Risma, Kimberly A']","['Urrea Moreno R', 'Gil J', 'Rodriguez-Sainz C', 'Cela E', 'LaFay V', 'Oloizia B', 'Herr AB', 'Sumegi J', 'Jordan MB', 'Risma KA']","['Division of Immunology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['R01 HL091769/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K12 CHILD HEALTH RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01-HL091769/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081016,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution/immunology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/*immunology', 'Homeostasis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Lipids/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mutation, Missense/*immunology', 'Perforin/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",PMC2615650,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37882-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-172924 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 8;113(2):338-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-08-172924.

One mechanism for retention of blasts within the bone marrow is adhesion via very late antigen-4 (VLA-4), the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin heterodimer that binds to its main ligands, fibronectin, and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). To examine the relationship of functional expression of VLA-4 to prognosis in AML, we studied marrow samples from 175 adult AML patients who underwent induction chemotherapy with anthracycline and cytarabine on Southwest Oncology Group trials. The studies included flow cytometry and functional in vitro assays for ligand binding and maximal beta(1) activation. VLA-4 expression varied widely, with mean expression 60.6% for alpha(4), and was not significantly associated with response to chemotherapy, relapse-free, or overall survival (OS). However, increased binding of soluble VCAM-1 via VLA-4 was significantly associated with longer OS, corrected for age (P = .033). Estimated 5-year OS was 31% (95% confidence interval, 14%-48%) in 30 patients with soluble VCAM-1 binding greater than or equal to 40%, compared with 10% (confidence interval, 3%-17%) in 72 patients with lower binding.

The aim of our study was to evaluate if the in vivo proliferation marker 3'-deoxy-3'-18F-fluorothymidine (FLT) is suitable for visualizing leukemia manifestation sites and if 18F-FLT is a surrogate marker for disease activity. METHODS: In this pilot study, 10 patients with AML underwent pretherapeutic imaging with 18F-FLT PET or 18F-FLT PET/CT. The biodistribution of 18F-FLT was assessed 60 min after intravenous injection of the radiotracer. Standardized uptake values were calculated for reference segments of bone marrow, spleen, and normal organs. 18F-FLT PET in 10 patients with benign pulmonary nodules and the absence of malignant or inflammatory disease served as controls. RESULTS: Retention of 18F-FLT was observed predominantly in bone marrow and spleen and was significantly higher in AML patients than in controls (mean 18F-FLT SUV in bone marrow, 11.5 and 6.6, P < 0.05; mean 18F-FLT SUV in spleen, 6.1 and 1.8, P < 0.05). Outside bone marrow, focal 18F-FLT uptake showed extramedullary manifestation sites of leukemia in 4 patients (meningeal disease, pericardial, abdominal, testicular, and lymph node), proven by other diagnostic procedures. CONCLUSION: This pilot study indicated that PET using 18F-FLT is able to visualize extramedullary manifestation sites of AML and reflects disease activity. Because 18F-FLT uptake in bone marrow is caused by a combination of both neoplastic and normal hematopoietic cells, the correlation of 18F-FLT uptake in bone marrow and leukemic blast infiltration did not reach statistical significance.","['Buck, Andreas K', 'Bommer, Martin', 'Juweid, Malik E', 'Glatting, Gerhard', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Mottaghy, Felix M', 'Schulz, Melanie', 'Kull, Thomas', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Moller, Peter', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Reske, Sven N']","['Buck AK', 'Bommer M', 'Juweid ME', 'Glatting G', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Mottaghy FM', 'Schulz M', 'Kull T', 'Bunjes D', 'Moller P', 'Dohner H', 'Reske SN']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. andreas.buck@tum.de']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081016,United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,"['0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', 'PG53R0DWDQ (alovudine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Dideoxynucleosides/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Young Adult']",,2008/10/18 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['jnumed.108.055335 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.108.055335 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2008 Nov;49(11):1756-62. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.108.055335.

Our laboratory has shown that normal and malignant B cells, including multiple myeloma, express PPARgamma. Moreover, certain PPARgamma ligands can induce apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. Because PPARgamma ligands can also have PPARgamma-independent effects, the role of PPARgamma in B-cell malignancies remains poorly understood. To further understand the role of PPARgamma, we examined the functional consequences of its overexpression in human multiple myeloma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In the present work, we developed a lentiviral vector for PPARgamma gene delivery. We transduced multiple myeloma cells with a lentivirus-expressing PPARgamma and studied the involvement of this receptor on cell growth and viability. RESULTS: PPARgamma overexpression decreased multiple myeloma cell proliferation and induced spontaneous apoptosis even in the absence of exogenous ligand. These PPARgamma-overexpressing cells were dramatically more sensitive to PPARgamma ligand-induced apoptosis compared with uninfected or LV-empty-infected cells. Apoptosis was associated with the down-regulation of antiapoptotic proteins X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein and myeloid cell leukemia-1 as well as induction of caspase-3 activity. Importantly, PPARgamma overexpression-induced cell death was not abrogated by coincubation with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC), which are known to protect multiple myeloma cells from apoptosis. Additionally, PPARgamma overexpression in multiple myeloma or BMSC inhibited both basal and multiple myeloma-induced interleukin-6 production by BMSC. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PPARgamma negatively controls multiple myeloma growth and viability in part through inhibition of interleukin-6 production by BMSC. As such, PPARgamma is a viable therapeutic target in multiple myeloma.","['Garcia-Bates, Tatiana M', 'Bernstein, Steven H', 'Phipps, Richard P']","['Garcia-Bates TM', 'Bernstein SH', 'Phipps RP']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['ES01247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007152-25/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007152/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE011390/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001247-250109/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32HL007152/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE11390/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DE011390-21/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Hypoglycemic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'U8QXS1WU8G (ciglitazone)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemic Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Lentivirus', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'PPAR gamma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Thiazolidinediones/pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",PMC2756795,2008/10/18 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/20/6414 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0457 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 15;14(20):6414-25. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0457.,,,,['NIHMS137227'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have looked at the role of OSM signaling in nontransformed mouse mammary epithelial cells in vitro using the KIM-2 mammary epithelial cell line and in vivo using OSM receptor (OSMR)-deficient mice. OSM and its receptor were up-regulated approximately 2 d after the onset of postlactational mammary regression, in response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3). This resulted in sustained STAT3 activity, increased epithelial apoptosis, and enhanced clearance of epithelial structures during the remodeling phase of mammary involution. Concurrently, OSM signaling precipitated the dephosphorylation of STAT5 and repressed expression of the milk protein genes beta-casein and whey acidic protein (WAP). Similarly, during pregnancy, OSM signaling suppressed beta-casein and WAP gene expression. In vitro, OSM but not LIF persistently down-regulated phosphorylated (p)-STAT5, even in the continued presence of prolactin. OSM also promoted the expression of metalloproteinases MMP3, MMP12, and MMP14, which, in vitro, were responsible for OSM-specific apoptosis. Thus, the sequential activation of IL-6-related cytokines during mammary involution culminates in an OSM-dependent repression of epithelial-specific gene expression and the potentiation of epithelial cell extinction mediated, at least in part, by the reciprocal regulation of p-STAT5 and p-STAT3.","['Tiffen, Paul G', 'Omidvar, Nader', 'Marquez-Almuina, Nuria', 'Croston, Dawn', 'Watson, Christine J', 'Clarkson, Richard W E']","['Tiffen PG', 'Omidvar N', 'Marquez-Almuina N', 'Croston D', 'Watson CJ', 'Clarkson RW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081016,United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit)', '0 (Osmr protein, mouse)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Death/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Lactation/genetics/metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Milk/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncostatin M Receptor beta Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology']",PMC5419408,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/03/07 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['me.2008-0097 [pii]', '10.1210/me.2008-0097 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2008 Dec;22(12):2677-88. doi: 10.1210/me.2008-0097.

In tasidotin, the carboxyl-terminal ester group of dolastatin 15 has been replaced by a carboxy-terminal tert-butyl amide. As expected from studies with cemadotin, [(3)H]tasidotin, with the radiolabel in the second proline residue, was hydrolyzed intracellularly, with formation of N,N-dimethylvalyl-valyl-N-methylvalyl-prolyl-proline (P5), a pentapeptide also present in dolastatin 15 and cemadotin. P5 was more active as an inhibitor of tubulin polymerization and less active as a cytotoxic agent than tasidotin, cemadotin, and dolastatin 15. [(3)H]P5 was not the end product of tasidotin metabolism. Large amounts of [(3)H]proline were formed in every cell line studied, with proline ultimately becoming the major radiolabeled product. The putative second product of the hydrolysis of P5, N,N-dimethylvalyl-valyl-N-methylvalyl-proline (P4), had little activity as either an antitubulin or cytotoxic agent. In seven suspension cell lines, the cytotoxicity of tasidotin correlated with total cell uptake of the compound and was probably affected negatively by the extent of degradation of P5 to proline and, presumably, P4. The intracellular enzyme prolyl oligopeptidase probably degrades tasidotin to P5. When CCRF-CEM human leukemia cells were treated with N-benzyloxycarbonylprolylprolinal (BCPP), an inhibitor of prolyl oligopeptidase, there was a 30-fold increase in the IC(50) of tasidotin and a marked increase in intracellular [(3)H]tasidotin. BCPP also caused a 4-fold increase in the IC(50) of P5, so the enzyme probably does not convert P5 to P4. Inhibiting degradation of P5 should have led to a decrease in the IC(50) obtained for P5 in the presence of BCPP.","['Bai, Ruoli', 'Edler, Michael C', 'Bonate, Peter L', 'Copeland, Terry D', 'Pettit, George R', 'Luduena, Richard F', 'Hamel, Ernest']","['Bai R', 'Edler MC', 'Bonate PL', 'Copeland TD', 'Pettit GR', 'Luduena RF', 'Hamel E']","['Toxicology and Pharmacology Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081016,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '05G07285DK (tasidotin)', '123884-00-4 (dolastatin 15)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors']",PMC2635573,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.108.051110 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.108.051110 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2009 Jan;75(1):218-26. doi: 10.1124/mol.108.051110.

Epidemiol. 2006;35(2):370-384.), an electronic literature search was performed covering August 2002-April 2008. It showed that (1) the results are heterogeneous, with no clear evidence to support a relation between SES and childhood leukaemia; (2) a number of factors, most importantly selection bias, might explain inconsistencies between studies; (3) there is some support for an association between SES at birth (rather than later in childhood) and childhood leukaemia and (4) if there are any associations, these are weak, limited to the most extreme SES groups (the 10-20% most or least deprived). This makes it unlikely that they would act as strong confounders in research addressing associations between other exposures and childhood leukaemia.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of measuring adolescents' HRQoL at the time of their diagnosis of OS or AML, and to compare their ratings with those of their parents and of similarly diagnosed but younger patients aged 8-12 years. Participants included 126 patients (79 adolescents) and 130 parents (78 parents of adolescents); most completed the HRQoL instrument/s within 48 h of the first chemotherapy cycle. Ninety-three percent of adolescents diagnosed with OS and 93% of those diagnosed with AML completed the HRQoL instruments. Agreement between the adolescents and their parents ranged from 0.29 to 0.71 (OS) and 0.44 to 0.62 (AML). In all domains, OS adolescents had significantly lower PedsQL v.4.0 scores than adolescents with AML. Our findings demonstrates the feasibility of measuring HRQoL in adolescents with OS or AML (and their parents) at the time of diagnosis, and thus their HRQoL ratings can be used to inform their cancer care from diagnosis forward.","['Hinds, Pamela S', 'Billups, Catherine A', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Gattuso, Jami S', 'Burghen, Elizabeth', 'West, Nancy', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Daw, Najat C']","['Hinds PS', 'Billups CA', 'Cao X', 'Gattuso JS', 'Burghen E', 'West N', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Daw NC']","[""Division of Nursing Research, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. pam.hinds@stjude.org""]",['eng'],['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20081015,Scotland,Eur J Oncol Nurs,European journal of oncology nursing : the official journal of European Oncology Nursing Society,100885136,,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Male', 'Osteosarcoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*psychology', 'Parents/psychology', 'Probability', 'Psychometrics', '*Quality of Life', 'Sex Factors', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Time Factors']",PMC4017853,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/11/05 06:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/05 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1462-3889(08)00123-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejon.2008.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Oncol Nurs. 2009 Jul;13(3):156-63. doi: 10.1016/j.ejon.2008.08.003.

Not much is known about the molecular biology of this disease. METHODS: We studied a series of 30 CMML samples (13 MP- and 11 MD-CMMLs, and 6 acutely transformed cases) from 29 patients by using Agilent high density array-comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and sequencing of 12 candidate genes. RESULTS: Two-thirds of samples did not show any obvious alteration of aCGH profiles. In one-third we observed chromosome abnormalities (e.g. trisomy 8, del20q) and gain or loss of genes (e.g. NF1, RB1 and CDK6). RAS mutations were detected in 4 cases (including an uncommon codon 146 mutation in KRAS) and PTPN11 mutations in 3 cases. We detected 11 RUNX1 alterations (9 mutations and 2 rearrangements). The rearrangements were a new, cryptic inversion of chromosomal region 21q21-22 leading to break and fusion of RUNX1 to USP16. RAS and RUNX1 alterations were not mutually exclusive. RAS pathway mutations occurred in MP-CMMLs (approximately 46%) but not in MD-CMMLs. RUNX1 alterations (mutations and cryptic rearrangement) occurred in both MP and MD classes (~38%). CONCLUSION: We detected RAS pathway mutations and RUNX1 alterations. The latter included a new cryptic USP16-RUNX1 fusion. In some samples, two alterations coexisted already at this early chronic stage.","['Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Trouplin, Virginie', 'Adelaide, Jose', 'Aceto, Nicola', 'Remy, Virginie', 'Pinson, Stephane', 'Houdayer, Claude', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Bentires-Alj, Mohamed', 'Olschwang, Sylviane', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Chaffanet, Max']","['Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Trouplin V', 'Adelaide J', 'Aceto N', 'Remy V', 'Pinson S', 'Houdayer C', 'Arnoulet C', 'Sainty D', 'Bentires-Alj M', 'Olschwang S', 'Vey N', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Birnbaum D', 'Chaffanet M']","[""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire, UMR891 Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France. gelsiv@marseille.fnclcc.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081016,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (USP16 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics']",PMC2588460,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/07/01 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/06/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-299 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-299 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Oct 16;8:299. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-299.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from 147 adult patients with leukemia. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to screen FLT3/ITD mutation and quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of the FLT3 transcript. Flow cytometry was used for detection of FLT3 receptor protein expression on bone marrow mononuclear cells. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to estimate the significance of FLT3. RESULTS: FLT3 expression was higher in acute myeloid leukemia and B-acute lymphoid leukemia than in T-acute lymphoid leukemia (P=0.006, P=0.001) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (P<0.001). In chronic myelogenous leukemia, FLT3 expression in blast transformation phase was higher than in acceleration phase (P=0.023). Surface expression of FLT3 protein was correlated with high percentage of bone marrow blasts and with FLT3 mRNA expression (r=0.366, P<0.001) in acute leukemia. FLT3/ITDs in the juxtamembrane domain were found in 25% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 7% of patients with acute lymphoid leukemia. FLT3/ITD positive sequences had 36, 42, and 57 nucleotides. FLT3/ITD mutation was associated with a higher white blood cell count, higher marrow blast percentage, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (P=0.045, P=0.014, P<0.001, respectively) and not associated with a higher FLT3 mRNA and FLT3 protein expression, and lower complete remission (P=0.091, P=0.060, P=0.270, respectively). CONCLUSION: FLT3 expression levels differed in different types of adult leukemia. Overexpression of FLT3 and presence of a positive FLT3/ITD mutation in acute leukemia were associated with unfavorable clinical characteristics and poor prognosis.","['Peng, Hong-Ling', 'Zhang, Guang-Sen', 'Gong, Fan-Jie', 'Shen, Jian-Kai', 'Zhang, Yang', 'Xu, Yun-Xiao', 'Zheng, Wen-Li', 'Dai, Chong-Wen', 'Pei, Min-Fei', 'Yang, Jun-Jie']","['Peng HL', 'Zhang GS', 'Gong FJ', 'Shen JK', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu YX', 'Zheng WL', 'Dai CW', 'Pei MF', 'Yang JJ']","[""Division of Hematology/Institute of Molecular Hematology, Second Xiang-Ya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Croatia,Croat Med J,Croatian medical journal,9424324,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC2582358,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3325/cmj.2008.5.650 [doi]'],ppublish,Croat Med J. 2008 Oct;49(5):650-69. doi: 10.3325/cmj.2008.5.650.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus of this article is on optimizing neuropsychological and adaptive outcomes for children who have been successfully treated for these cancers and whose prospects for long-term survival are increasingly encouraging. We present a model for understanding systemic interactions among the multiple factors that influence the child's development over time and take into account contextual variables. Strategies for optimizing cognitive and psychosocial outcomes or ameliorating late effects need to consider treatment histories, specific stages of development, the contextual demands/developmental challenges associated with each, and the resources (internal and external to the child) available to meet these challenges. The challenges faced by survivors at the early childhood, middle childhood, adolescent, and emerging adulthood stages are discussed.

Resistant cells accumulated significantly less SNARF-1 compared to parental cells but near control levels of probe accumulation were observed by preincubating cells with the specific MRP1 inhibitor MK571. Two new drug-resistant cell lines were generated following exposure to doxorubicin or daunorubicin and these upregulated MRP1 or P-glycoprotein expression, respectively. Experiments in these cells showed that reduced SNARF-1 accumulation was specific to MRP1 overexpression, as cells upregulating P-glycoprotein accumulated control levels of the probe. Confirmation that SNARF-1 is a MRP1 substrate was obtained using K562 and KG1a cells that have been shown to, respectively, constitutively express MRP1 and P-glycoprotein. Together, the data suggest that SNARF-1 is a substrate for MRP1 but not P-glycoprotein, and could therefore be used as a probe to distinguish between expression and activity of these 2 efflux proteins. Finally, we confirm that doxorubicin but not daunorubicin challenged MRP1 overexpressing HL-60 cells have elevated cytosolic pH.","['Jin, Jing', 'Jones, Arwyn T']","['Jin J', 'Jones AT']","['Welsh School of Pharmacy, Cardiff University, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Naphthols)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (carboxy-seminaphthorhodaminefluoride)', '0 (seminaphthorhodaminefluoride)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Benzopyrans/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukotriene Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Naphthols/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Rhodamines/metabolism/*pharmacology']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23892 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jan 1;124(1):233-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23892.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in the G-CSFR in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) transforming to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have been shown to induce hypersensitivity and enhanced growth responses to G-CSF. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in the initiation of negative signaling by the G-CSFR. To further investigate the role of ubiquitination in regulating G-CSFR signaling, we generated a mutant form of the G-CSFR (K762R/G-CSFR) which abrogates the attachment of ubiquitin to the lysine residue at position 762 of the G-CSFR that is deleted in the Delta716 G-CSFR form isolated from patients with SCN/AML. In response to G-CSF, mono-/polyubiquitination of the G-CSFR was impaired in cells expressing the mutant K762R/G-CSFR compared to cells transfected with the WT G-CSFR. Cells stably transfected with the K762R/G-CSFR displayed a higher proliferation rate, increased sensitivity to G-CSF, and enhanced survival following cytokine depletion, similar to previously published data with the Delta716 G-CSFR mutant. Activation of the signaling molecules Stat5 and Akt were also increased in K762R/G-CSFR transfected cells in response to G-CSF, and their activation remained prolonged after G-CSF withdrawal. These results indicate that ubiquitination is required for regulation of G-CSFR-mediated proliferation and cell survival. Mutations that disrupt G-CSFR ubiquitination at lysine 762 induce aberrant receptor signaling and hyperproliferative responses to G-CSF, which may contribute to leukemic transformation.","['Ai, Jing', 'Druhan, Lawrence J', 'Loveland, Megan J', 'Avalos, Belinda R']","['Ai J', 'Druhan LJ', 'Loveland MJ', 'Avalos BR']","['Heart and Lung Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['R21 DK068639/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-DK068639/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20081016,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Lysine/genetics', 'Mutant Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology', 'Neutropenia/congenital/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/*physiology']",PMC2561048,2008/10/17 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003422 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2008;3(10):e3422. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003422.

To investigate this phenomenon, we explored FAS transcript levels, cell-surface FAS protein expression and susceptibility to FAS-mediated apoptosis in four CTCL lines (MyLa, HH, SZ4, and SeAx), freshly isolated leukemic cells from a patient with SS, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-cell line (Jurkat), and JFL (a FAS-low variant of Jurkat). Results confirmed low FAS expression by the leukemic SS cells, HH, SZ4, SeAx, and JFL relative to normal peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes and the other cell lines. There was a direct correlation among FAS transcript level, FAS protein level, and FAS-mediated apoptotic sensitivity in the CTCL samples. When the FAS-deficient cell lines were transfected with a wild-type FAS construct, FAS expression and sensitivity to FAS-mediated apoptosis were restored. In aggregate, these findings provide evidence that like normal T cells, CTCL cells exhibit a mechanistic connection between transcriptional regulation of FAS and sensitivity to FAS-mediated apoptosis, point to the development of FAS deficiency as one molecular mechanism responsible for acquired resistance to apoptosis in CTCL, and indicate that upregulation of FAS expression can restore sensitivity to apoptosis.","['Wu, Jianqiang', 'Nihal, Minakshi', 'Siddiqui, Jawed', 'Vonderheid, Eric C', 'Wood, Gary S']","['Wu J', 'Nihal M', 'Siddiqui J', 'Vonderheid EC', 'Wood GS']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Wisconsin and VAMC, Madison, Wisconsin 53715, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20081016,United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Sezary Syndrome/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation/*physiology', 'fas Receptor/genetics/*metabolism']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-202X(15)34319-0 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2008.309 [doi]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 2009 May;129(5):1165-73. doi: 10.1038/jid.2008.309.

Here, we identified DLC1 promoter hypermethylation in 43 out of 44 multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines, which resulted in downregulation or silencing of DLC1 in 41 samples. High frequency of tumor-specific methylation and attenuation or silencing of DLC1 expression could serve as an independent diagnostic marker for MM. Combined treatment with demethylating and acetylating agents significantly elevated the expression of DLC1 and suppressed MM cell proliferation. Two cell lines exhibiting complete promoter methylation and the absence of DLC1 expression were transduced by an adenoviral vector containing DLC1 cDNA. In both cell lines, the reexpression of DLC1 inhibited myeloma cell invasion and migration, reduced RhoA activity and resulted in the reorganization of actin cytoskeleton. These results provide the first evidence for the antiproliferative effect of DLC1 in a hematological cancer and implicate RhoA pathway in suppression of MM migration and invasion. Given the myeloma cells sensitivity to the reactivation of DLC1 function, the potential for molecular targeted therapy of DLC1-mediated pathways as well as epigenetic therapies hold prospects.","['Ullmannova-Benson, V', 'Guan, M', 'Zhou, X', 'Tripathi, V', 'Yang, X-Y', 'Zimonjic, D B', 'Popescu, N C']","['Ullmannova-Benson V', 'Guan M', 'Zhou X', 'Tripathi V', 'Yang XY', 'Zimonjic DB', 'Popescu NC']","['Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4262, USA.']",['eng'],['ZIA BC010038-14/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20081016,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DLC1 protein, human)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Movement', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', '*Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Young Adult', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/*metabolism']",PMC2790147,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/03/03 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008285 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.285 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Feb;23(2):383-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.285.

Instead of known miRNA genes, new miRNA genes were not evolutionarily conserved. Quantification of 19 selected miRNA genes revealed an aberrant expression in ALL as compared with normal CD34+ cells (P <or= 0.02); both upregulated (14/19) and downregulated (5/19) expressions were observed. Eight miRNAs were differentially expressed between MLL and non-MLL precursor B-ALL cases (P<0.05). Most remarkably, miR-708 was 250- up to 6500-fold higher expressed in 57 TEL-AML1, BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, hyperdiploid and B-other cases than in 20 MLL-rearranged and 15 T-ALL cases (0.0001<P<0.01), whereas the expression of miR-196b was 500-fold higher in MLL-rearranged and 800-fold higher in 5 of 15 T-ALL cases as compared with the expression level in the remaining precursor B-ALL cases (P<0.001). The expression did not correlate with the maturation status of leukemia cells based on immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangements, immunophenotype or MLL-fusion partner.

However, diagnostic dilemmas may arise in daily practice due to overlap of BL with subsets of other aggressive, mature B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL). Recently, two gene expression studies have described a distinct molecular profile for BL, but also showed the persistence of some cases intermediate between BL and DLBCL. An alternative approach to define BL is to consider (cyto)genetic data, in particular chromosomal abnormalities other than the t(8;14) or its variants. In this review the 'Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer,' harboring the majority of all published neoplasia-related karyotypes, was explored to define a cytogenetic profile of 'true' BL. This core subset of BL showed a very low complexity of chromosomal abnormalities with 40% of the cases having the IG-MYC fusion as the sole abnormality. In the remaining cases, additional recurrent but partially exclusive abnormalities included gains at chromosomes 1q, 7 and 12, and losses of 6q, 13q32-34 and 17p. Within the core subset, no differences were found between pediatric and adult patients. In addition, the genetic profile of the core subset was significantly different from BL with an 8q24 breakpoint not affecting one of the three immunoglobulin loci, BL with a translocation involving 18q21/BCL2, 3q27/BCL6 or 11q13/BCL1, additionally to a breakpoint at 8q24/MYC, and from other morphological types of lymphomas with an 8q24/MYC breakpoint. These groups showed a higher cytogenetic complexity than the core subset of BL. BL without a detectable 8q24/MYC breakpoint might be heterogeneous and deserves further studies. We suggest that, concordant with the WHO classification to be published in 2008, the diagnosis of BL should be restricted to cases with expression of CD10 and BCL6, absence or very weak expression of BCL2 protein, a homogeneously very high proliferation index and a proven IG-MYC translocation without evidence of a chromosomal translocation typical for other lymphoma entities. In addition, a high number of nonspecific cytogenetic abnormalities should suggest need for a critical review of the diagnosis of BL.","['Boerma, E G', 'Siebert, R', 'Kluin, P M', 'Baudis, M']","['Boerma EG', 'Siebert R', 'Kluin PM', 'Baudis M']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20081016,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cytogenetics/history', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/classification/diagnosis/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/03/03 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008281 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.281 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Feb;23(2):225-34. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.281.

We previously reported powerful pro-apoptotic actions of bezafibrate (BEZ) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) against Burkitts lymphoma cells. Here, we demonstrate that BEZ and MPA individually, and more potently when combined (BEZ+MPA), induce apoptosis of unsorted and CD19(+ve)-selected CLL cells and abrogate the pro-proliferative activity of CD40(L). This action was tumor cell specific, as the drugs had little impact on normal donor cells. The antiproliferative actions of BEZ+MPA were associated with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the proapoptotic actions were associated with the generation of both ROS and mitochondrial superoxide (MSO). BEZ increased prostaglandin D(2) (PGD(2)) synthesis by CLL cells, and treatment with PGD(2) and its antineoplastic derivative 15dDelta(12,14,)PGJ(2) recapitulated BEZ-induced antiproliferative and proapoptotic actions. The PGD(2) receptor antagonist, BW868C, did not block BEZ or PGD(2) activity against CLL cells. The potency of BEZ+MPA against CLL cells mirrored that of chlorambucil, and BEZ+MPA combined with chlorambucil was more potent than either treatment alone. Given the known safety profiles of BEZ and MPA, our data warrant further investigation of their potential as novel therapy for CLL.","['Hayden, R E', 'Pratt, G', 'Davies, N J', 'Khanim, F L', 'Birtwistle, J', 'Delgado, J', 'Pearce, C', 'Sant, T', 'Drayson, M T', 'Bunce, C M']","['Hayden RE', 'Pratt G', 'Davies NJ', 'Khanim FL', 'Birtwistle J', 'Delgado J', 'Pearce C', 'Sant T', 'Drayson MT', 'Bunce CM']","['University of Birmingham, School of Biosciences, Edgbaston, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081016,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'C2QI4IOI2G (Medroxyprogesterone Acetate)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'Y9449Q51XH (Bezafibrate)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bezafibrate/*pharmacology', 'CD40 Ligand/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Medroxyprogesterone Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Prostaglandin D2/agonists/*analogs & derivatives', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction', 'Superoxides', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/03/03 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008283 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.283 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Feb;23(2):292-304. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.283.

In this multicentric study we collected 27 cases of NUP214-ABL1-positive T-ALL. Median age was 15 years with male predominance. Outcome was poor in 12 patients. An associated abnormality involving TLX1 or TLX3 was found in all investigated cases. Fluorescent in situ hybridization revealed a heterogeneous pattern of NUP214-ABL1 amplification. Multiple episomes carrying the fusion were detected in 24 patients. Episomes were observed in a significant number of nuclei in 18 cases, but in only 1-5% of nuclei in 6. In addition, intrachromosomal amplification (small hsr) was identified either as the only change or in association with episomes in four cases and two T-ALL cell lines (PEER and ALL-SIL). One case showed insertion of apparently non-amplified NUP214-ABL1 sequences at 14q12. The amplified sequences were analyzed using array-based CGH.These findings confirm that the NUP214-ABL1 gene requires amplification for oncogenicity; it is part of a multistep process of leukemogenesis; and it can be a late event present only in subpopulations. Data also provide in vivo evidence for a model of episome formation, amplification and optional reintegration into the genome.

Although the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin of MPDs was suggested over 30 years ago, only recently the HSC-specific effects of MPD molecular mutations have been investigated. The pivotal role of BCR-ABL in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) development provided the rationale for targeted therapy, which greatly reduced mortality rates. However, BCR-ABL inhibitor-resistant CML HSCs persist that may be a reservoir for relapse. This has provided the impetus for investigating molecular mechanisms governing the production of recalcitrant HSC. Comparatively little was known about the molecular events driving BCR-ABL-negative MPDs until seminal studies revealed that a large proportion of MPD patients harbor a JAK2-activating point mutation, JAK2V617F. Although JAK2 activation appears to be central to BCR-ABL-negative MPD pathogenesis, its effects may be cell type and context specific. Recent evidence suggests that acquired mutations misdirect differentiation and survival of the MPD-initiating stem cell resulting in the production of aberrant self-renewing progenitors that subvert the microenvironment leading to leukemia stem cell generation and leukemic transformation. Thus, combined therapies targeting aberrant molecular pathways may be required to redirect miscreant MPD stem cells.","['Jamieson, C H M', 'Barroga, C F', 'Vainchenker, W P']","['Jamieson CH', 'Barroga CF', 'Vainchenker WP']","['Department of Medicine, Moores UCSD Cancer Center San Diego Medical Center, University of California, La Jolla, CA 92093-0820, USA. cjamieson@ucsd.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20081016,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008290 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.290 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Nov;22(11):2011-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.290.

We have previously reported that chemokine-induced TEM is defective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and that this defect is a result of failure of the chemokine to induce polar clustering of alphaLbeta2; engagement of alpha4beta1 and autocrine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) restore clustering and TEM. The aim of the present study was to characterize the nature of this defect in alphaLbeta2 activation and determine how it is corrected. We show here that the alphaLbeta2 of CLL cells is already in variably activated conformations, which are not further altered by chemokine treatment. Importantly, such treatment usually does not cause an increase in the GTP-loading of Rap1, a GTPase central to chemokine-induced activation of integrins. Furthermore, we show that this defect in Rap1 GTP-loading is at the level of the GTPase and is corrected in CLL cells cultured in the absence of exogenous stimuli, suggesting that the defect is the result of in vivo stimulation. Finally, we show that, because Rap1-induced activation of both alpha4beta1 and alphaLbeta2 is defective, autocrine VEGF and chemokine are necessary to activate alpha4beta1 for ligand binding. Subsequently, this binding and both VEGF and chemokine stimulation are all needed for alphaLbeta2 activation for motility and TEM. The present study not only clarifies the nature of the alphaLbeta2 defect of CLL cells but is the first to implicate activation of Rap1 in the pathophysiology of CLL.","['Till, Kathleen J', 'Harris, Robert J', 'Linford, Andrea', 'Spiller, David G', 'Zuzel, Mirko', 'Cawley, John C']","['Till KJ', 'Harris RJ', 'Linford A', 'Spiller DG', 'Zuzel M', 'Cawley JC']","['Division of Hematology, School of Cancer Studies, School of Biological Sciences, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. k.j.till@liv.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Shelterin Complex)', '0 (TERF2IP protein, human)', '0 (Telomere-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/pharmacology', 'Chemokines/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*physiology', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Shelterin Complex', 'Telomere-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/physiology']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2008/11/08 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/20/8429 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1758 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 15;68(20):8429-36. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1758.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combined treatment with bortezomib and IFN-alpha induced synergistic apoptosis in melanoma and other solid tumor cell lines. Apoptosis was associated with processing of procaspase-3, procaspase-7, procaspase-8, and procaspase-9 and with cleavage of Bid and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Bortezomib plus IFN-alpha was effective at inducing apoptosis in melanoma cells that overexpressed Bcl-2 or Mcl-1, suggesting that this treatment combination can overcome mitochondrial pathways of cell survival and resistance to apoptosis. The proapoptotic effects of this treatment combination were abrogated by a caspase-8 inhibitor, led to increased association of Fas and FADD before the onset of cell death, and were significantly reduced in cells transfected with a dominant-negative FADD construct or small interfering RNA targeting Fas. These data suggest that bortezomib and IFN-alpha act through the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis via FADD-induced caspase-8 activation to initiate cell death.

We studied the progeny of CD34(+) cells from CML patients before SCT, which were cultured 4 days in serum-free media with hematopoietic growth factors. BCR-ABL expression was similar in both cycling and quiescent noncycling CD34(+) populations. Quiescent CD34(+) cells from CML patients were less susceptible than their cycling CD34(+) and CD34(-) counterparts to lysis by natural killer (NK) cells from their HLA-identical sibling donors. Compared with cycling populations, quiescent CD34(+) CML cells had higher surface expression of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) receptors DR4 and DR5. Bortezomib up-regulated TRAIL receptor expression on quiescent CD34(+) CML cells, and further enhanced their susceptibility to cytotoxicity by in vitro expanded donor NK cells. These results suggest that donor-derived NK cell-mediated GVL effects may be improved by sensitizing residual quiescent CML cells to NK-cell cytotoxicity after SCT. Such treatment, as an adjunct to donor lymphocyte infusions and pharmacologic therapy, may reduce the risk of relapse in CML patients who require treatment by SCT.","['Yong, Agnes S M', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Hensel, Nancy', 'Eniafe, Rhoda', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Berg, Maria', 'Lundqvist, Andreas', 'Adams, Sharon', 'Sloand, Elaine M', 'Goldman, John M', 'Childs, Richard', 'Barrett, A John']","['Yong AS', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Hensel N', 'Eniafe R', 'Savani BN', 'Berg M', 'Lundqvist A', 'Adams S', 'Sloand EM', 'Goldman JM', 'Childs R', 'Barrett AJ']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. yonga@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081015,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (GEM protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monomeric GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Death Domain/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC2630272,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37817-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-158253 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 22;113(4):875-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-158253.

Here, we show that preconditioning with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody before conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI) prevents GVHD but retains GVL in a HCT model of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched C57BL/6 donor to BALB/c host. Prevention of GVHD is associated with inhibition of donor T-cell expression of homing and chemokine receptors, and inhibition of GVHD target tissue expression of chemokines. Furthermore, inhibition of donor T-cell expression of gut homing alpha4beta7 and chemokine receptor (CCR)9 by anti-CD3 preconditioning results from a reduction of CD103(+) DCs in draining mesenteric lymph nodes (LNs), which is associated with down-regulation of DC expression of CCR7, a receptor required for tissue DC migration to draining LNs. These results indicate that anti-CD3 preconditioning reduces not only tissue release of chemokines but also prevents tissue DC migration to draining LNs and subsequently reduces the capacity of DCs of draining LNs to imprint donor T-cell tissue tropism. Therefore, modulation of host DCs by anti-CD3 preconditioning before HCT represents a new approach for separating GVL from GVHD.","['Li, Nainong', 'Chen, Ying', 'He, Wei', 'Yi, Tangsheng', 'Zhao, Dongchang', 'Zhang, Chunyan', 'Lin, Chia-Lei', 'Todorov, Ivan', 'Kandeel, Fouad', 'Forman, Stephen', 'Zeng, Defu']","['Li N', 'Chen Y', 'He W', 'Yi T', 'Zhao D', 'Zhang C', 'Lin CL', 'Todorov I', 'Kandeel F', 'Forman S', 'Zeng D']","['Department of Diabetes and Endocrinology, The Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 AI066008/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081015,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Integrin alpha Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (alpha E integrins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Blood Donors', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Integrin alpha Chains/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology/surgery', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Chemokine/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Up-Regulation', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC2630281,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37827-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-165522 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 22;113(4):953-62. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-165522.

The elderly are disproportionately affected by AML, as 35% of newly diagnosed patients are aged >or=75 and the median age at diagnosis is 67. Elderly individuals also respond less well to standard chemotherapy than do younger individuals, as reflected by lower complete remission and relapse-free survival rates in major clinical trials. A higher prevalence of comorbid conditions as well as the unique biological features of elderly AML patients account for the relatively poor response to therapy observed in this population. Compared with AML in younger individuals, for example, AML in the elderly more often emerges from a preceding myelodysplastic syndrome and is more frequently associated with poor-prognosis karyotypes such as 5q- or 7q-. The introduction of novel therapies over the past decade has already altered the treatment paradigm of elderly individuals with AML. The first of these to emerge was gemtuzumab ozogamicin. Other agents are currently under evaluation in clinical trials, including inhibitors of multidrug resistance, farnesyltransferase inhibitors, novel nucleoside analogues, and inhibitors of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3.

The association has been confirmed by many case-control studies carried out around the world, the appropriately combined results of which show a highly statistically significant increase in risk that is compatible with the OSCC finding. There is no doubt about the reality of the statistical association, but a causal interpretation has been questioned. On balance, however, the evidence points to low-level irradiation of the fetus increasing the risk of leukaemia in childhood, with an excess relative risk coefficient of around 50 Gy(-1) (equivalent to an excess absolute risk coefficient of about 3% Gy(-1)), although the uncertainty associated with these coefficients is considerable and they are likely to be overestimates. In contrast to exposure in utero, the evidence from case-control studies for an association between childhood leukaemia and postnatal exposure to medical diagnostic irradiation is equivocal and sometimes conflicting. Since standard radiation risk models predict that low-level exposure in the early years of life should produce an increased risk of childhood leukaemia that is roughly similar to that arising from fetal exposure, this absence of persuasive evidence is likely to be due to various problems with the studies. This is unfortunate given the rise in relatively high dose diagnostic procedures (e.g. paediatric CT scans) that would be predicted to materially increase the relative risk of childhood leukaemia.","['Wakeford, Richard']",['Wakeford R'],"['The Dalton Nuclear Institute, The University of Manchester, Pariser Building-G Floor, PO Box 88, Sackville Street, Manchester M60 1QD, UK.

Interviews with parents of 1881 leukaemia and lymphoma cases (0-14 years) and 3742 controls collected job histories recording exposure to eight specific agents. Exposure was (1) self-reported and (2) reviewed, based mainly on exposure probability and exposure level. Completeness, consistency and sufficiency evaluated data quality. Of all job exposures which were self-reported as exposed, 33% cases and 34% controls remained classified as exposed after review, with the remainder designated as partially exposed or unexposed. No review of underreporting of exposure was made. Data quality was 'good' for 26% of cases and 24% of controls. For self-reported exposure, significant risks of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were observed for solvents and petrol in all time windows. For reviewed exposure, solvents remained significant for ALL during pregnancy and postnatally. Restricting analyses to good-quality information removed all significant results. Refinement of exposure assessment revealed misclassification of self-reported exposures and data quality influenced risk assessment. Maternal exposure to solvents should further be investigated.

Various ways in which ionizing radiation exposures have been assessed are illustrated through reference to some studies of childhood leukaemia, concerning environmental, medical, natural and parental occupational exposures. Based on this, implications for the interpretation of radiation epidemiological studies are discussed.","['Muirhead, Colin R']",['Muirhead CR'],"['Health Protection Agency, Radiation Protection Division, Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards, Chilton, Didcot, Oxon OX11 0RQ, UK. colinhead@hpa.org.uk']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081015,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['*Artifacts', '*Body Burden', '*Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', '*Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Radiation Injuries/*epidemiology', 'Radiation Monitoring/*methods', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn267 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn267 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):134-8. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn267.

Molecular studies have revealed a prenatal origin of many childhood leukaemias. According to current models, a preleukaemic stem cell clone is generated by a first mutation in utero which, in a minority of children, progresses to leukaemia after receiving further postnatal genetic hits. The nature of pre- and postnatal events involved in leukaemogenesis in children is not well understood. Although genetic predisposition and specific environmental exposures may account for individual cases, the bulk of childhood leukaemia cannot be explained by any of these factors. The higher incidence of the most common leukaemia subtype in affluent societies, as well as the age peak between 2-5 y, suggest a contributory role of socioeconomic factors. An abnormal immune response during delayed exposure to common infections provides a plausible mechanism for malignant progression of preleukaemic clones in a subgroup of children. As highlighted in this review, a common cause for all types and subtypes of childhood leukaemia is highly unlikely. Deeper insights into the pathogenesis of childhood leukaemia will rely on large-scale and combined epidemiological and biomolecular studies.","['Rossig, Claudia', 'Juergens, Heribert']","['Rossig C', 'Juergens H']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Str. 33, D-48149 Muenster, Germany. rossig@uni-muenster.de""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081015,England,Radiat Prot Dosimetry,Radiation protection dosimetry,8109958,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Causality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Outbreaks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/immunology', 'Male', '*Models, Biological', '*Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/05/02 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['ncn269 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn269 [doi]']",ppublish,Radiat Prot Dosimetry. 2008;132(2):114-8. doi: 10.1093/rpd/ncn269.

Examination of the data supports the commonly held view that veterinarians do not embrace heartworm disease testing or prevention in cats to the same degree they do in dogs. Despite significant awareness and adoption of heartworm testing and prevention in dogs, we hypothesized that heartworm testing rates are lower for cats than for dogs despite a significant prevalence of feline infection. This is important because a perceived low rate of infection in cats is likely to manifest in a low adoption of testing and prevention. In reality, the overall feline heartworm antigen-positive rate is significant--on average 0.9% over the period studied--and in some regions was estimated to be as high as 4.6%. This compares with an average canine heartworm prevalence rate of 1.2%, a feline leukemia virus prevalence of 1.9%, and a feline immunodeficiency prevalence of 1.0%. Based on the low rate of testing and these prevalence rates, practitioners are routinely missing cases of adult feline heartworm infections and the recently defined heartworm-associated respiratory disease (H.A.R.D). Increased antigen testing would result in detection of a significant number of positive cases. In addition, this population of infected cats would represent the ""tip of the iceberg"" relative to the greater number of cats that have early infection or are at risk for infection.","['Lorentzen, Leif', 'Caola, Anthony E']","['Lorentzen L', 'Caola AE']","['IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME 04092, USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The THP1 cell line and primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were cultured with triptolide alone or in association with AraC or idarubicin in increasing concentrations. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using DiOC6(3) for the cell line and fluorescein isothiocyanateAnnexin-V and CD45 labeling for fresh blast cells. Protein expression was measured by Western blot. Cell cycle distribution of apoptotic cells was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: A synergistic effect was observed when triptolide was added to idarubicin or to AraC to induce apoptosis of THP-1 leukemic cells. The triptolide/AraC association was also investigated in vitro on primary blast cells from 25 AML patients. This combination induced significantly higher percentages of apoptosis vs treatment with each drug separately (p<0.005). The IkappaB and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein contents, which were altered by triptolide in idarubicin-treated cells, were not modified in AraC-treated cells. The association of AraC with triptolide increased the number of cells blocked in the S phase and most underwent apoptosis. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that, by modifying the cell cycle kinetics, AraC sensitizes AML cells to apoptosis induced by low concentration triptolide. The in vitro proapoptotic effect of triptolide associated with the antiproliferative activity of AraC warrants further clinical investigation for treatment of AML patients, especially elderly patients for whom low-dose AraC treatment could be improved by the addition of triptolide.","['Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Uhalde, Maialene', 'Jeanneteau, Marie', 'Lacombe, Francis', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Belloc, Francis']","['Pigneux A', 'Mahon FX', 'Uhalde M', 'Jeanneteau M', 'Lacombe F', 'Milpied N', 'Reiffers J', 'Belloc F']","[""CHU Bordeaux, Hopital Haut-Leveque, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Pessac, France. arnaud.pigneux@chu-bordeaux.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081014,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Phenanthrenes)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '19ALD1S53J (triptolide)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytarabine/agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Diterpenes/agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epoxy Compounds/agonists/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Idarubicin/agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/metabolism', 'Phenanthrenes/agonists/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00387-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Dec;36(12):1648-59. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.08.002.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of the four compounds on several nuclear, membrane, and mitochondrial events of apoptosis and on expression of proteins controlling the apoptosis were analyzed after treatment of cultured CLL patients' cells. RESULTS: Treatment with all four compounds resulted in a dose-dependent internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, in stimulation of phosphatidylserine externalization, disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and caspase-3 activation. DNA fragmentation was prevented in the presence of the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Two of the compounds downregulated the expression of Mcl-1, a protein thought to be crucial for the antiapoptotic state in CLL, while Bcl-2 expression was unaffected. No effects were observed on the expression of p27kip1 or the inducible nitric oxide synthase, two proteins, which are constitutively overexpressed by CLL cells and downregulated during the apoptosis induced by other plant-derived molecules (flavopiridol, polyphenols, or hyperforin). This suggests different mechanisms of action for the compounds studied here. Furthermore, normal B lymphocytes from healthy donors appeared less sensitive than CLL cells to the proapoptotic activity of the four compounds. CONCLUSION: The four arylcoumarin analogues were able to promote the apoptosis of CLL cells ex vivo through the caspase-dependent mitochondrial pathway. Therefore, these compounds may be of interest to develop new therapies of CLL based on apoptosis restoration.","['Billard, Christian', 'Menasria, Faouzia', 'Quiney, Claire', 'Faussat, Anne-Marie', 'Finet, Jean-Pierre', 'Combes, Sebastien', 'Kolb, Jean-Pierre']","['Billard C', 'Menasria F', 'Quiney C', 'Faussat AM', 'Finet JP', 'Combes S', 'Kolb JP']","['UMRS 872 INSERM, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie-Paris 6, Paris, France. christian.billard@crc.jussieu.fr']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081014,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Bibenzyls)', '0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '7O62J06F18 (combretastatin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bibenzyls/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00354-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Dec;36(12):1625-33. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.008.

This disease has been cytogenetically characterized by a partial deletion of chromosome 2 with G-banding. For the rapid diagnosis of ML, this study reports a FISH method using spleen cells and peripheral blood smears from ML mice exposed to gamma rays and neutrons with PU.1, a candidate ML tumor suppressor, as a probe. RESULTS: Among mice that were tentatively diagnosed with ML by clinical findings and blood smear examination, 85% carried spleen cells showing the loss of PU.1 although the frequency of these abnormal cells varied among individuals. Mice with very low frequencies of cells showing the loss of one copy of PU.1 (one-PU.1 frequency) were later diagnosed pathologically not with ML but with blastic or eosinophilic leukemia. Some neutron-irradiated mice had cells showing translocated PU.1, although no pathological features differentiated these ML mice from ML mice expressing the simple loss of PU.1.The one-PU.1 frequency can be detected from spleen metaphase cells, spleen interphase cells, and blood smears. There was a good correlation between the one-PU.1 frequency in spleen metaphase cells and that in spleen interphase cells (r = 0.96) and between one-PU.1 frequency in spleen interphase cells and that in blood cells (r = 0.83). CONCLUSION: The FISH method was capable of detecting aberration of copy number of the PU.1 gene on murine chromosome 2, and using a peripheral blood smear is more practical and less invasive than conventional pathological diagnosis or the cytogenetic examination of spleen cells.","['Kanda, Reiko', 'Tsuji, Satsuki', 'Ohmachi, Yasushi', 'Ishida, Yuka', 'Ban, Nobuhiko', 'Shimada, Yoshiya']","['Kanda R', 'Tsuji S', 'Ohmachi Y', 'Ishida Y', 'Ban N', 'Shimada Y']","['Research Center for Radiation Protection, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Research Center for Radiation Protection, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Research Center for Radiation Protection, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Fundamental Technology Center, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Environmental Health Science, Oita University of Nursing and Health Sciences, Oita, Japan.', 'Research Center for Radiation Protection, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081016,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC2572613,2008/10/17 09:00,2008/10/17 09:01,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:01 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['1755-8166-1-22 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-1-22 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2008 Oct 16;1:22. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-1-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, mutations within the ABL kinase domain interfering with drug binding have been identified as the main mechanism of resistance to imatinib. Multiple distinct BCR-ABL kinase mutant isoforms conferring varying degrees of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been reported. Nilotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor 30-fold more potent than imatinib against BCR-ABL kinase. Nilotinib is active against a wide range of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutant isoforms, except for T315I. Results from Phase II studies of nilotinib for patients with CML after failure or intolerance to imatinib therapy have shown a favorable toxicity profile and confirmed the high efficacy of nilotinib in this setting. Studies addressing the activity of nilotinib in newly-diagnosed patients with CML are underway. Furthermore, nilotinib is a potent inhibitor of KIT and PDGFR kinases. Here, we review the preclinical development of nilotinib and the activity of this agent in patients with CML and in tumors driven by KIT and/or PDGFR mutant kinases, such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors and some forms of clonal hypereosinophilia.","['Quintas-Cardama, Alfonso', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Quintas-Cardama A', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. aquinta@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Future Oncol,"Future oncology (London, England)",101256629,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/*drug effects']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2008/12/31 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/14796694.4.5.611 [doi]'],ppublish,Future Oncol. 2008 Oct;4(5):611-21. doi: 10.2217/14796694.4.5.611.,,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental studies suggest that ATRA can induce differentiation and apoptosis in leukaemia cells also for other acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) subtypes, but the clinical observations are conflicting. DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-two AML patients with non-APL disease received oral ATRA alone (22.5 mg/m2 twice daily) for two days, the patients thereafter continued ATRA together with valproic acid and theophylline. We investigated the biological effects of the initial 2 days treatment with ATRA alone. Serum/plasma samples were collected before and after 2 days of ATRA, peripheral blood AML cells were collected from all 12 patients with circulating leukaemia cells (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00175812; EudraCT no. 2004-001663-22). RESULTS: AML cells collected during therapy had altered flow cytometric forward and right angle light scatters but no morphological signs of differentiation. ATRA increased the percentage of circulating AML cells in G0/G1 phase for 9 out of 12 patients (p = 0.043). Circulating leukaemia cells derived during therapy had increased intracellular levels of P21 (mean increase in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) being 18.2%, p = 0.017), and decreased levels of Gata-2 (mean decrease in MFI 19%, p = 0.026), NF-kappaB p65 (mean decrease in MFI 15.4%, p = 0.033) and Bcl-2 (mean decrease in MFI 7.2%, p = 0.005). In addition, increased systemic levels of the endothelial marker endocan (plasma) and the angioregulatory mediator angiopoietin-2 (serum) were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo ATRA treatment in AML affects leukaemic cell morphology, regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis, and possibly also microvascular endothelial cell functions.","['Ryningen, Anita', 'Stapnes, Camilla', 'Paulsen, Kristin', 'Lassalle, Philippe', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ryningen A', 'Stapnes C', 'Paulsen K', 'Lassalle P', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bruserud O']","['University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital and Institute of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Bergen.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/13543784.17.11.1623 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2008 Nov;17(11):1623-33. doi: 10.1517/13543784.17.11.1623.,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00175812'],,,,,,

The BIRCS gene is expressed in most human embryonic tissues and malignant tumors but not in normal differentiated tissues of adult human. It was suggested that BIRC5 proteins inhibit apoptosis and play an essential role in tumorigenesis, makings surviving an attractive target for anticancer therapy. The mechanisms regulating level of survivin are not completely understood. It was supposed that natural inhibitors of survivin, namely SMAC and PML, play an important role in these processes. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting we analyzed the transcription level of BIRC5, SMAC and PML genes and content of corresponding proteins in normal and tumor human tissues in non-small cell lung cancer and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. It was demonstrated that BIRC5 is transcribed only in tumor tissues, whereas expression levels of SMAC and PML are the same in normal and tumor tissues. The contents of proteins correspond to levels of mRNA of the respective genes. Thus the increase of level of survivin in tumor tissues is not the result of decrease in content of its inhibitors SMAC and PML, as their content in tumor and normal cells is the same.","['Vaishlia, N A', ""Zinov'eva, M V"", 'Sass, A V', 'Kopantsev, E P', 'Vinogradova, T V', 'Sverdlov, E D']","['Vaishlia NA', ""Zinov'eva MV"", 'Sass AV', 'Kopantsev EP', 'Vinogradova TV', 'Sverdlov ED']",,['rus'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Russia (Federation),Mol Biol (Mosk),Molekuliarnaia biologiia,0105454,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Squamous Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Survivin', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",,2008/10/17 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/10/17 09:00'],"['2008/10/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol (Mosk). 2008 Jul-Aug;42(4):652-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Using a case-matched comparison design, childhood cancer survivors participating in a 12-month open-label MPH trial (n = 51) were compared with childhood cancer survivors not taking MPH (n = 51). Measures of body mass index (BMI), height, and weight were obtained at hospital visits and corrected for gender and age using Centers for Disease Control normative data. RESULTS: Significant deceleration of BMI and weight, but not height, was observed during the 12-month MPH trial for those children taking MPH. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors taking MPH experience significant, though modest, deceleration of BMI and weight across the first year of MPH intervention. The absence of height deceleration, and the presence of only modest BMI and weight deceleration, suggests that MPH is reasonably well tolerated by childhood cancer survivors with respect to growth. Such findings are encouraging in light of increasing evidence that MPH mitigates some of the cognitive late-effects of cancer treatments. Nevertheless, on a case-by-case basis, clinicians should balance the intended benefits of MPH with potential growth effects in this vulnerable population.","['Jasper, Bruce W', 'Conklin, Heather M', 'Lawford, Joanne', 'Morris, E Brannon', 'Howard, Scott C', 'Wu, Shengjie', 'Xiong, Xiaoping', 'Shelso, John', 'Khan, Raja B']","['Jasper BW', 'Conklin HM', 'Lawford J', 'Morris EB', 'Howard SC', 'Wu S', 'Xiong X', 'Shelso J', 'Khan RB']","[""Division of Behavioral Medicine, University of Tennessee, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA078957-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-29S3/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA081445-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA078957/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA81445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['207ZZ9QZ49 (Methylphenidate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Height', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Growth/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Methylphenidate/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/physiopathology', '*Survivors']",PMC2585147,2008/10/16 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/10/16 09:00'],"['2008/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21770 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jan;52(1):39-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21770.,,,,['NIHMS75304'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in expression or activity of transcription factors result in diverse and manifold effects on the whole transcriptome of the cell. Therefore transcription factors are of special interest in physiological as well as pathological processes particularly tumour development and progression. In this review we focus on Ets-1, the prototype of the ETS family of transcription factors. ETS family members play important roles in development, differentiation and proliferation of cells in general and they are involved in apoptosis and tissue remodelling as well. Most of them are downstream nuclear targets of Ras-MAP kinase signalling and the deregulation of ets genes results in malignant transformation of different cells. Several ets genes are rearranged in human leukaemia, Ewing tumours and prostate cancer to produce chimeric oncoproteins. Furthermore, an aberrant expression of several ets genes is often observed in various types of human malignant tumours. With regard to the involvement of some ETS transcription factors, especially Ets-1, in malignant transformation and tumour progression (including invasion, metastasis and neoangiogenesis) through transactivation of cancer related genes, they are potential molecular targets for selective cancer therapy. In this review we focus on the roles of Ets-1 for tumour development and progression with special emphasis on tumour vascularization and invasion. We then discuss specific strategies for Ets-1 inhibition as a potential tool for cancer treatment.","['Hahne, Jens Claus', 'Okuducu, Ali Fuat', 'Sahin, Aygun', 'Fafeur, Veronique', 'Kiriakidis, Serafim', 'Wernert, Nicolas']","['Hahne JC', 'Okuducu AF', 'Sahin A', 'Fafeur V', 'Kiriakidis S', 'Wernert N']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Bonn, P.O.

These factors can emanate from diverse sources including cancer cells, stromal cells, blood and extracellular matrix. Their relative contribution is likely to change with tumor type and tumor site. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is now well confirmed as the primary and the most potent inducer of angiogenesis. To activate cellular signaling pathways, VEGF binds to receptor kinases VEGF-R1, R2 and R3. It then promotes several events required for the formation of new blood vessels, such as endothelial cell survival, proliferation, migration and vascular permeability. Activation of endothelial cells, leads to the secretion of enzymes which degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and hence promote metastasis. Similarly it promotes survival by inducing Bcl-2 expression on VEGF receptor positive leukemia. Besides being a potent mitogen for macrovascular cells derived from arteries, veins and lymphatics, it is also highly involved in a number of angiogenic related disorders including inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, retinopathies and age related macular degeneration. Neovascularization and increased vessel permeability are being recognized as major causes of VEGF related pathogenesis. Therefore, inhibition of VEGF pathway is a strategy being widely pursued to provide new therapeutics for the treatment of VEGF related disorders. Over twenty compounds with anti-angiogenic properties ranging from VEGF neutralizing antibody, soluble receptors, receptor antagonists or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are either approved or are currently under clinical (phase I - III) study.

Nevertheless, 2-Chloroadenosine has been shown to be capable of inducing apoptosis in several cell lines by acting either via adenosine receptors or via uptake that is followed by metabolic transformations leading to nucleotide analogues, i.e. antimetabolites effective in the treatment of a variety of malignancies. Triphosphate nucleoside analogues show specificity for cell in S-phase, inhibit DNA synthesis and kill the cells by mechanisms still largely unknown. 2-Chloroadenosine, at low micromolar concentration, acts as a metabolic precursor of an S-phase specific nucleoside analogue in human prostate cancer PC3 cells and inhibits DNA synthesis thereby leading to accumulation of cells in the S-phase. However, although responsible for the acquisition of resistance, the adenosine derivative is capable of sensitising the cells to the action of other antineoplastic agents and the ability of nucleoside analogues to trigger cell cycle arrest can be exploited to maximize cytotoxicity in combination with cell cycle checkpoint disregulators. 2-Chloroadenosine, in combination with Docetaxel, known to improve the survival of hormone-refractory prostate cancer patients, further decreases in vitro PC3 cell proliferation and invasiveness. Moreover, 2-Chloroadenosine is capable of modulating PAR-1 and IL-23 gene expression suggesting a modulation of cancer metastasis and immune system activity.

To address this question, we generated a loss-of-function allele (Mll5(tm1Apa)) in the murine Mll5 locus. Unlike other Mll genes, Mll5(tm1Apa) homozygous mice are viable but display defects in immunity and hematopoiesis. First, Mll5(tm1Apa) homozygous mice show increased susceptibility to spontaneous eye infections, associated with a cell-autonomous impairment of neutrophil function. Second, Mll5(tm1Apa/tm1Apa) mice exhibit a mild impairment of erythropoiesis. Third, Mll5(tm1Apa/tm1Apa) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have impaired competitive repopulating capacity both under normal conditions and when subjected to self-renewal stimulation by NUP98-HOXA10. Fourth, Mll5(tm1Apa) homozygous HSCs show a dramatic sensitivity to DNA demethylation-induced differentiation (5-azadeoxycytidine). Taken together, our data show that MLL5 is involved in terminal myeloid differentiation and the regulation of HSC self-renewal by a mechanism that involves DNA methylation. These data warrant investigation of MLL5 expression levels as a predictive marker of demethylating-agent response in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemias and identify MLL5 as a key regulator of normal hematopoiesis.","['Heuser, Michael', 'Yap, Damian B', 'Leung, Malina', 'de Algara, Teresa Ruiz', 'Tafech, Alaeddin', 'McKinney, Steven', 'Dixon, John', 'Thresher, Rosemary', 'Colledge, Bill', 'Carlton, Mark', 'Humphries, R Keith', 'Aparicio, Samuel A']","['Heuser M', 'Yap DB', 'Leung M', 'de Algara TR', 'Tafech A', 'McKinney S', 'Dixon J', 'Thresher R', 'Colledge B', 'Carlton M', 'Humphries RK', 'Aparicio SA']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081014,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL5 protein, mouse)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Infections/genetics/immunology', 'Blepharitis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'DNA Methylation/*physiology', 'Decitabine', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*immunology']",,2008/10/16 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2008/10/16 09:00'],"['2008/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37711-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-162263 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Feb 12;113(7):1432-43. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-162263.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We treated 62 patients with refractory (n = 18) or relapsed (n = 44) CD33(+) AML. Median age was 55.5 years. Salvage regimen consisted of GO 9 mg/m(2) on day 4, cytarabine 1 g/m(2) every 12 hours on days 1 through 5, and mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2)/d on days 1 through 3. Median follow-up time was 26.5 months. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (50%) achieved complete remission (CR), and eight patients (13%) had CR with delayed platelet recovery (CRp); the overall response (OR; CR + CRp) rate was 63%. A significantly higher OR rate was achieved in patients who had relapsed versus refractory AML (73% v 39%, respectively; P = .007) and patients with CD33 expression more than 98% of the blast population versus less than 98% (79% v 52.3%, respectively; P = .03). The overall, event-free, and disease-free survival rates were 41%, 33%, and 53% at 2 years, respectively. Leukocytosis more than 20,000/microL at MIDAM therapy, high-risk cytogenetics, and absence of postremission therapy were adverse prognostic factors. Age, disease status, and/or CD33 expression did not influence survival parameters. Four early toxic deaths occurred; a grade 3 to 4 hyperbilirubinemia rate of 16% was observed, and two patients had veno-occlusive disease (3%). CONCLUSION: The MIDAM regimen seems to be an effective salvage regimen for refractory/relapsed CD33(+) AML patients. These encouraging results support the need for a randomized phase III trial before considering this combination of GO and chemotherapy as superior or the standard of care treatment for refractory/relapsed CD33(+) AML patients.","['Chevallier, Patrice', 'Delaunay, Jacques', 'Turlure, Pascal', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Hunault, Mathilde', 'Garand, Richard', 'Guillaume, Thierry', 'Avet-Loiseau, Herve', 'Dmytruk, Nathalia', 'Girault, Stephane', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Ifrah, Norbert', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc']","['Chevallier P', 'Delaunay J', 'Turlure P', 'Pigneux A', 'Hunault M', 'Garand R', 'Guillaume T', 'Avet-Loiseau H', 'Dmytruk N', 'Girault S', 'Milpied N', 'Ifrah N', 'Mohty M', 'Harousseau JL']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Hotel-Dieu, Nantes, France. patrice.chevallier@chu-nantes.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20081014,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/10/16 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/16 09:00'],"['2008/10/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.9764 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.9764 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 10;26(32):5192-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.9764.

The outcome in such patients is a reflection of an aggressive systemic and CNS-directed therapy. However, CNS toxicity represents the dose-limiting side effect of treatment. With effective CNS prophylaxis including intrathecal chemotherapy, high-dose systemic administration of certain agents and cranial irradiation, most adults with ALL without CNS disease at diagnosis may remain free of CNS leukemia.

We analyzed the chromatin organization at intron 5 of the RUNX1 gene where all the sequenced breakpoints involved in t(8;21) have been mapped. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays we show that chromatin organization at intron 5 of the RUNX1 gene is different in HL-60 and HeLa cells. Two distinct features mark the intron 5 in cells expressing RUNX1: a complete lack or significantly reduced levels of Histone H1 and enrichment of hyperacetylated histone H3. Strikingly, induction of DNA damage resulted in formation of t(8;21) in HL-60 but not in HeLa cells.

Overexpression of MBP-1 induces cell death in a number of cancer cells and regresses tumor growth. However, the function of endogenous MBP-1 in normal cell growth regulation remains unknown. To unravel the role of endogenous MBP-1, we knocked down MBP-1 expression in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) by RNA interference. Knockdown of MBP-1 in HFF (HFF-MBPsi-4) resulted in an induction of premature senescence, displayed flattened cell morphology, and increased senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity. FACS analysis of HFF-MBPsi-4 revealed accumulation of a high number of cells in the G1-phase. A significant upregulation of cyclin D1 and reduction of cyclin A was detected in HFF-MBPsi-4 as compared to control HFF. Senescent fibroblasts exhibited enhanced expression of phosphorylated and acetylated p53, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21. Further analysis suggested that promyolocytic leukemia protein (PML) bodies are dramatically increased in HFF-MBPsi-4. Together, these results demonstrated that knockdown of endogenous MBP-1 is involved in cellular senescence of HFF through p53-p21 pathway.","['Ghosh, Asish K', 'Kanda, Tatsuo', 'Steele, Robert', 'Ray, Ratna B']","['Ghosh AK', 'Kanda T', 'Steele R', 'Ray RB']","['Department of Pathology, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.']",['eng'],['CA52977/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081013,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DENND4A protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Foreskin/cytology', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Male', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",PMC2557062,2008/10/15 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/10/15 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003384 [doi]'],ppublish,PLoS One. 2008;3(10):e3384. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0003384.

We investigated the in vitro and in vivoantileukemic efficacy of combined treatment with non-toxic doses of a low-calcemic 1,25D(3) analogue, 1,25-dihydroxy-21(3-hydroxy-3-methyl-butyl)-19-nor-cholecalciferol (19-nor-Gemini; Ro27-5646), and rosemary plant agents in a mouse model of AML. METHODS: Proliferation and differentiation of WEHI-3B D- (WEHI) murine myelomonocytic leukemia cellsin vitro were determined by standard assays. Reactive oxygen species, glutathione and protein expression levels were measured by flow cytometry, enzymatic assay and Western blotting, respectively. Systemic AML was developed by intravenous injection of WEHI cells in syngeneic Balb/c mice. RESULTS: 19-nor-Gemini had a higher potency than its parent compounds, Gemini (Ro27-2310) and 1,25D(3), in the induction of differentiation (EC(50) = 0.059 +/- 0.011, 0.275 +/- 0.093 and 0.652 +/- 0.085 nM, respectively) and growth arrest (IC(50) = 0.072 +/- 0.018, 0.165 +/- 0.061 and 0.895 +/- 0.144 nM, respectively) in WEHI cells in vitro, and lower in vivo toxicity. Combined treatment of leukemia-bearing mice with 19-nor-Gemini (injected intraperitoneally) and standardized rosemary extract (mixed with food) resulted in a synergistic increase in survival (from 42.2 +/- 2.5 days in untreated mice to 66.5 +/- 4.2 days, n = 3) and normalization of white blood cell and differential counts. This was consistent with strong cooperative antiproliferative and differentiation effects of low concentrations of 19-nor-Gemini or 1,25D(3) combined with rosemary extract or its major polyphenolic component, carnosic acid, as well as with the antioxidant action of rosemary agents and vitamin D derivatives in WEHI cell cultures. CONCLUSION: Combined effectiveness of 1,25D(3) analogues and rosemary agents against mouse AML warrants further exploration of this therapeutic approach in translational models of human leukemia.","['Shabtay, Ayelet', 'Sharabani, Hagar', 'Barvish, Zeev', 'Kafka, Michael', 'Amichay, Doron', 'Levy, Joseph', 'Sharoni, Yoav', 'Uskokovic, Milan R', 'Studzinski, George P', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Shabtay A', 'Sharabani H', 'Barvish Z', 'Kafka M', 'Amichay D', 'Levy J', 'Sharoni Y', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Studzinski GP', 'Danilenko M']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA117942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA 44722-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA117942-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA117942-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081014,Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (1,25-dihydroxy-16,23-diene vitamin D3)', '0 (1,25-dihydroxy-21-(3-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)vitamin D(3))', '0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['Abietanes/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cholecalciferol/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plant Extracts/*therapeutic use', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Rosmarinus/chemistry', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2826875,2008/10/15 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/15 09:00'],"['2008/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['000163849 [pii]', '10.1159/000163849 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2008;75(3-4):203-14. doi: 10.1159/000163849.

To systematically understand signaling components that determine the survival of CTL in T-LGL leukemia, we constructed a T-LGL survival signaling network by integrating the signaling pathways involved in normal CTL activation and the known deregulations of survival signaling in leukemic T-LGL. This network was subsequently translated into a predictive, discrete, dynamic model. Our model suggests that the persistence of IL-15 and PDGF is sufficient to reproduce all known deregulations in leukemic T-LGL. This finding leads to the following predictions: (i) Inhibiting PDGF signaling induces apoptosis in leukemic T-LGL. (ii) Sphingosine kinase 1 and NFkappaB are essential for the long-term survival of CTL in T-LGL leukemia. (iii) NFkappaB functions downstream of PI3K and prevents apoptosis through maintaining the expression of myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1. (iv) T box expressed in T cells (T-bet) should be constitutively activated concurrently with NFkappaB activation to reproduce the leukemic T-LGL phenotype. We validated these predictions experimentally. Our study provides a model describing the signaling network involved in maintaining the long-term survival of competent CTL in humans. The model will be useful in identifying potential therapeutic targets for T-LGL leukemia and generating long-term competent CTL necessary for tumor and cancer vaccine development.","['Zhang, Ranran', 'Shah, Mithun Vinod', 'Yang, Jun', 'Nyland, Susan B', 'Liu, Xin', 'Yun, Jong K', 'Albert, Reka', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr']","['Zhang R', 'Shah MV', 'Yang J', 'Nyland SB', 'Liu X', 'Yun JK', 'Albert R', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute and Department of Pharmacology, The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA098472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 94872/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20081013,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (SPHKAP protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2571012,2008/10/15 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/15 09:00'],"['2008/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['0806447105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0806447105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Oct 21;105(42):16308-13. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0806447105.

Preexposure (24 h) of U937, HL-60, Jurkat, or K562 cells to LAQ-824 (40 nmol/L) followed by fludarabine (0.4 micromol/L) dramatically potentiated apoptosis (>or=75%). LAQ-824 triggered an early ROS peak (30 min-3 h), which declined by 6 h, following LAQ-824-induced manganese superoxide dismutase 2 (Mn-SOD2) upregulation. LAQ-824/fludarabine lethality was significantly diminished by either ROS scavengers N-acetylcysteine or manganese (III) tetrakis (4-benzoic acid) porphyrin or ectopic Mn-SOD2 expression and conversely increased by Mn-SOD2 antisense knockdown. During this interval, LAQ-824 induced early (4-8 h) increases in gamma-H2AX, which persisted (48 h) secondary to LAQ-824-mediated inhibition of DNA repair (e.g., down-regulation of Ku86 and Rad50, increased Ku70 acetylation, diminished Ku70 and Ku86 DNA-binding activity, and down-regulated DNA repair genes BRCA1, CHEK1, and RAD51). Addition of fludarabine further potentiated DNA damage, which was incompatible with cell survival, and triggered multiple proapoptotic signals including activation of nuclear caspase-2 and release of histone H1.2 into the cytoplasm. The latter event induced activation of Bak and culminated in pronounced mitochondrial injury and apoptosis. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for understanding the role of early HDACI-induced ROS generation and modulation of DNA repair processes in potentiation of nucleoside analogue-mediated DNA damage and lethality in leukemia. Moreover, they show for the first time the link between HDACI-mediated ROS generation and the recently reported DNA damage observed in cells exposed to these agents.","['Rosato, Roberto R', 'Almenara, Jorge A', 'Maggio, Sonia C', 'Coe, Stefanie', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Rosato RR', 'Almenara JA', 'Maggio SC', 'Coe S', 'Atadja P', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA093738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100866/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063753-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (LAQ824)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (superoxide dismutase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 2/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/metabolism']",PMC2586957,2008/10/15 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/10/15 09:00'],"['2008/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/10/3285 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0385 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Oct;7(10):3285-97. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0385.,,,,['NIHMS73717'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown that this compound has low nanomolar cell-killing activity in a variety of lymphoma and leukemia cell lines, many of which overexpress Bcl-2 through a variety of mechanisms. Rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic that inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin complex, leading to cell cycle arrest and inhibition of protein translation. Rapamycin (and its analogues) has shown activity in a variety of tumor cell lines primarily through induction of cell cycle arrest. Activity has also been shown clinically in mantle cell lymphoma and advanced renal cell carcinoma. Here, we show that treatment of the follicular lymphoma lines DoHH-2 and SuDHL-4 with 100 nmol/L rapamycin induces substantial G(0)-G(1) arrest. Addition of as little as 39 nmol/L ABT-263 to the rapamycin regimen induced a 3-fold increase in sub-G(0) cells. Combination of these agents also led to a significant increase in Annexin V staining over ABT-263 alone. In xenograft models of these tumors, rapamycin induced a largely cytostatic response in the DoHH-2 and SuDHL-4 models. Coadministration with ABT-263 induced significant tumor regression, with DoHH-2 and SuDHL-4 tumors showing 100% overall response rates. Apoptosis in these tumors was significantly enhanced by combination therapy as measured by staining with an antibody specific for cleaved caspase-3. These data suggest that combination of ABT-263 and rapamycin or its analogues represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lymphoma.","['Ackler, Scott', 'Xiao, Yu', 'Mitten, Michael J', 'Foster, Kelly', 'Oleksijew, Anatol', 'Refici, Marion', 'Schlessinger, Sally', 'Wang, Baole', 'Chemburkar, Sanjay R', 'Bauch, Joy', 'Tse, Christin', 'Frost, David J', 'Fesik, Stephen W', 'Rosenberg, Saul H', 'Elmore, Steven W', 'Shoemaker, Alex R']","['Ackler S', 'Xiao Y', 'Mitten MJ', 'Foster K', 'Oleksijew A', 'Refici M', 'Schlessinger S', 'Wang B', 'Chemburkar SR', 'Bauch J', 'Tse C', 'Frost DJ', 'Fesik SW', 'Rosenberg SH', 'Elmore SW', 'Shoemaker AR']","['Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Building AP3/105, 100 Abbott Park Road, Abbott Park, IL 60064-6074, USA. scott.ackler@abbott.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Remission Induction', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2008/10/15 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/10/15 09:00'],"['2008/10/15 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/10/3265 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0268 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Oct;7(10):3265-74. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-08-0268.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although imatinib mesylate has considerable efficacy against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), advanced-stage CML patients frequently become refractory to this agent. The bone marrow is the predominant microenvironment of CML and is a rich source of both soluble factors and extracellular matrices, which may influence drug response. To address the influence of the bone marrow microenvironment on imatinib mesylate sensitivity, we used an in vitro bone marrow stroma model. Our data show culturing K562 cells, in bone marrow stroma-derived conditioned medium (CM), is sufficient to cause resistance to BCR-ABL inhibitors. Drug resistance correlated with increased pTyrStat3, whereas no increases in pTyrStat5 was noted. Moreover, resistance was associated with increased levels of the Stat3 target genes Bcl-xl, Mcl-1, and survivin. Finally, reducing Stat3 levels with small interfering RNA sensitized K562 cells cultured in CM to imatinib mesylate-induced cell death. Importantly, Stat3 dependency was specific for cells grown in CM, as reducing Stat3 levels in regular growth conditions had no effect on imatinib mesylate sensitivity. Together, these data support a novel mechanism of BCR-ABL-independent imatinib mesylate resistance and provides preclinical rationale for using Stat3-inhibitors to increase the efficacy of imatinib mesylate within the context of the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Bewry, Nadine N', 'Nair, Rajesh R', 'Emmons, Michael F', 'Boulware, David', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier', 'Hazlehurst, Lori A']","['Bewry NN', 'Nair RR', 'Emmons MF', 'Boulware D', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J', 'Hazlehurst LA']","['Molecular Oncology Program, H.

In the present study, AF1q was found to be down-regulated in a doxorubicin-resistant subline of human squamous carcinoma A431 cells. Knockdown of AF1q decreased the apoptosis induced by doxorubicin, Taxol, gamma-radiation, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma in A431 cells. On the other hand, overexpression of AF1q increased the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in A431 cells as well as in HepG2 and HL60 cells. Both exogenous and ectopic expression of AF1q in A431 cells increased the mRNA and protein levels of BAD, a proapoptotic BCL-2 family protein. Gene silencing of BAD by small interfering RNA suppressed the AF1q enhancement of apoptosis, suggesting that BAD is downstream of AF1q in regulation of apoptosis. Furthermore, AF1q enhanced the mitochondrial membrane depolarization, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 on doxorubicin treatment. Collectively, AF1q increases doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in cells through activation of BAD-mediated apoptotic pathway.

To improve understanding of the mechanisms of action and resistance to 2ME2, we selected leukemia cells, CCRF-CEM, that display increasing resistance to 2ME2, and three of the highly resistant sublines were chosen for detailed analysis. The 2ME2 cells selected in 7.2 to 28.8 micromol/L were found to be 47- to 107-fold resistant to 2ME2 and exhibited low levels of cross-resistance to vinblastine. Two of the lowest 2ME2-resistant sublines were significantly hypersensitive to colchicine and epothilone B, but the hypersensitive effects were lost in the highest 2ME2-resistant subline. Moreover, 2ME2-resistant cells require 10-fold higher concentrations of 2ME2 to induce G(2)-M cell cycle arrest and have higher amounts of tubulin polymer compared with parental cells. Gene and protein sequencing revealed four class I beta-tubulin mutations, S25N, D197N, A248T, and K350N, in the 2ME2-resistant cells. The S25N mutation is within the paclitaxel-binding site, whereas A248T and K350N are within the colchicine-binding site on beta-tubulin, yet the resistant cells were not cross-resistant to paclitaxel or colchicine. This strongly suggests that the mutations have induced conformational changes to the binding site that resulted in 2ME2 resistance. The 2ME2-resistant leukemia cells provide novel insights into microtubule stability and drug-target interactions.","['Liaw, Tracy Y E', 'Salam, Noeris K', 'McKay, Matthew J', 'Cunningham, Anne M', 'Hibbs, David E', 'Kavallaris, Maria']","['Liaw TY', 'Salam NK', 'McKay MJ', 'Cunningham AM', 'Hibbs DE', 'Kavallaris M']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, P.O.

Coupling transferrin to an anti-neoplastic drug has the potential to overcome multidrug resistance (MDR).

The intracellular accumulation of DOX and DOX-TRF was monitored by direct fluorescence. More DOX-TRF than free DOX was delivered to the tumour cells, and consecutively the levels of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis increased even in the multidrug-resistant cell line. In the normal tissue cell line, DOX-TRF did not accumulate, and therefore, the levels of DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis did not increase. Cell viability was determined using the MTT assay. The IC(50) for DOX-TRF was lower than the IC(50) value for the free drug in both leukaemia cell lines. The IC(50) values for the HL60 cells were 0.08 microM for DOX and 0.02 microM for DOX-TRF. The IC(50) values for HL60ADR cells were 7 microM for DOX and 0.035 microM for DOX-TRF.

Case report and review of the literature.,354-7,10.1007/s11239-008-0281-3 [doi],"Several disturbances of the coagulation system are associated with malignancies of the hematopoietic system. The primary mechanisms of these are disseminated intravascular coagulation and hyperviscosity. As such, bleeding or thrombotic events are often encountered and, occasionally, they may even be the inaugural symptom of leukaemia. The lack of a diagnostic tool that would enable a rapid diagnosis of a hematopoietic malignancy, which may present initially as, for example, a coagulation disorder (arterial or venous thrombotic event and/or haemorrhage), can have dramatic consequences.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been demonstrated to take part in the differentiation and apoptosis of malignant hematological cells induced by commonly used medicines, such as all-transretinoic acid (ATRA), interferon, arsenic sulfide, etc. However, there are almost no data on the role PP2A plays in ATO-induced APL cell differentiation/apoptosis. In this report, our goal was to show that ATO inhibited the proliferation and induced the apoptosis and differentiation of neuroblastoma NB4 cells. Okadaic acid (OKA), a specific inhibitor of protein phosphatase activity, markedly increased these effects of ATO on cells. To further elucidate the regulation of PP2A during ATO-induced differentiation/apoptosis of NB4 cells, we measured the phosphatase activity and protein expression of PP2A. The activity of PP2A in NB4 cells decreased with increasing concentration of ATO. This decrease of PP2A activity appeared to parallel phenotypic and functional changes of NB4 cells. Western blot analysis showed that the levels of the PP2A structural subunit PP2A-A decreased during the course of ATO-induced differentiation/apoptosis, whereas the expression of the B and C subunits of PP2A was relatively unaltered. In conclusion, the decrease of PP2A activity may be involved in ATO-induced apoptosis and differentiation of APL cells, and this decrease is predicted to be related to the repression of PP2A-A subunit expression.","['Ouyang, Jian', 'Xu, Xi-hui', 'Chen, Jun-hao', 'Xie, Pin-hao', 'Xia, Yong-quan']","['Ouyang J', 'Xu XH', 'Chen JH', 'Xie PH', 'Xia YQ']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China. oy626@sina.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Spain,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol,Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology,7909595,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/*metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles']",,2008/10/14 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['1186086 [pii]', '10.1358/mf.2008.30.6.1186086 [doi]']",ppublish,Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Jul-Aug;30(6):411-9. doi: 10.1358/mf.2008.30.6.1186086.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Prous Science, S.A.U. or its licensors.

This process involves extensive vascular remodeling and coordinated division of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT). We demonstrate that the homeodomain transcription factor Pbx1 orchestrates separate transcriptional pathways to control great-artery patterning and cardiac OFT septation in mice. Pbx1-null embryos display anomalous great arteries owing to a failure to establish the initial complement of branchial arch arteries in the caudal pharyngeal region. Pbx1 deficiency also results in the failure of cardiac OFT septation. Pbx1-null embryos lose a transient burst of Pax3 expression in premigratory cardiac neural crest cells (NCCs) that ultimately specifies cardiac NCC function for OFT development, but does not regulate NCC migration to the heart. We show that Pbx1 directly activates Pax3, leading to repression of its target gene Msx2 in NCCs. Compound Msx2/Pbx1-null embryos display significant rescue of cardiac septation, demonstrating that disruption of this Pbx1-Pax3-Msx2 regulatory pathway partially underlies the OFT defects in Pbx1-null mice. Conversely, the great-artery anomalies of compound Msx2/Pbx1-null embryos remain within the same spectrum as those of Pbx1-null embryos. Thus, Pbx1 makes a crucial contribution to distinct regulatory pathways in cardiovascular development.","['Chang, Ching-Pin', 'Stankunas, Kryn', 'Shang, Ching', 'Kao, Shih-Chu', 'Twu, Karen Y', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Chang CP', 'Stankunas K', 'Shang C', 'Kao SC', 'Twu KY', 'Cleary ML']","['Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. chingpin@stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 HL085345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL085345/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL085345-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MSX2 protein)', '0 (PAX3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '138016-91-8 (Pax3 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arteries/cytology/*embryology/metabolism', 'Body Patterning/*genetics', 'Branchial Region/blood supply/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Heart/*anatomy & histology/*embryology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Myocardium/cytology/metabolism', 'Neural Crest/cytology/metabolism', 'PAX3 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",PMC2680673,2008/10/14 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['135/21/3577 [pii]', '10.1242/dev.022350 [doi]']",ppublish,Development. 2008 Nov;135(21):3577-86. doi: 10.1242/dev.022350.,,,,['NIHMS88429'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to gain further insight into the role of miRNAs in AML, we have applied the Illumina massively parallel sequencing platform to carry out an in-depth analysis of the miRNA transcriptome in a murine leukemia progression model. This model simulates the stepwise conversion of a myeloid progenitor cell by an engineered overexpression of the nucleoporin 98 (NUP98)-homeobox HOXD13 fusion gene (ND13), to aggressive AML inducing cells upon transduction with the oncogenic collaborator Meis1. From this data set, we identified 307 miRNA/miRNA species in the ND13 cells and 306 miRNA/miRNA species in ND13+Meis1 cells, corresponding to 223 and 219 miRNA genes. Sequence counts varied between two and 136,558, indicating a remarkable expression range between the detected miRNA species. The large number of miRNAs expressed and the nature of differential expression suggest that leukemic progression as modeled here is dictated by the repertoire of shared, but differentially expressed miRNAs. Our finding of extensive sequence variations (isomiRs) for almost all miRNA and miRNA species adds additional complexity to the miRNA transcriptome. A stringent target prediction analysis coupled with in vitro target validation revealed the potential for miRNA-mediated release of oncogenes that facilitates leukemic progression from the preleukemic to leukemia inducing state. Finally, 55 novel miRNAs species were identified in our data set, adding further complexity to the emerging world of small RNAs.","['Kuchenbauer, Florian', 'Morin, Ryan D', 'Argiropoulos, Bob', 'Petriv, Oleh I', 'Griffith, Malachi', 'Heuser, Michael', 'Yung, Eric', 'Piper, Jessica', 'Delaney, Allen', 'Prabhu, Anna-Liisa', 'Zhao, Yongjun', 'McDonald, Helen', 'Zeng, Thomas', 'Hirst, Martin', 'Hansen, Carl L', 'Marra, Marco A', 'Humphries, R Keith']","['Kuchenbauer F', 'Morin RD', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Petriv OI', 'Griffith M', 'Heuser M', 'Yung E', 'Piper J', 'Delaney A', 'Prabhu AL', 'Zhao Y', 'McDonald H', 'Zeng T', 'Hirst M', 'Hansen CL', 'Marra MA', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081010,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxd13 protein, mouse)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (nuclear pore complex protein 98)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Variation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",PMC2577858,2008/10/14 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['gr.077578.108 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.077578.108 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2008 Nov;18(11):1787-97. doi: 10.1101/gr.077578.108.

Endocrine-disrupting agents (e.g. dioxins) might be involved. Dioxins, via the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), induce estrogen-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. Elevated expression of gamma-SYNUCLEIN (gamma-SYN) has been associated with hormone-related conditions. Tissue sets consisting of eutopic and ectopic (ovarian) endometrium from patients with stage 3 or 4 endometriosis were obtained. Following RNA extraction and reverse transcription, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed for anti-apoptotic B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), CYP1A1, CYP1B1, estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, ER beta and gamma-SYN. Immunohistochemical analyses for gamma-syn, ER alpha, ER beta and CYP1A1 were also conducted. A 3-9-fold increase in intra-individual expression of CYP1A1 in ectopic (ovarian) endometrium compared with eutopic tissue was observed; immunohistochemical analyses pointed to CYP1A1 being localized to the glandular epithelium. This intra-individual expression profile was not observed for CYP1B1 or BCL-2. However, a 5-53-fold intra-individual increase in gamma-SYN expression was also demonstrated in six of nine tissue sets (a further two showed an increase that was not considered significant) when comparing ectopic to eutopic endometrium; gamma-syn positivity was associated with endothelial cells. An elevation in ER beta was also noted when comparing ectopic to eutopic endometrium; with regard to ER alpha, this was inconsistent. These results suggest an up-regulation of dioxin-inducible CYP1A1 and gamma-SYN occurs in endometriosis. Whether gamma-syn may be a novel diagnostic marker for endometriosis remains to be ascertained.","['Singh, Maneesh N', 'Stringfellow, Helen F', 'Taylor, Sian E', 'Ashton, Kate M', 'Ahmad, Mushfika', 'Abdo, Khalil R', 'El-Agnaf, Omar M A', 'Martin-Hirsch, Pierre L', 'Martin, Francis L']","['Singh MN', 'Stringfellow HF', 'Taylor SE', 'Ashton KM', 'Ahmad M', 'Abdo KR', 'El-Agnaf OM', 'Martin-Hirsch PL', 'Martin FL']","['Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Fulwood, Preston, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081010,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (gamma-Synuclein)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1B1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1B1', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'Endometriosis/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'gamma-Synuclein/genetics/*metabolism']",,2008/10/14 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['gan056 [pii]', '10.1093/molehr/gan056 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 2008 Nov;14(11):655-63. doi: 10.1093/molehr/gan056.

A 48-year-old female patient developed ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia and pyomyositis on the twelfth day of cefpirome therapy for neutropenic fever after chemotherapy due to acute myeloid leukemia. She recovered completely after a three-week course of meropenem and surgical excision. Pyomyositis should be included in the differential diagnosis when fever and muscular swelling develop in a patient with neutropenic status after chemotherapy. Early recognition of symptoms and proper diagnostic procedures are key to diagnosing pyomyositis. Both adequate antibiotics and surgical intervention are important for the successful treatment of pyomyositis caused by ESBL-producing E. coli.,"['Chiu, Sheng-Kang', 'Chang, Feng-Yee']","['Chiu SK', 'Chang FY']","['Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20081010,Canada,Int J Infect Dis,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,9610933,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thienamycins)', 'EC 3.5.2.6 (beta-Lactamases)', 'FV9J3JU8B1 (Meropenem)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/etiology/*microbiology', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Meropenem', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyomyositis/drug therapy/etiology/*microbiology', 'Thienamycins/therapeutic use', '*beta-Lactamases']",,2008/10/14 09:00,2009/07/18 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1201-9712(08)01437-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijid.2008.06.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Infect Dis. 2009 May;13(3):e85-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ijid.2008.06.032.

Because disruption of the biological clock has been associated with increased susceptibility to colon cancer and gastrointestinal symptoms, we aimed to identify rhythmically expressed genes in the mouse distal colon. METHODS: Microarray analysis was used to identify genes that were rhythmically expressed over a 24-hour light/dark cycle. The transcripts were then classified according to expression pattern, function, and association with physiologic and pathophysiologic processes of the colon. RESULTS: A circadian gene expression pattern was detected in approximately 3.7% of distal colonic genes. A large percentage of these genes were involved in cell signaling, differentiation, and proliferation and cell death. Of all the rhythmically expressed genes in the mouse colon, approximately 7% (64/906) have been associated with colorectal cancer formation (eg, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 [Bcl2]) and 1.8% (18/906) with various colonic functions such as motility and secretion (eg, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of genes in the murine colon follows a rhythmic expression pattern. These findings may have significant implications for colonic physiology and pathophysiology.","['Hoogerwerf, Willemijntje A', 'Sinha, Mala', 'Conesa, Ana', 'Luxon, Bruce A', 'Shahinian, Vahakn B', 'Cornelissen, Germaine', 'Halberg, Franz', 'Bostwick, Jonathon', 'Timm, John', 'Cassone, Vincent M']","['Hoogerwerf WA', 'Sinha M', 'Conesa A', 'Luxon BA', 'Shahinian VB', 'Cornelissen G', 'Halberg F', 'Bostwick J', 'Timm J', 'Cassone VM']","['Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, USA. willemij@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['R21 DK074477/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK074477-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK074477-01A1/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080903,United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Circadian Rhythm/*genetics', 'Colon/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",PMC2748881,2008/10/14 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]']","['S0016-5085(08)01545-X [pii]', '10.1053/j.gastro.2008.08.048 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2008 Dec;135(6):2019-29. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2008.08.048.

TEL-Jak2 gene fusion, which has been identified in human leukemia, encodes a chimeric protein endowed with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity. Expression of TEL-Jak2 protects Ba/F3 cells from IL-3 withdrawal-induced apoptotic cell death and leads to IL-3-independent growth. However, its mechanisms remain to be only partially understood. Here, we first found that Licochalcone A, one of the flavonoids isolated from the root of Glycyrrhiza inflate, inhibited TEL-Jak2-mediated cell proliferation and survival in the absence of IL-3. Licochalcone A failed to inhibit the activity of TEL-Jak2, however, this induced apoptosis of TEL-Jak2-transformed cells with a much lower concentration in the absence of IL-3 than in the presence of IL-3. Interestingly, Licochalcone A significantly inhibited the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of Stat3, which is essential for TEL-Jak2-induced cell transformation. These data suggest that Licochalcone A is a specific inhibitor for Stat3 and would be employed for the treatment of various diseases caused by disorders of the Jak/Stat pathway.","['Funakoshi-Tago, Megumi', 'Tago, Kenji', 'Nishizawa, Chiho', 'Takahashi, Kyoko', 'Mashino, Tadahiko', 'Iwata, Susumu', 'Inoue, Hideo', 'Sonoda, Yoshiko', 'Kasahara, Tadashi']","['Funakoshi-Tago M', 'Tago K', 'Nishizawa C', 'Takahashi K', 'Mashino T', 'Iwata S', 'Inoue H', 'Sonoda Y', 'Kasahara T']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacology, Keio University, 1-5-30 Shibakoen, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8512, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080919,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TEL-JAK2 fusion protein, human)', 'JTV5467968 (licochalcone A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Chalcones/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/prevention & control', 'Mice', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Plant Extracts', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2008/10/14 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/10/14 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00630-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.09.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Dec 15;76(12):1681-93. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.09.012.

This is important with regard to investigational approaches aimed at helping this subset of patients. The objectives of the current study were to predict outcomes and determine the prognostic factors associated with second salvage therapy in patients with ALL. METHODS: In this study, 288 patients were analyzed who received second salvage therapy for ALL at the authors' institution. RESULTS: Overall, 53 patients (18%) achieved a complete response (CR). The median remission duration was 7 months and the median survival was 3 months. In multivariate analysis, prognostic factors that were associated independently with achieving CR were duration of first CR and platelet count. Patients with a first CR <36 months and platelet counts <50 x 10(9)/L had an expected CR rate of 7%. In multivariate analysis, prognostic factors that were associated independently with survival were duration of first CR, percentage bone marrow blasts, platelet count, and albumin level. The expected 12-month survival rates for patients with 0 or 1, 2, 3, or 4 adverse factors were 33%, 14%, 8%, and 0%, respectively. A repeat multivariate analysis using landmark assessment at 6 weeks selected achievement of CR as adding significantly to the survival benefit (P = .0001; hazard ratio, 0.51). Only 22 patients (8%) were able to undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation as second salvage therapy, and their 1-year survival rate was 18%.

Light chain gene and Fd fragment of heavy chain gene were inserted into fd-tet-DOG2 vector to construct fd-tet-DOG2-Fab. Fab gene was further cloned into expression vector pHEN2 to construct the soluble expression vector pHEN2-Fab. After induction by IPTG, Fab protein was purified by Ni-NTA-chromatography. MTT was used to determine the effects of purified protein on the proliferation of stimulated PBMC in vitro and the concentrations of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in the culture supernatants were detected by ELISA.

The paper explores legitimate disagreement, autonomy and decision making processes in two cases concerning withdrawal of treatment. We suggest a decision making procedure for such cases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A case study of two dilemmas discussed in Norwegian mass media: a four-year-old girl with severe brain damage and a ten-year-old girl with leukaemia. Sources are public documents, newspaper articles and scientific papers. The framework used to evaluate the cases is based on ethics theory and a procedural framework originally developed for priority setting in healthcare. RESULTS: Both cases illustrate disagreement between health personnel and relatives. What seemed to be a medical disagreement turned out to be a conflict where the parties valued the expected outcomes from treatment differently. The doctors found the treatment to be futile in both cases, while the parents disagreed. The conflict was not solved by giving the parents decisive influence in the decision making process. The decision making process did not adhere to standard requirements for due processes. INTERPRETATION: Decisions on withdrawal of treatment should not be made by the doctors alone. Such decisions entail choices between values where there may be legitimate disagreement between affected parties. In unsolved conflicts the case should be handed to a clinical ethics committee or another independent board to ensure legitimacy and trust in the decision making process.","['Miljeteig, Ingrid', 'Johansson, Kjell Arne', 'Norheim, Ole Frithjof']","['Miljeteig I', 'Johansson KA', 'Norheim OF']","['Fagomradet medisinsk etikk, Institutt for samfunnsmedisinske fag, Universitetet i Bergen, Postboks 7804, 5020 Bergen. ingrid.miljeteig@isf.uib.no']",['nor'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,IM,"['Brain Damage, Chronic/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Decision Making/ethics', 'Dissent and Disputes', 'Ethics Committees', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Medical Futility/*ethics', 'Patient Rights/ethics', 'Withholding Treatment/ethics']",,2008/10/11 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['1741730 [pii]'],ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2008 Oct 9;128(19):2185-9.,"['Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2008 Oct 9;128(19):2222.

To determine the prevalence and subtypes of HTLV-1/2 in pregnant women in Gabon, we conducted an epidemiological survey in the five main cities of the country. In 907 samples, the HTLV-1 seroprevalence was 2.1%, which is lower than that previously reported. Only one case of HTLV-2 infection was found. The HTLV-1 seroprevalence increased with age and differed between regions (P </= 0.05), with the highest prevalence (5%) in the southeastern region. A wide range of HTLV-1 proviral loads was observed among the infected women. The level of the proviral load was correlated with a high HTLV-1 antibody titer (P </= 0.02). Sequencing of HTLV-1 env and long terminal repeat fragments showed that all but one strain belonged to the central African subtype B; the outlier was of cosmopolitan subtype A. The new strains of subtype B exhibited wide genetic diversity, but there was no evidence of clustering of specific genomes within geographical regions of the country. Some strains were closely related to simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 strains of great apes, suggesting that in these areas some HTLV-1 strains could arise from relatively recent interspecies transmission. The sole HTLV-2 strain belonged to subtype B. In this study we showed that the prevalence of HTLV-1 in the southeast is one of the highest in the world for pregnant women.","['Etenna, Sonia Lekana-Douki', 'Caron, Melanie', 'Besson, Guillaume', 'Makuwa, Maria', 'Gessain, Antoine', 'Mahe, Antoine', 'Kazanji, Mirdad']","['Etenna SL', 'Caron M', 'Besson G', 'Makuwa M', 'Gessain A', 'Mahe A', 'Kazanji M']","['Departement de Retrovirologie, Centre International de Recherches Medicales, BP 769 Franceville, Gabon.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080924,United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Female', 'Gabon/epidemiology', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*epidemiology/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Urban Population', 'Viral Load']",PMC2576568,2008/10/11 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCM.01249-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JCM.01249-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 2008 Nov;46(11):3607-14. doi: 10.1128/JCM.01249-08.

Previous studies, however, have suggested that endothelial cell (EC) SOCE is mediated by the nonselective canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) family, TRPC1 or TRPC4. Here, we show that passive store depletion by thapsigargin or receptor activation by either thrombin or the vascular endothelial growth factor activates the same pathway in primary ECs with classical SOCE pharmacological features. ECs possess the archetypical Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) current (I(CRAC)), albeit of a very small amplitude. Using a maneuver that amplifies currents in divalent-free bath solutions, we show that EC CRAC has similar characteristics to that recorded from rat basophilic leukemia cells, namely a similar time course of activation, sensitivity to 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, and low concentrations of lanthanides, and large Na(+) currents displaying the typical depotentiation. RNA silencing of either Stim1 or Orai1 essentially abolished SOCE and I(CRAC) in ECs, which were rescued by ectopic expression of either Stim1 or Orai1, respectively. Surprisingly, knockdown of either TRPC1 or TRPC4 proteins had no effect on SOCE and I(CRAC). Ectopic expression of Stim1 in ECs increased their I(CRAC) to a size comparable to that in rat basophilic leukemia cells. Knockdown of Stim1, Stim2, or Orai1 inhibited EC proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest at S and G2/M phase, although Orai1 knockdown was more efficient than that of Stim proteins. These results are first to our knowledge to establish the requirement of Stim1/Orai1 in the endothelial SOCE pathway.","['Abdullaev, Iskandar F', 'Bisaillon, Jonathan M', 'Potier, Marie', 'Gonzalez, Jose C', 'Motiani, Rajender K', 'Trebak, Mohamed']","['Abdullaev IF', 'Bisaillon JM', 'Potier M', 'Gonzalez JC', 'Motiani RK', 'Trebak M']","['Cardiovascular Sciences, MC8, Albany Medical College, 47 New Scotland Avenue, MC-8, Albany, NY 12208, USA.']",['eng'],"['K22 ES014729/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'K22 ES014729-01/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'K22 ES014729-02/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'K22ES014729/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20081009,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (ORAI1 Protein)', '0 (ORAI1 protein, human)', '0 (Orai1 protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STIM1 protein, human)', '0 (Stim1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stromal Interaction Molecule 1)', '0 (TRPC Cation Channels)', '0 (transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 1)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*physiology', 'Calcium Channels/genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA Primers', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'ORAI1 Protein', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Rats', 'Stromal Interaction Molecule 1', 'TRPC Cation Channels/*physiology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Umbilical Veins']",PMC2682347,2008/10/11 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['01.RES.0000338496.95579.56 [pii]', '10.1161/01.RES.0000338496.95579.56 [doi]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 2008 Nov 21;103(11):1289-99. doi: 10.1161/01.RES.0000338496.95579.56.

In the last two years 30 newly diagnosed or recurrent childhood ALL bone marrow samples were analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities with conventional G-banding and interphase-fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) using probes to detect BCR/ABL fusions, cryptic TEL/AML1 and MLL rearrangements and p16(9p21) tumor suppressor gene deletions. G-banded karyotype analysis found clonal chromosomal aberrations in 50% of cases. With the use of complementary I-FISH techniques, ALL-specific structural and numerical changes could be identified in 70% of the patients. Nine cases (30%) had subtle chromosomal aberrations with prognostic importance that had not been detected in G-banded analysis. Conventional G-banding yielded additional information (rare and complex structural aberrations) in 19% of patients. The most common aberration (30%) was AML1 copy number increase present in G-banded hyperdiploid karyotype as a chromosome 21 tetrasomy in the majority of cases; one case displayed 5-6 copies and in another case amplification of AML1 gene on der(21) was combined with TEL/AML1 fusion of the homologue AML1 gene and deletion of the remaining TEL allele. High hiperdiploidy was detected in 6 cases, in one patient with normal G-banding karyotype. TEL/AML1 fusion signals were identified in four patients.

Besides their major cytotoxic function, NK cells can also produce inflammatory cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-gamma. In this way, NK cells can shape adaptive immune responses through activation of dendritic cells (DC), thereby promoting the bidirectional cross-talk between NK cells and DC. Including this helper function of NK cells in cancer vaccination might be important for the induction of effective T cell responses. Here, we explored the capacity of purified human NK cells to produce IFN-gamma upon two-signal stimulation using different types of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and type I IFN. Based on our previous findings that AML cells produce IFN-alpha upon electroporation with the synthetic double-stranded (ds)RNA polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), we hypothesized that dsRNA-loaded tumor cells provide both signals to elicit an NK cell-driven IFN-gamma production. Our results show that in vitro, NK cells become strong IFN-gamma-secreting cells upon stimulation with specific AML cells and IFN-alpha, with a variable responsiveness against different AML cell lines. Importantly, loading of AML cells with poly(I:C) is an elegant method to provide NK cells with both signals, a feature that could have important clinical implications because it obviates the side effects of systemic cytokine administration. Moreover, in addition to our previous findings that DC become activated upon phagocytosis of poly(I:C)-electroporated AML cells, these data strongly encourage future research on the potential of dsRNA-transfected AML cells and their effect to favor NK-DC cross-talk for the design of leukemia vaccines.","['Lion, Eva', 'Smits, Evelien L J M', 'Berneman, Zwi N', 'Van Tendeloo, Viggo F I']","['Lion E', 'Smits EL', 'Berneman ZN', 'Van Tendeloo VF']","['Vaccine & Infectious Disease Institute (VIDI), Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Antwerp University, Antwerp, Belgium. eva.lion@ua.ac.be']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081009,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Cell Communication/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Electroporation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interferon Inducers/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology', 'Poly I-C/immunology', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/*immunology']",,2008/10/11 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00385-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.08.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Apr;33(4):539-46. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.08.020.

The EBV transcriptional activating protein EBNA2 and the EBNA2 coactivator EBNA-leader protein (EBNA-LP) are important for B cell immortalization. Recent observations from our laboratory indicate that EBNA-LP coactivation function is mediated through interactions with the interferon-inducible gene (ISG) Sp100, resulting in displacement from its normal location in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML NBs) into the nucleoplasm. The EBNA-LP- and interferon-mediated mechanisms that regulate Sp100 subnuclear localization and transcriptional function remain undefined. To clarify these issues, we generated a panel of Sp100 mutant proteins to ascertain whether EBNA-LP induces Sp100 displacement from PML NBs by interfering with Sp100 dimerization or through other domains. In addition, we tested EBNA-LP function in interferon-treated cells. Our results indicate that Sp100 dimerization, PML NB localization, and EBNA-LP interaction domains overlap significantly. We also show that IFN-beta does not inhibit EBNA-LP coactivation function. The results suggest that EBNA-LP might play a role in EBV-evasion of IFN-mediated antiviral responses.","['Echendu, Chisaroka W', 'Ling, Paul D']","['Echendu CW', 'Ling PD']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['F31 CA126523-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA124309/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (EBNA-LP protein, Human herpesvirus 4)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/*genetics/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC2988464,2008/10/11 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2008.0023 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2008 Nov;28(11):667-78. doi: 10.1089/jir.2008.0023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mononuclear cells exposed to microbes or microbial products secrete a host of proinflammatory cytokines followed by delayed onset of anti-inflammatory IL-10. IL-10 suppresses immune responses by inhibiting cytokine production by mononuclear phagocytes. Using THP-1, a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, we show that endotoxin/lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure induces IL10 expression while IFN-gamma blocks this LPS-mediated effect. IFN-gamma is an important modulator of IL-10 production during infectious diseases. We show that LPS and IFN-gamma regulate IL10 expression in THP-1 cells in part through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Our results demonstrate that 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) AU-rich elements (AREs) decrease expression of a chimeric luciferase reporter gene in THP-1 cells. The ARE-binding protein AUF1 binds the IL10 3'-UTR. Depletion of AUF1 by RNAi suppresses LPS-mediated induction of IL10 mRNA and protein without affecting LPS-mediated stabilization of IL10 mRNA. Upon complementation with either RNAi-refractory p37 or p40 AUF1 plasmids, only p40 restores LPS-mediated induction of IL10 mRNA and protein to near normal levels. Thus, the p40 AUF1 isoform selectively plays a critical, positive role in IL10 expression upon LPS exposure.","['Sarkar, Srijata', 'Sinsimer, Kristina S', 'Foster, Randi L', 'Brewer, Gary', 'Pestka, Sidney']","['Sarkar S', 'Sinsimer KS', 'Foster RL', 'Brewer G', 'Pestka S']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, and Immunology, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA. pestka@umdnj.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 AI059465/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI057596/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI57596/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5T32AI007403/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA052443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (HNRNPD protein, human)', '0 (Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D0', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein D/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",PMC2956575,2008/10/11 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.2008.0028 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 2008 Nov;28(11):679-91. doi: 10.1089/jir.2008.0028.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to determine whether there was space-time clustering around the residence at birth in relation to time of birth and separately from time of diagnosis. A total of 29,553 cases, diagnosed during the period 1969-1993, were examined by a second-order procedure based on K-functions. Locations were birth addresses, but separately, both dates of birth and diagnosis were analyzed. There was statistically significant space-time clustering for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and central nervous system (CNS) tumors (p=0.047 and 0.01, respectively, based on birth date) and for total leukemia at ages 1-4 years only, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and Wilms tumor (p=0.01, 0.02 and 0.006, respectively, based on diagnosis date). These results, interpreted together with other epidemiological evidence, suggest an etiological role for environmental factors focused around birth address for certain childhood cancers. For HL and CNS tumors, findings suggest that etiological exposures occurred at similar ages or in utero. For leukemia, NHL and Wilms tumor there is support for exposures occurring at similar times before diagnosis. For leukemia, HL, NHL and CNS tumors, but not Wilms tumor, the findings are consistent with infectious hypotheses.","['McNally, Richard J Q', 'Bithell, John F', 'Vincent, Tim J', 'Murphy, Michael F G']","['McNally RJ', 'Bithell JF', 'Vincent TJ', 'Murphy MF']","['School of Clinical Medical Sciences (Child Health) and Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. richard.mcnally@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Time Factors']",,2008/10/11 09:00,2009/01/16 09:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.23927 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2009 Jan 15;124(2):449-55. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23927.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

METHODS: Methylation status of PTEN in leukemic cell lines, including HL-60, Nalm-6, NB4, U937, Raji, K562 and KG-1a was assessed by methylation specific PCR (MSP). The cell lines were then treated with different concentrations of methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR). After that the changes in PTEN methylation status were detected by MSP, and PTEN mRNA expression level by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Growth inhibition and apoptosis of HL-60 and Nalm-6 cells induced by 5-Aza-CdR were observed by MTT assay, and Wright and Annexin V staining, respectively. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of PTEN promoter was detected in HL-60, U937, Nalm-6, Raji and KG-1a, while hypomethylation was found in NB4 and K562 by MSP. After 5-Aza-CdR treatment, the hypermethylation status of PTEN promoter in HL-60 and Nalm-6 cells was reversed and their PTEN mRNA expression levels were up regulated in dose dependent manner with the 5-Aza-CdR concentrations, and the cell apoptosis was induced. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation in the promoter region is one of major mechanisms responsible for transcriptional suppression of PTEN. Methyltransferase inhibitor could induce the expression of PTEN gene and lead to the leukemia cells apoptosis.","['Li, Min', 'Liu, Hang', 'Xu, Zhi-Fang', 'Liu, Xiang-Rong', 'Wang, Yang', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Jian-Xiang', 'Wang, Min']","['Li M', 'Liu H', 'Xu ZF', 'Liu XR', 'Wang Y', 'Rao Q', 'Wang JX', 'Wang M']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS, Tianjin 300020, China.']",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,"['EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics']",,2008/10/11 09:00,2010/04/09 06:00,['2008/10/11 09:00'],"['2008/10/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2008 May;29(5):289-92.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective clinical study was conducted at the bone marrow transplant unit in our hospital between March 2001 and November 2006. A total of 26 HBsAg positive leukemia patients were included in the study. 18 patients received HLA-identical sibling allo-HSCT, 7 patients received HLA-mismatched related and 1 patient received HLA-identical unrelated. All the patients were free from hepatitis C infection before and after allo-HSCT. HBV serologic markers, including HBsAg, HBeAg, HBsAb, HBeAb and HBcAb were tested. 2 patients were positive for HBV-DNA before allo-HSCT. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence for acute graft vs host disease (aGVHD) grades I -IV was 50.0%. The cumulative incidence for chronic GVHD was 25.0%. 15 (57.7%) of all the patients had abnormalities of liver function after allo-HSCT. The types of hepatic disease were reactivation of HBV and hepatic GVHD. The cumulative incidence in 5 years for hepatitis B reactivation was 33.4%, the median day of hepatitis B reactivation was 82th (65th-159th) day. The virologic and clinical outcomes were compared between two groups; one received lamivudine as prophylactic (group 1) and the other did not receive lamivudine (group 2). After transplantation, 1 patient in group 1 and 7 patients in group 2 had hepatitis due to reactivation of HBV. The cumulative incidence for hepatitis B reactivation was statistically different between the two groups (P= 0.006). None in group 1 but 4 in group 2 died of HBV-related hepatic failure. 10 of the 26 patients died after transplantation. The overall survival (OS) in 5 years was 59.0%. The causes of death included hepatic failure (5 cases), lung infection (3 cases) and relapse of leukemia (2 cases). By multivariate Cox analysis, development of hepatic failure was a significant predictor of mortality (P = 0.000). CONCLUSION: HBsAg positive leukemia patients often suffered from hepatic injury after allo-HSCT. The principal cause of hepatic damage was the reactivation of HBV. Hepatic failure caused by HBV was the principal reason of death.

It is often poorly performed in practice. Various interventions have been developed that aim to enhance communication involving children or adolescents with cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of interventions for improving communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, its treatment and their implications, updating the 2003 version of this review. SEARCH STRATEGY: In April 2006 we updated searches of the following sources: CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, issue 1 2006); MEDLINE (Ovid), (2003 to March week 5 2006); EMBASE (Ovid) (2003 to 2006 week 13); PsycINFO (Ovid) (2003 to March week 5 2006); CINAHL (Ovid) (2003 to March week 5 2006); ERIC (CSA) (earliest to 2006); Sociological Abstracts (CSA) (earliest to 2006); Dissertation Abstracts: (2002 to 6 April 2006).In 2003 we conducted searches of CENTRAL; MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Sociological Abstracts and Dissertation Abstracts.For the initial (2001) publication of this review we also searched the following databases: PsycLIT; Cancerlit; Sociofile; Health Management Information Consortium; ASSIA; LISA; PAIS; Information Science Abstracts; JICST; Pascal; Linguistics and Language Behavior Abstracts; Mental Health Abstracts; AMED; MANTIS.We also searched the bibliographies of studies assessed for inclusion, and contacted experts in the field. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and before and after studies, evaluating the effects of interventions for improving communication with children and/or adolescents about their cancer, treatment and related issues. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data relating to the interventions, populations and outcomes studied and the design and methodological quality of included studies were extracted by one review author and checked by another review author. We present a narrative summary of the results. MAIN RESULTS: One new study met the criteria for inclusion; in total we have included ten studies involving 438 participants. Studies were diverse in terms of the interventions evaluated, study designs used, types of people who participated and the outcomes measured.One study of a computer-assisted education programme reported improvements in knowledge and understanding about blood counts and cancer symptoms. One study of a CD-ROM about leukaemia reported an improvement in children's feelings of control over their health. One study of art therapy as support for children during painful procedures reported an increase in positive, collaborative behaviour. Two out of two studies of school reintegration programs reported improvements in some aspects of psychosocial wellbeing (one in anxiety and one in depression), social wellbeing (two in social competence and one in social support) and behavioural problems; and one reported improvements in physical competence. One newly-identified study of a multifaceted interactive intervention reported a reduction in distress (as measured by heart rate) related to radiation therapy.Two studies of group therapy, one of planned play and story telling, and one of a self-care coping intervention, found no significant effects on the psychological or clinical outcomes measured. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to enhance communication involving children and adolescents with cancer have not been widely or rigorously assessed. The weak evidence that exists suggests that some children and adolescents with cancer may derive some benefit from specific information-giving programs, from support before and during particular procedures, and from interventions that aim to facilitate their reintegration into school and social activities. More research is needed to investigate the effects of these and other related interventions.","['Ranmal, Rita', 'Prictor, Megan', 'Scott, J Tim']","['Ranmal R', 'Prictor M', 'Scott JT']","['Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 5-11 Theobalds Road, London, UK, WC1X 8SH.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",20081008,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Communication', 'Family', 'Humans', '*Neoplasms/psychology/therapy', '*Patient Education as Topic', 'Professional-Patient Relations']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/01/16 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD002969.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2008 Oct 8;(4):CD002969. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD002969.pub2.,,,136,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2003;(3):CD002969.

However, the transcriptional changes triggered by the mutation have not yet been totally characterized. In this study, we performed a large-scale gene expression study using serial analysis of gene expression in bone marrow cells of a newly diagnosed PV patient harboring the JAK2 V617F mutation and in normal bone marrow cells of healthy donors. JUNB was one of the genes upregulated in PV, and we confirmed, by quantitative real-time PCR, an overexpression of JUNB in hematopoietic cells of other JAK2 V617F PV patients. Using Ba/F3-EPOR cell lines and primary human erythroblast cultures, we found that JUNB was transcriptionally induced after erythropoietin addition and that JAK2 V617F constitutively induced JunB protein expression. Furthermore, JUNB knockdown reduced not only the growth of Ba/F3 cells by inducing apoptosis, but also the clonogenic and proliferative potential of human erythroid progenitors. These results establish a role for JunB in normal erythropoiesis and indicate that JunB may play a major role in the development of JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative disorders.","['da Costa Reis Monte-Mor, B', 'Plo, I', 'da Cunha, A F', 'Costa, G G L', 'de Albuquerque, D M', 'Jedidi, A', 'Villeval, J-L', 'Badaoui, S', 'Lorand-Metze, I', 'Pagnano, K B B', 'Saad, S T O', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Costa, F F']","['da Costa Reis Monte-Mor B', 'Plo I', 'da Cunha AF', 'Costa GG', 'de Albuquerque DM', 'Jedidi A', 'Villeval JL', 'Badaoui S', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Pagnano KB', 'Saad ST', 'Vainchenker W', 'Costa FF']","['Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, State University of Campinas, Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081009,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*genetics/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008275 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.275 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):144-52. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.275.

We first showed protection of lymphoma cells from apoptosis by conditioned medium of a stromal cell-lymphoma cell coculture, either spontaneous or induced by mitoxantrone, implying a role for soluble factor(s) in lymphoma cell survival. Addition of BAFF counteracted mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis and elicited a reduction in spontaneous apoptosis in primary lymphomas, suggesting a role of BAFF in sustaining B-cell survival. Abundant BAFF was detected in the BMSC cell line (HS-5) and primary BMSCs by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and immunoblotting. BAFF levels were 20- to 200-fold higher in BMSCs than in lymphoma cells, and lymphoma cell adhesion to BMSCs augmented BAFF secretion twofold through upregulation of BAFF gene expression. Finally, neutralization of BAFF by TACI-Ig or depletion of BAFF by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) in BMSCs significantly enhanced lymphoma cell response to chemotherapy and overcame stroma-mediated drug resistance, suggesting that lymphoma cells use BMSC-derived BAFF as a survival factor. These findings support the hypothesis that lymphoma cells interact with BMSCs, resulting in stromal niches with high BAFF concentration, and identify BMSC-derived BAFF as a functional determinant for B lymphoma cell survival in the bone marrow environment.","['Lwin, T', 'Crespo, L A', 'Wu, A', 'Dessureault, S', 'Shu, H B', 'Moscinski, L C', 'Sotomayor, E', 'Dalton, W S', 'Tao, J']","['Lwin T', 'Crespo LA', 'Wu A', 'Dessureault S', 'Shu HB', 'Moscinski LC', 'Sotomayor E', 'Dalton WS', 'Tao J']","['Department of Oncologic Sciences and Experimental Therapeutics Program, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33613, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081009,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)', '0 (TNFSF13B protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/*genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Survival', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/*cytology', 'Up-Regulation']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008266 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.266 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):170-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.266.

IFN-receptor characterization was also pivotal in the discovery of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Among the large IFN family, mainly one of the type I IFN, IFN-alpha2, is used in therapy. Many clinical trials have shown remarkable efficacy of IFN-alpha in bcr-abl-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), especially polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET). IFN-alpha induces about 80% of hematological responses in those diseases and is able to reduce splenomegaly, as well as relieve pruritus and other constitutional symptoms. Yet its use was limited by toxicity, leading to early treatment discontinuation in about 20% of the patients. However, its lack of leukemogenic potential and its possible use during pregnancy have already made IFN-alpha the drug of choice for younger MPN patients. In addition, several studies have shown a probably selective effect of IFN-alpha on PV and ET clones, as shown by cytogenetic remissions, reversions to polyclonal hematopoiesis, and more recently by induction of JAK2V617F complete molecular remissions in PV which may widen the indications of IFN-alpha in JAK2-mutated MPN.","['Kiladjian, J-J', 'Chomienne, C', 'Fenaux, P']","['Kiladjian JJ', 'Chomienne C', 'Fenaux P']","[""Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Bobigny, France. jean-jacques.kiladjian@avc.aphp.fr""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20081009,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008280 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.280 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Nov;22(11):1990-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.280.

Based on our enhanced understanding of the functional importance of the MM BM microenvironment and its inter-relation with the MM cell resulting in homing, seeding, proliferation and survival, new molecular targets have been identified and derived treatment regimens in MM have already changed fundamentally during recent years.

With the benefit of time, a more comprehensive picture has emerged regarding several characteristics of the fusion, including its incidence, biological features and the clinical profile of patients who carry the molecular rearrangement. A few prospective trials have now better defined the natural history of imatinib-treated FIP1L1-PDGFRA-positive patients, from which some basic conclusions can be drawn: the prognosis is outstanding, acquired resistance is exceedingly rare, but ongoing imatinib treatment is likely required to prevent relapse. The emergence of genetically assigned eosinophilias has led the World Health Organization in 2008 to adopt a semi-molecular classification scheme, with one subcategory named 'myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and abnormalities of PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1.' Molecular rearrangements involving other partner genes, such as ETV6 and JAK2, have also been associated with eosinophilic disorders, and will likely be assimilated into such classifications over time. Despite the molecularly defined eosinophilias comprising a small proportion of cases compared to the aggregate of other subtypes of hypereosinophilia, their recognition is critical because of the availability of highly effective molecularly targeted therapy.","['Gotlib, J', 'Cools, J']","['Gotlib J', 'Cools J']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Center, Stanford, CA 94305-5821, USA. jason.gotlib@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20081009,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)']",IM,"['Eosinophilia/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/*genetics', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/*genetics']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008287 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.287 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Nov;22(11):1999-2010. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.287.

This work focuses on the development of a novel peptidic molecule based on the BH3 domain of Bim. The antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-X(L), involved in cancer development/progression and tumour resistance to cytotoxic drugs, is a target for Bim. According to a rational study of the structural interactions between wt Bim-BH3 and Bcl-X(L), we replaced specific residues of Bim-BH3 with natural and non-natural aminoacids and added an internalizing sequence, thus increasing dramatically the inhibitory activity of our modified Bim-BH3 peptide, called 072RB. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry demonstrated cellular uptake and internalization of 072RB, followed by co-localization with mitochondria. Multiparameter flow cytometry demonstrated that the 072RB dose-dependent growth inhibition of leukaemia cell lines was due to apoptotic cell death. No effect was observed when cells were treated with the internalizing vector alone or a mutated control peptide (single aminoacid substitution L94A). Ex-vivo derived leukemic cells from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients underwent cell death when cultured in vitro in the presence of 072RB. Conversely, no significant cytotoxic effect was observed when 072RB was administered to cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, either resting or PHA-stimulated, and bone marrow cells of normal donors. Xenografts of human AML cells in NOD/SCID mice displayed a significant delay of leukemic cell growth upon treatment with 072RB administered intravenously (15 mg/Kg three times, 48 hours after tumour cell injection). Altogether, these observations support the therapeutic potentials of this novel BH3 mimetic.","['Ponassi, Raffaella', 'Biasotti, Barbara', 'Tomati, Valeria', 'Bruno, Silvia', 'Poggi, Alessandro', 'Malacarne, Davide', 'Cimoli, Guido', 'Salis, Annalisa', 'Pozzi, Sarah', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Damonte, Gianluca', 'Cozzini, Pietro', 'Spyrakis, Francesca', 'Campanini, Barbara', 'Bagnasco, Luca', 'Castagnino, Nicoletta', 'Tortolina, Lorenzo', 'Mumot, Anna', 'Frassoni, Francesco', 'Daga, Antonio', 'Cilli, Michele', 'Piccardi, Federica', 'Monfardini, Ilaria', 'Perugini, Miriam', 'Zoppoli, Gabriele', ""D'Arrigo, Cristina"", 'Pesenti, Raffaele', 'Parodi, Silvio']","['Ponassi R', 'Biasotti B', 'Tomati V', 'Bruno S', 'Poggi A', 'Malacarne D', 'Cimoli G', 'Salis A', 'Pozzi S', 'Miglino M', 'Damonte G', 'Cozzini P', 'Spyrakis F', 'Campanini B', 'Bagnasco L', 'Castagnino N', 'Tortolina L', 'Mumot A', 'Frassoni F', 'Daga A', 'Cilli M', 'Piccardi F', 'Monfardini I', 'Perugini M', 'Zoppoli G', ""D'Arrigo C"", 'Pesenti R', 'Parodi S']","['Department of Oncology, University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081020,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (072RB peptide)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['6830 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.20.6830 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 Oct;7(20):3211-24. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.20.6830.

However, there is little documentation of ethnic differences in these excess risks. Asian women are characterized by younger age at diagnosis of breast cancer, but very few reports are available on the incidences and risks for second primary cancers in this region. Using population-based data from the Taiwan National Cancer Registry (TNCR) for the period 1979 to 2003, we quantified standardized incidence ratios and cumulative incidence of second cancers among 53,783 women with initial diagnoses of breast cancer. Age-specific incidences showed peaks among women in their 40s, and 1,085 cases (2.02%) developed nonbreast second primary cancers. The risk for second cancers differs significantly according to age at diagnosis of breast cancer. In comparison with women diagnosed when >or=50 years (standardized incidence ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval; 0.89-1.04), there were significantly greater risks for bone, corpus uterine, ovarian, thyroid, esophageal, kidney and lung cancers, nonmelanoma skin cancer, and leukemia or lymphoma in women diagnosed when <50 years (standardized incidence ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-1.58). The survival probabilities differed between breast cancer patients with and without second cancers (P<0.001). After diagnosis of the second cancer, the median survival time was only 2.87 years. In conclusion, we confirmed that young age at diagnosis of breast cancer predicted a subsequently increased risk for second malignancies, and the second cancers indeed worsen survivorship in patients who survived breast cancer.","['Lee, Kuan-Der', 'Chen, Shin-Cheh', 'Chan, Chunghuang Hubert', 'Lu, Chang-Hsien', 'Chen, Chih-Cheng', 'Lin, Jen-Tsun', 'Chen, Miao-Fen', 'Huang, Shih-Hao', 'Yeh, Chun-Ming', 'Chen, Min-Chi']","['Lee KD', 'Chen SC', 'Chan CH', 'Lu CH', 'Chen CC', 'Lin JT', 'Chen MF', 'Huang SH', 'Yeh CM', 'Chen MC']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Chiayi, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Breast Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['17/10/2647 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0109 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2008 Oct;17(10):2647-55. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-08-0109.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we describe an additional block in the selective packaging of tRNA(3Lys) into HIV-1 produced in murine cells. HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus (MuLV) use tRNA(3Lys) and tRNA(Pro), respectively, as primers for reverse transcription. Selective packaging of tRNA(3Lys) into HIV-1 produced in human cells is much stronger than that for tRNA(Pro) incorporation into MuLV produced in murine cells, and different packaging mechanisms are used. Thus, both lysyl-tRNA synthetase and GagPol are required for tRNA(3Lys) packaging into HIV-1, but neither prolyl-tRNA synthetase nor GagPol is required for tRNA(Pro) packaging into MuLV. In this report, we show that when HIV-1 is produced in murine cells, the virus switches from an HIV-1-like incorporation of tRNA(3Lys) to an MuLV-like packaging of tRNA(Pro). The primer binding site in viral RNA remains complementary to tRNA(3Lys), resulting in a significant decrease in reverse transcription and infectivity. Reduction in tRNA(3Lys) incorporation occurs even though both murine lysyl-tRNA synthetase and HIV-1 GagPol are packaged into the HIV-1 produced in murine cells. Nevertheless, the murine cell is able to support the select incorporation of tRNA(3Lys) into another retrovirus that uses tRNA(3Lys) as a primer, the mouse mammary tumor virus.","['Wei, Min', 'Yang, Yiliang', 'Niu, Meijuan', 'Desfosse, Laurie', 'Kennedy, Robert', 'Musier-Forsyth, Karin', 'Kleiman, Lawrence']","['Wei M', 'Yang Y', 'Niu M', 'Desfosse L', 'Kennedy R', 'Musier-Forsyth K', 'Kleiman L']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Jewish General Hospital, 3755 Cote St. Catherine Rd., Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1E2.']",['eng'],"['F32 GM069339/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI054145/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI054145/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM069339/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081008,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Lys)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2/genetics', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer, Lys/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Virion/metabolism', '*Virus Assembly']",PMC2593337,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/01/03 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01744-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01744-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Dec;82(24):12049-59. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01744-08.

However, the function(s) of human Wrnip1 has remained elusive so far. Here we report that Wrnip1 is distributed inside heterogeneous structures detectable in nondamaged cells throughout the cell cycle. In an attempt to characterize these structures, we found that Wrnip1 resides in DNA replication factories. Upon treatments that stall replication forks, such as UVC light, the amount of chromatin-bound Wrnip1 and the number of foci significantly increase, further implicating Wrnip1 in DNA replication. Interestingly, the nuclear pattern of Wrnip1 appears to extend to a broader landscape, as it can be detected in promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. The presence of Wrnip1 into these heterogeneous subnuclear structures requires its ubiquitin-binding zinc finger (UBZ) domain, which is able to interact with different ubiquitin (Ub) signals, including mono-Ub and chains linked via lysine 48 and 63. Moreover, the oligomerization of Wrnip1 mediated by its C terminus is also important for proper subnuclear localization. Our study is the first to reveal the composite and regulated topography of Wrnip1 in the human nucleus, highlighting its potential role in replication and other nuclear transactions.","['Crosetto, Nicola', 'Bienko, Marzena', 'Hibbert, Richard G', 'Perica, Tina', 'Ambrogio, Chiara', 'Kensche, Tobias', 'Hofmann, Kay', 'Sixma, Titia K', 'Dikic, Ivan']","['Crosetto N', 'Bienko M', 'Hibbert RG', 'Perica T', 'Ambrogio C', 'Kensche T', 'Hofmann K', 'Sixma TK', 'Dikic I']","['Institute of Biochemistry II and Cluster of Excellence Macromolecular Complexes, J.

Furthermore the differences between clinician and patient perceptions of stresses and distress during chemotherapy are well recognised. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a nursing intervention incorporating structured symptom assessment and management, facilitated by information technology, on chemotherapy-related symptoms, nausea, vomiting, fatigue and mucositis. This pan-European study, involved 8 clinical sites from Belgium, Denmark, England, Ireland and Scotland. Adults (n=249) receiving first line chemotherapy for breast, lung, ovarian or colorectal cancer, osteosarcoma, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or lymphoma were recruited to the study.

The latter is a major contributor to the classification, as well as to the understanding of the malignant T-cell behavior. The fact that T-cell migration is regulated by chemokines should, in theory, enable us to identify tissue tropism and organ involvement by neoplastic T-cells by monitoring chemokine receptor surface expression. To address this issue we compared the expression of several early and late inflammatory, homeostatic, and organ specific chemokine receptors on blood T-cells from normal individuals and patients with T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia and peripheral T-cell lymphoma. T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia cells mainly express late inflammatory chemokine receptors (CXCR1 and CXCR2), whereas peripheral T-cell lymphoma cells usually express one or more organ homing receptors (CCR4, CCR6 and CCR7). Nevertheless, no clear correlation was found between CCR4 and CCR7 expression and skin and lymph node involvement, respectively. Compared to their normal counterparts, lymphoma T-cells displayed an exaggerated CCR4 expression, whereas leukemic T-cells had abnormally high CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression. Further analysis revealed that, in leukemia patients, the percentage of neoplastic cells expressing CCR5 correlates directly with lymphocytosis. In addition, in the case of CD8 T-cell leukemia patients, an inverse correlation with neutropenia was found. In lymphoma patients, higher CCR4 and CCR7 expression is accompanied by lower to absent CCR5 expression.","['Moura, Joao', 'Rodrigues, Joao', 'Santos, Ana Helena', 'Teixeira, Maria dos Anjos', 'Queiros, Maria Luis', 'Santos, Marlene', 'Goncalves, Marta', 'Fonseca, Sonia', 'Laranjeira, Carla', 'Rodrigues, Antonio Silva', 'Correia Junior, Esmeraldina', 'Ribeiro, Fernanda', 'Acosta, Maria Joao', 'Lima, Margarida']","['Moura J', 'Rodrigues J', 'Santos AH', 'Teixeira Mdos A', 'Queiros ML', 'Santos M', 'Goncalves M', 'Fonseca S', 'Laranjeira C', 'Rodrigues AS', 'Correia Junior E', 'Ribeiro F', 'Acosta MJ', 'Lima M']","['Laboratorio de Citometria, Servico de Hematologia Clinica, Centro Hospitalar do Porto (CHP), Hospital Geral de Santo Antonio (HGSA), Porto, Portugal. jmouraalves@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081007,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",IM,"['Cytokines/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*classification/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/analysis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/pathology']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(08)00178-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2009 Jan-Feb;42(1):57-63. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.08.002.

In this study, we investigated fecal viral shedding of FeLV and its role in viral pathogenesis with the goal to improve infection control. FeLV RNA and DNA levels were determined in rectal swabs of experimentally infected cats by real-time PCR, and the results were correlated with proviral and viral loads in whole blood and plasma, respectively, and plasma p27 levels. All antigenemic cats shed FeLV RNA and DNA in feces. To determine whether the viral RNA detected was infectious, virus isolation from feces was also performed. Infectious virus was isolated from feces of antigenemic cats, and these results perfectly correlated with the isolation of virus from plasma. Naive cats exposed to these feces seroconverted, showing that infection through feces took place, but remained negative for the presence of FeLV provirus and p27 in blood, an outcome so far not described. Some of the organs collected after euthanasia were provirus positive at low copy numbers. From these results it is concluded that fecal shedding of FeLV plays a role in transmission, but it is probably of secondary importance in viral pathogenesis. Nevertheless, sharing of litter pans by susceptible and viremic cats could increase the environmental infectious pressure and appropriate measures should be taken to avoid unnecessary viral exposure.","['Gomes-Keller, M A', 'Gonczi, E', 'Grenacher, B', 'Tandon, R', 'Hofman-Lehmann, R', 'Lutz, H']","['Gomes-Keller MA', 'Gonczi E', 'Grenacher B', 'Tandon R', 'Hofman-Lehmann R', 'Lutz H']","['University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 260, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland. alice_gomes@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080822,Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cat Diseases/transmission/*virology', 'Cats', 'DNA, Viral/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Feces/*virology', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Retroviridae Infections/transmission/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/transmission/*veterinary/virology', 'Virus Shedding/*physiology']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/04/15 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1135(08)00329-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.08.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 2009 Mar 2;134(3-4):208-17. doi: 10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.08.011.

The hypothesis suggested that those cancer cells that are able to proliferate may have found a way to cause the expression of the immunomodulatory protein known as the progesterone induced blocking factor (PIBF). The cancer cells could find an alternate pathway to make this protein that does not require progesterone secretion, or the cancer cells may actually utilize progesterone and thus make PIBF in a similar fashion to normal pregnancy. If the former mechanism was operational, then one could develop monoclonal antibody type therapy directed to this unique protein not needed for normal body functions. However, if the latter pathway involving progesterone secretion is operational, then there would be drugs already on the market, e.g., the progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone that could be used to treat these cancers. In vitro data has shown that 100% of human leukemia cell lines express mRNA for the PIBF protein. Some leukemia cell lines have been found that actually express the PIBF protein. In fact adding progesterone to the culture media upregulated PIBF protein expression and mifepristone inhibited it. Controlled studies in various murine spontaneous cancers not known to be associated with progesterone receptors showed increased length and quality of life following mifepristone therapy. Anecdotal improvement in advanced widely metastatic human cancers has also been found. Thus there is now experimental data to support this hypothesis and a new door to a completely different type of cancer therapy has been opened.","['Check, J H', 'Dix, E', 'Sansoucie, L']","['Check JH', 'Dix E', 'Sansoucie L']","['The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School at Camden, Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center, Melrose Park, PA 19027, USA. laurie@ccivf.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081007,United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (PIBF1 protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*physiology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mifepristone/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/genetics', 'Progesterone/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Progesterone/drug effects/physiology', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/genetics']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/02/26 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-9877(08)00421-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mehy.2008.05.042 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 2009 Jan;72(1):87-90. doi: 10.1016/j.mehy.2008.05.042.

We propose innovative generalizations of SNR for multiclass cancer discrimination through introduction of two indices, Gene Dominant Index and Gene Dormant Index (GDIs). These two indices lead to the concepts of dominant and dormant genes with biological significance. We use these indices to develop methodologies for discovery of dominant and dormant biomarkers with interesting biological significance. The dominancy and dormancy of the identified biomarkers and their excellent discriminating power are also demonstrated pictorially using the scatterplot of individual gene and 2-D Sammon's projection of the selected set of genes. Using information from the literature we have shown that the GDI based method can identify dominant and dormant genes that play significant roles in cancer biology. These biomarkers are also used to design diagnostic prediction systems. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: To evaluate the effectiveness of the GDIs, we have used four multiclass cancer data sets (Small Round Blue Cell Tumors, Leukemia, Central Nervous System Tumors, and Lung Cancer). For each data set we demonstrate that the new indices can find biologically meaningful genes that can act as biomarkers. We then use six machine learning tools, Nearest Neighbor Classifier (NNC), Nearest Mean Classifier (NMC), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with linear kernel, and SVM classifier with Gaussian kernel, where both SVMs are used in conjunction with one-vs-all (OVA) and one-vs-one (OVO) strategies. We found GDIs to be very effective in identifying biomarkers with strong class specific signatures. With all six tools and for all data sets we could achieve better or comparable prediction accuracies usually with fewer marker genes than results reported in the literature using the same computational protocols. The dominant genes are usually easy to find while good dormant genes may not always be available as dormant genes require stronger constraints to be satisfied; but when they are available, they can be used for authentication of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Since GDI based schemes can find a small set of dominant/dormant biomarkers that is adequate to design diagnostic prediction systems, it opens up the possibility of using real-time qPCR assays or antibody based methods such as ELISA for an easy and low cost diagnosis of diseases. The dominant and dormant genes found by GDIs can be used in different ways to design more reliable diagnostic prediction systems.","['Tsai, Yu-Shuen', 'Lin, Chin-Teng', 'Tseng, George C', 'Chung, I-Fang', 'Pal, Nikhil Ranjan']","['Tsai YS', 'Lin CT', 'Tseng GC', 'Chung IF', 'Pal NR']","['Institute of Biomedical Informatics, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan. g39528010@ym.edu.tw']",['eng'],['KL2 TR000146/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081009,England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",PMC2620271,2008/10/10 09:00,2009/03/05 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2105-9-425 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-9-425 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2008 Oct 9;9:425. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-9-425.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies includes monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, smoldering (asymptomatic) and symptomatic multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and rare plasma cell leukemia and heavy chain diseases. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or smoldering multiple myeloma should be followed closely, but not treated. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, if possible. Melphalan, prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have been used successfully. It is important that family physicians recognize and appropriately treat multiple myeloma complications. Bone pain is treated with opiates, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty; nephrotoxic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. Hypercalcemia is treated with isotonic saline infusions, steroids, furosemide, or bisphosphonates. Because of susceptibility to infections, patients require broad-spectrum antibiotics for febrile illness and immunization against influenza, pneumococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae B. Five-year survival rates approach 33 percent, and the median survival rate is 33 months.","['Nau, Konrad C', 'Lewis, William D']","['Nau KC', 'Lewis WD']","['West Virginia University, Department of Family Medicine, Eastern Division, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia 26425, USA. nauk@rcbhsc.wvu.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am Fam Physician,American family physician,1272646,"['0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (multiple myeloma M-proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/etiology/*therapy', 'Myeloma Proteins/physiology', 'Pain/etiology', 'Plasma Cells/physiology', 'Risk Factors']",,2008/10/10 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Fam Physician. 2008 Oct 1;78(7):853-9.,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis of R-band was used to detect the abnormalities of chromosome 11 in 356 acute myeloid leukemia patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four out of 356 patients (9.55%) had abnormalities of chromosome 11, of which 20 (58.8%) involved in 11q23, 7 (19.9%) had translocations involving 11p15, 5 (14.7%) had-11, and the rest had other abnormalities such as +11, and t(11;14). The incidence of 11q23 involvement in M4 and M5 was higher than other subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Ten cases with 11q23 abnormality had additional cytogenetic aberrations. In 30 cases treated with chemotherapy, 13 cases acquired complete remission (CR). The CR rate was lower than that of whole cases of acute myeloid leukemia(34.3% versus 64.0%). The CR rate of AML with 11q23 abnormality was lower than that of AML with normal karyotype (25% versus 55.6%). In other 10 patients with additional chromosome aberrations, the CR rate was lower than that of AML with 11q23 alone. In 7 patients with translocations at 11p15, only 3 patients acquired CR, and 2 patients relapsed early. Only 2 patients acquired CR in 5 patients with-11. CONCLUSION: 11q23 was a frequent aberration in chromosome 11 anomaly, which was often detected in M4 and M5. It might be associated with the pathogenesis of acute monolytic leukemia. The patients with chromosome 11 anomaly had poorer prognosis.","['Lu, Ying', 'Xu, Weilai', 'Chen, Zhimei', 'Lou, Jiyu', 'Jin, Jie']","['Lu Y', 'Xu W', 'Chen Z', 'Lou J', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, Ningbo First Hospital, Ningbo, Zhejiang 315000, P.R.

This effect is mediated by NK cells because of the lack of activation of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) which recognize HLA-Bw4 and HLA-C alleles. However, conflicting results have been reported about the impact of KIR ligand mismatching on the outcome of unrelated HLA-mismatched hematopoietic stem cells transplants (HSCT) to leukemic patients. The interpretation of these conflicting results is hampered by the scant information about the level of expression of HLA class I alleles on leukemic cells, although this variable may affect the activation of inhibitory KIRs. Therefore in the present study, utilizing a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies we have measured the level of expression of HLA-A, -B and -C alleles on 20 B-chronic lymphoid leukemic (B-CLL) cell preparations, on 16 B-acute lymphoid leukemic (B-ALL) cell preparations and on 19 AML cell preparations. Comparison of the level of HLA class I antigen expression on leukemic cells and autologous normal T cells identified selective downregulation of HLA-A and HLA-B alleles on 15 and 14 of the 20 B-CLL, on 2 and 5 of the 16 B-ALL and on 7 and 11 of the 19 AML patients tested, respectively. Most interestingly HLA-C alleles were markedly downregulated on all three types of leukemic cells; the downregulation was most pronounced on AML cells. The potential functional relevance of these abnormalities is suggested by the dose-dependent enhancement of NK cell activation caused by coating the HLA-HLA-Bw4 epitope with monoclonal antibodies on leukemic cells which express NK cell activating ligands. Our results suggest that besides the HLA and KIR genotype, expression levels of KIR ligands on leukemic cells should be included among the criteria used to select the donor-recipient combinations for HSCT.","['Verheyden, Sonja', 'Ferrone, Soldano', 'Mulder, Arend', 'Claas, Frans H', 'Schots, Rik', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Benoit, Yves', 'Demanet, Christian']","['Verheyden S', 'Ferrone S', 'Mulder A', 'Claas FH', 'Schots R', 'De Moerloose B', 'Benoit Y', 'Demanet C']","['Department of Hematology, HLA and Molecular Hematology Laboratory, Universitair Ziekenhuis Brussel (UZ Brussel), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA138188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA110249/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA110249/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA109688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA113861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA113861/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081008,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-Bw4 antigen)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A Antigens/genetics/metabolism', 'HLA-B Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'HLA-C Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",PMC3426282,2008/10/09 09:00,2009/04/22 09:00,['2008/10/09 09:00'],"['2008/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0601-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Jun;58(6):855-65. doi: 10.1007/s00262-008-0601-7.

Although CBF-AML is associated with a relatively favorable prognosis, only one-half of the patients are cured. Herein we review recent discoveries of genetic and epigenetic alterations in CBF-AML that may represent novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets and lead to improvement of the still disappointing clinical outcome of these patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Several acquired gene mutations and gene-expression and microRNA-expression changes that occur in addition to t(8;21)(q22;q22) and inv(16)(p13q22)/t(16;16)(p13;q22), the cytogenetic hallmarks of CBF-AML, have been recently reported. Alterations that may represent cooperative events in CBF-AML leukemogenesis include mutations in the KIT, FLT3, JAK2 and RAS genes, haploinsufficiency of the putative tumor suppressor genes TLE1 and TLE4 in t(8;21)-positive patients with del(9q), MN1 overexpression in inv(16) patients, and epigenetic and posttranscriptional silencing of CEBPA. Genome-wide gene-expression and microRNA-expression profiling identifying subgroups of CBF-AML patients with distinct molecular signatures, different clinical outcomes, or both, have also been reported. SUMMARY: Progress has been made in delineating the genetic basis of CBF-AML that will likely result in improved prognostication and development of novel, risk-adapted therapeutic approaches.","['Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Mrozek K', 'Marcucci G', 'Paschka P', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1228, USA. krzysztof.mrozek@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA102031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",PMC3677535,2008/10/09 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2008/10/09 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0b013e32831369df [doi]', '00001622-200811000-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2008 Nov;20(6):711-8. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e32831369df.,,,81,['NIHMS202765'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These drugs are structurally related and induce DNA hypomethylation. Aberrant DNA methylation is associated with gene silencing. It is proposed that hypomethylating agents work by inducing reexpression of epigenetically silenced genes. Here, we provide an up-to-date summary of the clinical experience with these drugs. RECENT FINDINGS: 5-Azacitidine and decitabine were approved in the United States based on clinical responses, but no effect on survival was documented. Recent results from a phase III study have indicated that treatment of patients with higher risk MDS with 5-azacitidine results in significant improvement in overall survival. Results of a randomized survival study of decitabine should be available in 2008. Reports of combination epigenetic therapies (a hypomethylating agent with a histone deacetylase inhibitor) indicate that these have significant activity in patients with MDS/acute myelogenous leukemia. Randomized studies are testing the concept that the combinations are superior to single-agent therapy. SUMMARY: Demethylating agents are the standard of care for patients with higher risk MDS and the only agent known to improve the natural history of MDS. Further work in new combination therapies may result in further advances in the care of patients with MDS.","['Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']",['Garcia-Manero G'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. ggarciam@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01 CA108631/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,"['614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Valproic Acid/therapeutic use']",PMC3873866,2008/10/09 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2008/10/09 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CCO.0b013e328313699c [doi]', '00001622-200811000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 2008 Nov;20(6):705-10. doi: 10.1097/CCO.0b013e328313699c.,,,37,['NIHMS202764'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characteristic features are a diminished homeostatic control of blood cell production and a decline in immune functions. It is generally accepted that stromal cells play a basal role in hematopoiesis by providing survival and differentiation signals, by secreting cytokines, or through direct contact with hematopoietic stem cells, thereby supporting the generation and replenishment of hematopoi- etic progenitor cells (HPC). Here we demonstrated that HPC-related colony formation is positively influenced by mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) when grown in co-culture, in particular regarding the number of primary granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units as well as with respect to the average size of the formed colonies. These effects were more pronounced when the MSCs originated from young donors than from old ones. Because leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) plays an important role during hematopoiesis, properties of lin- Sca-1+ cells and MSCs derived from LIF-deficient mice (LIF-/-) were determined both ex vivo and in vitro. LIF-/- animals contain a significantly reduced number of lin- Sca-1+ cells, nevertheless the replating capacity of LIF-/- HPCs was found to be generally unchanged when compared to those from LIF+/+ animals.

With the goal of ultimately developing a proteomic-based classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we assayed leukemia-enriched cells from 256 newly diagnosed AML patients, for 51 total and phosphoproteins from apoptosis, cell-cycle, and signal-transduction pathways, using reverse-phase protein arrays. Expression in matched blood and marrow samples were similar for 44 proteins; another 7 had small fold changes (8%-55%), suggesting that functional proteomics of leukemia-enriched cells in the marrow and periphery are similar. Protein expression patterns were independent of clinical characteristics. However, 24 proteins were significantly different between French-American-British subtypes, defining distinct signatures for each. Expression signatures for AML with cytogenetic abnormalities involving -5 or -7 were similar suggesting mechanistic commonalities. Distinct expression patterns for FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication were also identified. Principal component analysis defined 7 protein signature groups, with prognostic information distinct from cytogenetics that correlated with remission attainment, relapse, and overall survival. In conclusion, protein expression profiling patterns in AML correlate with known morphologic features, cytogenetics, and outcome. Confirmation in independent studies may also provide pathophysiologic insights facilitating triage of patients to emerging targeted therapies.","['Kornblau, Steven M', 'Tibes, Raoul', 'Qiu, Yi Hua', 'Chen, Wenjing', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Mills, Gordon B']","['Kornblau SM', 'Tibes R', 'Qiu YH', 'Chen W', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Andreeff M', 'Coombes KR', 'Mills GB']","['Departments of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas M.

Here, we present a crystal structure of WDR5 bound to an MLL peptide. Surprisingly, we find that WDR5 utilizes the same pocket shown to bind histone H3 for this MLL interaction. Furthermore, the WDR5-MLL interaction is disrupted preferentially by mono- and di-methylated Lys-4 histone H3 over unmodified and tri-methylated Lys-4 histone H3. These data implicate a delicate interplay between the effector, WDR5, the catalytic subunit, MLL, and the substrate, histone H3, of the MLL complex. We suggest that the activity of the MLL complex might be regulated through this interplay.","['Song, Ji-Joon', 'Kingston, Robert E']","['Song JJ', 'Kingston RE']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 EB009998/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081007,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance']",PMC2596411,2008/10/09 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/10/09 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)63348-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M806900200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Dec 12;283(50):35258-64. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M806900200.

The apoptotic process in these cells was produced by trichostatin A (TSA) that is a histone deacetylase inhibitor with strong cytostatic effects. The selected TSA concentration added to cultures facilitated to study apoptotic and not-apoptotic cells in one and the same specimen. The nucleolar diameter and density were determined using computer assisted measurement and densitometry in specimens stained for RNA. In comparison with not-apoptotic cells, in apoptotic cells, nucleolar mean diameter did not change significantly and nucleolar RNA density was also not apparently different. On the other hand, the cytoplasmic RNA density in apoptotic cells was markedly reduced. Thus it seemed to be possible that the transcribed RNA remained ""frozen""within the nucleolus but its transport to the cytoplasm decreased or stopped. However, the possibility of the RNA degradation in the cytoplasm of apoptotic cells based on the present study cannot be eliminated. At this occasion it should be added that AgNORs reflecting nucleolar biosynthetic and cell proliferation activity in apoptotic cells decreased in number or disappeared. The presented results also indicated that large nucleoli intensely stained for RNA need not be necessarily related to the high nucleolar biosynthetic or cell proliferation activity and may be also present in apoptotic cells responding to the cytostatic treatment.","['Smetana, Karel', 'Zapotocky, M', 'Starkova, J', 'Trka, J']","['Smetana K', 'Zapotocky M', 'Starkova J', 'Trka J']","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Unemocnice 1, Prague 2, Czech Republic 128 20. karel.smetana@uhkt.cz']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur J Histochem,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,9207930,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (nucleolar organizer region associated proteins)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/analysis/ultrastructure', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleolus/chemistry/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'RNA/analysis']",,2008/10/09 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/10/09 09:00'],"['2008/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4081/1204 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Histochem. 2008 Jul-Sep;52(3):143-8. doi: 10.4081/1204.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological studies have suggested that insufficient host T cell response to HTLV-I is a potential risk factor for ATL. To understand the relationship between host T cell response and HTLV-I pathogenesis in a rat model system, we have developed an activation and detection system of HTLV-I Tax-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) by Epitope expressing Single-Chain Trimers (SCTs) of MHC class I. RESULTS: We have established expression vectors which encode SCTs of rat MHC-I (RT1.Al) with Tax180-188 peptide. Human cell lines transfected with the established expression vectors were able to induce IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha production by a Tax180-188-specific CTL line, 4O1/C8. We have further fused the C-terminus of SCTs to EGFP and established cells expressing SCT-EGFP fusion protein on the surface. By co-cultivating the cells with 4O1/C8, we have confirmed that the epitope-specific CTLs acquired SCT-EGFP fusion proteins and that these EGFP-possessed CTLs were detectable by flow cytometric analysis. CONCLUSION: We have generated a SCT of rat MHC-I linked to Tax epitope peptide, which can be applicable for the induction of Tax-specific CTLs in rat model systems of HTLV-I infection. We have also established a detection system of Tax-specific CTLs by using cells expressing SCTs fused with EGFP. These systems will be useful tools in understanding the role of HTLV-I specific CTLs in HTLV-I pathogenesis.","['Ohashi, Takashi', 'Nagai, Mika', 'Okada, Hiroyuki', 'Takayanagi, Ryo', 'Shida, Hisatoshi']","['Ohashi T', 'Nagai M', 'Okada H', 'Takayanagi R', 'Shida H']","['Division of Molecular Virology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan. ohashi-t@igm.hokudai.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081008,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/immunology', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/virology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC2579301,2008/10/09 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-90 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-90 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Oct 8;5:90. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their structures were confirmed by (1)H NMR, LCMS and IR analyses. The antiproliferative effect of these compounds were determined against human leukemia, K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and CEM (T-cell leukemia) cells using trypan blue and MTT assay, and the SAR associated with the position of N-terminal substituents in diazaspiro bicyclo hydantoin have also been discussed. It has been observed that these compounds displayed strong, moderate and weak cytotoxic activities. Interestingly, compounds having electron withdrawing groups at third and fourth position of the phenyl ring displayed selectively cytotoxic activities to both the cell lines tested with IC(50) value lower than 50 muM. In addition, the cytotoxic activities of the compounds 7(a-o) bearing the substituents at N-3 position of diazaspiro bicyclo hydantoin increases in the order alkene > ester > ether and plays an important role in determining their antitumor activities. The position and number of substituents in benzyl group attached to N-8 of diazaspiro bicyclo hydantoin nucleus interacted selectively with specific targets leading to the difference of biochemical and pharmacological effects.","['Ananda Kumar, C S', 'Kavitha, C V', 'Vinaya, K', 'Benaka Prasad, S B', 'Thimmegowda, N R', 'Chandrappa, S', 'Raghavan, Sathees C', 'Rangappa, K S']","['Ananda Kumar CS', 'Kavitha CV', 'Vinaya K', 'Benaka Prasad SB', 'Thimmegowda NR', 'Chandrappa S', 'Raghavan SC', 'Rangappa KS']","['Department of Studies in Chemistry, University of Mysore, Mysore, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081007,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydantoins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Hydantoins/administration & dosage/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/10/01 06:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10637-008-9179-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2009 Aug;27(4):327-37. doi: 10.1007/s10637-008-9179-3.

The aim of this work is to study the frequency of AML1/ETO fusion gene in a series of Egyptian childhood AML cases. The clinical significance and prognostic implications of this aberration, including CR rate, duration of first CR, extramedullary leukemia (EML), and survival are investigated as well. Peripheral blood and/or bone marrow mononuclear cells were available for analysis from 78 children, all newly diagnosed with AML. AML1/ ETO fusion transcript was detected by the reverse transcriptase- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. Patients with de novo AML were treated by 2 courses of induction chemotherapy, followed by 4 courses of consolidation treatment if the patient achieved complete remission (CR). The marrow status was evaluated after each course in order to check bone marrow cellularity and presence of blasts. Patients with less than 5% blasts by the end of the second course of ADE passed to consolidation chemotherapy. Patients with more than 5% blasts by the end of the second course of ADE were excluded from the study. The AML1/ETO fusion transcript was detected by a singleround RT-PCR reaction and was found to be expressed in 15 out of 78 cases (19.2%). AML1/ETO positive patients were 7 girls and 8 boys, with ages ranging from 5 to 15 years. Seven cases (46.67%) belonged to FAB subtype M1, 7 (46.67%) M2, while only one case (6.67%) belonged to M5a subtype. Their total leukocytic counts ranged from 7.1 to 183.0 x 109/l with a median of 21.0 x 109/l. Their hemoglobin concentrations ranged from 4.8 to 10.3g/dl with a median of 7.4g/dl, while their platelet counts ranged from 6.0 to 96.0 x 109/l with a median of 25.5 x 109/l. Lymph nodes were enlarged in 8/15 cases (53.34%), hepatomegly was observed in 4/15 cases (26.67%), splenomegaly in 8/15 cases (53.34%), purpura in 6/15 cases (40%), while pallor was observed in all fifteen cases.Extramedullary leukemia occurred in 4/15 cases (26.67%). As regards the fate of the positive cases, thirteen cases (86.67%) attained complete remission (CR) following induction chemotherapy. Two patients (13.33%) died during induction in active disease. Eight patients were in complete continuous remission (CCR), four patients (26.67%) relapsed and died during relapse, and one patient (6.67%) died in complete remission due to severe neutropenia and infection. On comparing the AML1/ETO fusion gene status with overall survival, no significant difference was found between AML1/ETO positive and negative cases. Likewise, no difference could be found between positive and negative cases as regards disease-free survival (p=0.354). In conclusion, we report a frequency of 19.2% of AML1/ETO fusion gene in our newly diagnosed pediatric AML cases. Positive cases showed good response to induction therapy, as well as high complete remission rates, which are features of good prognosis.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, double blind, crossover study. SETTING: Pediatric Sedation Program. PATIENTS: Children with acute leukemia or lymphoma receiving sedation for lumbar puncture. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient received two sedations in random order, one with propofol/placebo and one with propofol/fentanyl. The study investigator and patient/parent were blinded to placebo or fentanyl. Data collected included patient age and diagnosis, propofol dose and adverse events. Adverse events included oxygen saturation <94%, airway obstruction, apnea, hypotension, and bradycardia (<5% mean for age). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess probability of adverse events and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank and McNemar's tests were used for paired comparisons. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were enrolled. Fourteen patients were male and eight were female. Each patient was studied twice for a total of 44 sedations. The median age was 5.0 yrs (range, 2.2-17.2 yrs). All procedures were successfully completed. The median total dose of propofol was 5.05 mg/kg (range, 2.4-10.2 mg/kg) for propofol/placebo vs. 3.00 mg/kg (range 1.4-10.5 mg/kg) for propofol/fentanyl (p < 0.001). Twelve adverse events occurred in 11 of 22 patients (50.0%) propofol/placebo compared with 6 of 22 (18.2%) propofol/fentanyl (p = 0.02). The most common adverse event was hypotension. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of propofol and fentanyl vs. propofol alone for lumbar puncture sedation in children with acute hematologic malignancies resulted in lower propofol doses and fewer adverse events.","['Hollman, Gregory A', 'Schultz, Meredith M', 'Eickhoff, Jens C', 'Christenson, Devon K']","['Hollman GA', 'Schultz MM', 'Eickhoff JC', 'Christenson DK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Wisconsin Children's Hospital, Madison, WI, USA. ghollman@pediatrics.wisc.edu""]",['eng'],"['M01 RR003186-17/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR003186-21/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR003186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR003186-22/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR003186-20/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR003186-14/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01RR03186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR003186-16/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Crit Care Med,Pediatric critical care medicine : a journal of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies,100954653,"['0 (Adjuvants, Anesthesia)', '0 (Anesthetics, Intravenous)', 'UF599785JZ (Fentanyl)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Anesthesia/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Adolescent', 'Anesthetics, Intravenous/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fentanyl/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Propofol/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Spinal Puncture']",PMC3076743,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/02/24 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818e3ad3 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Crit Care Med. 2008 Nov;9(6):616-22. doi: 10.1097/PCC.0b013e31818e3ad3.,,,,['NIHMS224940'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In mature lymphoid neoplasms, receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed CD20 to be the most sensitive, and CD20 and CD79a the most specific markers for B-lineage derivation. CD19 had the weakest specificity, because it was expressed in 3 T-cell lymphomas, but its sensitivity was better than CD79a. In Hodgkin lymphoma cases, the presence of B-cell markers in Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells decreased in the following order: PAX5>CD20>CD79a>CD19. CD19 and PAX5 were not detectable in myelomas. In acute leukemia, CD20 turned to be the most specific, and PAX5 and CD19 the most sensitive markers for B-lineage derivation. In conclusion, an optimal B-cell lineage panel for daily routine on paraffin-embedded tissues should consist of CD20 and CD79a, and eventually, PAX5 for mature lymphoid neoplasms and PAX5 and CD19, and eventually, CD20 in (acute) precursor cell leukemias, because they cover most of the sensitivity and specificity needed.","['Adams, Heiner', 'Liebisch, Peter', 'Schmid, Patrik', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Tzankov, Alexandar']","['Adams H', 'Liebisch P', 'Schmid P', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Tzankov A']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD79 Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Microarray Analysis', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/08/19 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0b013e3181845ef4 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2009 Mar;17(2):96-101. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0b013e3181845ef4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used a rat model in which B acute lymphoblastic leukemia is chemically induced by a nitrosurea derivative. From the onset of the chemical treatment, the animals were also exposed to ELF-MFs (100 microT, sinusoidal 50 Hz MFs), with or without harmonics. The experiment was conducted on 280 rats. We compared body weight and survival time, percentage of bone marrow blast cells, cumulative incidence of leukemia and type of leukemia in the unexposed groups and in the groups exposed to 50 Hz MFs, with and without harmonics.

We assessed the principal mode of inactivation in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and frequency in biologically relevant subgroups. Mutation or methylation was rare, whereas genomic deletion occurred in 21% of B-cell precursor ALL and 50% of T-ALL patients. Single nucleotide polymorphism arrays revealed copy number neutral (CNN) loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 8% of patients. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization demonstrated that the mean size of deletions was 14.8 Mb and biallelic deletions composed a large and small deletion (mean sizes, 23.3 Mb and 1.4 Mb). Among 86 patients, only 2 small deletions were below the resolution of detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Patients with high hyperdiploidy, ETV6-RUNX1, or 11q23/MLL rearrangements had low rates of deletion (11%, 15%, 13%), whereas patients with t(9;22), t(1;19), TLX3, or TLX1 rearrangements had higher frequencies (61%, 42%, 78%, and 89%). In conclusion, CDKN2A deletion is a significant secondary abnormality in childhood ALL strongly correlated with phenotype and genotype. The variation in the incidence of CDKN2A deletions by cytogenetic subgroup may explain its inconsistent association with outcome. CNN LOH without apparent CDKN2A inactivation suggests the presence of other relevant genes in this region.","['Sulong, Sarina', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Irving, Julie A E', 'Strefford, Jonathan C', 'Konn, Zoe J', 'Case, Marian C', 'Minto, Lynne', 'Barber, Kerry E', 'Parker, Helen', 'Wright, Sarah L', 'Stewart, Adam R M', 'Bailey, Simon', 'Bown, Nick P', 'Hall, Andrew G', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Sulong S', 'Moorman AV', 'Irving JA', 'Strefford JC', 'Konn ZJ', 'Case MC', 'Minto L', 'Barber KE', 'Parker H', 'Wright SL', 'Stewart AR', 'Bailey S', 'Bown NP', 'Hall AG', 'Harrison CJ']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Queen Victoria Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20081006,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)'],IM,"['Child', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, p16', 'Genomics', 'Human Growth Hormone', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Incidence', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/*pathology']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37919-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-166801 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 1;113(1):100-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-07-166801.

We have established a genetically defined differentiation model in human leukemia K562 cells by conditional expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor p27 (inducible by Zn(2+)) and Myc (activatable by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen). Induction of p27 resulted in erythroid differentiation, accompanied by Cdk inhibition and G(1) arrest. Interestingly, activation of Myc inhibited p27-mediated erythroid differentiation without affecting p27-mediated proliferation arrest. Microarray-based gene expression indicated that, in the presence of p27, Myc blocked the upregulation of several erythroid-cell-specific genes, including NFE2, JUNB, and GATA1 (transcription factors with a pivotal role in erythropoiesis). Moreover, Myc also blocked the upregulation of Mad1, a transcriptional antagonist of Myc that is able to induce erythroid differentiation. Cotransfection experiments demonstrated that Myc-mediated inhibition of differentiation is partly dependent on the repression of Mad1 and GATA1. In conclusion, this model demonstrates that Myc-mediated inhibition of differentiation depends on the regulation of a specific gene program, whereas it is independent of p27-mediated cell cycle arrest. Our results support the hypothesis that differentiation inhibition is an important Myc tumorigenic mechanism that is independent of cell proliferation.","['Acosta, Juan C', 'Ferrandiz, Nuria', 'Bretones, Gabriel', 'Torrano, Veronica', 'Blanco, Rosa', 'Richard, Carlos', ""O'Connell, Brenda"", 'Sedivy, John', 'Delgado, M Dolores', 'Leon, Javier']","['Acosta JC', 'Ferrandiz N', 'Bretones G', 'Torrano V', 'Blanco R', 'Richard C', ""O'Connell B"", 'Sedivy J', 'Delgado MD', 'Leon J']","['Cancer Molecular Biology Group, Department of Molecular Biology, Instituto de Biomedicina y Biotecnologia de Cantabria, Universidad de Cantabria-CSIC-IDICAN, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081006,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (MAD1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Leukemia', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",PMC2593424,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00752-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00752-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Dec;28(24):7286-95. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00752-08.

APRIL (A Proliferation Inducing Ligand) is a member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily that plays a key role in normal B-cell development, while promoting survival and proliferation of malignant B cells. We investigated APRIL expression and activity in acute myeloid leukemia. We found that APRIL mRNA and protein, including the secreted form, are expressed in leukemic cells of patients with M0, M2 and M4 acute myeloid leukemia subtypes but not in normal hematopoietic progenitors. Retrovirus-mediated APRIL expression in normal hematopoietic progenitors confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis. Conversely, blocking APRIL function by recombinant soluble APRIL receptors increased chemotherapeutic drugs-induced cell adeath in acute myeloid leukemia cells. These results indicate that APRIL acts in an autocrine fashion to protect acute myeloid leukemia cells from drug-induced death and foresee a therapeutic potential of APRIL antagonists in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Bonci, Desiree', 'Musumeci, Maria', 'Coppola, Valeria', 'Addario, Antonio', 'Conticello, Concetta', 'Hahne, Michael', 'Gulisano, Massimo', 'Grignani, Francesco', 'De Maria, Ruggero']","['Bonci D', 'Musumeci M', 'Coppola V', 'Addario A', 'Conticello C', 'Hahne M', 'Gulisano M', 'Grignani F', 'De Maria R']","['Dept. of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081006,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Autocrine Communication', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 13/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13035 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13035 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Dec;93(12):1899-902. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13035.

In patients with advanced phase of the disease, the advent of imatinib significantly increased survival. However, few long-term data, based on large, prospective and controlled trials are available on the outcome of these patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II trial of imatinib 600 mg daily in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. The return to chronic phase was defined as <15% blasts and <30% blasts plus promyelocytes in blood or bone marrow and <20% peripheral basophils. A complete hematologic response required the normalization of platelet and white cell differential counts and absence of extramedullary involvement. Cytogenetic response was assessed by the standard banding technique and rated as usual. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were enrolled (20 with lymphoid blast crisis and 72 with myeloid blast crisis). Forty-six patients (50%) returned to chronic phase, and 24 patients (26%) achieved also a complete hematologic response. Sixteen patients (17%) had a cytogenetic response (9 complete, 1 partial, and 6 minor or minimal). The complete cytogenetic response was subsequently lost by all but two patients between 2 and 12 months after first having achieved it: the median duration of complete cytogenetic response was 7 months. All responses were sustained for a minimum of 4 weeks. The median survival of all the patients was 7 months. After a median observation time of 66 months, seven (8%) patients are alive. Three of these patients are on imatinib treatment (1 in complete hematologic remission, 1 in partial cytogenetic response and 1 in complete cytogenetic remission). Three patients are in complete remission after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. One patient is alive in blast crisis, on therapy with a second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib was effective and safe in the short-term treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis, but longer-term outcome was not significantly influenced (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00514969).","['Palandri, Francesca', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Luatti, Simona', 'Marzocchi, Giulia', 'Bassi, Simona', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Alimena, Giuliana', 'Pungolino, Ester', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Varaldo, Riccardo', 'Miglino, Maurizio', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Zuffa, Eliana', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Alberti, Daniele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Palandri F', 'Castagnetti F', 'Testoni N', 'Luatti S', 'Marzocchi G', 'Bassi S', 'Breccia M', 'Alimena G', 'Pungolino E', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Varaldo R', 'Miglino M', 'Specchia G', 'Zuffa E', 'Ferrara F', 'Bocchia M', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Alberti D', 'Martinelli G', 'Baccarani M', 'Rosti G']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology L. and A.

Alternative splicing can generate multiple Ikaros isoforms that lack different numbers of exons and have different functions. Shorter isoforms, which lack the amino-terminal domain that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding, exert a dominant negative effect and inhibit the ability of longer heterodimer partners to bind DNA. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a high-throughput capillary electrophoresis sizing method to detect and quantify different Ikaros cDNA transcripts. RESULTS: We demonstrated that Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells expressed high levels of the non-DNA-binding isoform Ik6 that was generated following IKZF1 genomic deletions (19/46 patients, 41%). Furthermore, a recurring 60 bp insertion immediately upstream of exon 5, at the exon 3/exon 5 junction, was frequently detected in the Ik2 and Ik4 isoforms. This insertion occurred either alone or together with an in-frame ten amino acid deletion that was due to a 30 bp loss at the end of exon 7. Both the alterations are due to the selection of alternative cryptic splice sites and have been suggested to cause impaired DNA-binding activity. Non-DNA-binding isoforms were localized in the cytoplasm whereas the DNA-binding isoforms were localized in the nucleus. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that both aberrant splicing and genomic deletion leading to different non-DNA-binding Ikaros cDNA transcripts are common features of Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Zuntini, Roberta', 'Ferrari, Simona', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Baruzzi, Anna', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Berton, Giorgio', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Foa, Robin', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Iacobucci I', 'Lonetti A', 'Cilloni D', 'Messa F', 'Ferrari A', 'Zuntini R', 'Ferrari S', 'Ottaviani E', 'Arruga F', 'Paolini S', 'Papayannidis C', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Soverini S', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Baruzzi A', 'Vignetti M', 'Berton G', 'Vitale A', 'Chiaretti S', 'Muschen M', 'Foa R', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology L. and A.

The favorable cytogenetic acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, i.e., acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16), were predicted with maximum accuracy (positive and negative predictive value: 100%). Mutations in NPM1 and CEBPA were predicted less accurately (positive predictive value: 66% and 100%, and negative predictive value: 99% and 97% respectively). Various other characteristic molecular acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, i.e., mutant FLT3 and RAS, abnormalities involving 11q23, -5/5q-, -7/7q-, abnormalities involving 3q (abn3q) and t(9;22), could not be correctly predicted using gene expression profiling. In conclusion, gene expression profiling allows accurate prediction of certain acute myeloid leukemia subtypes, e.g. those characterized by expression of chimeric transcription factors.

The aim of the present study was to analyze the decisional value of poor risk factors in 416 elderly patients treated in the ALFA-9803 trial in order to derive a decisional index. DESIGN AND METHODS: Standard multivariate analysis was used to identify risk factors for overall survival. Risk factors were then considered as good decision tools if associated with a frequency >10% and a false positive rate <10% in predicting overall survival as poor as observed after low-dose cytarabine therapy (25% survival or less at 12 months). RESULTS: Among six independent risk factors (age, performance status, white blood cell count, hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index, infection at baseline, and cytogenetics), cytogenetics was the only potent, independent decision tool. High hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index scores or infections were found too rarely to guide further decisions. The three other factors (age, performance status, and white cell count) needed to be combined to provide a good specificity. The proposed decisional index, therefore, included high-risk cytogenetics and/or the presence of at least two of the following criteria: age > or =75 years, performance status > or =2, and white cell count > or =50 x 10(9)/L. This simple two-class decisional index, which was validated in an independent patient set, enabled us to discriminate 100 patients (24%) who had an estimated overall survival of only 19% at 12 months, with a good 9% false positive rate. CONCLUSIONS: We propose waiting for cytogenetic information before making treatment decisions in elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Those patients with unfavorable cytogenetics, as well as patients with at least two of the following features, age > or =75 years, performance status > or =2, and white cell count > or =50 x 10(9)/L, should not be considered for standard intensive chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00363025).","['Malfuson, Jean-Valere', 'Etienne, Anne', 'Turlure, Pascal', 'de Revel, Thierry', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Contentin, Nathalie', 'Terre, Christine', 'Rigaudeau, Sophie', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Gardin, Claude', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Malfuson JV', 'Etienne A', 'Turlure P', 'de Revel T', 'Thomas X', 'Contentin N', 'Terre C', 'Rigaudeau S', 'Bordessoule D', 'Vey N', 'Gardin C', 'Dombret H']","[""Department of Hematology, Hopital d'Instruction des Armees, Clamart, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081006,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Decision Making', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Patient Selection', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13309 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13309 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Dec;93(12):1806-13. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13309.

In this study, we evaluated the degree of correlation between pesticide sales in 1985 in eleven Brazilian states and cancer mortality rates during 1996-1998. Information of all cancer deaths occurred in men 30-69 years old from 1996 to 1998 were collected from National Mortality System. Single and multiple linear regression coefficients were obtained to assess the relationship between per capita sales of pesticides in 1985, specific-site cancer mortality rates (prostate, soft tissue, larynx, leukemia, lip, esophagus, lung, pancreas, bladder, liver, testis, stomach, brain, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma) during 1996-1998, and several covariates. In addition, states were stratified into three groups according to tertiles of pesticides sales and cancer mortality rate ratios (MRR) were then calculated using first tertile as reference. Finally, a factor analysis was performed to reveal unapparent relationships between pesticide use and cancer mortality. Pesticide sales showed statistically significant correlation with the mortality rates for the cancers of prostate (r=0.69; p=0.019), soft tissue (r=0.71; p=0.015), leukemia (r=0.68; p=0.021), lip (r=0.73; p=0.010), esophagus (r=0.61; p=0.046), and pancreas (r=0.63; p=0.040). Moderate to weak correlations were observed for the cancers of larynx, lung, testis, bladder, liver, stomach, brain, and NHL and multiple myeloma. In addition, correlation between pesticide sales and specific-site cancer mortality rates was reinforced by multiple regression analysis. For all specific-sites, cancer mortality rates were significantly higher in the states of moderate (2nd tertile) and high (3rd tertile) pesticide sales, with MRR ranging from 1.11 to 5.61. Exploring hidden relationships between pesticide sales and cancer mortality in Brazil, through a factor analysis, revealed that affluence; public policies and lifestyle behaviors may explain almost 70% of the variance of the studied association. The results suggest that population exposure to pesticides in the 1980s in some Brazilian States may have been associated with selected cancer sites observed a decade later.","['Chrisman, Juliana de Rezende', 'Koifman, Sergio', 'de Novaes Sarcinelli, Paula', 'Moreira, Josino Costa', 'Koifman, Rosalina Jorge', 'Meyer, Armando']","['Chrisman Jde R', 'Koifman S', 'de Novaes Sarcinelli P', 'Moreira JC', 'Koifman RJ', 'Meyer A']","['Centro de Estudos da Saude do Trabalhador e Ecologia Humana, Escola Nacional de Saude Publica, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Cells from advanced MDS are resistant to TRAIL. Two isoforms of the Flice inhibitory protein (FLIP) short (FLIPS) and FLIP long (FLIPL), which modulate TRAIL signals, showed disease-stage-dependent differential regulation. Therefore, we aimed at characterizing potential differential effects of FLIPL and FLIPS, on TRAIL and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in model leukemic cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using lentiviral constructs, FLIPL and FLIPS, as well as a green fluorescent protein control were overexpressed in ML-1 cells, which constitutively express very low levels of FLIP and are highly sensitive to apoptosis induction. Cells were then exposed to TRAIL or TNF-alpha, and effects on the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis induction were assessed. RESULTS: Overexpression of FLIP reduced TRAIL and TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in ML-1 cells. However, while FLIPL completely abrogated apoptosis, FLIPS allowed for BID cleavage and caspase-3 activation. Concurrently, there was a decline of Bcl-xL and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in FLIPS cells followed by apoptosis. Further, inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in TNF-alpha-treated cells resulted in profound apoptosis in FLIPS, but not in FLIPL-overexpressing cells, consistent with the observations in patients with early stage MDS. Inhibition of NF-kappaB had only minimal effects on TRAIL signaling. CONCLUSION: Thus, FLIPL and FLIPS exerted differential effects in myeloid leukemic cell lines in response to TRAIL and TNF-alpha. It might be possible to therapeutically exploit those differences with effector molecules specific for the FLIP isoforms.","['Seal, Sudeshna', 'Hockenbery, David M', 'Spaulding, Emily Y', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Abbassi, Nissa', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Seal S', 'Hockenbery DM', 'Spaulding EY', 'Kiem HP', 'Abbassi N', 'Deeg HJ']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Department of Chemistry, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA119599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082941-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA119599-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444-280016/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA119599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20081005,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 3/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/genetics', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/metabolism']",PMC2645417,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00389-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Dec;36(12):1660-72. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.012.

Children with cancer scored themselves more negatively than their parents on all the subscales except scholastic competence, while children with diabetes scored negatively in the area of athletic competence. With regard to family coping, parental hope as well as social and family communication were the most important factors that contributed to better coping in children with leukemia, while parental education and health awareness were integral to better coping in children with diabetes. Awareness of family coping and understanding the domains of self-competence and self-worth, which are vulnerable in children with cancer, can help healthcare providers to target these issues and to offer appropriate psychosocial intervention.","['Eapen, Valsamma', 'Mabrouk, Abdelazim', 'Bin-Othman, Salem']","['Eapen V', 'Mabrouk A', 'Bin-Othman S']","['Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, UAE University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. v.eapen@unsw.edu.au']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', '*Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', '*Social Perception']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['NYAS1138008 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1414.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2008 Sep;1138:47-9. doi: 10.1196/annals.1414.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: The gene chip was used to detect the expression panel of genes of leukaemia cell line K562 treated by dihydroartemisinin. K562 cells were treated with 1 x 10(-5), 4 x 10(-5), 16 x 10(-5), 64 x 10(-5), 256 x 10(-5) mol x L(-1) dihydroartemisinin for 24 h, and then studied the modality changes by invert microscope. The morphological changes of the nucleons were observed by Hoechst33342/PI staining. The cell cycle were examined by flow cytometry analysis (FCM). Total RNA samples were obtained by TRIzol and were reverse transcribed to the cDNA. The cDNA samples were hybridized to our gene chips. Hybridization signal were collected and analyzed following scanning by Gene Pix 4100A. RESULT: The numbers of drift cells were increased and the density of cells was decreased under invert microscope after K562 cells were treated with dihydroartemisinin for 24 h. Morphological changes of cell apoptosis such as karyopyknosis and conglomeration were observed by Hoechst 33342/PI staining. Flow cytometric analysis showed that cells were arrested in G2 phase. There were 13 differentially expressed genes identified. Hybridization analysis showed up-regulation of chk1 and down-regulation of PCNA, cyclinB1, cyclinD1, cyclinE1, cdk4, cdk2, E2F1, DNA-PK, DNA-Topo I, mcl-1, jNK, VEGF in the dihydroartemisinin-treated K562 cells. CONCLUSION: Dihydroartemisinin can Inhibit the leukaemia cell line K562 and exert its anti-cancer effect by altering the expression of these genes involved in cell cycle; dihydroartemisinin may act via apoptosis pathway.","['Yao, Li', 'Xie, Hong', 'Jin, Qiu-Yue', 'Hu, Wen-Liang', 'Chen, Li-Jun']","['Yao L', 'Xie H', 'Jin QY', 'Hu WL', 'Chen LJ']","[""Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of the Chinese People's Armed Police Forces, Tianjin 300162, China.""]",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '6A9O50735X (artenimol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Artemisinins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Microscopy', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA/analysis/isolation & purification']",,2008/10/08 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2008/10/08 09:00'],"['2008/10/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2008 Jul;33(13):1583-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, updated childhood and adolescent cancer survival statistics are presented, overall and among demographic subgroups, including Hispanics, for whom to the authors' knowledge national rates have not been previously reported. These results extend those provided by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in their detail and interpretation. METHODS: Survival trends of primary cancers in children and adolescents (ages birth to 19 years) were evaluated using SEER 9 data. Five-year and 10-year relative survival rates across 5-year (1975-1979, 1985-1989, and 1995-1999) and 10-year (1975-1984 and 1985-1994) cohorts were compared via Z-tests. Annual percent change (APC) in survival was computed via weighted least-squares regression. Rates in Hispanic children and adolescents were compared with those in non-Hispanic whites and blacks (SEER 13, 1995-1999). RESULTS: Five-year survival rates increased significantly overall (1975-1979: 63% vs 1995-1999: 79%; P< .0001) and for nearly all histologic types examined; increases were greatest for ependymoma (+37%; P< .0001) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (+34%; P< .0001). Hispanic children and adolescents had somewhat poorer 5-year rates than non-Hispanic whites overall (74% vs 81%; P< .0001) and for Ewing sarcoma, leukemia, central nervous system tumors, and melanoma. Ten-year rates also increased significantly overall (1975-1984: 61% vs 1985-1994: 72%; P< .0001) and for a majority of cancer types. The largest improvements were noted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (+19%; P< .0001) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (+19%; P< .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Observed trends reinforce the need for resources devoted to advancing treatment modalities, reducing disparities among racial/ethnic groups and adolescents, and providing long-term care of survivors.","['Linabery, Amy M', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Linabery AM', 'Ross JA']","['Division of Pediatric Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 CA099936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA099936-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blacks/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Mortality/ethnology/*trends', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*ethnology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'United States/ethnology', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC2765225,2008/10/07 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23866 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Nov 1;113(9):2575-96. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23866.,,,,['NIHMS70883'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, depending on the expertise of the operator minimal residual disease (MRD) can be misidentified, given that data analysis is based on the definition of expert-based bidimensional plots, where an operator selects the subpopulations of interest. Here, we propose and evaluate a probabilistic approach based on pattern classification tools and the Bayes theorem, for automated analysis of flow cytometry data from a group of 50 B-CLPD versus normal peripheral blood B-cells under MRD conditions, with the aim of reducing operator-associated subjectivity. The proposed approach provided a tool for MRD detection in B-CLPD by flow cytometry with a sensitivity of < or =8 x 10(-5) (median of < or =2 x 10(-7)). Furthermore, in 86% of B-CLPD cases tested, no events corresponding to normal B-cells were wrongly identified as belonging to the neoplastic B-cell population at a level of < or =10(-7). Thus, this approach based on the search for minimal numbers of neoplastic B-cells similar to those detected at diagnosis could potentially be applied with both a high sensitivity and specificity to investigate for the presence of MRD in virtually all B-CLPD. Further studies evaluating its efficiency in larger series of patients, where reactive conditions and non-neoplastic disorders are also included, are required to confirm these results.","['Pedreira, C E', 'Costa, E S', 'Almeida, J', 'Fernandez, C', 'Quijano, S', 'Flores, J', 'Barrena, S', 'Lecrevisse, Q', 'Van Dongen, J J M', 'Orfao, A']","['Pedreira CE', 'Costa ES', 'Almeida J', 'Fernandez C', 'Quijano S', 'Flores J', 'Barrena S', 'Lecrevisse Q', 'Van Dongen JJ', 'Orfao A']","['Faculty of Medicine and COPPE-PEE Engineering Graduate Program, UFRJ/Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cytometry A,Cytometry.

We examined the plasma pharmacokinetics of AraC and its deamination product uracil arabinoside (AraU) in four patients with AML and concomitant severe renal insufficiency after treatment with AraC. Additionally, in one of these patients the concentration of intracellular AraCTP, the active metabolite of AraC, was analysed. Patients 2 and 3 were treated with AraC 1.0 g/m(2) infused for 3 h at 12-h intervals on days 1-4. Patient 1 received the same schedule of AraC with 0.5 g/m(2) and patient 4 with 0.25 g/m(2) AraC. Plasma concentrations of AraC, AraU and the intracellular concentration of AraCTP were analysed at different time points using HPLC. AraC pharmacokinetics in patients with severe renal insufficiency was comparable to patients with normal renal function. Peak plasma levels as well as intracellular AraCTP kinetics were also not significantly influenced by renal dysfunction. As expected from the high dose AraC pharmacokinetic parameters, the AraU serum levels accumulated during treatment. Under the conditions of renal impairment, AraU half-life was about 75 h and the AUC was about 12-fold higher than for patients with normal renal function.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: A 6-year-old boy was admitted with bilaterally enlarged kidneys and severe renal impairment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral renal enlargement with features suggestive of an infiltrative lesion. Accordingly, bone marrow examination was performed, and diagnosis of ALL was made. The patient developed acute renal failure after initiation of chemotherapy, so he received hemodialysis. His renal function normalized and kidney enlargement regressed. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates an unusual early renal involvement in ALL in a child.

Their expression is endogenous, but is also induced by signals from the microenvironment resulting in intrinsic and extrinsic drug resistance. Because AT-101 binds to the BH3 motif of all Bcl-2-family antiapoptotic proteins, we hypothesized that this molecule could overcome resistance. AT-101 treatment (20 microM for 24 hours) resulted in a median 72% apoptosis in CLL cells (patients; n = 32, P < .001). Stromal cells protected CLL B cells from spontaneous and fludarabine-induced apoptosis (P = .003) by increasing the Mcl-1 protein levels. However, AT-101 induced similar extent of down-regulation of Mcl-1 and apoptosis in CLL lymphocytes cultured in suspension or on stroma (P = .999). Stromal cells expressed undetectable levels of antiapoptotic but high levels of activated ERK and AKT proteins and had low or no apoptosis with AT-101. Collectively, these data demonstrate that AT-101 induces apoptosis in CLL B cells and overcomes microenvironment-mediated resistance while sparing normal stromal cells.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Wierda, William G', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Burger JA', 'Wierda WG', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

Studies on this compound have illuminated potentials and problems of kinase inhibitors in the treatment of cancer. As found in crystal structures, STI571-bound Abelson kinase (abl) is believed to form closed conformation with N-terminal regulatory domains. Here we present evidence of distinct STI571-induced modulation of abl functions using high-resolution live-cell imaging approaches. Within lamellipodia of fibroblast cells, STI571 was found to induce rapid translocation of abl to the lamellipodium tip. Quantitative analysis yielded 0.81 and 1.8 microM for EC(50) values of STI571-induced cell edge translocation of abl-KD-green fluorescent protein (GFP) and wild-type abl-GFP, respectively. It also revealed adverse response of drug-resistant abl-T334I to STI571, suggesting that drug binding to abl-GFP triggers translocation. N-myristoylation and the src homology 3 (SH3) domain were required for this translocation, whereas disruption of intramolecular interactions of these motifs enhanced cell-edge association of abl. An intact C-terminal last exon region in abl, but not its F-actin binding, was required for efficient cell-edge translocation. Moreover, single-molecule observation revealed an STI571-induced rapid increase in slow diffusive species of abl in both the tip and the body region of lamellipodia. These results suggest that although activated abl translocates to the cell edge at its open state, STI571 can also bind and lock abl in the open and membrane-tethered conformation as long as the SH3 domain and the C-terminal region are intact. High-resolution imaging can be a powerful tool for elucidating inhibitor modulation of abl functions under intracellular environment.","['Fujita, Akiko', 'Shishido, Tomoyuki', 'Yuan, Yunfeng', 'Inamoto, Eiji', 'Narumiya, Shuh', 'Watanabe, Naoki']","['Fujita A', 'Shishido T', 'Yuan Y', 'Inamoto E', 'Narumiya S', 'Watanabe N']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081003,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Myristic Acid/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Xenopus laevis/metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2009/01/27 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.108.051706 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.108.051706 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2009 Jan;75(1):75-84. doi: 10.1124/mol.108.051706.

Likewise, the frequency and the prognostic significance in pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the newly characterized NUP214-ABL1 fusion transcript is not yet clear. DESIGN AND METHODS: Two hundred children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia were treated in the French FRALLE-93 study from 1993 to 1999. The expression of TLX3, TLX1 and SILTAL1 genes was analyzed in samples from 92 patients by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Most of these samples were further studied for NUP214-ABL1 and CALM-AF10 fusion transcripts. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 7.9 years. At 5 years the overall survival (+/- standard deviation, %) was 62 (+/-3%) and leukemia-free survival was 58 (+/-3%). Patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia positive for TLX3 had a poorer survival compared to those with T-ALL negative for TLX3 (overall survival: 45+/-11% vs. 57+/-5%, p=0.049). In multivariate analysis, TLX3 expression was an independent adverse risk factor predicting relapse with a hazard ratio of 2.44 (p=0.017) and an overall survival with a hazard ratio of 3.7 (p=0.001). NUP214-ABL1 was expressed in 16.6% of patients with TLX3-positive T-ALL (3 of 18); all of the patients with this association died before completion of the treatment. SILTAL expression did not significantly affect the prognosis of patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Only three of 92 patients expressed the TLX1 gene and all three are alive. CONCLUSIONS: TLX3 gene expression is an independent risk factor predicting poor survival in childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. When co-expressed with TLX3, NUP214-ABL1 transcripts may increase the risk of poor survival.","['Ballerini, Paola', 'Landman-Parker, Judith', 'Cayuela, Jean Michel', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Gandemer, Virginie', 'Perel, Yves', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Schmitt, Claudine', 'Fasola, Sylvie', 'Hagemejier, Anne', 'Sigaux, Francois', 'Auclerc, Marie Francoise', 'Douay, Luc', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Baruchel, Andre']","['Ballerini P', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Cayuela JM', 'Asnafi V', 'Labopin M', 'Gandemer V', 'Perel Y', 'Michel G', 'Leblanc T', 'Schmitt C', 'Fasola S', 'Hagemejier A', 'Sigaux F', 'Auclerc MF', 'Douay L', 'Leverger G', 'Baruchel A']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital A.

In these complexes, the dithiocarbamato ligand coordinates to Pt(II) or Pd(II) center as bidentate with two sulfur atoms. These complexes show 50% cytotoxic concentration (Cc(50)) values against chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line, K562, much lower than that of cisplatin. The interaction of these complexes with calf thymus DNA was extensively investigated by a variety of spectroscopic techniques. These studies showed that both complexes presumably intercalate in DNA. UV-vis studies imply that they cooperatively bind with DNA and unexpectedly denature the DNA at very low concentrations (approximately 100 microL). Palladium complex breaks the DNA into two unequal fragments and binds stronger to the lighter fragment than to the heavier one. In the interaction studies between the Pt(II) and Pd(II) complexes with DNA, several binding and thermodynamic parameters have been determined, which may provide deeper insights into the mechanism of action of these types of complexes with nucleic acids.","['Mansouri-Torshizi, Hassan', 'I-Moghaddam, Mahboube', 'Divsalar, Adeleh', 'Saboury, Ali-Akbar']","['Mansouri-Torshizi H', 'I-Moghaddam M', 'Divsalar A', 'Saboury AA']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Sistan & Baluchestan, Daneshgah Street, Zahedan, Iran. hmtorshizi@hamoon.usb.ac.ir']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080809,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', ""551W113ZEP (2,2'-Dipyridyl)"", '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '91080-16-9 (calf thymus DNA)']",IM,"[""2,2'-Dipyridyl/analogs & derivatives/chemistry"", 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Circular Dichroism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Organometallic Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Palladium/*chemistry', 'Platinum/*chemistry', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(08)00737-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2008.08.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2008 Nov 1;16(21):9616-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2008.08.021.

To date, there is no data on tolerability of caspofungin in ICU patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate caspofungine tolerability in critical care patients. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Over a 36-month period, 1430 patients were admitted in a general intensive care unit. All patients data were collected in a prospective database. All the clinical or biological side effects reported in the multicentric studies were required. The patients were laminated in two groups, according to the initial hepatic function. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients were treated with caspofungin (5.1%) and 58% were immunocompromised. Immunosuppression was due to acute leukemia (30%), solid organ transplant (20%) or other causes of immunosuppression. In this group, SAPS2 was higher (51+/-20 versus 44+/-20; p<0.05) as mortality rate was (60% versus 23%). More than 90% of patients were ventilated and 55% needed extrarenal therapy. Caspofungin treatment was initiated for aspergillosis in 12 patients, candidiasis in 33 patients and others indications. Partial or complete response to treatment was 72%. Median duration of caspofungin administration was 11 days, no liver dysfunction or acute renal failure due to caspofungin was reported whatever initial liver function was. CONCLUSION: This prospective open study demonstrate the very low toxicity of caspofungin even in critical care patients.","['Constantin, J-M', 'Roszyk, L', 'Guerin, R', 'Bannier, F', 'Chartier, C', 'Perbet, S', 'Futier, E', 'Cayot-Constantin, S', 'Sapin, V', 'Bazin, J-E']","['Constantin JM', 'Roszyk L', 'Guerin R', 'Bannier F', 'Chartier C', 'Perbet S', 'Futier E', 'Cayot-Constantin S', 'Sapin V', 'Bazin JE']","['Pole anesthesie-reanimation, service de reanimation adulte, hopital Hotel-Dieu, CHU de Clermont-Ferrand, boulevard Leon-Malfreyt, 63058 Clermont-Ferrand, France. jmconstantin@chu-clermontferrand.fr']",['fre'],,"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20081005,France,Ann Fr Anesth Reanim,Annales francaises d'anesthesie et de reanimation,8213275,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Antifungal Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Caspofungin', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Critical Care', 'Drug Eruptions/epidemiology/etiology', 'Echinocandins/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*drug therapy', 'Pain/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Postoperative Complications/drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0750-7658(08)00433-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.annfar.2008.06.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Fr Anesth Reanim. 2008 Oct;27(10):819-24. doi: 10.1016/j.annfar.2008.06.013.

Its expression is induced by various apoptotic stimuli, including irradiation and cytokine withdrawal. Using an inducible system to express Puma, we investigated the nature of Puma-induced apoptosis. In BaF(3) cells, expression of Puma caused rapid caspase-mediated cleavage of ICAD (inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease) and Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia 1), leading to complete loss of cell viability. Surprisingly, Puma protein levels peaked within 2 h of its induction and subsequently declined to basal levels. Maximal Puma abundance coincided with the onset of caspase activity. Subsequent loss of Puma was prevented by the inhibition of caspases, indicating that its degradation was caspase dependent. In cells expressing transfected Bcl-2, induced Puma reached significantly higher levels, but after a delay, caspases became active and cell death occurred. Puma co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 but not Bax and Bak, suggesting that Puma did not associate with either Bax or Bak in these cells to initiate cell death. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), the amount of Puma peaked within 4 h of its induction. In contrast, in bax/bak double-knockout MEFs, Puma was stably expressed following its induction and was unable to trigger apoptosis even at very high levels. Overexpression of Bcl-2 in wild-type MEFs, like in BaF(3) cells, resulted in higher levels of Puma being reached but did not prevent cell death from occurring. These results demonstrate that the level of the Bcl-2 prosurvival family sets the threshold at which Puma is able to indirectly activate Bax or Bak, leading in turn to activation of caspases that not only cause cell death but also rapidly induce Puma degradation.","['Callus, Bernard A', 'Moujallad, Donia M', 'Silke, John', 'Gerl, Robert', 'Jabbour, Anissa M', 'Ekert, Paul G', 'Vaux, David L']","['Callus BA', 'Moujallad DM', 'Silke J', 'Gerl R', 'Jabbour AM', 'Ekert PG', 'Vaux DL']","['Department of Biochemistry, La Trobe University, Victoria 3086, Australia. b.callus@latrobe.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080925,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/deficiency/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/deficiency/metabolism']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)01168-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.09.041 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Dec 12;384(2):313-23. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.09.041.

To better understand the behavior of BCR-ABL in pluripotent stem cells, we previously developed a murine embryonic stem (ES) cell model transformed by p210-BCR-ABL and reported that BCR-ABL activates STAT3, a major protein involved in ES cells self-renewal, which leads specifically to inhibition of ES cells differentiation. We show here that BCR-ABL either inhibits differentiation or, unexpectedly, induces a rapid commitment to differentiation of murine ES cells, according to the intracellular levels of activated STAT3. We show that inhibition of endogenous STAT3 activation with an inducible STAT3 protein with dominant-negative activity (STAT3F) results in an early, rapid and complete differentiation of BCR-ABL-expressing ES cells, whereas control ES cells retain a more undifferentiated phenotype. This phenomenon could be totally abrogated by PD98059, a specific MEK1 inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-Kinase)/ERK1/2 pathway, which was found constitutively phosphorylated in BCR-ABL-expressing cells. In addition, BCR-ABL-expressing ES cells harboring low levels of activated STAT3 committed more rapidly through hematopoietic differentiation, since embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from these cells were able to generate numerous hematopoietic progenitors 2 days early. Moreover, BCR-ABL-expressing ES cells cultured first with low levels of activated STAT3 before EBs derivation displayed a more rapid loss of pluripotency than controls and failed to generate hematopoietic progenitors. This phenomenon was partially abrogated when ES cells were first exposed to PD98059 or to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. From this predictive model, we suggest that variations of the activation levels in BCR-ABL substrates such as STAT3 may represent ""instructive"" secondary cooperating events involved in the transformation of the leukemic cell phenotype during the course of CML.","['Coppo, Paul', 'Dusanter-Fourt, Isabelle', 'Vainchenker, William', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Coppo P', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Vainchenker W', 'Turhan AG']","['INSERM, Unites Mixtes de Recherche (UMR) 790, Institut Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris XI, Villejuif, France. paulcoppo@aol.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080919,England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0898-6568(08)00271-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2009 Jan;21(1):52-60. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.09.006.

DNA damage induced by benzene metabolites such as hydroquinone (HQ) and p-benzoquinone (BQ) is one reason for the leukemogenesis. In this study, we showed that treatment with HQ and BQ quickly and clearly generated phosphorylated histone H2AX (gamma-H2AX) which has been recently considered an index of the production of double strand breaks (DSBs). HQ and BQ produced discrete foci of gamma-H2AX within the nucleus of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. gamma-H2AX appeared after the treatment with HQ and BQ for 2h, and increased time-dependently up to 4-8h. HQ and BQ increased intracellular oxidation, and an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, clearly inhibited the phosphorylation, suggesting that reactive oxygen species produced from HQ and BQ contributed to the generation. gamma-H2AX was sensitively detected after treatment with low concentrations of HQ and BQ, compared with the direct detection of DSBs by biased sinusoidal field gel electrophoresis and with the assessment of cytotoxicity based on cell survival. DSBs are the most serious form of DNA damage and are associated with genomic instability leading to myeloid leukemia. gamma-H2AX may be a useful tool for judging the genotoxicity of benzene metabolites sensitively.","['Ishihama, Mio', 'Toyooka, Tatsushi', 'Ibuki, Yuko']","['Ishihama M', 'Toyooka T', 'Ibuki Y']","['Laboratory of Radiation Biology, Graduate School of Nutritional and Environmental Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Shizuoka-shi 422-8526, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080918,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mutagens/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(08)00228-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2008.09.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Dec;22(8):1861-8. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.09.005.

Many of these hereditary cancer genes are silenced by methylation in a similar spectrum of sporadic cancers. It is likely that the initiating event in some of those cases of sporadic cancer is the somatic epigenetic inactivation (epimutation) of the same hereditary cancer gene. Recently, it has been shown that epimutations of certain hereditary cancer genes can be constitutional i.e. present throughout the soma. These epimutations may be inherited or arise very early in the germline. The heritability of these epimutations is very low as in most cases they are erased by passage through the germline. In other cases, predisposition to epimutations rather than the epimutations themselves can be inherited. These cases are characterised by Mendelian inheritance and are likely to be associated with sequence variants. Other sequence variants and environmental influences may also affect methylation propensity at a global level.","['Dobrovic, Alexander', 'Kristensen, Lasse S']","['Dobrovic A', 'Kristensen LS']","['Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria 8006, Australia. alexander.dobrovic@petermac.org']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",20080916,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (MLH1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MSH2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutL Protein Homolog 1)', 'EC 3.6.1.3 (MutS Homolog 2 Protein)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'BRCA1 Protein/genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'MutL Protein Homolog 1', 'MutS Homolog 2 Protein/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/09 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(08)00385-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2008.09.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2009 Jan;41(1):34-9. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2008.09.006.

Approximately 20-30% of neurons in the chick cochlear nucleus, nucleus magnocellularis (NM) die following deafferentation (i.e. deafness produced by cochlea removal). Previous studies have identified cellular events that occur within hours following cochlea removal, which are thought to lead to the ultimate death of NM neurons. We have recently shown that chronic lithium treatment increases neuronal survival following deafferentation. To assess where in the cell death cascade lithium is having its effect, we evaluated some of the early deafferentation-induced cellular changes in NM neurons. Lithium did not affect deafferentation-induced changes that occur across the entire population of NM neurons. There were still deafferentation-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentrations and early changes in the ribosomes, as indicated by Y10b immunolabeling. Lithium did, however, affect changes that are believed to be indicative of the subpopulation of NM neurons that will eventually die. Ribosomes recovered in all of the deafferented NM neurons (as assessed by Y10b labeling) by 10 h following cochlea removal in subjects pretreated with lithium, while a subpopulation of the NM neurons in saline-treated subjects showed dramatic reduction in Y10b labeling at that time.

To improve their HDAC activity and selectivity, chemical modifications at the benzoyl moieties were investigated and evaluated using three maize histone deacetylases: HD2, HD1-B (class I human HDAC homologue), and HD1-A (class II human HDAC homologue). Docking experiments on HD1-A and HD1-B homology models revealed that the different compounds selectivity profiles could be addressed to different binding modes as observed for the reference compound SAHA. Smaller hydrophobic cap groups improved class II HDAC selectivity through the interaction with HD1-A Asn89-Ser90-Ile91, while bulkier aromatic substituents increased class I HDAC selectivity.

In laboratory animals, the potential effect of opiate drugs to induce cell death by apoptosis is a controversial topic. This postmortem human brain study examined the status of the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in the prefrontal cortex of a large group of well-characterized heroin or methadone abusers. In these subjects (n=36), the immunocontent of apoptosis-1 protein (Fas) death receptor did not differ from that in age-, gender-, and postmortem delay-matched controls. In contrast, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), the mediator of the death signal, was significantly decreased in the same brain samples (all addicts: 30%, n=36; short-term abuse (ST): 31%, n=15; long-term abuse (LT): 29%, n=21). The initiator caspase-8 was not altered, but FLIP(L) (Fas-associated protein with death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein), a dominant inhibitor of caspase-8, was increased in LT addicts (19%). In the intrinsic pathway, the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) and AIF (apoptosis-inducing factor) remained unchanged, but cytochrome c was decreased (all addicts: 25%; ST: 31%; LT: 20%) and anti-apoptotic B-cell leukemia 2 (Bcl-2) increased in LT addicts (24%). The content of executioner caspase-3 and the pattern of cleavage of the nuclear enzyme poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 (PARP-1) were similar in opiate addicts and control subjects. Taken together, the data revealed that the extrinsic and intrinsic canonical apoptotic pathways are not abnormally activated in the prefrontal cortex of opiate abusers. Instead, the chronic modulation of some of their components (downregulation of FADD and cytochrome c; upregulation of FLIP(L) and Bcl-2) suggests the induction of non-apoptotic actions by opiate drugs related to phenomena of synaptic plasticity in the brain. These neurochemical adaptations could play a major role in the development of opiate tolerance, sensitization and relapse in human addicts.","['Garcia-Fuster, M J', 'Ramos-Miguel, A', 'Rivero, G', 'La Harpe, R', 'Meana, J J', 'Garcia-Sevilla, J A']","['Garcia-Fuster MJ', 'Ramos-Miguel A', 'Rivero G', 'La Harpe R', 'Meana JJ', 'Garcia-Sevilla JA']","['Laboratorio de Neurofarmacologia, IUNICS, Universitat de les Illes Balears, and Red Tematica de Investigacion Cooperativa en Salud (Trastornos Adictivos), Cra.

Many possibilities have been raised, including beta-cells themselves, embryonic or adult stem cells and reprogramming of other cell types. Some of these progenitor types may be active or reside in a dormant state in adults in vivo, while others can be rather considered to be products of tissue engineering in vitro. Starting from the available pancreas organs from cadaveric donors, an attractive possibility is to reprogram acinar exocrine cells into beta-cells. Indeed, acinar cells isolated from adult rats display a pronounced plasticity in culture. After an initial step of dedifferentiation, they can be redirected to the beta-cell phenotype by adding agonists of the JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathway to the medium (epidermal growth factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor). The acinar cells that undergo exocrine-to-endocrine transdifferentiation first need to re-express neurogenin-3 and then need to escape inhibition by Notch signalling. The insulin-expressing cells that are generated in this way are glucose-regulated and can normalize glycaemia after transplantation into diabetic immunocompromised mice. It will now be important to translate these findings to human cells.","['Baeyens, L', 'Bouwens, L']","['Baeyens L', 'Bouwens L']","['Cell Differentiation Unit, Diabetes Research Center, Vrije Universiteit Brussel-Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Validation Study']",,England,Diabetes Obes Metab,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",100883645,['0 (Insulin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*cytology', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/metabolism/physiology', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pancreas, Exocrine/*cytology/metabolism', 'Regeneration/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism/physiology']",,2008/10/18 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['DOM949 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00949.x [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes Obes Metab. 2008 Nov;10 Suppl 4:170-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1463-1326.2008.00949.x.,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report an unusual case of granulocytic sarcoma of the liver that arose in the background of myeloid metaplasia. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was instrumental in making the diagnosis in absence of previously known Hematlogic abnormality. CASE: A 65-year-old woman presented with multiple nodules in the liver. USG-guided FNAC was performed on them. The aspirates showed many myeloid blasts, myelocytes, metamyelocytes, erytbroid precursors and lympboglandular bodies. We considered a differential diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma and myeloid metaplasia. The presence of erytbroid precursors prompted us to consider myeloid metaplasia as a differential diagnorsis of granulocytic sarcoma. Peripberal smear showed a leukoerytbroblastic reaction. The patient died, and necropsy from the liver revealed extensive infiltration by undfferentiated blast cells with areas of myeloid metaplasia showing maturing erytbroid, myeloid and megakaryocytic elements. CONCLUSION: When a dual population of predominant myeloid blasts and normoblarts is encountered, a suspicion of granulocytic sarcoma arising in a background of myeloid metaplasia must be kept. Cells of all 3 lineages may not be always seen in myeloid metaplasia, and 1 cell line may predominate, causing a diagnostic dilemma.","['Gangane, Nitin', 'Kamra, Hemlata', 'Anshu', 'Joshi, Deepti', 'Gupta, Anupama']","['Gangane N', 'Kamra H', 'Anshu', 'Joshi D', 'Gupta A']","['Department of Pathology, Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sevagram, Wardha, Maharashtra, India. nitingangane@rediffmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Aged', 'Cytodiagnosis', 'Female', 'Hepatocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/*diagnosis/pathology']",,2008/10/07 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/07 09:00'],"['2008/10/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000325608 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2008 Sep-Oct;52(5):619-22. doi: 10.1159/000325608.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the molecular basis for how EBV latent infection promotes the development of NPC. We show that the viral EBNA1 protein, previously known to be required to maintain the EBV episomes, also causes the disruption of the cellular PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear bodies (or ND10s). This disruption occurs both in the context of a native latent infection and when exogenously expressed in EBV-negative NPC cells and involves loss of the PML proteins. We also show that EBNA1 is partially localized to PML nuclear bodies in NPC cells and interacts with a specific PML isoform. PML disruption by EBNA1 requires binding to the cellular ubiquitin specific protease, USP7 or HAUSP, but is independent of p53. We further observed that p53 activation, DNA repair and apoptosis, all of which depend on PML nuclear bodies, were impaired by EBNA1 expression and that cells expressing EBNA1 were more likely to survive after induction of DNA damage. The results point to an important role for EBNA1 in the development of NPC, in which EBNA1-mediated disruption of PML nuclear bodies promotes the survival of cells with DNA damage.","['Sivachandran, Nirojini', 'Sarkari, Feroz', 'Frappier, Lori']","['Sivachandran N', 'Sarkari F', 'Frappier L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081003,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7)', 'O5GA75RST7 (EBV-encoded nuclear antigen 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/virology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/genetics/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Specific Peptidase 7']",PMC2542412,2008/10/04 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/10/04 09:00'],"['2008/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000170 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2008 Oct 3;4(10):e1000170. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1000170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on respiratory viral infections in children with cancer are limited. METHODS: A long-term, prospective, multicenter study was carried out in Finland searching for respiratory viruses in febrile children with leukemia. For this purpose, 138 febrile episodes in 51 children with leukemia were analyzed. Twelve types of respiratory viruses were searched for by viral culture, antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS: Evidence of a respiratory viral infection was found in 61 of 138 febrile episodes (44%), accounting for an incidence of 0.8 (range, 0-2.4) per person year at risk during the treatment of leukemia. The most common viruses detected were rhinovirus (22%), respiratory syncytial virus (11%), human bocavirus (5%), and influenza A virus (4%). Dual viral infections were detected in 12 cases (9%). Half of the children had respiratory symptoms with cough being the most common symptom. Two children developed pneumonia. The mean duration of fever was 2.6 (SD 1.7) days in children with respiratory viral infection and 2.1 (SD 1.3) days in children without evidence of viral infection (P = 0.44). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory viruses are found commonly during febrile episodes in children with leukemia. The detection of viruses permits the use of available antiviral agents, may explain a poor response to antimicrobial agents, and minimizes the proportion of febrile episodes without possible etiologic agents in children with leukemia.","['Koskenvuo, Minna', 'Mottonen, Merja', 'Rahiala, Jaana', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M', 'Riikonen, Pekka', 'Waris, Matti', 'Ziegler, Thedi', 'Uhari, Matti', 'Salmi, Toivo T', 'Ruuskanen, Olli']","['Koskenvuo M', 'Mottonen M', 'Rahiala J', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM', 'Riikonen P', 'Waris M', 'Ziegler T', 'Uhari M', 'Salmi TT', 'Ruuskanen O']","['Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland. minnak@stanford.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Infect Dis J,The Pediatric infectious disease journal,8701858,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bocavirus/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Community-Acquired Infections/complications/virology', 'Cross Infection/complications/virology', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Influenza A virus/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/virology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/virology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Viruses/isolation & purification', 'Respiratory Tract Infections/complications/diagnosis/*virology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhinovirus/isolation & purification', 'Virus Diseases/complications/diagnosis/*virology']",,2008/10/04 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/INF.0b013e31817b0799 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2008 Nov;27(11):974-80. doi: 10.1097/INF.0b013e31817b0799.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed this role after donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) by quantifying Treg in DLI products, using the CD25, Foxp3 but also the recently identified CD127 Treg markers. Compared with others, patients in durable complete remission of their malignancy after DLI had received a lower number of FoxP3CD25, FoxP3CD127, or CD4CD127 Treg cells (P=0.04). The CD4CD127 Treg content of DLI remained significantly correlated with the hematologic response in multivariate analysis (P=0.05). Treg may thus inhibit graft-versus-tumor effect after DLI, a setting where the antitumoral effect observed is only driven by T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, independently of any other associated treatment. In comparison with the intracytoplasmic Foxp3 marker, the membranous CD4CD127 phenotype of Treg could be particularly relevant to manipulate this cell-population, to increase the antitumoral response in strategies of allogeneic or autologous immunotherapy.","['Hicheri, Yosr', 'Bouchekioua, Abdelghani', 'Hamel, Yamina', 'Henry, Adeline', 'Rouard, Helene', 'Pautas, Cecile', 'Beaumont, Jean-Louis', 'Kuentz, Mathieu', 'Cordonnier, Catherine', 'Cohen, Jose L', 'Maury, Sebastien']","['Hicheri Y', 'Bouchekioua A', 'Hamel Y', 'Henry A', 'Rouard H', 'Pautas C', 'Beaumont JL', 'Kuentz M', 'Cordonnier C', 'Cohen JL', 'Maury S']","[""AP-HP, Groupe Henri-Mondor Albert-Chenevier, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Universite Paris 12, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD4 Antigens', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-7 Receptor alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*metabolism']",,2008/10/04 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2008/10/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e318184908d [doi]', '00002371-200811000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2008 Nov-Dec;31(9):806-11. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e318184908d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The distal scFvs were specific for the tumor antigen CD19, and the central scFv for the trigger molecule CD16 (FcgammaRIII) on natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages. We had previously built a disulphide stabilized (ds) bsscFv [19 x 16] with monovalent binding for CD19 from ds components. The sctb ds[19 x 16 x 19] also used ds components and displayed 3-fold greater avidity for CD19 than the bsscFv (KD = 13 vs. 42 nM), whereas both had equal affinity for CD16 (KD = 58 nM). Plasma half-lives in mice were 4 and 2 hours for the sctb and the bsscFv, respectively. In antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reactions with human mononuclear cells as effectors, the sctb promoted equal lysis of leukemic cell lines and primary cells from leukemia and lymphoma patients at 10-fold to 40-fold lower concentrations than the bsscFv. This new format may also be applicable to a variety of other tumor antigens and effector molecules. With half-maximum effective concentrations (EC50) in the low picomolar range, the sctb ds[19 x 16 x 19] is an attractive candidate for further preclinical evaluation.","['Kellner, Christian', 'Bruenke, Joerg', 'Stieglmaier, Julia', 'Schwemmlein, Michael', 'Schwenkert, Michael', 'Singer, Heiko', 'Mentz, Kristin', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Lang, Peter', 'Oduncu, Fuat', 'Stockmeyer, Bernhard', 'Fey, Georg H']","['Kellner C', 'Bruenke J', 'Stieglmaier J', 'Schwemmlein M', 'Schwenkert M', 'Singer H', 'Mentz K', 'Peipp M', 'Lang P', 'Oduncu F', 'Stockmeyer B', 'Fey GH']","['Chair of Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, BTE-building, Erwin-Rommel Strasse 3, D-91058 Erlangen, Germany. ckellner@biologie.uni-erlangen.de']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/therapeutic use', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/chemistry/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/immunology/metabolism/therapeutic use']",,2008/10/04 09:00,2009/07/14 09:00,['2008/10/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CJI.0b013e318186c8b4 [doi]', '00002371-200811000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 2008 Nov-Dec;31(9):871-84. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0b013e318186c8b4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RECENT FINDINGS: RIC regimens with a broad range of TBI doses (0, 200, 400, 550, and 800 cGy) have been studied. Durable donor stem cell engraftment occurred in most patients, with a low rate of toxicity and nonrelapse mortality. Patients excluded from myeloablative regimens were able to tolerate RIC regimens. Retrospective comparisons of patients treated with RIC and myeloablative regimens showed lower nonrelapse mortality but higher relapse risk with RIC; however, overall survivals were similar though a larger fraction of RIC patients had high-risk pretransplant features. Study design weaknesses limit the ability to generalize and apply these results. RIC and myeloablative TBI-based regimens result in durable engraftment of donor stem cells, tolerable toxicity, and acceptable rates of relapse risk and overall survival. Determination of the optimal dose of TBI for allogeneic transplantation is complex and depends on several variables and may vary based on a specific permutation of these variables. SUMMARY: A broad range of TBI doses for RIC regimens are effective; however, all conclusions are limited by the lack of prospective, randomized trials comparing RIC and myeloablative regimens.","['Adkins, Douglas R', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Adkins DR', 'DiPersio JF']","['Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

Prior to transplantation, the patient was on long-term oral anticoagulant (acenocoumarol) following the placement of a mechanical aortic valve. Acenocoumarol was stopped and low-molecular-weight heparin (nadroparin calcium) was administered intravenously through a continuous infusion pump (30 000 anti-Xa U/day) starting from day 0 until day 23 after transplantation. The patient was prophylactically transfused with platelets when the daily platelet count fell below 50 x 10 l. Repeated blood measurements showed that a therapeutic level of anti-Xa activity was achieved and maintained at a fairly constant level. No haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications occurred.

As such, study of MDS/AML can provide insight into the mechanisms of neoplastic evolution. In 184 patients with MDS and AML, DNA methylation microarray and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) karyotyping were used to assess the relative contributions of aberrant DNA methylation and chromosomal deletions to tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) silencing during disease progression. Aberrant methylation was seen in every sample, on average affecting 91 of 1505 CpG loci in early MDS and 179 of 1505 loci after blast transformation (refractory anemia with excess blasts [RAEB]/AML). In contrast, chromosome aberrations were seen in 79% of early MDS samples and 90% of RAEB/AML samples, and were not as widely distributed over the genome. Analysis of the most frequently aberrantly methylated genes identified FZD9 as a candidate TSG on chromosome 7. In patients with chromosome deletion at the FZD9 locus, aberrant methylation of the remaining allele was associated with the poorest clinical outcome. These results indicate that aberrant methylation can cooperate with chromosome deletions to silence TSG. However, the ubiquity, extent, and correlation with disease progression suggest that aberrant DNA methylation is the dominant mechanism for TSG silencing and clonal variation in MDS evolution to AML.","['Jiang, Ying', 'Dunbar, Andrew', 'Gondek, Lukasz P', 'Mohan, Sanjay', 'Rataul, Manjot', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Sekeres, Mikkael', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Jiang Y', 'Dunbar A', 'Gondek LP', 'Mohan S', 'Rataul M', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Sekeres M', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic, OH 44195, USA.']",['eng'],"['K24 HL077522/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082983/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 RR019391/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081002,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FZD3 protein, human)', '0 (Frizzled Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frizzled Receptors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC2637194,2008/10/04 09:00,2009/02/27 09:00,['2008/10/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37755-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-163246 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Feb 5;113(6):1315-25. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-163246.

Distinct miRNA expression patterns were observed for t(15;17), MLL rearrangements, and core-binding factor (CBF) AMLs including both t(8;21) and inv(16) samples. Expression signatures of a minimum of two (i.e., miR-126/126*), three (i.e., miR-224, miR-368, and miR-382), and seven (miR-17-5p and miR-20a, plus the aforementioned five) miRNAs could accurately discriminate CBF, t(15;17), and MLL-rearrangement AMLs, respectively, from each other. We further showed that the elevated expression of miR-126/126* in CBF AMLs was associated with promoter demethylation but not with amplification or mutation of the genomic locus. Our gain- and loss-of-function experiments showed that miR-126/126* inhibited apoptosis and increased the viability of AML cells and enhanced the colony-forming ability of mouse normal bone marrow progenitor cells alone and particularly, in cooperation with AML1-ETO, likely through targeting Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2), a tumor suppressor. Our results demonstrate that specific alterations in miRNA expression distinguish AMLs with common translocations and imply that the deregulation of specific miRNAs may play a role in the development of leukemia with these associated genetic rearrangements.","['Li, Zejuan', 'Lu, Jun', 'Sun, Miao', 'Mi, Shuangli', 'Zhang, Hao', 'Luo, Roger T', 'Chen, Ping', 'Wang, Yungui', 'Yan, Ming', 'Qian, Zhijian', 'Neilly, Mary Beth', 'Jin, Jie', 'Zhang, Yanming', 'Bohlander, Stefan K', 'Zhang, Dong-Er', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Thirman, Michael J', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Rowley, Janet D', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Li Z', 'Lu J', 'Sun M', 'Mi S', 'Zhang H', 'Luo RT', 'Chen P', 'Wang Y', 'Yan M', 'Qian Z', 'Neilly MB', 'Jin J', 'Zhang Y', 'Bohlander SK', 'Zhang DE', 'Larson RA', 'Le Beau MM', 'Thirman MJ', 'Golub TR', 'Rowley JD', 'Chen J']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA127277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'CA014599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081001,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (MIRN126 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.11.- (PLK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival', 'Core Binding Factors/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Translocation, Genetic']",PMC2563085,2008/10/04 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/04 09:00'],"['2008/10/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['0808266105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0808266105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Oct 7;105(40):15535-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0808266105.

Both LY29 and its inactive analogue, LY303511 (LY30), significantly up-regulated early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1) expression in HL-60 leukemic cells. However, wortmannin, another commonly used PI3K inhibitor, was not able to induce Egr-1 at the dose that completely blocked Akt phosphorylation. LY29 markedly decreased the invasive cells number through Matrigel and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared with the controls. Moreover, the inhibitory effects could be significantly abolished by Egr-1 gene silencing with siRNA technology. Our results indicated for the first time that LY29 could suppress leukemia cell invasion and migration at least in part through up-regulation of Egr-1, independent of its PI3K-Akt inhibitory activity.

Molecular tumor classifications resulted from these data and learning algorithms have advanced our understanding of genetic changes associated with cancer etiology and development. However, classifications are not always perfect and in such cases the classification rankings (likelihoods of correct class predictions) can be useful for directing further research (e.g., by deriving inferences about predictive indicators or prioritizing future experiments). Classification ranking is a challenging problem, particularly for microarray data, where there is a huge number of possible regulated genes with no known rating function. This study investigates the possibility of making tumor classification more informative by using a method for classification ranking that requires no additional ranking analysis and maintains relatively good classification accuracy. RESULTS: Microarray data of 11 different types and subtypes of cancer were analyzed using MDR (Multi-Dimensional Ranker), a recently developed boosting-based ranking algorithm. The number of predictor genes in all of the resulting classification models was at most nine, a huge reduction from the more than 12 thousands genes in the majority of the expression samples. Compared to several other learning algorithms, MDR gives the greatest AUC (area under the ROC curve) for the classifications of prostate cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and four ALL subtypes: BCR-ABL, E2A-PBX1, MALL and TALL. SVM (Support Vector Machine) gives the highest AUC for the classifications of lung, lymphoma, and breast cancers, and two ALL subtypes: Hyperdiploid > 50 and TEL-AML1. MDR gives highly competitive results, producing the highest average AUC, 91.01%, and an average overall accuracy of 90.01% for cancer expression analysis. CONCLUSION: Using the classification rankings from MDR is a simple technique for obtaining effective and informative tumor classifications from cancer gene expression data. Further interpretation of the results obtained from MDR is required. MDR can also be used directly as a simple feature selection mechanism to identify genes relevant to tumor classification. MDR may be applicable to many other classification problems for microarray data.","['Hewett, Rattikorn', 'Kijsanayothin, Phongphun']","['Hewett R', 'Kijsanayothin P']","['Department of Computer Science, Texas Tech University, Abilene, TX 79601, USA.

On the other hand, since microarray datasets contain a small number of samples and a large number of genes, it is usually desirable to identify small gene subsets with distinct pattern between sample classes. Such gene subsets are highly discriminative in phenotype classification because of their tightly coupling features. Unfortunately, such identified classifiers usually tend to have poor generalization properties on the test samples due to overfitting problem. RESULTS: We propose a novel approach combining both supervised learning with unsupervised learning techniques to generate increasingly discriminative gene clusters in an iterative manner. Our experiments on both simulated and real datasets show that our method can produce a series of robust gene clusters with good classification performance compared with existing approaches. CONCLUSION: This backward approach for refining a series of highly discriminative gene clusters for classification purpose proves to be very consistent and stable when applied to various types of training samples.","['Xu, Min', 'Zhu, Mengxia', 'Zhang, Louxin']","['Xu M', 'Zhu M', 'Zhang L']","['Program in Molecular and Computational Biology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. mxu@usc.edu']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",20080916,England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,,IM,"['*Algorithms', '*Artificial Intelligence', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Computer Simulation', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics']",PMC2559882,2008/10/10 09:00,2008/11/06 09:00,['2008/10/10 09:00'],"['2008/10/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2164-9-S2-S18 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2164-9-S2-S18 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2008 Sep 16;9 Suppl 2:S18. doi: 10.1186/1471-2164-9-S2-S18.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of MRD in pB-ALL by flow cytometric immunophenotyping requires demonstration of abnormal antigen expression in leukemic B-cell precursors relative to that of normal B-cell precursors. The gene encoding CD49f (integrin alpha-6) is one of several whose overexpression in pB-ALL at diagnosis has been associated with the subsequent detection of MRD. However, whether CD49f might be a useful reagent in the immunophenotypic detection of MRD in pB-ALL has not been evaluated. METHODS: We evaluated CD49f expression by 4-color flow cytometry in normal B-cell precursors, and in a series of cases of pB-ALL, both at diagnosis and at intervals following the initiation of therapy. RESULTS: In 10 control marrow samples, CD49f was undetectable or extremely dim in all but a minor subset of normal CD19+ B-lineage cells, whereas in 11 of 15 cases (73%) of pB-ALL, CD49f was moderate or bright at diagnosis, and persisted or became brighter after initiation of therapy. MRD detected using CD49f corresponded precisely with that obtained using a standard panel of antibodies, and permitted the detection of leukemic populations comprising as little as 0.02% of cells. Of the four pB-ALL cases in which CD49f was undetectable or dim at diagnosis, MRD was detected in two; in one of these, CD49f expression was substantially increased in the leukemic cells that persisted following initiation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: CD49f is commonly overexpressed in p-B-ALL, and represents a potentially useful marker for the immunophenotypic detection of MRD.","['DiGiuseppe, Joseph A', 'Fuller, Sheila G', 'Borowitz, Michael J']","['DiGiuseppe JA', 'Fuller SG', 'Borowitz MJ']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Hartford Hospital, Connecticut 06102-5037, USA. jdigius@harthosp.org']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

Furthermore, two new patients with Sweet's syndrome are reported. METHODS: A literature search was performed on Pub med using search terms ""sweet* syndrome*"" and neutrophil* dermatos*. Patients were subdivided into the following groups: classic/idiopathic, paraneoplastic, and parainflammatory Sweet's syndrome. RESULTS: The literature search revealed 64 patients (including our two patients) who were diagnosed with Sweet's syndrome in childhood and adolescence; 27 (42%) patients were categorized as ""classic/idiopathic Sweet's syndrome"". In 37 patients (58%) chronic associated diseases were reported. Out of these, 21 (33%) patients were categorized as ""parainflammatory Sweet's syndrome"" including chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, vasculitis with aortitis, recurrent infections due to immunodeficiencies, arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Sixteen (25%) patients were categorized as ""paraneoplastic Sweet's syndrome"" comprising both malignant and premalignant diseases like leukemia, aplastic anaemia, and Fanconi anaemia. As all five (8%) patients treated with drugs (granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, retinoid acid) suffered from malignant, premalignant, or parainflammatory diseases, these patients were categorized according to the underlying disease. Two new children with Sweet's syndrome and associated diseases are presented here, one of them suffering from recurrent infections and trisomy 21, while the other was diagnosed with CNS vasculitis 5(1/2) years after the primary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Sweet's syndrome should be considered in differential diagnosis of prolonged fever with cutaneous involvement.

SOURCES: A survey of articles selected from MEDLINE, American Society of Hematology educational programs, the CAPES web portal, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and textbook chapters. SUMMARY OF THE FINDINGS: Since the discovery in 1960 by Peter C. Nowel and David Hungerford of the 9:22 translocation (the Philadelphia chromosome), genetics has come to play an important role in hematology, in this case making it possible to diagnose chronic myeloid leukemia and opening doors to research avenues for the whole field of oncology. One point of great interest refers to the implications of these findings for the prognosis of a range of types of leukemia. In acute myeloid leukemia, the karyotype is of fundamental importance to postremission treatment decisions, and molecular factors determine the treatment of individuals with normal karyotypes. In chronic myeloid leukemia, clonal evolution is associated with progression to the blast crisis. Patients on imatinib who cease responding may have mutations on their ABL gene. Finally, in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, factors such as hyperdiploidy and t 12:21 are associated with good prognosis, whereas carriers of t 4:11 and t 9:22 are considered high risk patients. CONCLUSIONS: Genetics has come to stay as far as hematology and, in particular, the management of leukemia and its prognostic factors are concerned. These tests should always be carried out and the appropriate treatment adopted in the light of their results, so that optimal patient outcomes can be achieved.","['Hamerschlak, Nelson']",['Hamerschlak N'],"['Programa de Hematologia e Unidade de Transplantes de Medula Ossea, Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil. hamer@einstein.br']","['eng', 'por']",,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Brazil,J Pediatr (Rio J),Jornal de pediatria,2985188R,,IM,"['*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Prognosis']",,2008/12/04 09:00,2009/08/21 09:00,['2008/12/04 09:00'],"['2008/12/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/12/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2223/JPED.1785 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr (Rio J). 2008 Aug;84(4 Suppl):S52-7. doi: 10.2223/JPED.1785.,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that PTEN inactivation in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells is not always synonymous with PTEN gene lesions and diminished protein expression. Samples taken from patients with T-ALL at the time of diagnosis very frequently showed constitutive hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. In contrast to immortalized cell lines, most primary T-ALL cells did not harbor PTEN gene alterations, displayed normal PTEN mRNA levels, and expressed higher PTEN protein levels than normal T cell precursors. However, PTEN overexpression was associated with decreased PTEN lipid phosphatase activity, resulting from casein kinase 2 (CK2) overexpression and hyperactivation. In addition, T-ALL cells had constitutively high levels of ROS, which can also downmodulate PTEN activity. Accordingly, both CK2 inhibitors and ROS scavengers restored PTEN activity and impaired PI3K/Akt signaling in T-ALL cells. Strikingly, inhibition of PI3K and/or CK2 promoted T-ALL cell death without affecting normal T cell precursors. Overall, our data indicate that T-ALL cells inactivate PTEN mostly in a nondeletional, posttranslational manner. Pharmacological manipulation of these mechanisms may open new avenues for T-ALL treatment.","['Silva, Ana', 'Yunes, J Andres', 'Cardoso, Bruno A', 'Martins, Leila R', 'Jotta, Patricia Y', 'Abecasis, Miguel', 'Nowill, Alexandre E', 'Leslie, Nick R', 'Cardoso, Angelo A', 'Barata, Joao T']","['Silva A', 'Yunes JA', 'Cardoso BA', 'Martins LR', 'Jotta PY', 'Abecasis M', 'Nowill AE', 'Leslie NR', 'Cardoso AA', 'Barata JT']","['Unidade de Biologia do Cancro, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.']",['eng'],['G9403619/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081001,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC2556239,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI34616 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Nov;118(11):3762-74. doi: 10.1172/JCI34616.

Extra-adrenal myelolipomas are extremely rare, with approximately 50% of cases occurring in the presacral region. We report a case of an 85 year old woman who presented with small bowel obstruction relating to a pelvic mass detected on computed tomography (CT) scan. At laparotomy, a 12-cm. pre-sacral mass was resected. Histologic examination showed a myelolipoma with dense lymphoid aggregates. On immunostains, the lymphoid aggregates showed positivity for CD20, CD5, and CD23, consistent with small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL). Molecular evaluation confirmed the presence of a clonal B-cell lymphocytic proliferation that did not harbor BCL-2 or BCL-1 gene rearrangements. This case represents the first report of a myelolipoma involved by a non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The unique combination of these findings raises questions about the relationship between the two observed entities.

Although, causative factors such as genetic events and altered expression of anti-apoptotic factors have been described in a number of patients, the mechanistic details that drive myeloma development and continued growth of malignant cells remain largely undefined. Numerous growth factors, including interleukin (IL)-6, Insulin-like growth factor-1 and IL-10 have been shown to promote growth of MM cells suggesting a significant role for cytokines in this disease. Interferon (IFN)-lambda1 is a new member of the Class II cytokine family that, similar to IFN-alpha, has been shown to mediate viral immunity. In light of data supporting a role for cytokines in myeloma, we investigated the significance of IFN-lambda1 on myeloma cell biology. Our studies show for the first time that myeloma cells bind to soluble IFN-lambda1, and that IFN-lambda1 induces myeloma cell growth and protects against dexamethasone-induced cell death. Our data also show that IFN-lambda1 induces phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT3 and Erk. Taken together, our results suggest that IFN-lambda1 may regulate myeloma cell biology and could prove to be therapeutically important.","['Novak, A J', 'Grote, D M', 'Ziesmer, S C', 'Rajkumar, V', 'Doyle, S E', 'Ansell, S M']","['Novak AJ', 'Grote DM', 'Ziesmer SC', 'Rajkumar V', 'Doyle SE', 'Ansell SM']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA062242-119004/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA062242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081002,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (IFNL1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Death/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferons', 'Interleukins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC2771776,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008263 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.263 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Dec;22(12):2240-6. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.263.

A variety of congenital and acquired disorders provide evidence in support of T cell or NK cell immune surveillance mechanisms in human hematological malignancies. Furthermore, clinical experience with stem cell transplantation underlines the potential for both T and NK cell-mediated antileukemia effects. Animal models of tumor surveillance and viral-driven lymphoproliferative diseases in man emphasize the dynamic nature of the equilibrium between tumors and the immune system, which can lead to tumor escape in individuals with normal immune function. In hematological malignancies the implication of a dynamic immune surveillance model is that chemotherapy may disrupt potentially competent immune surveillance mechanisms leading to disease recurrence following successful tumor bulk reduction by chemotherapy. This possibility deserves further investigation with a view to developing strategies to boost immune function following chemotherapy so as to combine the beneficial effect of chemotherapy with an immune response capable of sustaining remissions.","['Barrett, A J', 'Savani, B N']","['Barrett AJ', 'Savani BN']","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. barrettj@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],['ZIA HL002342-16/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20081002,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Surveillance/*drug effects', 'Tumor Escape/drug effects/immunology']",PMC4170943,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008273 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.273 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):53-8. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.273.

The negative regulatory programmed death-1/programmed death-1 ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) pathway has been implicated in the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) exhaustion during chronic viral infection along with tumor escape from host immunity. To determine whether the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway could be involved in the establishment of persistent HTLV-1 infections and immune evasion of ATLL cells in patients, we examined PD-1/PD-L1 expression on cells from 27 asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) and 27 ATLL patients in comparison with cells from 18 healthy donors. PD-1 expression on HTLV-1-specific CTLs from ACs and ATLL patients was dramatically elevated. In addition, PD-1 expression was significantly higher on CD8+ T cells along with cytomegalovirus (CMV)- and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-specific CTLs in ATLL patients compared with ACs and control individuals. Primary ATLL cells in 21.7% of ATLL patients expressed PD-L1, whereas elevated expression was not observed in cells from ACs. Finally, in functional studies, we observed that an anti-PD-L1 antagonistic antibody upregulated HTLV-1-specific CD8+T-cell response. These observations suggest that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway plays a role in fostering persistent HTLV-1 infections, which may further ATLL development and facilitate immune evasion by ATLL cells.","['Kozako, T', 'Yoshimitsu, M', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Masamoto, I', 'Horai, S', 'White, Y', 'Akimoto, M', 'Suzuki, S', 'Matsushita, K', 'Uozumi, K', 'Tei, C', 'Arima, N']","['Kozako T', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Fujiwara H', 'Masamoto I', 'Horai S', 'White Y', 'Akimoto M', 'Suzuki S', 'Matsushita K', 'Uozumi K', 'Tei C', 'Arima N']","['Division of Hematology and Immunology, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081002,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis/immunology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'B7-H1 Antigen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/immunology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/03/03 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008272 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.272 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Feb;23(2):375-82. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.272.

T-cell activation did not require a primary signal through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)/CD3 complex and depended on the presence of NG2-positive tumor cells. Here, we further investigate this phenomenon of a target cell-restricted, supra-agonistic CD28 stimulation with bispecific antibodies. To this end, we exchanged the NG2 targeting part of r28M with a single-chain antibody directed to the B-cell associated antigen CD20. The resulting bispecific single-chain antibody, termed r2820, induced supra-agonistic T-cell activation, which required the presence of autologous normal or malignant B cells, respectively. Once activated, T cells were capable of destroying lymphoma target cells.These findings demonstrate that supra-agonistic CD28 stimulation with bispecific single-chain antibodies is a robust and readily reproducible phenomenon. In the context of experimental tumor therapy, it may provide a valuable alternative to the unrestricted T-cell activation induced by 'super-agonistic', monospecific CD28 antibodies.","['Otz, T', 'Grosse-Hovest, L', 'Hofmann, M', 'Rammensee, H-G', 'Jung, G']","['Otz T', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Hofmann M', 'Rammensee HG', 'Jung G']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cell Biology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081002,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proteoglycans/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008271 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.271 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):71-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.271.

Although treatment with cytarabine is effective in high-risk TL cases, approximately 20% of severe patients still suffer early death. In this study, we demonstrate abundant KIT expression in all 13 patients with GATA1 mutations, although no significant difference in expression levels was observed between TL and acute myeloid leukemia. Stem cell factor (SCF) stimulated the proliferation of the TL cells from five patients and treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib suppressed the proliferation effectively in vitro. To investigate the signal cascade, we established the first SCF-dependent, DS-related acute megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, KPAM1. Withdrawal of SCF or treatment with imatinib induced apoptosis of KPAM1 cells. SCF activated the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT pathways, followed by downregulation of the pro-apoptotic factor BIM and upregulation of the anti-apoptotic factor MCL1. Although we found novel missense mutations of KIT in 2 of 14 TL patients, neither mutation led to KIT activation and neither reduced the cytotoxic effects of imatinib.

However, efficient evaluation of novel drugs is hindered by the lack of a suitable preclinical animal model. Here an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic NET is established and used to study the action of ZK 304709, a first in class, oral multitarget tumour growth inhibitor. ZK 304709 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) 1, 2, 4, 7 and 9, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-type kinases (VEGF-RTKs) 1-3 and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-type kinase beta (PDGF-RTKss). METHODS: BON and QGP-1 human NET cells were used to study proliferation, survival and cell cycle distribution in vitro. For induction of orthotopic NETs, BON cells were injected into the pancreas of NMRI(nu/nu) mice. Primary tumour growth and metastatic spread were recorded after 9 weeks, and apoptosis, microvessel density and lymphatic vessel density were determined. RESULTS: ZK 304709 dose-dependently suppressed proliferation and colony formation of NET cells. Direct effects on NET cells were consistent with Cdk inhibition and involved G(2) cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, which was associated with reduced expression of MCL1 (myeloid cell leukaemia sequence 1), survivin and hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha). Apoptosis similarly occurred in vivo in ZK 304709-treated orthotopic BON tumours, resulting in a 80% reduction of primary tumour growth. In contrast, treatment with lanreotide or 5-fluorouracil and streptozotocin failed to inhibit tumour gowth. ZK 304709 also reduced tumour microvessel density, implicating antiangiogenic mechanisms. CONCLUSION: BON orthotopic tumours provide an informative model for preclinical drug evaluation in NETs. In this model, ZK 304709 achieved efficacious tumour growth control via induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumour-induced angiogenesis.","['Scholz, A', 'Wagner, K', 'Welzel, M', 'Remlinger, F', 'Wiedenmann, B', 'Siemeister, G', 'Rosewicz, S', 'Detjen, K M']","['Scholz A', 'Wagner K', 'Welzel M', 'Remlinger F', 'Wiedenmann B', 'Siemeister G', 'Rosewicz S', 'Detjen KM']","['Medizinische Klinik mit Schwerpunkt Hepatologie und Gastroenterologie, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081001,England,Gut,Gut,2985108R,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/analysis', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/analysis', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/blood supply/*drug therapy', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/blood supply/*drug therapy', 'Survivin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/02/12 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['gut.2007.146415 [pii]', '10.1136/gut.2007.146415 [doi]']",ppublish,Gut. 2009 Feb;58(2):261-70. doi: 10.1136/gut.2007.146415.

We recently reported that Vpx promoted the accumulation of full-length viral DNA following the infection of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). This positive effect was exerted following the infection of DCs with cognate viruses and with retroviruses as divergent as HIV-1, feline immunodeficiency virus, and even murine leukemia virus, leading us to suggest that Vpx counteracted an antiviral restriction present in DCs. Here, we show that Vpx is required, albeit to a different extent, for the infection of all myeloid but not of lymphoid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and monocytoid THP-1 cells that had been induced to differentiate with phorbol esters. The intracellular localization of Vpx was highly heterogeneous and cell type dependent, since Vpx localized differently in HeLa cells and DCs. Despite these differences, no clear correlation between the functionality of Vpx and its intracellular localization could be drawn. As a first insight into its function, we determined that SIV(SM)/HIV-2 and SIV(RCM) Vpx proteins interact with the DCAF1 adaptor of the Cul4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase complex recently described to associate with HIV-1 Vpr and HIV-2 Vpx. However, the functionality of Vpx proteins in the infection of DCs did not strictly correlate with DCAF1 binding, and knockdown experiments failed to reveal a functional role for this association in differentiated THP-1 cells. Lastly, when transferred in the context of a replication-competent viral clone, Vpx was required for replication in DCs.","['Goujon, Caroline', 'Arfi, Vanessa', 'Pertel, Thomas', 'Luban, Jeremy', 'Lienard, Julia', 'Rigal, Dominique', 'Darlix, Jean-Luc', 'Cimarelli, Andrea']","['Goujon C', 'Arfi V', 'Pertel T', 'Luban J', 'Lienard J', 'Rigal D', 'Darlix JL', 'Cimarelli A']","['LaboRetro, Department of Human Virology, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['R01 AI036199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI36199/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081001,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (VPX protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', '0 (VPX protein, Simian immunodeficiency virus)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/metabolism', 'HIV-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",PMC2593360,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/01/03 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01181-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01181-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Dec;82(24):12335-45. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01181-08.

Recently, there have been an increasing number of reports of damage in unirradiated cells that are either neighbors or descendants of irradiated cells, respectively, regarded as bystander effects and genomic instability and collectively termed nontargeted effects. In this study, we show that descendants of normal murine hemaopoietic clonogenic stem cells exposed to bone marrow-conditioned medium derived from gamma-irradiated mice exhibit chromosomal instability unlike the descendants of directly gamma-irradiated cells. The instability is expressed in bone marrow cells of the radiation-induced acute myeloid leukemia (r-AML) susceptible strain (CBA/Ca) but not in mice resistant to r-AML (C57BL/6). Furthermore, crossgenetic experiments show the induction of the instability phenotype requires both the producer and responder cells to be of the susceptible CBA/Ca genotype. Macrophages are the source of the bystander signals, and the signaling mechanism involves tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and superoxide. The findings show a genotype-dependent chromosomal instability phenotype induced by radiation-induced macrophage-mediated bystander signaling. As the majority of accidental, occupational, and therapeutic exposures to ionizing radiation are partial body exposures, the findings have implications for understanding the consequences of such exposure.","['Lorimore, Sally A', 'Chrystal, Jennifer A', 'Robinson, Joanne I', 'Coates, Philip J', 'Wright, Eric G']","['Lorimore SA', 'Chrystal JA', 'Robinson JI', 'Coates PJ', 'Wright EG']","['Division of Pathology and Neuroscience, Cancer Biology and Clinical Pathology Unit, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bystander Effect/physiology/radiation effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromosomal Instability/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism/*physiology/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Models, Biological', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/19/8122 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0698 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;68(19):8122-6. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0698.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD19 represents an attractive immunotherapy target for cancers of lymphoid origin due to its high expression levels on the vast majority of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and some leukemias. A humanized anti-CD19 antibody with an engineered Fc domain (XmAb5574) was generated to increase binding to Fcgamma receptors on immune cells and thus increase Fc-mediated effector functions. In vitro, XmAb5574 enhanced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 100-fold to 1,000-fold relative to an anti-CD19 IgG1 analogue against a broad range of B-lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Furthermore, XmAb5574 conferred antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity against patient-derived acute lymphoblastic leukemia and mantle cell lymphoma cells, whereas the IgG1 analogue was inactive. XmAb5574 also increased antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and apoptosis. In vivo, XmAb5574 significantly inhibited lymphoma growth in prophylactic and established mouse xenograft models, and showed more potent antitumor activity than its IgG1 analogue. Comparisons with a variant incapable of Fcgamma receptor binding showed that engagement of these receptors is critical for optimal antitumor efficacy. These results suggest that XmAb5574 exhibits potent tumor cytotoxicity via direct and indirect effector functions and thus warrants clinical evaluation as an immunotherapeutic for CD19(+) hematologic malignancies.","['Horton, Holly M', 'Bernett, Matthew J', 'Pong, Erik', 'Peipp, Matthias', 'Karki, Sher', 'Chu, Seung Y', 'Richards, John O', 'Vostiar, Igor', 'Joyce, Patrick F', 'Repp, Roland', 'Desjarlais, John R', 'Zhukovsky, Eugene A']","['Horton HM', 'Bernett MJ', 'Pong E', 'Peipp M', 'Karki S', 'Chu SY', 'Richards JO', 'Vostiar I', 'Joyce PF', 'Repp R', 'Desjarlais JR', 'Zhukovsky EA']","['Xencor, Inc, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FCGR1A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/*genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/biosynthesis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Engineering/methods', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/19/8049 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2268 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;68(19):8049-57. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2268.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic efficacy of the widely used antineoplastic drugs doxorubicin, cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate, and imatinib were compared in leukemia (K562) and lymphoma (RL) cell lines with and without pretreatment with dehydroascorbic acid, the commonly transported form of vitamin C. The effect of vitamin C on viability, clonogenicity, apoptosis, P-glycoprotein, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and mitochondrial membrane potential was determined. Pretreatment with vitamin C caused a dose-dependent attenuation of cytotoxicity, as measured by trypan blue exclusion and colony formation after treatment with all antineoplastic agents tested. Vitamin C given before doxorubicin treatment led to a substantial reduction of therapeutic efficacy in mice with RL cell-derived xenogeneic tumors. Vitamin C treatment led to a dose-dependent decrease in apoptosis in cells treated with the antineoplastic agents that was not due to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein or vitamin C retention modulated by antineoplastics. Vitamin C had only modest effects on intracellular ROS and a more general cytoprotective profile than N-acetylcysteine, suggesting a mechanism of action that is not mediated by ROS. All antineoplastic agents tested caused mitochondrial membrane depolarization that was inhibited by vitamin C. These findings indicate that vitamin C given before mechanistically dissimilar antineoplastic agents antagonizes therapeutic efficacy in a model of human hematopoietic cancers by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential. These results support the hypothesis that vitamin C supplementation during cancer treatment may detrimentally affect therapeutic response.","['Heaney, Mark L', 'Gardner, Jeffrey R', 'Karasavvas, Nicos', 'Golde, David W', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Smith, Emily A', ""O'Connor, Owen A""]","['Heaney ML', 'Gardner JR', 'Karasavvas N', 'Golde DW', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Smith EA', ""O'Connor OA""]","['Departments of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology and Chemistry, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. heaneym@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['R01 CA055349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA030388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055349-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'Y2Z3ZTP9UM (Dehydroascorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Dehydroascorbic Acid/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC3695824,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/19/8031 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1490 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;68(19):8031-8. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1490.,['Cancer Res. 2009 Nov 15;69(22):8830; author reply 8830-1.

However, the role of these factors in response to stalled replication forks is not clear. Nucleoside analogues are agents that are incorporated into DNA during replication, which cause stalling of replication forks. The molecular mechanisms that sense these events may signal for DNA repair and contribute to survival but are poorly understood. Cellular responses to both DSBs and stalled replication forks are marked by H2AX phosphorylation on Ser(139) (gamma-H2AX), which forms nuclear foci at sites of DNA damage. Here, concentrations of the nucleoside analogues 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylcytosine (cytarabine; ara-C), gemcitabine, and troxacitabine, which inhibited DNA synthesis by 90% within 2 hours, were determined for each agent. Using gamma-H2AX as a marker for changes in chromatin structure, we show that Mre11, Rad50, Nbs1, and phosphorylated ATM respond to nucleoside analogue-induced stalled replication forks by forming nuclear foci that colocalize with gamma-H2AX within 2 hours. Because neither DSBs nor single-strand breaks were detectable after nucleoside analogue exposure, we conclude that this molecular response is not due to the presence of DNA breaks. Deficiencies in ATM, Mre11, or Rad50 led to a 2- to 5-fold increase in clonogenic sensitization to gemcitabine, whereas Nbs1 and H2AX deficiency did not affect reproductive growth. Taken together, these results suggest that ATM, Mre11, and Rad50 are required for survival after replication fork stalling, whereas Nbs1 and H2AX are inconsequential.","['Ewald, Brett', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Plunkett, William']","['Ewald B', 'Sampath D', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-110015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA032839-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA032839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Atm protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Deoxycytidine/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Multiprotein Complexes/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Nucleosides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology']",PMC2631429,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/19/7947 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0971 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;68(19):7947-55. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0971.,,,,['NIHMS63490'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peyton Rous founded this scientific field in 1911 by discovering an avian virus that induced tumors in chickens; however, it took 40 years for the scientific community to comprehend the effect of this seminal finding. Later identification of mammalian tumor viruses in the 1930s by Richard Shope and John Bittner, and in the 1950s by Ludwik Gross, sparked the first intense interest in tumor virology by suggesting the possibility of a similar causal role for viruses in human cancers. This change in attitude opened the door in the 1960s and 1970s for the discovery of the first human tumor viruses--EBV, hepatitis B virus, and the papillomaviruses. Such knowledge proved instrumental to the development of the first cancer vaccines against cancers having an infectious etiology. Tumor virologists additionally recognized that viruses could serve as powerful discovery tools, leading to revolutionary breakthroughs in the 1970s and 1980s that included the concept of the oncogene, the identification of the p53 tumor suppressor, and the function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor. The subsequent availability of more advanced molecular technologies paved the way in the 1980s and 1990s for the identification of additional human tumor viruses--human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, hepatitis C virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma virus. In fact, current estimates suggest that viruses are involved in 15% to 20% of human cancers worldwide. Thus, viruses not only have been shown to represent etiologic agents for many human cancers but have also served as tools to reveal mechanisms that are involved in all human malignancies. This rich history promises that tumor virology will continue to contribute to our understanding of cancer and to the development of new therapeutic and preventive measures for this disease in the 21st century.","['Javier, Ronald T', 'Butel, Janet S']","['Javier RT', 'Butel JS']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. rjavier@bcm.edu']",['eng'],['R01 CA058541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bird Diseases/virology', 'Birds/virology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/etiology/history/*virology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/physiology', 'Virology/history', 'Virus Physiological Phenomena']",PMC3501656,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/19/7693 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3301 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;68(19):7693-706. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-3301.,,,115,['NIHMS411897'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work investigates its anticancer effect and mechanism. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Anticancer efficacy was evaluated at the molecular target, cancer cells and nude mice. The mechanism was explored at submolecular, molecular, and cellular levels. RESULTS: IG-105 showed a potent activity against human leukemia and solid tumors in breast, liver, prostate, lung, skin, colon, and pancreas with IC(50) values between 0.012 and 0.298 mumol/L. It was also active in drug-resistant tumor cells and not a P-glycoprotein substrate. It inhibited microtubule assembly followed by M-phase arrest, Bcl-2 inactivation, and then apoptosis through caspase pathways. The colchicine pocket on tubulin is the binding site of IG-105. Nude mice experiments showed that IG-105 monotherapy at 100 mg/kg i.p. (q2d) yielded 81% inhibition of Bel-7402 hepatoma growth and at 275 mg/kg i.p. (q2d) completely inhibited the tumor growth. MCF-7 breast cancer in nude mice showed a similar therapeutic response to IG-105. Acute toxicity of IG-105 was not found even at 1,000 mg/kg i.p. In combination with oxaliplatin or doxorubicin, IG-105 converted each of these subcurative compounds into a curative treatment with complete inhibition for tumor growth in the hepatoma-bearing nude mice. The combination was more active than either drug. In no experiment was toxicity increased by combination chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: IG-105 inhibits microtubule assembly by binding at colchicine pocket. It shows a potent anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo and has good safety in mice. We consider IG-105 merits further investigation.","['Wang, Yue-Ming', 'Hu, Lai-Xing', 'Liu, Zhen-Ming', 'You, Xue-Fu', 'Zhang, Sheng-Hua', 'Qu, Jing-Rong', 'Li, Zhuo-Rong', 'Li, Yan', 'Kong, Wei-Jia', 'He, Hong-Wei', 'Shao, Rong-Guang', 'Zhang, Liang-Ren', 'Peng, Zong-Gen', 'Boykin, David W', 'Jiang, Jian-Dong']","['Wang YM', 'Hu LX', 'Liu ZM', 'You XF', 'Zhang SH', 'Qu JR', 'Li ZR', 'Li Y', 'Kong WJ', 'He HW', 'Shao RG', 'Zhang LR', 'Peng ZG', 'Boykin DW', 'Jiang JD']","[""Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 1 Tiantan Xili, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (N-(2,6-dimethoxypyridine-3-yl)-9-methylcarbazole-3-sulfonamide)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microtubules/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Sulfonamides/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*chemistry', 'Tubulin Modulators/metabolism']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/19/6218 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0550 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;14(19):6218-27. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0550.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used TF-1 BCR/ABL cells, by introducing the BCR/ABL gene into a leukemia cell line, TF-1 and K562, and established dasatinib- (BMS-R) and imatinib-resistant (IM-R) cells. We characterized chronic myelogenous leukemia drug-resistant cells and examined intracellular signaling. RESULTS: The IC(50) of dasatinib was 0.75 nmol/L (TF-1 BCR/ABL), 1 nmol/L (K562), 7.5 nmol/L (TF-1 BCR/ABL IM-R), 10 nmol/L (K562 IM-R), 15 micromol/L (TF-1 BCR/ABL BMS-R), and 25 micromol/L (K562 BMS-R). The number of BCR/ABL copies in resistant cell lines was the same as the parental cell line by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. There was no mutation in Abl kinase. We found that protein levels of BCR/ABL were reduced in dasatinib-resistant cell lines. BCR/ABL protein was increased by treatment of an ubiquitin inhibitor. The Src kinase, Lck, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt were activated, but p21(WAF), phosphatase and tensin homologue was reduced in K562 BMS-R cells. Removal of dasatinib from the culture medium of K562 BMS-R cells led to apoptosis, and activated caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the expression and protein activation signatures identified in this study provide insight into the mechanism of resistance to dasatinib and imatinib and may be of therapeutic chronic myelogenous leukemia value clinically.","['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, 6-7-1 Nishi-shinjuku, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. okabe@tokyo-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Benzamides', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/19/6181 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0461 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Oct 1;14(19):6181-6. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0461.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Following exposure to MK-0457 and/or vorinostat, apoptosis, loss of viability, as well as activity and levels of Aurora kinase and Bcr-Abl proteins were determined. RESULTS: Treatment with MK-0457 decreased the phosphorylation of Aurora kinase substrates including serine (S)10 on histone H3 and survivin, and led to aberrant mitosis, DNA endoreduplication as well as apoptosis of the cultured human acute leukemia HL-60, OCI-AML3, and K562 cells. Combined treatment with vorinostat and MK-0457 resulted in greater attenuation of Aurora and Bcr-Abl (in K562) kinase activity and levels as well as synergistically induced apoptosis of OCI-AML3, HL-60, and K562 cells. MK-0457 plus vorinostat also induced synergistic apoptosis of BaF3 cells with ectopic overexpression of wild-type or mutant Bcr-Abl. Finally, cotreatment with MK-0457 and vorinostat induced more loss of viability of primary AML and imatinib-refractory CML than treatment with either agent alone, but exhibited minimal toxicity to normal CD34+ progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Combined in vitro treatment with MK-0457 and vorinostat is highly active against cultured and primary leukemia cells.

Recent studies indicate that the catalytic subunits of SET1 family members are regulated by interaction with a conserved core group of proteins that include the WD repeat protein-5 (WDR5), retinoblastoma-binding protein-5 (RbBP5), and the absent small homeotic-2-like protein (Ash2L). It has been suggested that WDR5 functions to bridge the interactions between the catalytic and regulatory subunits of SET1 family complexes. However, the molecular details of these interactions are unknown. To gain insight into the interactions among these proteins, we have determined the biophysical basis for the interaction between the human WDR5 and MLL1. Our studies reveal that WDR5 preferentially recognizes a previously unidentified and conserved arginine-containing motif, called the ""Win"" or WDR5 interaction motif, which is located in the N-SET region of MLL1 and other SET1 family members.

We demonstrate that WDR5's recognition of arginine 3765 of MLL1 is essential for the assembly and enzymatic activity of the MLL1 core complex in vitro.","['Patel, Anamika', 'Vought, Valarie E', 'Dharmarajan, Venkatasubramanian', 'Cosgrove, Michael S']","['Patel A', 'Vought VE', 'Dharmarajan V', 'Cosgrove MS']","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244, USA.']",['eng'],['R01 CA140522/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081001,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ASH2L protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RBBP5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Arginine/*chemistry', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Lysine/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)60397-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M806317200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Nov 21;283(47):32162-75. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M806317200.

Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 37, 2366-2379]. In this study, we evaluated differentiating and apoptotic efficiency of a second new anti-proliferating agent from the same plant relative to 3-HK using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) KG1 cell line. 3-HK at 5-30 nM inhibited proliferation of KG1 cells after 24-96 h of treatment. NBT reducing assay and expression of cell surface markers (CD11b and CD14) confirmed that the inhibition of proliferation is associated with differentiation toward macrophage-like morphology. Regarding the relatively weaker potency of 3-HK in the induction of differentiation compared to that of the crude extract, we looked for additional compound(s) with similar properties in the crude extract. This effort led to isolation of the second compound from the leaves' extract with higher differentiating potency. The new compound inhibited proliferation of KG1 cells by almost 48+/-3.1% after 72 h of treatment with a single dose of 1.5 microg/ml. The treated cells differentiated along the monocyte/macrophage lineage based on the morphological features apparent after Wright-Giemsa staining, phagocytic activity and expression of cell surface markers as analyzed by flow cytometry. On the other hand, the results indicated that exposure of KG1 cells to either 3-HK or the new compound for 3-4 days induced apoptosis as assayed qualitatively by acridine orange/ethidium bromide (Ao/EtBr) double staining, agarose gel electrophoresis and quantitatively by Annexin-V technique and sub-G1 DNA staining using flow cytometry. Based on the present data, these two active constituents of D. lessertii have the novelty of being further evaluated for pharmaceutical applications.","['Yazdanparast, Razieh', 'Meshkini, Azadeh']","['Yazdanparast R', 'Meshkini A']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, P.O.

DESIGN: Prospective animal model study. SETTING: Gamete and Stem Cell Biotechnology Laboratory, Seoul National University, Korea. ANIMAL(S): F1 hybrid B6D2F1 mice. INTERVENTION(S): Inner cell mass (ICM) cells of blastocysts were cultured or commercially available ESCs were maintained in LIF-free or LIF-containing medium on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cell morphology, LIF concentration, and mRNA expression. RESULT(S): The MEFs themselves secreted 146.5-175.3 pg/mL LIF in LIF-free medium. The ICM cells formed ESC-like colonies on MEF feeder, and E14 and R1 ESCs were successfully maintained in LIF-free medium. Expression of the genes either mediating LIF function or regulating stemness was not altered significantly, and change in the growth of ESCs was not prominent in LIF-free medium. Neither mRNA expression of differentiation-related genes nor differentiation into embryoid body was changed in the ESCs. CONCLUSION(S): Addition of LIF to culture medium is not necessary for establishing ICM-derived ESC-like colonies in the presence of fibroblast monolayer, and established ESCs can be maintained in an LIF-free medium.","['Lee, Jae Hee', 'Lee, Eun Ju', 'Lee, Chae Hyun', 'Park, Jun Hong', 'Han, Jae Yong', 'Lim, Jeong Mook']","['Lee JH', 'Lee EJ', 'Lee CH', 'Park JH', 'Han JY', 'Lim JM']","['Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Clinical Research Institute, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Agricultural Biotechnology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea; Research Institute for Agriculture and Life Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.

World-wide, more than one million women will be diagnosed with breast cancer annually. In 2007, more than 175,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States. However, deaths due to breast cancer have decreased in the recent years in part because of improved screening techniques, surgical interventions, understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, and utilization of traditional chemotherapies in a more efficacious manner. One of the more exciting areas of improvement in the treatment of breast cancer is the entrance of novel therapies now available to oncologists. In the field of cancer therapeutics, the area of targeted and biologic therapies has been progressing at a rapid rate, particularly in the treatment of breast cancer.Since the advent of imatinib for the successful treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia in the 2001, clinicians have been searching for comparable therapies that could be as efficacious and as tolerable. In order for targeted therapies to be effective, the agent must be able to inhibit critical regulatory pathways which promote tumor cell growth and proliferation. The targets must be identifiable, quantifiable and capable of being interrupted.In the field of breast cancer, two advances in targeted therapy have led to great strides in the understanding and treatment of breast cancer, namely hormonal therapy for estrogen positive receptor breast cancer and antibodies directed towards the inhibition of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2. These advances have revolutionized the understanding and the treatment strategies for breast cancer. Building upon these successes, a host of novel agents are currently being investigated and used in clinical trials that will hopefully prove to be as fruitful. This review will focus on novel therapies in the field of breast cancer with a focus on metastatic breast cancer (MBC) and updates from the recent annual ASCO meeting and contains a summary of the results.","['Chu, David', 'Lu, Janice']","['Chu D', 'Lu J']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York, USA. david.chu@stonybrook.edu']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20081001,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Congresses as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans']",PMC2579406,2008/10/03 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-16 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Oct 1;1:16. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-16.,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Point mutations within the ABL kinase domain of the BCR-ABL fusion protein are a major underlying cause of resistance. Of the known imatinib-resistant mutations, the most frequently occurring involve the ATP-binding loop (P-loop). In vitro evidence has suggested that these mutations are more oncogenic with respect to other mutations and wild type BCR-ABL. Dasatinib and nilotinib have been approved for second-line treatment of patients with CML who demonstrate resistance (or intolerance) to imatinib. Both agents have marked activity in patients resistant to imatinib; however, they have differential activity against certain mutations, including those of the P-loop. Data from clinical trials suggest that dasatinib may be more effective vs. nilotinib for treating patients harboring P-loop mutations. Other mutations that are differentially sensitive to the second-line tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) include F317L and F359I/V, which are more sensitive to nilotinib and dasatinib, respectively. P-loop status in patients with CML and the potency of TKIs against P-loop mutations are key determinants for prognosis and response to treatment. This communication reviews the clinical importance of P-loop mutations and the efficacy of the currently available TKIs against them.","['Cang, Shundong', 'Liu, Delong']","['Cang S', 'Liu D']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA. cangshundong@163.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20081001,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC2567340,2008/10/03 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-15 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-15 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Oct 1;1:15. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-15.,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C/EBPdelta is highly expressed in G0 growth arrested mammary epithelial cells (MECs) and ""loss of function"" alterations in C/EBPdelta have been associated with impaired contact inhibition, increased genomic instability and increased cell migration. Reduced C/EBPdelta expression has also been reported in breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). C/EBPdelta functions as a transcriptional activator, however, only a limited number of C/EBPdelta target genes have been reported. As a result, the role of C/EBPdelta in growth control and the potential mechanisms by which ""loss of function"" alterations in C/EBPdelta contribute to tumorigenesis are poorly understood. The goals of the present study were to identify C/EBPdelta target genes using Chromatin Immunoprecipitation coupled with a CpG Island (HCG12K) Array gene chip (""ChIP-chip"") assay and to assess the expression and potential functional roles of C/EBPdelta target genes in growth control. RESULTS: ChIP-chip assays identified approximately 100 C/EBPdelta target gene loci which were classified by gene ontology (GO) into cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, signal transduction, intermediary metabolism, gene transcription, DNA repair and solute transport categories. Conventional ChIP assays validated the ChIP-chip results and demonstrated that 14/14 C/EBPdelta target loci were bound by C/EBPdelta in G0 growth arrested MCF-12A MECs. Gene-specific RT-PCR analysis also demonstrated C/EBPdelta-inducible expression of 14/14 C/EBPdelta target genes in G0 growth arrested MCF-12A MECs. Finally, expression of endogenous C/EBPdelta and selected C/EBPdelta target genes was also demonstrated in contact-inhibited G0 growth arrested nontransformed human MCF-10A MECs and in mouse HC11 MECs. The results demonstrate consistent activation and downstream function of C/EBPdelta in growth arrested human and murine MECs. CONCLUSION: C/EBPdelta target genes were identified by a global gene array approach and classified into functional categories that are consistent with biological contexts in which C/EBPdelta is induced, such as contact-mediated G0 growth arrest, apoptosis, metabolism and inflammation. The identification and validation of C/EBPdelta target genes provides new insights into the mechanistic role of C/EBPdelta in mammary epithelial cell biology and sheds new light on the potential impact of ""loss of function"" alterations in C/EBPdelta in tumorigenesis.","['Zhang, Yingjie', 'Liu, Tong', 'Yan, Pearlly', 'Huang, Tim', 'Dewille, Jim']","['Zhang Y', 'Liu T', 'Yan P', 'Huang T', 'Dewille J']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. zhang.321@osu.edu']",['eng'],"['R29 CA057607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57607-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20081001,England,BMC Mol Biol,BMC molecular biology,100966983,['142662-43-9 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-delta/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/*metabolism', 'Mammary Glands, Human/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*genetics']",PMC2576343,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/10/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2199-9-83 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2199-9-83 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Mol Biol. 2008 Oct 1;9:83. doi: 10.1186/1471-2199-9-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to other gender combinations, female donor/male recipient (FDMR) transplants are associated with increased graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), increased transplant-related mortality (TRM) and reduced risk of relapse. Still, their relative impact on transplant outcome remains controversial. We analyzed donor/recipient sex combination in 53,988 patients treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between 1980 and 2005. We found a strong increase in chronic GvHD and late TRM and decreased survival in FDMR transplants irrespective of underlying disease. Conversely, FDMR patients had lower relapse rates. The negative effect on survival decreased with advancing disease stage as relapse protection became more important. Effects of H-Y alloreactivity were most pronounced in patients transplanted from HLA-matched donors and in those receiving transplants from an adult donor. Adjustment for acute and chronic GvHD only partially corrected the effects of H-Y alloreactivity. Analysis of the FDMR proportion over time indicated that the frequency of this gender combination has declined in unrelated transplants over the last 10 years. These data define the role of H-Y mismatching in allogeneic HSCT and support the current practice of avoiding female donors for male patients, if possible.","['Stern, M', 'Brand, R', 'de Witte, T', 'Sureda, A', 'Rocha, V', 'Passweg, J', 'Baldomero, H', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Gratwohl, A']","['Stern M', 'Brand R', 'de Witte T', 'Sureda A', 'Rocha V', 'Passweg J', 'Baldomero H', 'Niederwieser D', 'Gratwohl A']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland. sternm@uhbs.ch']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Histocompatibility/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation Immunology/genetics']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2009/03/27 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['AJT2374 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02374.x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2008 Oct;8(10):2149-57. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-6143.2008.02374.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ANIMALS: 8 dogs with IBD (IBD dogs) and 8 healthy control dogs. PROCEDURES: Biopsy specimens of the duodenum and colon were obtained via endoscopy from dogs with IBD before and after 10 weeks of standard treatment and compared with specimens obtained from control dogs. Expression of activated caspase 3 (Casp3), caspase-cleaved fragment p85 from poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was measured in the duodenal (villous tip and base) and colonic mucosae. RESULTS: Expression of Casp3 was greater in the duodenal villous tips of control dogs, compared with expression in similar tissues from dogs with IBD before or after treatment. Despite clinical improvement of dogs with IBD, expression of Casp3 did not increase after treatment. Expression of PARP did not differ between groups at any time point. Expression of Bcl-2 was greater at all 3 tissue sites in control dogs, compared with expression at the same sites in dogs with IBD. Furthermore, Bcl-2 expression in duodenal villous tips was higher in dogs with IBD after treatment but was not higher elsewhere. In control dogs, expression patterns for all 3 markers were similar between sites (villous tip > villous base > colon). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Expression of Casp3 in lymphocytes in duodenal villous tips was significantly reduced in dogs with IBD, compared with expression in healthy dogs, but no increase was detected following successful treatment of IBD. Increased expression of Bcl-2 may be a potential marker of the success of treatment.","['Dandrieux, Julien R', 'Bornand, Valerie F', 'Doherr, Marcus G', 'Kano, Rui', 'Zurbriggen, Andreas', 'Burgener, Iwan A']","['Dandrieux JR', 'Bornand VF', 'Doherr MG', 'Kano R', 'Zurbriggen A', 'Burgener IA']","['Division of Small Animal Internal Medicine, Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Colon/cytology/pathology', 'Colonoscopy', 'Dog Diseases/*pathology', 'Dogs', 'Duodenum/cytology/pathology', 'Endoscopy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/pathology/*veterinary', 'Intestinal Mucosa/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Stomach/pathology']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.69.10.1279 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2008 Oct;69(10):1279-85. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.69.10.1279.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An assay for monitoring specific protein changes in response to MetAP2 inhibition, allowing pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) models to be established, could dramatically improve clinical decision-making. Candidate MetAP2-specific protein substrates were discovered from undigested cell culture-derived proteomes by MALDI-/SELDI-MS profiling and a biochemical method using (35)S-Met labeled protein lysates. Substrates were identified either as intact proteins by FT-ICR-MS or applying in-gel protease digestions followed by LC-MS/MS. The combination of these approaches led to the discovery of novel MetAP2-specific substrates including thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1), SH3 binding glutamic acid rich-like protein (SH3BGRL), and eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2). These studies also confirmed glyceraldehye 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and cyclophillin A (CypA) as MetAP2 substrates. Additional data in support of these proteins as MetAP2-specific substrates were provided by in vitro MetAP1/MetAP2 enzyme assays with the corresponding N-terminal derived peptides and 1D/2D Western analyses of cellular and tissue lysates. FT-ICR-MS characterization of all intact species of the 18 kDa substrate, CypA, enabled a SELDI-MS cell-based assay to be developed for correlating N-terminal processing and inhibition of proliferation.

These findings suggest that MELhipod8 cells could provide a mechanism for downregulation of the AHSP gene in prion diseases.","['Otsuka, Yayoi', 'Ito, Daisuke', 'Katsuoka, Kayoko', 'Arashiki, Nobuto', 'Komatsu, Tomohiko', 'Inaba, Mutsumi']","['Otsuka Y', 'Ito D', 'Katsuoka K', 'Arashiki N', 'Komatsu T', 'Inaba M']","['Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, Graduate School of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Jpn J Vet Res,The Japanese journal of veterinary research,0376567,"['0 (Ahsp protein, mouse)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (PrPC Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'PrPC Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,2008/10/03 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/10/03 09:00'],"['2008/10/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Vet Res. 2008 Aug;56(2):75-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying and managing loss of response.,673-83,,"Imatinib is widely recognized as the standard of care in the first-line treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); however, resistance can limit its long-term benefits. Early identification of the loss of response to imatinib is therefore important for the optimal management of patients with this type of leukemia. Cytogenetic and molecular responses during the first 12 months of treatment have been shown to predict future responses (complete cytogenetic response and major molecular response) and reduce disease progression. The degree of early reduction in BCR-ABL levels after commencing imatinib therapy is a good indicator of subsequent response. Monitoring for kinase domain mutations should also be considered in patients with suboptimal response or in those who demonstrate resistance. Modification of the treatment strategy is required if there is a loss of response. Dasatinib and nilotinib are the most extensively studied second-generation BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and are currently approved for treating patients following imatinib failure.","['Zeidan, Amer', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Zeidan A', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']","['Division of Hospital Medicine, Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol,Clinical advances in hematology & oncology : H&O,101167661,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",,2008/10/02 09:00,2009/05/06 09:00,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Adv Hematol Oncol. 2008 Sep;6(9):673-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB (effusion) or IV, performance status 0 to 1, and adequate organ function were eligible. Treatment with docetaxel 75 mg/m followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m over 1 hour day 1 with darbepoetin 200 mug day 1 and pegfilgrastim 6 mg day 2 without/with BNP7787 before cisplatin was repeated every other week for up to 6 cycles. The primary end point was to differentiate between grade >/=2 neurotoxicity rates of 30% on [A] and 10% on [B]. Feasibility was prospectively defined as febrile neutropenia in <10% of patients and </=1 treatment delay per cycles 1 to 3 and 4 to 6 in <20% of patients. RESULTS: Of 160 patients enrolled, 5 never started therapy and 4 were ineligible. Neurotoxicity grade >/=2 occurred in 32% on [A] and 29% on [B]. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was 4% on [A] and 3% on [B]. Treatment delays occurred in 13% and 20% of patients on [A] and [B], respectively. Completion rates for 3/6 cycles were 84%/51% on [A] and 84%/53% on [B]. Objective response rates were 55% on [A] and 51% on [B]. Median progression-free/overall survival times were 5.5/10.7 on [A] and 6.5/14.1 month on [B]. CONCLUSIONS: This dose-dense treatment regimen is active, feasible, and tolerable. Its further investigation in the curative setting in non-small cell lung cancer should be considered.

In our phase I trial of DT-granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GMCSF), a truncated DT linked to human GMCSF, in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia, patients with high concentrations of preexisting anti-DT IgG (>2.5 microg/ml) had significantly lower DT-GMCSF concentrations. This study details the fate of anti-DT IgG during the patient's treatment with DT-GMCSF and describes how we could lower anti-DT IgG concentrations and increase the patient's exposure to DT-GMCSF. Using an enzyme immunoassay, we measured anti-DT IgG concentrations before the first cycle of treatment (baseline) and on day 2 (after one dose of DT-GMCSF) and on day 5 (after four doses of DT-GMCSF). Thirty-three patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia in the phase 1 trial received DT-GMCSF at doses from 1 to 5 microg/kg/day intravenously for 5 days. The mean anti-DT IgG concentration pretherapy was 1.3 microg/ml (range: undetectable to 7.8) and significantly decreased to a mean concentration of 0.7 microg/ml on day 2 (P=0.007) and to 0.5 microg/ml on day 5 (P<0.0001). In two individuals in whom we measured DT-GMCSF concentrations on day 1 and day 5, we observed that a decrease in anti-DT IgG concentrations was associated with an increase in DT-GMCSF concentrations. No relationship was observed between dose of DT-GMCSF and the absolute change in anti-DT IgG concentrations on day 2 (r=-0.01, P=0.98) or day 5 (r=-0.12, P=0.53). For patients with high baseline anti-DT IgG concentrations, a single dose of DT-GMCSF could be used to lower the anti-DT IgG concentrations and potentially result in a significant increase in DT-GMCSF concentrations and efficacy.","['Hall, Philip D', 'Beagle, Kathryn L', 'Garrett-Mayer, Elizabeth', 'Frankel, Arthur E']","['Hall PD', 'Beagle KL', 'Garrett-Mayer E', 'Frankel AE']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy and Outcome Sciences, South Carolina College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, 274 Calhoun Street, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. hallpd@musc.edu']",['eng'],['R01 CA 90263/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Diphtheria Toxin/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2008/10/02 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328310894f [doi]', '00001813-200811000-00009 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Nov;19(10):1007-11. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328310894f.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present communication, we investigated the mechanisms behind this observation both at the cell and tissue level. The mechanisms were investigated by performing cytotoxicity, cell uptake, and biodistribution experiments. In the presence of cytidine deaminase, SQdFdC nanoassemblies resisted deamination and exerted significant anticancer activity in vitro against RNK-16 LGL leukemia cells, whereas the cytotoxicity of free gemcitabine decreased by approximately 83-fold, indicating its degradation due to deamination. Additionally, the SQdFdC showed considerably higher intracellular accumulation and retention compared with gemcitabine (P<0.05). Unlike gemcitabine, the cellular access to SQdFdC was not influenced by nucleoside transporters. When administered orally to rats, unlike H-gemcitabine, the H-SQdFdC absorbed slowly, but exhibited an improved pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution profile, particularly in the lymphoid organs (the major organs of metastasis). The resistance to deamination, followed by the improved pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution, and greater accumulation and retention at the level of cancer cells, are the key factors for the superiority of SQdFdC nanoassemblies over free gemcitabine against RNK-16 LGL leukemia in rats.","['Reddy, Lakkireddy Harivardhan', 'Ferreira, Humberto', 'Dubernet, Catherine', 'Mouelhi, Sinda Lepetre', 'Desmaele, Didier', 'Rousseau, Bernard', 'Couvreur, Patrick']","['Reddy LH', 'Ferreira H', 'Dubernet C', 'Mouelhi SL', 'Desmaele D', 'Rousseau B', 'Couvreur P']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Paris-Sud XI, UMR CNRS 8076 Biocis, Chatenay-Malabry Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (4-(N)-tris-nor-qualenoyl-gemcitabine)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '7QWM220FJH (Squalene)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', '*Nanomedicine', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Squalene/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",,2008/10/02 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283126585 [doi]', '00001813-200811000-00008 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Nov;19(10):999-1006. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e3283126585.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apogossypolone (ApoG2), the most potent gossypol derivative, has been classified as a novel small-molecule inhibitor of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Here, we assessed the in-vitro cytotoxicity of ApoG2 on human U937 lymphoma cells, and explored the underlying intracellular molecular mechanisms of ApoG2. Using the WST-8 assay, we found that ApoG2 inhibited growth of U937 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, and the IC50 values were 30.08, 14.81, and 9.26 mumol/l for 24, 48, and 72 h treatments, respectively. ApoG2 also induced apoptosis in U937 cells, as noted through changes in morphological characteristics, including cellular internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and the appearance of a sub-G1 apoptotic peak. Treatment with ApoG2 downregulated Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 protein expression and blocked the binding of Bcl-2 with Bax protein. Furthermore, ApoG2 led to an abundant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria and a five-fold increase in the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Taken together, our results suggest that ApoG2 could effectively suppress the growth of human lymphoma cell line U937 through the inhibition of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and the induction of mitochondria-dependent apoptotic cell death.","['Sun, Jian', 'Li, Zhi-Ming', 'Hu, Zhe-Yu', 'Lin, Xu-Bin', 'Zhou, Ning-Ning', 'Xian, Li-Jian', 'Yang, Da-Jun', 'Jiang, Wen-Qi']","['Sun J', 'Li ZM', 'Hu ZY', 'Lin XB', 'Zhou NN', 'Xian LJ', 'Yang DJ', 'Jiang WQ']","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in Southern China, and Cancer Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, P.R.

In recent years, most research efforts in CML have been devoted to developing novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as well as to elucidating the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and other TKIs. Nonetheless, primordial aspects of the pathogenesis of CML, such as the mechanisms responsible for the transition from chronic phase to blast crisis, the causes of genomic instability and faulty DNA repair, the phenomenon of stem cell quiescence, the role of tumor suppressors in TKI resistance and CML progression, or the cross-talk between BCR-ABL1 and other oncogenic signaling pathways, still remain poorly understood.

Besides hepatomegaly, growth retardation, hypoglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hyperuricemia and hyperlipidemia, patients suffer from neutropenia associated with functional defects predisposing for severe infections. In order to attenuate these complications, long-term treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is common but this is associated with an increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with inherited bone marrow failures such as severe congenital neutropenia. Onset of these myeloid malignancies is linked to cytogenetic aberrations involving chromosome 7. In addition, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is known to stimulate proliferation of monosomy 7 cells in vitro. To our knowledge, we report for the first time a case report of a patient with glycogen storage disease type Ib, who developed acute myeloid leukemia with a classical monosomy 7 and acute myeloid leukemia-associated translocation t(3;8)(q26;q24) after 14 years of continuous treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-year-old Turkish man with glycogen storage disease type Ib was admitted to our department because of dyspnea and increasing fatigue. He also presented with gum bleeding, bone pain in his legs, night sweats, recurrent episodes of fever with temperatures up to 39 degrees C and hepatosplenomegaly.A blood count taken on the day of admission showed pancytopenia and a differential count displayed 30% blasts. A bone marrow biopsy was taken which showed a hypercellular marrow with dysplastic features of all three cell lines, while blast count was 20%. Classical cytogenetic analyses as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a monosomy 7 with a translocation t(3;8)(q26;q24). Based on these findings, the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia was made. CONCLUSION: Our observations suggest that bone marrow examinations including cytogenetic analysis should be carried out on a regular basis in patients with glycogen storage disease type Ib who are on long-term treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor for severe neutropenia, since this treatment might also contribute to an increased risk for acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Schroeder, Thomas', 'Hildebrandt, Barbara', 'Mayatepek, Ertan', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Haas, Rainer']","['Schroeder T', 'Hildebrandt B', 'Mayatepek E', 'Germing U', 'Haas R']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Duesseldorf, Germany. thomas.schroeder@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080930,England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,,,PMC2566578,2008/10/02 09:00,2008/10/02 09:01,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/02 09:01 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['1752-1947-2-319 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-2-319 [doi]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2008 Sep 30;2:319. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-2-319.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it has a potentially fatal clinical outcome. We herein present the case of a 39-year-old man, who presented to our emergency room with horizontal diplopic images, vertigo, bilateral deafness, and progressing somnolence. Cerebral imaging revealed cerebral and cerebellar edema and a diffuse leukoencephalopathy. With the one-year-old history of an initially successfully treated FAB-M0 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in mind, a lumbar puncture was carried out that showed a vast number of myeloid blasts in the morphologic analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid. In conjunction with normal findings in the peripheral blood-count with differential and the bone marrow examination a diagnosis of an isolated CNS relapse of the AML was made. Cytarabine chemotherapy was initiated and the symptoms resolved rapidly. To our surprise, cerebral imaging in the course of the treatment not only showed a resolution of the brain edema but also of the leukoencephalopathy, pointing to a direct infiltration of brain parenchyma by leukemic blasts. The case highlights the relevance of the CNS as a pharmacologic ""sanctuary"" for tumor cells in patients that on prior treatments have not received intrathecal chemotherapy or chemotherapeutics that cross the blood-brain barrier.","['Schumann, Michael', 'Kiewe, Philipp', 'Hartlieb, Sissel', 'Neumann, Martin', 'Schilling, Andreas', 'Koch, Hans-Christian', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Korfel, Agnieszka']","['Schumann M', 'Kiewe P', 'Hartlieb S', 'Neumann M', 'Schilling A', 'Koch HC', 'Thiel E', 'Korfel A']","['Department of Gastroenterology, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Charite, Berlin, Germany. michael.schumann@charite.de']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20090927,United States,J Neuroimaging,Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging,9102705,,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Edema/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Leukoencephalopathies/*diagnosis/*etiology', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Recurrence']",,2008/10/02 09:00,2010/09/30 06:00,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['JON300 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1552-6569.2008.00300.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimaging. 2010 Apr;20(2):198-200. doi: 10.1111/j.1552-6569.2008.00300.x.

Br. and its mechanism of anti-angiogenesis effect. METHODS: MTT assay and ELISA were used to detect the proliferation and the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of chronic myelogenous leukemia K562, ovarian neoplasm SKOV3, colon carcinoma HT-29 and bladder cancer T24 cell lines respectively. The expression of fetal liver kinase (Flk-1) protein and mRNA in endothelial cells induced by VEGF was analyzed by Western blotting and RT-PCR. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate part of alcohol extract from seeds of Livistona chinensis R. Br. could selectively inhibit the proliferation of HT-29 and T24 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner, the maximum inhibitory rate were 74.66% and 86.52%, and could significantly inhibit the secretion of VEGF protein of the four tumor cell lines. The petroleum ether part had similar inhibitory effect as well as the ethyl acetate part, but its potency was inferior to the ethyl acetate part, the maximum inhibitory rate were 43.80% and 38.67%, the water-soluble and n-butanol parts had no effect on different tumor cell lines. The ethyl acetate part could reduce significantly the expression of Flk-1 protein and mRNA of HUVEC induced by VEGF. CONCLUSION: The ethyl acetate part, which is considered as active part of alcohol extract from seeds of Livistona chinensis R. Br., has fine anti-tumor activity, and its mechanism might be associated with reducing VEGF protein secretion and inhibiting the expression of Flk-1 mRNA and protein.","['Wang, Hui', 'Li, Ao', 'Dong, Xiao-Ping', 'Xu, Xiao-Yu']","['Wang H', 'Li A', 'Dong XP', 'Xu XY']","['College of Pharmacy, Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Chengdu 611137, China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhong Yao Cai,Zhong yao cai = Zhongyaocai = Journal of Chinese medicinal materials,9426370,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Pregnadienediols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)', 'Y0PC411K4T (anecortave acetate)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Arecaceae/*chemistry', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Ethanol', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Pregnadienediols', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Seeds/chemistry', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*metabolism']",,2008/10/02 09:00,2009/10/14 06:00,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/14 06:00 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhong Yao Cai. 2008 May;31(5):718-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lactic acidosis is likewise an uncommon complication of hematological malignancy associated mainly with leukemia and lymphoma. Most cases of NICTH and lactic acidosis have been described in the adult population. We report a child with congenital HIV and AIDS who developed Burkitt's lymphoma, lactic acidosis and NICTH. PATIENT: An 11 year-old boy with AIDS, cerebral palsy and seizure disorder presented with intractable hypoglycemia 12 days after diagnosis of Burkitt's lymphoma. He had persistent hypoglycemia (serum glucose 20-40 mg/dl; 1.1-2.2 mmo/l) despite glucose infusion rate of 6 mg/kg/minute and trial of diazoxide treatment. Critical sample obtained at time of hypoglycemia showed insulin at 1.78 microU/ml (normal <5 microU/ml), pro-insulin 5.6 pmol/l (<18.8 pmol/l), IGF-I <25 ng/ml (80-723 ng/ml), IGF-II 422 ng/ml (610-1,217 ng/ml), lactate 15.6 mmol/l (normal: 0.5-2.2 mmol/l), cortisol 21 microg/dl (580 nmol/l; normal >10 microg/dl; 276 nmol/l), and negative insulin antibodies. He remained alert and seizure free despite profound hypoglycemia. A 1 mg glucagon stimulation test showed a rise in serum glucose of 29 mg/dl (>1.6 mmol/l). Continuous glucagon infusion at 0.15-0.3 mg/h maintained euglycemia until the time of his demise (1 month after admission) due to complications of his underlying illness. CONCLUSION: We present a case of lactic acidosis and NICTH in an 11 year-old boy with AIDS and Burkitts's lymphoma. We review the mechanism of hyperlacticacidemia in supporting cerebral function during profound hypoglycemia. NICTH and lactic acidosis in association with malignancy carries a poor prognosis. In this patient, continuous glucagon infusion was a successful alternative to corticosteroid treatment in maintaining euglycemia.","['Rastogi, Maynika V', 'Desai, Ninad', 'Quintos, J B']","['Rastogi MV', 'Desai N', 'Quintos JB']","[""King's County Hospital Center and Children's Hospital at Downstate, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, NY, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab,Journal of pediatric endocrinology & metabolism : JPEM,9508900,,IM,"['Acidosis, Lactic/*complications/*diagnosis', 'Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications/congenital', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications', 'Child', 'Fatal Outcome', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemia/*complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male']",,2008/10/02 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/10/02 09:00'],"['2008/10/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/jpem.2008.21.8.805 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol Metab. 2008 Aug;21(8):805-10. doi: 10.1515/jpem.2008.21.8.805.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual unfixed, paraformaldehyde-fixed, and methanol-fixed normal and transformed lymphocytes from three different cell lines were analyzed with LTRS. When compared to the spectra of unfixed cells, the fixed cell spectra show clear, reproducible changes in the intensity of specific Raman markers commonly assigned to DNA, RNA, protein, and lipid vibrations (e.g. 785, 1230, 1305, 1660 cm(-1)) in mammalian cells, many of which are important markers that have been used to discriminate between normal and cancer lymphocytes. Statistical analyses of the Raman data and classification using principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis indicate that methanol fixation induces a greater change in the Raman spectra than paraformaldehyde. In addition, we demonstrate that the spectral changes as a result of the fixation process have an adverse effect on the accurate Raman discrimination of the normal and cancer cells. The spectral artifacts created by the use of fixatives indicate that the method of cell preparation is an important parameter to consider when applying Raman spectroscopy to characterize, image, or differentiate between different fixed cell samples to avoid potential misinterpretation of the data.","['Chan, James W', 'Taylor, Douglas S', 'Thompson, Deanna L']","['Chan JW', 'Taylor DS', 'Thompson DL']","['Applied Physics and Biophysics Division, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, CA 94550, USA. chan19@llnl.gov']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (Fixatives)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Cells/*cytology', 'Fixatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Methanol', 'Spectrum Analysis, Raman/methods', 'Tissue Fixation']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bip.21094 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2009 Feb;91(2):132-9. doi: 10.1002/bip.21094.,,,,,,,,,,"['2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,

In this study, the authors evaluated the safety and efficacy of arsenic trioxide combined with low-dose cytarabine in untreated patients aged >or=60 years with AML. METHODS: In a phase 1/2 design, arsenic trioxide was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg on Days 1 through 5 and on Days 8 through 12, and low-dose cytarabine was given subcutaneously twice daily on Days 1 through 14 in escalating doses to a target of 10 mg/m(2) per dose. Of 64 patients who had pathologically confirmed AML, excluding patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia and using World Health Organization criteria, the median age was 71 years, 10 patients (16%) had treatment-related AML, 40 patients (63%) had an antecedent myelodysplastic syndrome or myeloproliferative disorder, and 35 patients (55%) had unfavorable cytogenetics. Thirty-four patients (53%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or 3. RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 21 of 61 patients (34%), including 15 of 50 patients (30%) who had secondary or treatment-related AML, 10 of 33 patients (30%) who had unfavorable cytogenetics, and 6 of 34 patients (18%) who had a poor baseline performance status. The mortality rate within the first 4 weeks was 8%. Neutropenic fever was observed in >80% of patients, and 41% of patients had bacteremia. Nonhematologic toxicity generally was mild and reversible and included fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, rash, peripheral edema, and elevated transaminases. There were no clinically significant cardiac arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of arsenic trioxide to low-dose cytarabine appeared to improve responses in elderly patients who had AML compared with either agent alone, and a randomized trial of the combination versus single-agent low-dose cytarabine is ongoing.","['Roboz, Gail J', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Curcio, Tania', 'Provenzano, Juliette', 'Carlin, Rebecca', 'Samuel, Michael', 'Wittenberg, Beth', 'Mazumdar, Madhu', 'Christos, Paul J', 'Mathew, Susan', 'Allen-Bard, Sandra', 'Feldman, Eric J']","['Roboz GJ', 'Ritchie EK', 'Curcio T', 'Provenzano J', 'Carlin R', 'Samuel M', 'Wittenberg B', 'Mazumdar M', 'Christos PJ', 'Mathew S', 'Allen-Bard S', 'Feldman EJ']","['Leukemia Program, Weill Medical College of Cornell University and New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York 10021, USA. gar2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23855 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Nov 1;113(9):2504-11. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23855.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we aimed to investigate the effects of simvastatin on chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells in vitro and in vivo, and to elucidate the mechanisms. METHODS: Cell proliferation and cell cycle were measured after K562 cells were incubated with simvastatin, and differentially expressed genes were determined by oligonucleotide microarray. Changes of 2 genes obtained by oligonucleotide microarray were validated by real-time RT-PCR, and immunohistochemistry was performed to determine expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Finally, a xenograft tumor model was constructed to evaluate the effects of simvastatin in vivo. RESULTS: Simvastatin could inhibit K562 cell proliferation, and the inhibition rate was approximately 30% after treatment with 20 mumol/l simvastatin for 48 h. Cell cycle was arrested in G(1) phase, as shown by flow cytometry results. Fifteen downregulated, 9 upregulated cell cycle-related genes and decreased PCNA protein were observed in the presence of simvastatin. Furthermore, simvastatin exhibited impairment of xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and also blocked cell cycle in G(1) phase. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin can inhibit CML cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, and its mechanisms might be involved in cell cycle regulation.","['Yang, Yong-Chang', 'Huang, Wen-Fang', 'Chuan, Liang-Min', 'Xiao, Dai-Wen', 'Zeng, Ya-Li', 'Zhou, Ding-An', 'Xu, Guo-Qiang', 'Liu, Wen', 'Huang, Bo', 'Hu, Qi']","['Yang YC', 'Huang WF', 'Chuan LM', 'Xiao DW', 'Zeng YL', 'Zhou DA', 'Xu GQ', 'Liu W', 'Huang B', 'Hu Q']","[""Clinical Laboratory Department, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, China.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080930,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PCNP protein, human)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['000158663 [pii]', '10.1159/000158663 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2008;54(6):438-46. doi: 10.1159/000158663.

METHODS: Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a retrospectively ascertained cohort study that prospectively tracks the health status of adults who were diagnosed with childhood cancer between 1970 and 1986 and a comparison group of siblings. Changes in BMI from baseline enrollment to time of completion of follow-up (mean interval, 7.8 years) were calculated for 1,451 ALL survivors (mean age, 32.3 years at follow-up) and 2,167 siblings of childhood cancer survivors (mean age, 35.9 years). RESULTS: The mean BMI of the CCSS sibling comparison group increased with age (women, 0.25 units/yr, 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.28 units; men, 0.23 units/yr, 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.25 units). Compared with CCSS siblings, ALL survivors who were treated with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) had a significantly greater increase in BMI (women, 0.41 units/yr, 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.45 units; men, 0.29 units/yr; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.32 units). The rate of BMI increase was not significantly increased for ALL survivors who were treated with chemotherapy alone. Younger age at CRT exposure significantly modified risk. CONCLUSION: CRT used in the treatment of childhood ALL is associated with a greater rate of increasing BMI, particularly among women treated with CRT during the first decade of life. Health care professionals should be aware of this risk and interventions to reduce or manage weight gain are essential in this high-risk population.","['Garmey, Edward G', 'Liu, Qi', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Meacham, Lillian R', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Stovall, Marilyn A', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Oeffinger, Kevin C']","['Garmey EG', 'Liu Q', 'Sklar CA', 'Meacham LR', 'Mertens AC', 'Stovall MA', 'Yasui Y', 'Robison LL', 'Oeffinger KC']","['Department of Pediatrics and Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100474-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-100474/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA-55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Height', '*Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Humans', 'Linear Models', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Obesity/*epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors']",PMC2653124,2008/10/01 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/28/4639 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3527 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 1;26(28):4639-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.3527.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Available drugs are antiquated, toxic, and compromised by emerging resistance. The indenoisoquinolines are a class of noncamptothecin topoisomerase IB poisons that are under development as anticancer agents. We tested a variety of indenoisoquinolines for their ability to kill T. brucei. Indenoisoquinolines proved trypanocidal at submicromolar concentrations in vitro. Structure-activity analysis yielded motifs that enhanced potency, including alkylamino substitutions on N-6, methoxy groups on C-2 and C-3, and a methylenedioxy bridge between C-8 and C-9. Detailed analysis of eight water-soluble indenoisoquinolines demonstrated that in trypanosomes the compounds inhibited DNA synthesis and acted as topoisomerase poisons. Testing these compounds on L1210 mouse leukemia cells revealed that all eight were more effective against trypanosomes than against mammalian cells. In preliminary in vivo experiments one compound delayed parasitemia and extended survival in mice subjected to a lethal trypanosome challenge. The indenoisoquinolines provide a promising lead for the development of drugs against sleeping sickness.","['Bakshi, Rahul P', 'Sang, Dongpei', 'Morrell, Andrew', 'Cushman, Mark', 'Shapiro, Theresa A']","['Bakshi RP', 'Sang D', 'Morrell A', 'Cushman M', 'Shapiro TA']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA. rbakshi@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['R01 AI028855/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 AI028855/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI028855/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1 CA89566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA089566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080929,United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (DNA, Protozoan)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Trypanocidal Agents)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA, Protozoan/genetics', 'Isoquinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trypanocidal Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Trypanosoma brucei brucei/*drug effects/growth & development/metabolism']",PMC2612167,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/04/21 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['AAC.00650-07 [pii]', '10.1128/AAC.00650-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Jan;53(1):123-8. doi: 10.1128/AAC.00650-07.

Since STAT3 is dispensable in most normal tissue, targeted inhibition of STAT3 is an attractive therapy for patients with these cancers. To identify STAT3 inhibitors, we developed a transcriptionally based assay and screened a library of compounds known to be safe in humans. We found the drug nifuroxazide to be an effective inhibitor of STAT3 function. Nifuroxazide inhibits the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT3 in MM cells by reducing Jak kinase autophosphorylation, and leads to down-regulation of the STAT3 target gene Mcl-1. Nifuroxazide causes a decrease in viability of primary myeloma cells and myeloma cell lines containing STAT3 activation, but not normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although bone marrow stromal cells provide survival signals to myeloma cells, nifuroxazide can overcome this survival advantage. Reflecting the interaction of STAT3 with other cellular pathways, nifuroxazide shows enhanced cytotoxicity when combined with either the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide or the MEK inhibitor UO126. Therefore, using a mechanistic-based screen, we identified the clinically relevant drug nifuroxazide as a potent inhibitor of STAT signaling that shows cytotoxicity against myeloma cells that depend on STAT3 for survival.","['Nelson, Erik A', 'Walker, Sarah R', 'Kepich, Alicia', 'Gashin, Laurie B', 'Hideshima, Teru', 'Ikeda, Hiroshi', 'Chauhan, Dharminder', 'Anderson, Kenneth C', 'Frank, David A']","['Nelson EA', 'Walker SR', 'Kepich A', 'Gashin LB', 'Hideshima T', 'Ikeda H', 'Chauhan D', 'Anderson KC', 'Frank DA']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080929,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Hydroxybenzoates)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Nitrofurans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (U 0126)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'PM5LI0P38J (nifuroxazide)']",IM,"['Butadienes/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Depsipeptides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxybenzoates/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinases/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Nitrofurans/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC2597607,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51750-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-12-129718 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5095-102. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-12-129718.

Regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) promotes a Th1 response and is implicated as a physiologic tolerogenic factor; therefore, we studied its potential role in the trophoblast-maternal leukocyte dialog. METHODS: We performed co-cultures of immortalized trophoblast cell line (Swan 71) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from fertile women (n = 23) or with recurrent spontaneous abortions (n = 18, RSA). After 24 and 48 h, supernatant and cells were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, Western blot and apoptosis assay. To investigate the physiological effects at peripheral level, we co-cultured maternal and paternal PBMCs with conditioned media from Swan cells and progesterone. RESULTS: Following interaction of maternal PBMCs and trophoblast cells, RANTES production increased (P < 0.05) and was accompanied by low levels of interferon gamma, interleukin-12 p70 and high levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitrites and leukemia-inhibitory factor. RANTES production resulted in elevated apoptosis of potentially deleterious maternal CD3+ lymphocytes, accompanied by a decrease in the proliferative maternal response. During fetal-maternal dialog, the anti-RANTES antibody significantly reduced the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ cells (P < 0.05) and was associated with trophoblast cell survival. However, co-cultures of Swan cells and RSA-PBMCs displayed a differential RANTES kinetics, lower levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and CD3+annexin-V+cells, accompanied by higher levels of apoptotic trophoblast cells. CONCLUSIONS: RANTES promotes an adequate pro-implantatory microenvironment that influences trophoblast cell survival and modulates the balance of maternal Treg/T effector lymphocytes in favor of maternal tolerance.","['Fraccaroli, Laura', 'Alfieri, Julio', 'Larocca, Luciana', 'Calafat, Mario', 'Mor, Gil', 'Leiros, Claudia Perez', 'Ramhorst, Rosanna']","['Fraccaroli L', 'Alfieri J', 'Larocca L', 'Calafat M', 'Mor G', 'Leiros CP', 'Ramhorst R']","['Laboratory of Immunopharmacology, School of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Int.

A phase II study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of docetaxel/estramustine combined with exisulind, an apoptotic antineoplastic drug. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty men with chemotherapy-naive HRPC were enrolled in a multicenter, cooperative group study. The treatment regimen consisted of oral estramustine (280 mg 3 times daily for 5 days), docetaxel 70 mg/m2, oral exisulind (250 mg twice daily), oral dexamethasone (8 mg twice daily for 3 days), and oral warfarin (2 mg daily). RESULTS: Seventy-five eligible patients were treated with a median of 6 cycles of therapy. Fortyseven patients (62.7%; 95% CI, 50.7%-73.6%) had a > or = 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen levels. Forty-six patients had measurable disease with 6 partial responses (13%; 95% CI, 4.9%-26.3%). The main grade 3/4 toxicities were neutrophils (79%), fatigue (15%), and thrombosis/embolism (10%). The median time to first progression was 5.1 months (95% CI, 4.4-6.3 months) and the median survival time was 17.8 months (95% CI, 14.7-20.1 months). CONCLUSION: The combination of estramustine/docetaxel/exisulind was associated with significant thomboembolic toxicity despite prophylactic warfarin.

We have now sought to investigate mechanisms leading to the formation of multicellular spheroids and subsequent activation of fibroblasts (nemosis). Cell lines either lacking fibronectin expression (FN-/-) or expressing FN with a mutated integrin-binding site (FNRGE/RGE) were unable to form compact spheroids. Furthermore, inhibition of FN synthesis by siRNA or functional inhibition of FN or its integrins impaired spheroid formation (alpha5, beta1) and quenched fibroblast activation (alphaV). The integrin ligand GRGDSP hexapeptide interfered with spheroid formation and induced activation of fibroblasts. Surprisingly, a 70 kDa FN fragment, which prevents deposition of FN matrix but does not interfere with FN-integrin interaction, prevented spheroid formation only marginally and did not block the activation. Our results present a new mechanism of fibroblast activation, which is initiated by interaction of FN with its integrin receptors.","['Salmenpera, Pertteli', 'Kankuri, Esko', 'Bizik, Jozef', 'Siren, Vappu', 'Virtanen, Ismo', 'Takahashi, Seiichiro', 'Leiss, Michael', 'Fassler, Reinhard', 'Vaheri, Antti']","['Salmenpera P', 'Kankuri E', 'Bizik J', 'Siren V', 'Virtanen I', 'Takahashi S', 'Leiss M', 'Fassler R', 'Vaheri A']","['Haartman Institute, POB 21, FIN-00014 University of Helsinki, Finland. pertteli.salmenpera@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080919,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha5)', '0 (Integrin alphaV)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['Fibroblasts/*cytology/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha5/metabolism', 'Integrin alphaV/metabolism', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Spheroids, Cellular']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2008/12/20 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/06 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(08)00368-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.09.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2008 Nov 15;314(19):3444-52. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2008.09.004.

Molecular cloning revealed that NTP contained an open reading frame of 354bp encoding a polypeptide of 118 amino acids which included a 26-amino-acid signal peptide. An analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of NTP shows considerable sequence homology to the non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) of certain plants.

XMRV is the first MLV-related virus found in human infection. Forty percent (8/20) of familial prostate cancer patients homozygous for a mutation in RNase L (R462Q) were positive for XMRV, while the virus was rarely (1/66) detected in familial prostate cancer patients heterozygous for R462Q or carrying the wild type allele. OBJECTIVES: To determine the presence of XMRV in non-familial prostate cancer samples. STUDY DESIGN: RNA from prostate tissue was analyzed for XMRV using nested RT-PCR. In all samples, RNase L (R462Q) genotyping was performed using an allele-specific PCR. RESULTS: XMRV-specific sequences were detected in one of 105 tissue samples from non-familial prostate cancer patients and from one of 70 tissue samples from men without prostate cancer. The two XMRV-positive patients were wild type or heterozygous for the R462Q mutation and thus carried at least one fully functional RNase L allele.

The use of newer targeted therapies alone and in combination with chemotherapy may offer new hope of improving response to treatment. Dasatinib, a multi-target kinase inhibitor, is currently approved for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia and has shown promising results in preclinical studies in a number of solid tumours. METHODS: We examined the effects of dasatinib on proliferation, chemo-sensitivity, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, migration and invasion in human melanoma cell lines. Expression and activation of Src kinase, FAK and EphA2 were also examined in the melanoma cells. RESULTS: Dasatinib inhibited growth of three of the five melanoma cell lines. Comparison with sorafenib showed that in these three cell lines dasatinib inhibited growth at lower concentrations than sorafenib. Dasatinib in combination with the chemotherapy drug temozolomide showed greater efficacy than either drug alone. Dasatinib induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion of melanoma cells. Dasatinib inhibition of proliferation was associated with reduced phosphorylation of Src kinase, while decreased phosphorylation of FAK was implicated in dasatinib-mediated inhibition of migration and invasion in melanoma cells. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib has both anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects in melanoma cells and combined with chemotherapy may have clinical benefit in the treatment of malignant melanoma.","['Eustace, Alex J', 'Crown, John', 'Clynes, Martin', ""O'Donovan, Norma""]","['Eustace AJ', 'Crown J', 'Clynes M', ""O'Donovan N""]","['National Institute for Cellular Biotechnology, Dublin City University, Dublin 9, Ireland.

The best-characterised members are RhoA, Rac and Cdc42 that regulate many diverse actions such as actin cytoskeleton reorganisation, adhesion, motility as well as cell proliferation, differentiation and gene transcription. Among the 20 members of that family, only Rac2 and RhoH show an expression restricted to the haematopoietic lineage.RhoH was first discovered in 1995 as a fusion transcript with the transcriptional repressor LAZ3/BCL6. It was therefore initially named translation three four (TTF) but later on renamed RhoH due to its close relationship to the Ras/Rho family of GTPases. Since then, RhoH has been implicated in human cancer as the gene is subject to somatic hypermutation and by the detection of RHOH as a translocation partner for LAZ3/BCL6 or other genes in human lymphomas. Underexpression of RhoH is found in hairy cell leukaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia.Some of the amino acids that are crucial for GTPase activity are mutated in RhoH so that the protein is a GTPase-deficient, so-called atypical Rho GTPase. Therefore other mechanisms of regulating RhoH activity have been described. These include regulation at the mRNA level and tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein's unique ITAM-like motif. The C-terminal CaaX box of RhoH is mainly a target for farnesyl-transferase but can also be modified by geranylgeranyl-transferase. Isoprenylation of RhoH and changes in subcellular localisation may be an additional factor to fine-tune signalling.Little is currently known about its signalling, regulation or interaction partners. Recent studies have shown that RhoH negatively influences the proliferation and homing of murine haematopoietic progenitor cells, presumably by acting as an antagonist for Rac1. In leukocytes, RhoH is needed to keep the cells in a resting, non-adhesive state, but the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated.

We observed the excessive autophagy in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line, K562, associated with treatment of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which can induce K562 cells to differentiate into megakaryocytic lineage. Confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that autophagic cells did not express a megakaryocyte marker, the CD41 molecule, indicating that the autophagy was independent of megakaryocytic differentiation. After remarkable autophagic degradation, the cells finally underwent autophagic cell death (APCD). On the other hand, a block of TPA-induced autophagy by chloroquine rapidly promoted cell death that was not APCD. This result suggested that autophagy regulated two mechanisms in K562 cells: both the cell survival system and APCD. To confirm that autophagy regulates the cell survival system in K562 cells, imatinib was used to induce cell death in K562 cells. Autophagy has not been considered during imatinib treatment; nonetheless, co-treatment with imatinib and chloroquine markedly enhanced imatinib-induced cell death, compared to K562 cells treated only with imatinib. Furthermore, imatinib-resistant cell lines, BaF3/T315I and BaF3/E255K, also underwent cell death by co-treatment with imatinib and chloroquine. From these data, we concluded that autophagy is deeply related to the cell survival system and that inhibition of autophagy accelerates TPA- or imatinib-induced cell death. The block of autophagy could be a new strategy in the treatment of CML.","['Mishima, Yuko', 'Terui, Yasuhito', 'Mishima, Yuji', 'Taniyama, Akiko', 'Kuniyoshi, Ryoko', 'Takizawa, Toshihiro', 'Kimura, Shinya', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Hatake, Kiyohiko']","['Mishima Y', 'Terui Y', 'Mishima Y', 'Taniyama A', 'Kuniyoshi R', 'Takizawa T', 'Kimura S', 'Ozawa K', 'Hatake K']","['Department of Clinical Chemotherapy, Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080922,England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/01/24 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['CAS932 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00932.x [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2008 Nov;99(11):2200-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00932.x.

METHODS: Data were collected prospectively from 19 paediatric patients with ALL (n = 75 samples, 150 concentrations) who received 6-MP maintenance chemotherapy (titrated to a target dose of 75 mg m(-2) day(-1)). All patients were genotyped for polymorphisms in three enzymes involved in 6-MP metabolism. Population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with the nonlinear mixed effects modelling program (nonmem) to determine the population mean parameter estimate of clearance for the active metabolites. RESULTS: The developed model revealed considerable interindividual variability (IIV) in the clearance of 6-MP active metabolites [6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) and 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (6-mMPNs)]. Body surface area explained a significant part of 6-TGNs clearance IIV when incorporated in the model (IIV reduced from 69.9 to 29.3%). The most influential covariate examined, however, was thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype, which resulted in the greatest reduction in the model's objective function (P < 0.005) when incorporated as a covariate affecting the fractional metabolic transformation of 6-MP into 6-TGNs. The other genetic covariates tested were not statistically significant and therefore were not included in the final model. CONCLUSIONS: The developed pharmacokinetic model (if successful at external validation) would offer a more rational dosing approach for 6-MP than the traditional empirical method since it combines the current practice of using body surface area in 6-MP dosing with a pharmacogenetically guided dosing based on TPMT genotype.","['Hawwa, Ahmed F', 'Collier, Paul S', 'Millership, Jeff S', 'McCarthy, Anthony', 'Dempsey, Sid', 'Cairns, Carole', 'McElnay, James C']","['Hawwa AF', 'Collier PS', 'Millership JS', 'McCarthy A', 'Dempsey S', 'Cairns C', 'McElnay JC']","[""Clinical and Practice Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Medical Biology Centre, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080923,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '6V404DV25O (6-methylthiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate/genetics', 'Methyltransferases/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Prospective Studies']",PMC2675766,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/04/01 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BCP3281 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03281.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Dec;66(6):826-37. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03281.x.

Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) is known to promote trophoblast differentiation in human ES cells in contrast to mouse ES cells where BMP4 synergistically maintains self-renewal with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which represents a significant difference in signal transduction of self-renewal and differentiation between murine and human ES cells. As the similarity of the differentiation mechanism between monkey and human ES cells is of critical importance for their use as a primate model system, we investigated whether BMP4 induces trophoblast differentiation in monkey ES cells. Interestingly, BMP4 did not induce trophoblast differentiation, but instead induced primitive endoderm differentiation. Prominent downregulation of Sox2, which plays a pivotal role not only in pluripotency but also placenta development, was observed in cells treated with BMP4. In addition, upregulation of Hand1, Cdx2, and chorionic gonadotropin beta (CG-beta), which are markers of trophoblast, was not observed. In contrast, BMP4 induced significant upregulation of Gata6, Gata4, and LamininB1, suggesting differentiation into the primitive endoderm, visceral endoderm, and parietal endoderm, respectively. The threshold of BMP4 activity was estimated as about 10 ng/mL. These findings suggest that BMP4 induced differentiation into the primitive endoderm lineage but not into trophoblast in monkey ES cells.","['Kobayashi, Masashi', 'Takada, Tatsuyuki', 'Takahashi, Kentaro', 'Noda, Yoichi', 'Torii, Ryuzo']","['Kobayashi M', 'Takada T', 'Takahashi K', 'Noda Y', 'Torii R']","['Research Center for Animal Life Science, Shiga University of Medical Science, Otsu, Shiga, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Cloning Stem Cells,Cloning and stem cells,101125444,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (GATA4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (helix-loop-helix protein, eHAND)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Endoderm/*cytology/physiology', 'GATA4 Transcription Factor/drug effects/metabolism', 'GATA6 Transcription Factor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Laminin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Trophoblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/02/03 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/clo.2008.0030 [doi]'],ppublish,Cloning Stem Cells. 2008 Dec;10(4):495-502. doi: 10.1089/clo.2008.0030.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Pharmacokinetic subanalysis of a phase III, prospective, randomized, multicenter, evaluator-blinded trial comparing posaconazole with standard azoles (fluconazole and itraconazole). PATIENTS: One hundred ninety-four patients with AML or MDS who received posaconazole oral suspension 200 mg 3 times/day with meals or a nutritional supplement for a minimum of 7 days to achieve steady state and for a maximum of 12 weeks. INTERVENTION: For the first 20 patients, blood samples were collected before the first dose on day 8 and at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours after that first dose; for all other patients, blood samples were collected at 1 and 3 hours after the first dose on day 8 and during the first episode of evaluation for a possible IFI. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The effects of the following covariates on average (Cav) and maximum (Cmax) posaconazole plasma concentrations at steady state were explored: age, sex, and race-ethnicity; proven or probable IFI; baseline body weight and body surface area; and baseline (on or before day 7) increases in liver enzyme levels, mucositis, neutropenia, diarrhea, vomiting, or use of an H2-receptor antagonist or proton pump inhibitor. Diarrhea, proton pump inhibitor use, gamma-glutamyl transferase level of 2 or more times the upper limit of normal, and race-ethnicity reduced Cav. Although statistically significant, these results were not considered clinically significant and did not necessitate posaconazole dosage adjustments. Mean Cav and Cmax values did not appear different in the six patients with IFIs (three with proven IFIs, three with probable IFIs) compared with the entire sample of 194 patients; however, a definitive conclusion cannot be made due to the small sample size of patients with IFI. No factor found to affect posaconazole concentrations predominated in patients with IFIs. CONCLUSION: Oral posaconazole 200 mg 3 times/day provided plasma concentrations adequate for preventing IFIs. No dosage adjustments are recommended based on any covariate tested.","['Krishna, Gopal', 'AbuTarif, Malaz', 'Xuan, Fengjuan', 'Martinho, Monika', 'Angulo, David', 'Cornely, Oliver A']","['Krishna G', 'AbuTarif M', 'Xuan F', 'Martinho M', 'Angulo D', 'Cornely OA']","['1 Schering-Plough Research Institute, Kenilworth, New Jersey.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Pharmacotherapy,Pharmacotherapy,8111305,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/*chemically induced', 'Prospective Studies', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Young Adult']",,2008/10/01 09:00,2009/01/09 09:00,['2008/10/01 09:00'],"['2008/10/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1592/phco.28.10.1223 [doi]', '10.1592/phco.28.10.1223 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacotherapy. 2008 Oct;28(10):1223-32. doi: 10.1592/phco.28.10.1223.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Osteoblasts were isolated and cultured from calvarium of 2-day-old Kunming white mice, embryoid bodies (EBs) were prepared with modified zur Nieden method. EBs were divided into 4 groups according to different mediums: group A, as the control group, in which EBs medium contained no leukemia inhibitory factor; group B, in which EBs medium contained supplements of Vitamin C (VC, 50 microg/mL) and beta-glycerophosphate (beta-GP, 50 mmol/L); group C, in which EBs medium was the same as that of group B and 5 x 10(4) osteoblasts of 3rd passage were seeded into each well; group D, in which the medium contained supplements of VC (50 microg/mL), beta-GP (50 mmol/L) and 1,25(OH)2VD3 (4 x 10(-9) mol/L), and 5 x 10(4) osteoblasts of 3rd passage were seeded into each well. The ALP activity was determined by ALP reagent kit every 5 days. The RQ-PCR was performed to measure the mRNA expressions of osteocalcin (OCN). Alizarin red S staining was performed to count the bone nodules. RESULTS: The expression of ALP witnessed no obvious change in each group within 5 days after adherence of EBs, but increased gradually after 5 days. The expression of ALP in group D reached the peak at 20 days. Red nodules with clear outline and different sizes were evident by microscope. Alizarin red S staining testified the number of bone nodules in groups A, B, C and D was 20 +/- 8, 18 +/- 5, 31 +/- 1 and 50 +/- 1, respectively, indicating significant differences between groups C, D and groups A, B (P < 0.05), no significant difference between group A and group B (P > 0.05), and a significant difference between group C and group D (P < 0.05). The result of RQ-PCR showed that the mRNA expressions of OCN in groups A, B, C and D was 10.18 +/- 1.17, 20.29 +/- 1.03, 18.84 +/- 4.07 and 32.15 +/- 5.23, respectively, indicating significant differences between groups C, D and groups A, B (P < 0.05), no significant difference between group A and group B (P > 0.05), and a significant difference between group C and group D (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The combined action of 1,25(OH)2VD3 (4 x 10(-9) mol/L), VC, and beta-GP can effectively promote the differentiation of the ESCs-derived osteoblasts.","['Sun, Yadong', 'Yang, Xueyi', 'Li, Fengtao', 'Dou, Zhongying']","['Sun Y', 'Yang X', 'Li F', 'Dou Z']","['Vocational and Technical College of Shenyang Agriculture University, Shenyang Liaoning, 110122, P.R.

Sequence analysis of L. japonica TCTP showed that it had two signature regions of high sequence homology termed TCTP-1 and TCTP-2, respectively. TCTP is highly conserved in evolution. It showed more than 40% identification similarities with parasite TCTPs that had effect on immune responses of host. Phylogeny of 31 TCTP sequences showed that lamprey was closer to jawed vertebrates than to Amphioxus and was a sister group of gnathostomes. TCTP gene from L. japonica was expressed in a pET23b vector and purified by using His Bind affinity chromatography. Polyclonal antibody to recombinant protein was generated in New Zealand Rabbit. Immunoblot analysis to localize the recombinant protein in buccal gland secretion proves that recombinant TCTP is a secretion protein, which may be secreted through a non-classical secretion pathway. A characterization study shows that recombinant TCTP has histamine-releasing function in vitro. It mediated histamine release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. TCTP links both the innate and the adaptive immune responses by modulating the secretion of cytokines from mast cells, basophils, eosinophils, and T and B lymphocytes. These may indicate a potential role of TCTP in the inflammatory process and immune regulation between L. japonica and host.","['Sun, Jing', 'Wu, Yu', 'Wang, Jihong', 'Ma, Fei', 'Liu, Xin', 'Li, Qingwei']","['Sun J', 'Wu Y', 'Wang J', 'Ma F', 'Liu X', 'Li Q']","['Institute of Functional Gene and Proteomics of Marine Biology, Liaoning Normal University, Dalian, Liaoning, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080909,France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (TPT1 protein, human)', '0 (Tpt1 protein, rat)', '0 (Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lampreys/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Protein, Translationally-Controlled 1']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/07/09 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0300-9084(08)00252-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biochi.2008.08.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2008 Nov-Dec;90(11-12):1760-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.08.002.

Since we previously showed that mast cells expressed the AGE-binding protein, receptor for AGEs (RAGE) on their cell surface, we examined whether AGE affected mast cell survival. Herein, we demonstrate that mast cells undergo apoptosis in response to AGE. Glycated albumin (GA), an AGE, but not stimulation with the high-affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI), can induce mast cell death, as measured by annexin V/propidium iodide double-staining. GA (> or =0.1 mg/ml) exhibited this pro-apoptotic activity in a concentration-dependent manner. GA and FcepsilonRI stimulation increased the cytosolic Ca(2+) levels to a similar extent, whereas GA, but not FcepsilonRI stimulation, caused mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload and membrane potential collapse, resulting in mitochondrial integrity disruption, cytochrome c release and caspase-3/7 activation. In addition, GA, but not FcepsilonRI stimulation, induced extracellular release of superoxide from mitochondria, and this release played a key role in the disruption of Ca(2+) homeostasis. Knockdown of RAGE expression using small interfering RNA abolished GA-induced apoptosis, mitochondrial Ca(2+) overload, and superoxide release, demonstrating that RAGE mediates the GA-induced mitochondrial death pathway. AGE-induced mast cell apoptosis may contribute to the immunocompromised and inflammatory conditions.","['Yoshimaru, Tetsuro', 'Suzuki, Yoshihiro', 'Inoue, Toshio', 'Nishida, Shigeru', 'Ra, Chisei']","['Yoshimaru T', 'Suzuki Y', 'Inoue T', 'Nishida S', 'Ra C']","['Division of Molecular Cell Immunology and Allergology, Advanced Medical Research Center, Nihon University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 30-1 Oyaguchikami-cho Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080906,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (FCGR1A protein, human)', '0 (Fcgr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Glycation End Products, Advanced)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (glycated serum albumin)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Glycation End Products, Advanced/*pharmacology', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Serum Albumin/*pharmacology', 'Superoxides/*metabolism']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(08)00301-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Dec;1783(12):2332-43. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.08.010.

Increasing evidence suggests that opposite effects of arsenic trioxide (ATO) on tumors depend on its concentrations. For this reason, the mechanisms of action of the drug should be elucidated, and it should be used therapeutically only with extreme caution. Previously, we demonstrated the opposing effects of ERK1/2 and JNK on p21(WAF1/CIP1) (p21) expression in response to ATO in A431 cells. In addition, JNK phosphorylates c-Jun (Ser(63/73)) to recruit TGIF/HDAC1 to suppress p21 gene expression. Presently, we demonstrated that a high concentration of ATO sustains ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and increases c-Fos biosynthesis and stability, which enhances p21 gene expression. Using site-directed mutagenesis, a DNA affinity precipitation assay, and functional assays, we demonstrated that phosphorylation of the C-terminus of c-Fos (Thr(232), Thr(325), Thr(331), and Ser(374)) plays an important role in its binding to the p21 promoter, and in conjunction with N-terminus phosphorylation of c-Fos (Ser(70)) to transactivate p21 promoter expression. In conclusion, a high concentration of ATO can sustain ERK1/2 activation to enhance c-Fos expression, then dimerize with dephosphorylated c-Jun (Ser(63/73)) and recruit p300/CBP to the Sp1 sites (-84/-64) to activate p21 gene expression in A431 cells.","['Liu, Zi-Miao', 'Huang, Huei-Sheng']","['Liu ZM', 'Huang HS']","['Department of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, Tainan 701, Taiwan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080910,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oxides/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(08)00364-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2008.08.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Dec 1;233(2):297-307. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2008.08.015.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: All cancers reported 1995-2003 to the Danish Cancer Registry were included. Three cohorts diagnosed 1995-1997, 1998-2000 and 2001-2003 were followed for death until 31 December 2006 and age standardized 1- and 3-year relative survival was calculated by the cohort method. RESULTS: One-year survival increased for men from 59 to 65% and for women from 67 to 70%, and 3-year survival from 44 to 51% and 55 to 59%, respectively. The improved 3-year survival for women was after the launch of the cancer plan, whilst for men it was in the entire observation period. Improvement in 3-year survival for both sexes occurred for colon, rectum and lung cancer, and for bladder and prostate in men and esophagus, breast, ovary and leukemia in women. Worse survival was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer in women. DISCUSSION: The improved trend in survival has been maintained. The cancer plan may improve survival before onset due to the early implementation of recommendations. Since improvements in surgery presents early, 3-year survival is relevant. The improved survival for colo-rectal, lung, bladder, esophagus and ovarian cancer may be related to the cancer plan. Improvement in breast cancer survival is likely due to screening and the DBCG continued activity, whilst increasing incidence of prostate cancer due to PSA testing is likely to be behind our observation.

We compared 74 patients (56 ALL/18 AML), who received i.t. therapy post-HSCT with 46 patients (36 ALL/10 AML) who did not receive post-HSCT i.t. therapy. The patients were transplanted at the University Children's Hospital, Uppsala or the Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, two Swedish transplantation units with different routines concerning i.t. therapy after HSCT. The primary end-point was the number of isolated CNS relapses. Secondary end-points were other types of relapse, death, and neurological complications. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of CNS relapses between the groups (p > 0.05). I.t. therapy did not reduce the overall incidence of isolated CNS relapse or mortality. Our study did not demonstrate a protective effect of i.t. therapy indicating that post-HSCT i.t. therapy may only be of limited use in the treatment of acute childhood leukemia. We conclude that with the risks present, i.t. therapy should be carefully evaluated, and only considered in high-risk cases.","['Rubin, Johanna', 'Frost, Britt-Marie', 'Arvidson, Johan', 'Wide, Katarina', 'Gustafsson-Jernberg, Asa', 'Gustafsson, Britt']","['Rubin J', 'Frost BM', 'Arvidson J', 'Wide K', 'Gustafsson-Jernberg A', 'Gustafsson B']","['Department of Pediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital-Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. johanna.rubin@karolinska.se']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080915,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System/pathology', 'Chemoprevention', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/04/25 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['PTR964 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.00964.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2008 Dec;12(8):889-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.00964.x.

A precise diagnosis can be difficult to achieve, and specific diagnostic criteria are needed to more precisely define some of the rarer indolent tumors, such as nodal and splenic MZLs. Although some subtypes of NHL have a prolonged indolent course, with a good prognosis (e.g. SLL), others (e.g. nodal and splenic MZLs) can rapidly evolve into more aggressive subtypes. In asymptomatic patients, treatment may be deferred until the disease progresses and the patient becomes symptomatic.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were exposed to RMF for two chosen states of the magnetic field induction: B=10 mT and B=20 mT in experimental set-up for 30 min with 24-h intervals for four days. Cytospin slides were prepared and expression of nucleolin was detected using monoclonal antibodies. Parameters of fluorescence related to nucleolin were measured in at least 2000 tumor cells in each slide by a laser scanning cytometer with an argon laser. Percentages of cells in different phases of cell cycle were also analyzed. RESULTS: The repeated exposition of cells to RMF caused significant increase in nucleolin expression in the whole nucleus and in the nucleolin aggregates (NUA). The redistribution of nucleolin measured by changes in number of NUA was also observed. The exposition of both cell lines studied to RMF did not alter the cell cycle. CONCLUSION: The nucleolin is responsive to RMF in HL-60 and K-562. The increase of its expression may indicate a reaction of cells to RMF and it may influence their other biological properties.","['Masiuk, Marek', 'Rakoczy, Rafal', 'Masiuk, Stanislaw', 'Kordas, Marian']","['Masiuk M', 'Rakoczy R', 'Masiuk S', 'Kordas M']","['Department and Chair of Pathology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (nucleolin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/*radiation effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', '*Magnetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reference Standards', '*Rotation', 'Time Factors']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/01/29 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['903062981 [pii]', '10.1080/09553000802317786 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2008 Sep;84(9):752-60. doi: 10.1080/09553000802317786.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, MSCs have gained further interests after the demonstration of an immunosuppressive role. However, it is still unclear whether the immunosuppressive capability of MSCs will be altered with disease state. In this study, we obtained and expanded MSCs from bone marrow of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our results showed that MSCs derived from CML do not express costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. When MSCs derived from CML were added back to T cells stimulated by mitogens, a significant inhibition of T-cell proliferation was evident. MSCs differentiated into various mesenchymal lineages did not alter their immunosuppressive effect on T-cell proliferation. A significant T-cell inhibition was found in a transwell system, in which cell-cell contact between MSCs and effector cells was prevented. Furthermore, we found that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta1) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were major mediators of T-cell suppression by MSCs derived from CML. These results demonstrated that autologous MSCs derived from CML could effectively suppress T-cell proliferation.","['Zhao, Zhi-Gang', 'Li, Wei-Ming', 'Chen, Zhi-Chao', 'You, Yong', 'Zou, Ping']","['Zhao ZG', 'Li WM', 'Chen ZC', 'You Y', 'Zou P']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, the Oncology Hospital of Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, P.R.

Increased incidence of lymphoma and leukemia in humans is associated with TCDD exposure. Although AhR activation by TCDD has profound effects on the immune system, precise cellular and molecular mechanisms have yet to be determined. These studies tested the hypothesis that alteration of marrow populations following treatment of mice with TCDD is due to an effect on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Treatment with TCDD resulted in an increased number and proliferation of bone marrow (BM) populations enriched for HSCs. There was a time-dependent decrease in B-lineage cells with a concomitant increase in myeloid populations. The decrease in the B-cell lineage colony-forming unit-preB progenitors along with a transient increase in myeloid progenitors were consistent with a skewing of lineage development from lymphoid to myeloid populations. However, HSCs from TCDD-treated mice exhibited diminished capacity to reconstitute and home to marrow of irradiated recipients. AhR messenger RNA was expressed in progenitor subsets but is downregulated during HSC proliferation. This result was consistent with the lack of response following the exposure of 5-fluorouracil-treated mice to TCDD. The direct exposure of cultured BM cells to TCDD inhibited the growth of immature hematopoietic progenitor cells, but not more mature lineage-restricted progenitors. Overall, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that TCDD, through AhR activation, alters the ability of HSCs to respond appropriately to signals within the marrow microenvironment.","['Singh, Kameshwar P', 'Wyman, Amber', 'Casado, Fanny L', 'Garrett, Russell W', 'Gasiewicz, Thomas A']","['Singh KP', 'Wyman A', 'Casado FL', 'Garrett RW', 'Gasiewicz TA']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['ES01247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES04862/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES07026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080926,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/*toxicity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/*agonists']",PMC2639033,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/02/13 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgn224 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgn224 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2009 Jan;30(1):11-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgn224.

PKC412 is one of several mutant FLT3 inhibitors that is undergoing clinical testing, and which is currently in late-stage clinical trials. However, the discovery of drug-resistant leukemic blast cells in PKC412-treated patients with AML has prompted the search for novel, structurally diverse FLT3 inhibitors that could be alternatively used to override drug resistance. Here, we report the potent and selective antiproliferative effects of the novel mutant FLT3 inhibitor NVP-AST487 on primary patient cells and cell lines expressing FLT3-ITD or FLT3 kinase domain point mutants. NVP-AST487, which selectively targets mutant FLT3 protein kinase activity, is also shown to override PKC412 resistance in vitro, and has significant antileukemic activity in an in vivo model of FLT3-ITD(+) leukemia. Finally, the combination of NVP-AST487 with standard chemotherapeutic agents leads to enhanced inhibition of proliferation of mutant FLT3-expressing cells. Thus, we present a novel class of FLT3 inhibitors that displays high selectivity and potency toward FLT3 as a molecular target, and which could potentially be used to override drug resistance in AML.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Roesel, Johannes', 'Bold, Guido', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Jiang, Jingrui', 'Cools, Jan', 'Wright, Renee D', 'Nelson, Erik', 'Barrett, Rosemary', 'Ray, Arghya', 'Moreno, Daisy', 'Hall-Meyers, Elizabeth', 'Stone, Richard', 'Galinsky, Ilene', 'Fox, Edward', 'Gilliland, Gary', 'Daley, John F', 'Lazo-Kallanian, Suzan', 'Kung, Andrew L', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Roesel J', 'Bold G', 'Furet P', 'Jiang J', 'Cools J', 'Wright RD', 'Nelson E', 'Barrett R', 'Ray A', 'Moreno D', 'Hall-Meyers E', 'Stone R', 'Galinsky I', 'Fox E', 'Gilliland G', 'Daley JF', 'Lazo-Kallanian S', 'Kung AL', 'Griffin JD']","['Department of Medical Oncology/Hematologic Neoplasia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA036167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK050654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA036167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080926,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbanilides)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NVP-AST487)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Carbanilides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC2597611,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51757-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-138065 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5161-70. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-138065.

The synthetic peptide of this epitope appeared to be capable of binding to HLA-A*2402 as well as HLA-A*0201 molecules. Leukemia cell lines and freshly isolated leukemia cells, particularly chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells, appeared to express Aur-A abundantly. Aur-A-specific CTLs were able to lyse human leukemia cell lines and freshly isolated leukemia cells, but not normal cells, in an HLA-A*0201-restricted manner. Importantly, Aur-A-specific CTLs were able to lyse CD34+ CML progenitor cells but did not show any cytotoxicity against normal CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. The tetramer assay revealed that the Aur-A(207-215) epitope-specific CTL precursors are present in peripheral blood of HLA-A*0201-positive and HLA-A*2402-positive patients with leukemia, but not in healthy individuals.

It would therefore be of great clinical benefit if the efficacy of topoisomerase II inhibitors could be enhanced without the increased toxic side effects.

CD4(+)CD25(+) T cells obviously inhibit the proliferation of CD4(+)CD25(-)T cells in vitro, and the effect displays an effector-target ratio relationship.","['Chen, Wei', 'Cao, Dong-lin', 'Wang, Ling']","['Chen W', 'Cao DL', 'Wang L']","[""Department of Hematology, Second People's Hosptial of Guangdong Province, Guangzhou, China.""]",['chi'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology/pathology', 'Young Adult']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/04/07 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2008 Aug;28(9):1610-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, PB CLL B-cells showed a more heterogeneous Eph/EFN profile than their normal PB B-cell counterparts, expressing Eph/EFN members frequently found within the LN and activated B-cells, specially EFNA4, EphB6 and EphA10. Two of them, EphB6 and EFNA4 were further related with the clinical course of CLL patients. EphB6 expression correlated with a high content of ZAP-70 mRNA and a poor prognosis. High serum levels of a soluble EFNA4 isoform positively correlated with increasing peripheral blood lymphocyte counts and lymphadenopathy. These findings suggest that Eph/EFN might be relevant in normal B-cell biology and could represent new potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets for CLL.","['Alonso-C, Luis M', 'Trinidad, Eva M A', 'de Garcillan, Beatriz', 'Ballesteros, Monica', 'Castellanos, Milagros', 'Cotillo, Ignacio', 'Munoz, Juan J', 'Zapata, Agustin G']","['Alonso-C LM', 'Trinidad EM', 'de Garcillan B', 'Ballesteros M', 'Castellanos M', 'Cotillo I', 'Munoz JJ', 'Zapata AG']","['Centro de Microscopia y Citometria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid (U.C.M.), Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080926,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Ephrin-A4)', '0 (Ephrins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EPHB6 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Eph Family)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ephrin-A4/genetics', 'Ephrins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptors, Eph Family/*genetics', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00371-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.08.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2009 Mar;33(3):395-406. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.08.010.

Simultaneous dosage of EPO and of serum transferrin receptor have shown that anaemia in these patients is of central origin but related to a blunted EPO production. The same observation has been made in children at diagnosis either with acute leukaemia or solid tumour as well as during chemotherapy. In patients under maintenance chemotherapy for acute leukaemia, using long-term bone marrow cultures, we could detect an impaired supportive capacity of bone marrow micro-environment for erythropoiesis. The last part of this work has shown that thrombocytopaenia associated with acute leukaemia in children is accompanied by very high TPO levels as observed in other thrombocytopaenia of central origin, excepted in patients with acute leukaemia of myeloid origin. In these patients, TPO levels are inappropriately low in most cases. The low TPO levels are related to the presence of TPO receptor-expressing myeloid leukaemic cells, suggesting that TPO is ""consumed"" by blast cells expressing a functional TPO receptor.","['Corazza, F V']",['Corazza FV'],"[""Laboratoire d'hematologie, CHU-Brugmann, ULB, Bruxelles.""]",['fre'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Belgium,Bull Mem Acad R Med Belg,Bulletin et memoires de l'Academie royale de medecine de Belgique,7608462,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Anemia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Child', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Thrombopoietin/*physiology']",,2008/09/30 09:00,2008/11/06 09:00,['2008/09/30 09:00'],"['2008/09/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Mem Acad R Med Belg. 2008;163(1-2):152-6; discussion 156-7.,,,,,Aspects de la physiopathologie de l'anemie et de la thrombocytopenie associees a une affection neoplasique chez l'enfant: roles de l'erythropoietine et de la thrombopoietine.,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the gonadal toxicity of childhood cancer treatment using fertility markers. We included 248 adult male long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Median age at diagnosis: 5 years, median age at follow-up: 24 years, median follow-up time 18 years. We evaluated patient characteristics, treatment modalities, testicular size, and endocrinological parameters including Inhibin B, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone. RESULTS: The median value of Inhibin B in the cancer survivor group was 126 ng/L versus 177 ng/L in the control group (P < 0.001). In the survivors, 67% had Inhibin B levels below the normal reference value of 150 ng/L compared with 26% in the control group (P < 0.05). Inhibin B was the most sensitive discriminator between survivors and controls. Significantly decreased Inhibin B levels and increased FSH levels were found in men treated for Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute-myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and sarcoma as compared to other malignancies. Cumulative dosages of procarbazine and cyclophosphamide were the only independent chemotherapy-related predictors for decrease of Inhibin B levels and increase of FSH. Age at time of treatment did not influence post-treatment Inhibin B or FSH levels. CONCLUSIONS: Severe gonadal impairment is a risk in a considerable subgroup of childhood cancer survivors based on current fertility markers like Inhibin B. Males receiving gonadotoxic treatment before puberty are not protected from post treatment gonadal dysfunction.","['van Casteren, Niels J', 'van der Linden, Geert H M', 'Hakvoort-Cammel, Friederike G A J', 'Hahlen, Karel', 'Dohle, Gert R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['van Casteren NJ', 'van der Linden GH', 'Hakvoort-Cammel FG', 'Hahlen K', 'Dohle GR', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']","['Department of Urology, Section of Andrology, Erasmus MC-University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (inhibin B)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '57285-09-3 (Inhibins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/analysis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gonads/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Infertility/chemically induced/*diagnosis', 'Inhibins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/complications', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Sarcoma/complications', '*Survivors']",,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21780 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jan;52(1):108-12. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21780.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can also be present constitutionally and is associated with a wide range of phenotypes. We report a case of a 20-year-old woman with acute myelogenous leukemia associated with the 11q23/MLL translocation who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a healthy, unrelated 26-year-old female. Cytogenetics on a bone marrow biopsy and aspirate performed 71 days after transplant to evaluate pancytopenia identified trisomy 8 in 6 of 7 cells examined. The bone marrow was hypocellular but normal by morphology and flow cytometry. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the original 11q23/MLL translocation was negative. Chimerism analysis using multiplex polymerase chain reaction to amplify an informative short tandem repeat demonstrated 97% donor cells. These findings were confirmed by repeat bone marrow biopsies at Day 110 after transplant and 1 year after transplant. With resolution of comorbid illness, the patient's peripheral blood counts recovered and remained normal at 1 year after HSCT. FISH analysis of a cryopreserved sample of the donor graft showed trisomy 8 in 120 of 200 cells examined. This represents the first reported case of a person with constitutional trisomy 8 mosaicism serving as a stem cell donor. The case illustrates the importance of identifying donor-derived constitutional abnormalities to avoid the assumption that these cytogenetic abnormalities after HSCT are representative of malignant disease.","['Frey, Noelle V', 'Leid, Christopher E', 'Nowell, Peter C', 'Tomczak, Ewa', 'Strauser, Honore T', 'Kasner, Margaret', 'Goldstein, Steven', 'Loren, Alison', 'Stadtmauer, Edward', 'Luger, Selina', 'Hexner, Elizabeth', 'Hinkle, Joanne', 'Porter, David L']","['Frey NV', 'Leid CE', 'Nowell PC', 'Tomczak E', 'Strauser HT', 'Kasner M', 'Goldstein S', 'Loren A', 'Stadtmauer E', 'Luger S', 'Hexner E', 'Hinkle J', 'Porter DL']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and Abramson Cancer Center, Hospital of University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. noelle.frey@uphs.upenn.edu']",['eng'],"['K24 CA117879/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA117879-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K24 CA11787901/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Mosaicism', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Trisomy/*genetics']",PMC2610424,2008/09/27 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21268 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Nov;83(11):846-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21268.,['Am J Hematol. 2010 Dec;85(12):974-6.

Adiponectin levels inversely correlated with absolute peripheral blood lymphocyte count (r = -0.254; P = 0.03), CD38-positive CLL cells (r = -0.294; P = 0.04) and ZAP-70 (r = -0.285; P = 0.03). The univariate Cox proportional hazard model demonstrated that, in addition with lower serum levels of adiponectin (P = 0.01), the unmutated IgV(H) condition (P = 0.002) and ZAP-70-positivity (P = 0.02) were associated with a shorter time to first treatment (TFT). However, in multivariate analysis only ZAP-70 positivity emerged as predictor of the TFT (P = 0.008). The levels of adiponectin in CLL were evaluated in 60 patients from an independent cohort investigated by gene expression profiling.

In contrast to human ERVs, which are nearly all extinct, active mouse ERVs can still be found in all three ERV classes. The distribution and diversity of ERVs has been shaped by host-virus interactions over the course of evolution, but ERVs have also been pivotal in shaping the mouse genome by altering host genes through insertional mutagenesis, by adding novel regulatory and coding sequences, and by their co-option by host cells as retroviral resistance genes.

Ongoing expression of the endogenous sequence and consequent high levels of viraemia have been linked to neoplasia and immunosuppression in koalas. This apparently recent invader of the koala genome shares a remarkably close sequence relationship with the pathogenic exogenous Gibbon ape leukaemia virus (GALV), and comparative analyses of KoRV and GALVare helping to shed light on how retroviruses in general adapt to a relatively benign or at least less pathogenic existence within a new host genome.

The method involves measuring a current pulse generated when an individual cell passes through an artificial pore. When the pore is functionalized with proteins, specific interactions between a cell-surface marker and the functionalized proteins retard the cell, thus leading to an increased pulse duration that indicates the presence of that specific biomarker. For proof-of-principle, we successfully screened murine erythroleukemia cells based on their CD34 surface marker in both a single and mixed population of cells. Further, we developed a unified constrained statistical model for estimating the ratios of cells in a mixed population. Finally, we demonstrated our ability to screen a small number of cells (hundreds or less) with high accuracy and sensitivity. Overall, our pore-based method is broadly applicable and, in the future, could provide a full range of in vitro cell-based assays.","['Carbonaro, Andrea', 'Mohanty, Swomitra K', 'Huang, Haiyan', 'Godley, Lucy A', 'Sohn, Lydia L']","['Carbonaro A', 'Mohanty SK', 'Huang H', 'Godley LA', 'Sohn LL']","['Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720-1740, USA.']",['eng'],['2 P42 ES004705-19/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080725,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Porosity', 'Proteins/*analysis/chemistry', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2008/09/27 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b801929k [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2008 Sep;8(9):1478-85. doi: 10.1039/b801929k.

We analyzed survival after relapse among 9585 pediatric patients enrolled on Children's Oncology Group clinical trials between 1988 and 2002. A total of 1961 patients (20.5%) experienced relapse at any site. The primary end point was survival. Patients were subcategorized by the site of relapse and timing of relapse from initial diagnosis. Time to relapse remains the strongest predictor of survival. Patients experiencing early relapse less than 18 months from initial diagnosis had a particularly poor outcome with a 5-year survival estimate of 21.0+/-1.8%. Standard risk patients who relapsed had improved survival compared with their higher risk counterparts; differences in survival for the two risk groups was most pronounced for patients relapsing after 18 months. Adjusting for both time and relapse site, multivariate analysis showed that age (10+ years) and the presence of central nervous system disease at diagnosis, male gender, and T-cell disease were significant predictors of inferior post-relapse survival. It can be noted that there was no difference in survival rates for relapsed patients in earlier vs later era trials. New therapeutic strategies are urgently needed for children with relapsed ALL and efforts should focus on discovering the biological pathways that mediate drug resistance.","['Nguyen, K', 'Devidas, M', 'Cheng, S-C', 'La, M', 'Raetz, E A', 'Carroll, W L', 'Winick, N J', 'Hunger, S P', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Loh, M L']","['Nguyen K', 'Devidas M', 'Cheng SC', 'La M', 'Raetz EA', 'Carroll WL', 'Winick NJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Gaynon PS', 'Loh ML']","['1Mayo Medical School, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['U10 CA098543-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K22 CA113557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080925,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution']",PMC2872117,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/01/28 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008251 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.251 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Dec;22(12):2142-50. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.251.

Although the inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by imatinib is highly effective in treating human Ph(+) CML in chronic phase, it is difficult to achieve molecular remission of the disease, suggesting that LSCs remain in patients. In this study, we find that following imatinib treatment, LSCs not only remained but also accumulated increasingly in bone marrow of CML mice. This insensitivity of LSCs to imatinib was not because of the lack of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition by imatinib, and proliferating leukemic cells derived from LSCs were still sensitive to growth inhibition by imatinib. These results identify an LSC survival pathway that is not inhibited by imatinib. Furthermore, we show that beta-catenin in the Wnt signaling pathway is essential for survival and self-renewal of LSCs, providing a new strategy for targeting these cells.","['Hu, Y', 'Chen, Y', 'Douglas, L', 'Li, S']","['Hu Y', 'Chen Y', 'Douglas L', 'Li S']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01-CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA122142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080925,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins', 'beta Catenin/*physiology']",,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008262 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.262 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):109-16. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.262.

We have established the genome and gene expression profiles of a multicentric series of 61 M4/M5 AMLs including 18 MYST3-linked AMLs by using array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) (n=52) and DNA microarrays (n=44), respectively. We show that M4/5 AMLs have a variety of rare genomic alterations. One alteration, a gain of the MYB locus, was found recurrently and only in the MYST3-linked AMLs (7/18 vs 0/34). MYST3-AMLs have also a specific a gene expression profile, which includes overexpression of MYB, CD4 and HOXA genes. These features, reminiscent of T-cell acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), suggest the targeting of a common T-myeloid progenitor.","['Murati, A', 'Gervais, C', 'Carbuccia, N', 'Finetti, P', 'Cervera, N', 'Adelaide, J', 'Struski, S', 'Lippert, E', 'Mugneret, F', 'Tigaud, I', 'Penther, D', 'Bastard, C', 'Poppe, B', 'Speleman, F', 'Baranger, L', 'Luquet, I', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre, P', 'Nadal, N', 'Nguyen-Khac, F', 'Perot, C', 'Olschwang, S', 'Bertucci, F', 'Chaffanet, M', 'Lessard, M', 'Mozziconacci, M-J', 'Birnbaum, D']","['Murati A', 'Gervais C', 'Carbuccia N', 'Finetti P', 'Cervera N', 'Adelaide J', 'Struski S', 'Lippert E', 'Mugneret F', 'Tigaud I', 'Penther D', 'Bastard C', 'Poppe B', 'Speleman F', 'Baranger L', 'Luquet I', 'Cornillet-Lefebvre P', 'Nadal N', 'Nguyen-Khac F', 'Perot C', 'Olschwang S', 'Bertucci F', 'Chaffanet M', 'Lessard M', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Birnbaum D']","[""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080925,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",IM,"['CD4 Antigens/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, myb/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics']",,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008257 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.257 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):85-94. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.257.

A total of 69 patients with previously untreated LPL were enrolled into the trial; 64 patients were evaluable for treatment outcome. In all, 48 of the 64 LPL patients fulfilled the criteria of WM. Patients were randomly assigned to R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, n=34) or CHOP (n=30). R-CHOP resulted in significantly higher overall response (OR) rate (94 vs 67%, P=0.0085) in the LPL patients and in the WM subgroup (91 vs 60%, P=0.0188).

In mammalian cells however, deletion of the H3K9 histone methyltransferases (HMTases) Suv39h1 and Suv39h2 does not affect DNA methylation of the endogenous retrovirus murine leukaemia virus, indicating that H3K9 methylation is dispensable for DNA methylation of retrotransposons, or that a different HMTase is involved. We demonstrate that embryonic stem (ES) cells lacking the H3K9 HMTase G9a show a significant reduction in DNA methylation of retrotransposons, major satellite repeats and densely methylated CpG-rich promoters. Surprisingly, demethylated retrotransposons remain transcriptionally silent in G9a(-/-) cells, and show only a modest decrease in H3K9me2 and no decrease in H3K9me3 or HP1alpha binding, indicating that H3K9 methylation per se is not the relevant trigger for DNA methylation. Indeed, introduction of catalytically inactive G9a transgenes partially 'rescues' the DNA methylation defect observed in G9a(-/-) cells. Taken together, these observations reveal that H3K9me3 and HP1alpha recruitment to retrotransposons occurs independent of DNA methylation in ES cells and that G9a promotes DNA methylation independent of its HMTase activity.","['Dong, Kevin B', 'Maksakova, Irina A', 'Mohn, Fabio', 'Leung, Danny', 'Appanah, Ruth', 'Lee, Sandra', 'Yang, Hao W', 'Lam, Lucia L', 'Mager, Dixie L', 'Schubeler, Dirk', 'Tachibana, Makoto', 'Shinkai, Yoichi', 'Lorincz, Matthew C']","['Dong KB', 'Maksakova IA', 'Mohn F', 'Leung D', 'Appanah R', 'Lee S', 'Yang HW', 'Lam LL', 'Mager DL', 'Schubeler D', 'Tachibana M', 'Shinkai Y', 'Lorincz MC']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Life Sciences Institute, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080925,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Histones)', '107283-02-3 (Chromobox Protein Homolog 5)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (G9a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Chromobox Protein Homolog 5', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry', 'Methyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Genetic']",PMC2572176,2008/09/27 09:00,2008/11/18 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['emboj2008193 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2008.193 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2008 Oct 22;27(20):2691-701. doi: 10.1038/emboj.2008.193.

HTLV-2 is highly homologous to HTLV-1; however, infection with HTLV-2 has not been associated with lymphoproliferative diseases. Although HTLV-1 infection of CD4(+) lymphocytes induces cellular replication and transformation, infection of CD34(+) human hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) strikingly results in G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and suppression of in vitro clonogenic colony formation by induction of expression of the cdk inhibitor p21(cip1/waf1) (p21) and concurrent repression of survivin. Immature CD34(+)/CD38(-) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were more susceptible to alterations of p21 and survivin expression as a result of HTLV-1 infection, in contrast to more mature CD34(+)/CD38(+) HPCs. Knockdown of p21 expression in HTLV-1-infected CD34(+) HPCs partially abrogated cell cycle arrest. Notably, HTLV-2, an HTLV strain that is not associated with leukemogenesis, does not significantly modulate p21 and survivin expression and does not suppress hematopoiesis from CD34(+) HPCs in vitro. We speculate that the remarkable differences in the activities displayed by CD34(+) HPCs following infection with HTLV-1 or HTLV-2 suggest that HTLV-1 uniquely exploits cell cycle arrest mechanisms to establish a latent infection in hematopoietic progenitor/hematopoietic stem cells and initiates preleukemic events in these cells, which eventually results in the manifestation of ATL.","['Banerjee, Prabal', 'Sieburg, Michelle', 'Samuelson, Elizabeth', 'Feuer, Gerold']","['Banerjee P', 'Sieburg M', 'Samuelson E', 'Feuer G']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, State University of New York Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York 13210, USA.']",['eng'],['CA 124595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Retracted Publication']",20080925,United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*metabolism/*virology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Survivin', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/06/12 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['2008-0353 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2008-0353 [doi]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2008 Dec;26(12):3047-58. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2008-0353.

Given its critical functions, c-Myb regulatory factors are of great interest but remain incompletely defined. Herein we show that c-Myb expression is subject to posttranscriptional regulation by microRNA (miRNA)-15a. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-15a directly binds the 3'-UTR of c-myb mRNA. By transfecting K562 myeloid leukemia cells with a miR-15a mimic, functionality of binding was shown. The mimic decreased c-Myb expression, and blocked the cells in the G(1) phase of cell cycle. Exogenous expression of c-myb mRNA lacking the 3'-UTR partially rescued the miR-15a induced cell-cycle block. Of interest, the miR-15a promoter contained several potential c-Myb protein binding sites. Occupancy of one canonical c-Myb binding site was demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis and shown to be required for miR-15a expression in K562 cells. Finally, in studies using normal human CD34(+) cells, we showed that c-Myb and miR-15a expression were inversely correlated in cells undergoing erythroid differentiation, and that overexpression of miR-15a blocked both erythroid and myeloid colony formation in vitro. In aggregate, these findings suggest the presence of a c-Myb-miR-15a autoregulatory feedback loop of potential importance in human hematopoiesis.","['Zhao, Huiwu', 'Kalota, Anna', 'Jin, Shenghao', 'Gewirtz, Alan M']","['Zhao H', 'Kalota A', 'Jin S', 'Gewirtz AM']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA101859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080925,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN15 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Blood Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Feedback, Physiological/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, myb/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transfection']",PMC2628359,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/02/20 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37836-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-136218 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 15;113(3):505-16. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-136218.

Cytarabine is usually given in combination with other agents such as idarubicin. Such treatments are known to cause hepatic dysfunction characterized by a combination of jaundice, hyperbilirubinemia and increases in liver enzymes. Isolated hyperbilirubinemia is rarely reported. It is often difficult to identify a causative agent for the hepatic dysfunction, as there are often complicating factors such as sepsis. AIM: To report a case of isolated hyperbilirubinemia in a patient treated with cytarabine-based chemotherapy for AML. CLINICAL DETAILS: After a diagnosis of AML the patient was admitted to hospital to receive induction chemotherapy consisting of high-dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and etoposide. All baseline laboratory results were normal, except the full blood evaluation that was consistent with AML. The chemotherapy was delivered over 7 days, and on the eighth day the patient had a bilirubin (BL) level of 27 micromol/L(normal range 522 micromol/L). All other liver function tests (LFT) were normal. This isolated hyperbilirubinemia remained for the rest of the patient's admission, peaking on day 26, with a level of 255 micromol/L. After a stay in the intensive care unit, the patient was discharged on day 45 with a bilirubin level of 33 micromol/L. All other LFT remained unremarkable. OUTCOME: The isolated hyperbilirubinemia resolved slowly and on day 68, when the patient was re-admitted for further dose-reduced cytarabine, the BL level was 21 micromol/L. The patient was successfully retreated with this lower dose regimen. CONCLUSION: Isolated hyperbilirubinemia is an uncommon presentation of cytarabine induced liver dysfunction. Resolution does occur but over a prolonged period. A lower dose of cytarabine for future treatment should be considered.","['Coutsouvelis, John', 'Corallo, Carmela E']","['Coutsouvelis J', 'Corallo CE']","['Department of Pharmacy, Box Hill Hospital, Box Hill, Australia.

Suppression of tumorigenic property of lung cancer cells and their sensitization to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by miR-1.,33394-405,10.1074/jbc.M804788200 [doi],"Micro-RNAs are approximately 21-25-nucleotide-long noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression primarily at the post-transcriptional level in animals. Here, we report that micro-RNA-1 (miR-1), abundant in the cardiac and smooth muscles, is expressed in the lung and is down-regulated in human primary lung cancer tissues and cell lines. In situ hybridization demonstrated localization of miR-1 in bronchial epithelial cells. The tumor suppressor C/EBPalpha, frequently suppressed in lung cancer, reactivated miR-1 expression in the lung cancer cells. Repressed miR-1 was also activated in lung cancer cells upon treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor. These observations led us to examine the antitumorigenic potential of miR-1 in lung cancer cells. Expression of miR-1 in nonexpressing A549 and H1299 cells reversed their tumorigenic properties, such as growth, replication potential, motility/migration, clonogenic survival, and tumor formation in nude mice. Exogenous miR-1 significantly reduced expression of oncogenic targets, such as MET, a receptor tyrosine kinase, and Pim-1, a Ser/Thr kinase, frequently up-regulated in lung cancer. Similarly, the levels of two additional targets, FoxP1, a transcription factor with oncogeneic property, and HDAC4 that represses differentiation-promoting genes, were reduced in miR-1-expressing cells. Conversely, depletion of miR-1 facilitated N417 cell growth with concomitant elevation of these targets. Further, ectopic miR-1 induced apoptosis in A549 cells in response to the potent anticancer drug doxorubicin. Enhanced activation of caspases 3 and 7, cleavage of their substrate PARP-1, and depletion of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 contributed to the sensitivity of miR-1-expressing cells to doxorubicin. Thus, miR-1 has potential therapeutic application against lung cancers.","['Nasser, Mohd W', 'Datta, Jharna', 'Nuovo, Gerard', 'Kutay, Huban', 'Motiwala, Tasneem', 'Majumder, Sarmila', 'Wang, Bo', 'Suster, Saul', 'Jacob, Samson T', 'Ghoshal, Kalpana']","['Nasser MW', 'Datta J', 'Nuovo G', 'Kutay H', 'Motiwala T', 'Majumder S', 'Wang B', 'Suster S', 'Jacob ST', 'Ghoshal K']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry and Pathology, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['P01 CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA122694/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA122695/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA101956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Retracted Publication']",20080925,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (PARP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Caspase 3/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 7/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/genetics', 'Histone Deacetylases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase-1', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",PMC2586284,2008/09/27 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2008/09/27 09:00'],"['2008/09/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)63487-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804788200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Nov 28;283(48):33394-405. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M804788200.

Herein, we examined the reversal effect of two compounds on MDR in adriamycin (Adr)-induced resistant K562/A02 cells. MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay showed that QA1 and QA3 weakly inhibited the growth of tumor cells. However, the compounds increased Adr-induced cytotoxicity toward K562/A02 cells. The IC(50) values of Adr toward K562/A02 were decreased in the presence of QA1 or QA3. The maximal reversal fold (RF) of QA1 and QA3 was reached 6.9 and 9.0, respectively. The action of QA1 and QA3 was also confirmed by the increase of intracellular Adr accumulation in K562/A02 cells. In mechanism study, the intracellular accumulation and efflux of Rh123 were measured using multilabel counter with excitation/emission wavelengths of 485/535nm. An increase of intracellular Rh123 and the decrease of efflux were observed in K562/A02 cells incubation with QA1 or QA3, indicating that the activity of P-gp was blocked. These results suggested that the derivatives of substituted 1,3-dimethyl-1H-quinoxalin-2-ones might reverse MDR in K562/A02 cells via inhibition activity of P-gp.

We identified a CpG island with high density at nucleotides -200 through +100 and explored its role in PCFT promoter silencing. Leukemia cells with barely detectable PCFT transcripts consistently harbored 85-100% methylation of this CpG island, whereas no methylation was found in carcinoma cells. Treatment with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine which induced demethylation but not with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, restored 50-fold PCFT expression only in leukemia cells.

METHODS: Patients received rituximab and ICE for 1-3 cycles, depending upon response. Rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) was given on day 1 and 3 of each cycle (day 1 only for cycle 3), with ifosfamide (3,000 mg/m(2)) and etoposide (100 mg/m(2)) given on days 3, 4, and 5 and carboplatin (635 mg/m(2)) given on day 3 only. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 20 were eligible and evaluable. Although hematologic toxicities were common, only one patient was removed from study due to prolonged myelosuppression. Toxicities related to infusions of rituximab were frequent but manageable. Of the six eligible patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, three achieved complete remission (CR), one had stable disease (SD), and two had progressive disease (PD). Of the 14 eligible patients with Burkitt lymphoma and B-ALL, there were four complete responses (CR), five partial responses (PR), one SD, and four with PD. Thus, the CR/PR rate for the entire group was 12/20 (60%). Following completion of protocol therapy six patients were able to proceed to consolidation with high-dose therapy and stem cell rescue. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of rituximab and ICE chemotherapy was associated with an encouraging objective response (OR) rate and an acceptable toxicity profile.","['Griffin, Timothy C', 'Weitzman, Sheila', 'Weinstein, Howard', 'Chang, Myron', 'Cairo, Mitchell', 'Hutchison, Robert', 'Shiramizu, Bruce', 'Wiley, Joseph', 'Woods, Deborah', 'Barnich, Margaret', 'Gross, Thomas G']","['Griffin TC', 'Weitzman S', 'Weinstein H', 'Chang M', 'Cairo M', 'Hutchison R', 'Shiramizu B', 'Wiley J', 'Woods D', 'Barnich M', 'Gross TG']","['Memorial Hospital of South Bend, South Bend, Indiana, USA. tgriffin@memorialsb.org']",['eng'],"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC2728935,2008/09/26 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.21753 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Feb;52(2):177-81. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21753.,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Feb;52(2):150-2.

However, BMD estimates have been performed using varied instruments, reference data, and interpretations. This exploratory cross sectional study to evaluate bone mass in children with ALL, uses an algorithm that serially adjusts for variables known to affect pediatric bone measures by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), based on models developed in 1,218 healthy children and adolescents. PROCEDURE: Anthropometry, DXA scans, and factors with possible influence on bone mass were evaluated in 21 ALL patients receiving chemotherapy and 20 in the follow-up phase. Main outcome was treatment group differences in Z-scores for total body bone mineral content (BMC), bone area (Area), and areal BMD (aBMD). RESULTS: Mean Z-scores for the entire study population for BMC, Area, and aBMD were significantly less than zero. Among possible contributing factors, only calcium intake was a significant co-variate. Comparison between treatment groups showed that least-square mean Z-scores for patients on-therapy for at least 12 months were significantly lower than those off therapy for at least 12 months (P: 0.0008-0.044), except for BMC at last step of the algorithm (adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, height, weight, and bone area). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of total body DXA by this algorithm is consistent with better general bone status in those off-therapy. However, in this small exploratory study, the lack of significant difference between Z-scores for fully adjusted BMC in on- versus off-therapy groups suggests possible risk of low peak bone mass. Additional longitudinal evaluation is warranted.","['Kelly, Kara M', 'Thornton, John C', 'Hughes, Deborah', 'Osunkwo, Ifeyinwa', 'Weiner, Michael', 'Wang, Jack', 'Horlick, Mary']","['Kelly KM', 'Thornton JC', 'Hughes D', 'Osunkwo I', 'Weiner M', 'Wang J', 'Horlick M']","[""Division of Pediatric Oncology, Columbia University Medical Center, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital of New York-Presbyterian, New York, New York 10032, USA. kk291@columbia.edu""]",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Absorptiometry, Photon', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', '*Bone Density', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/therapy']",,2008/09/26 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21760 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jan;52(1):33-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21760.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-compliance with protocol may not only concern parents or patients, but may also concern health-care providers (HCP). Our study examines the accuracy of leukemia risk classification and attitude of HCP toward protocol compliance in Indonesia. PROCEDURE: A combined retrospective study of medical records (MR) and a cross-sectional questionnaire study with HCP were conducted. Accurate ALL risk classification in MR was assessed. HCP' knowledge of risk classification and their attitude toward protocol compliance were examined. RESULTS: A total of 164 MR patients with ALL were assessed and 97 HCP were interviewed. The protocol criteria for high-risk (HR) were not complete in 82 MR (50%). Of 97 HCP, 95% did not mention all five protocol criteria for HR. Both in the MR as well as in the questionnaires lymphoblast count on day 8 of chemotherapy, as early response to treatment, was the most frequently missed item (missing in 35% of MR and 85% of questionnaires). Only 14% of respondents actually checked with parents whether they administered the prescribed medicines. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that HCP should improve their knowledge and assessment of childhood ALL risk classification, especially lymphoblast count on day 8 of chemotherapy. Proper risk classification and subsequent correct treatment may enable more children to be cured of leukemia.","['Sitaresmi, Mei Neni', 'Mostert, Saskia', 'Gundy, Chad M', 'Sutaryo', 'Veerman, Anjo J P']","['Sitaresmi MN', 'Mostert S', 'Gundy CM', 'Sutaryo', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Growth and Development Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. msitaresmi@yahoo.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Delivery of Health Care/*standards', 'Guideline Adherence/*standards', 'Health Personnel/*standards', 'Humans', 'Indonesia/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",,2008/09/26 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21698 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Dec;51(6):732-6. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21698.,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Dec;51(6):719-21.

New strategies leading to a safe and efficacious food allergy treatment are required. Modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), which allows high levels of expression of recombinant protein in vivo and gives rise to a Th1-biased specific immune response, was used as a prophylactic vaccine in a murine model of ovalbumin (OVA) allergy. METHODS: An MVA-OVA vector vaccine was prepared. Female BALB/c mice were vaccinated twice with a MVA-OVA vector vaccine, followed by sensitization with OVA plus alum. OVA-specific immunoglobulin E(IgE) activity was measured by mediator release from rat basophilic leukaemia cells, whereas specific IgG subclass titers were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Expression of immunological active OVA in mammalian cells was demonstrated. OVA-specific IgE levels in sera from MVA-OVA-vaccinated mice were reduced and appeared delayed. The vaccine-mediated immune modulation was dose-dependent; the highest vaccine dose protected 50% of the animals from allergic sensitization. Upon sensitization, similar OVA-specific IgG1 titers were found in all mice, but the OVA-specific IgG2a antibody levels were strongly increased in MVA-OVA-vaccinated mice, signifying a Th1-biased and, non-allergic immune response. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic vaccination with MVA-OVA delays and in part even prevents the onset of a successful allergen-specific sensitization. Recombinant MVA, which fulfills the requirements for clinical application, is a promising candidate vector for the development of novel approaches to allergen-specific prophylactic vaccination and specific immunotherapy.","['Albrecht, Melanie', 'Suezer, Yasemin', 'Staib, Caroline', 'Sutter, Gerd', 'Vieths, Stefan', 'Reese, Gerald']","['Albrecht M', 'Suezer Y', 'Staib C', 'Sutter G', 'Vieths S', 'Reese G']","['Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Department of Allergology, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Vaccines)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovalbumin/genetics/immunology', 'Rats', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', '*Vaccines/administration & dosage/genetics/immunology', 'Vaccinia virus/*genetics']",,2008/09/26 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.1256 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2008 Dec;10(12):1324-33. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1256.,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

The capture probe was covalently attached on the sulfonic-terminated aminobenzenesulfonic acid monolayer-modified glassy carbon electrode through the free amines of DNA bases based on the acyl chloride cross-linking reaction. The covalently immobilized capture probe could selectively hybridize with its target DNA to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) on the LNA/4-ABSA/GCE surface. Differential pulse voltammetry was used to monitor the hybridization reaction on the capture probe electrode. The decrease of the peak current of methylene blue, an electroactive indicator, was observed upon hybridization of the probe with the target DNA. The results indicated that, in pH 7.0 Tris-HCl buffer solution, the peak current was linear with the concentration of complementary strand in the range of 1.0 x 10 (-12)1.1 x 10 (-11) M with a detection limit of 9.4 x 10 (-13) M. This new method demonstrates its excellent specificity for single-base mismatch and complementary dsDNA after hybridization, and this probe has been used for assay of PCR real sample with satisfactory results.","['Chen, Jinghua', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Wang, Kun', 'Lin, Xinhua', 'Huang, Liying', 'Chen, Guonan']","['Chen J', 'Zhang J', 'Wang K', 'Lin X', 'Huang L', 'Chen G']","['Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Analysis and Detection for Food Safety, Department of Chemistry, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, 350002, China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080925,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Sulfanilic Acids)', '434Z8C2635 (4-sulfanilic acid)', '7440-44-0 (Carbon)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biosensing Techniques/*methods', 'Carbon/*chemistry', 'DNA/*chemistry/genetics', 'Electrochemistry', 'Electrodes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/*chemistry/genetics', '*Glass', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfanilic Acids/*chemistry']",,2008/09/26 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/ac801040e [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2008 Nov 1;80(21):8028-34. doi: 10.1021/ac801040e.

Although the mechanism of retroviral transformation is unknown, Tax interferes with fundamental cellular processes, including proliferation and apoptosis, and these events may directly link Tax to early steps in malignant progression. In this study, we examined the interplay between Tax and the potent proto-oncogene B-cell chronic leukemia protein 3 (Bcl3). Bcl3 is a critical regulator of cell survival and proliferation and is overexpressed in HTLV-1-infected cells. We found that Tax induced Bcl3 expression through stimulation of the NF-kappaB pathway. An intronic NF-kappaB binding site within the Bcl3 gene served as the primary target of Tax-induced NF-kappaB activation. We next considered the consequence of Bcl3 overexpression on Tax function. Interestingly, we found that Bcl3 formed a stable complex with Tax and that this complex potently inhibited Tax-dependent HTLV-1 transcription. Importantly, Bcl3 associated with the HTLV-1 promoter in a Tax-dependent manner and inhibited the binding of the critical cellular coactivator p300. The conserved ankyrin repeat domain of Bcl3 mediated both Tax binding and inhibition of p300 recruitment to the HTLV-1 promoter. Together, these data suggest that Tax-induced Bcl3 overexpression benefits the virus in two important ways. First, Bcl3 may promote cell division and thus clonal proliferation of the virus. Second, Bcl3 may attenuate virion production, facilitating immune evasion. One consequence of this regulatory loop may be Bcl3-induced malignant transformation of the host cell.","['Kim, Young-Mi', 'Sharma, Neelam', 'Nyborg, Jennifer K']","['Kim YM', 'Sharma N', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Campus Box 1870, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-15A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080924,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)']",IM,"['Ankyrins/chemistry', 'B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/physiology', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/physiology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC2583681,2008/09/26 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.01356-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.01356-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Dec;82(23):11939-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.01356-08.

However, it has not been reported whether there is any correlation between degree of anemia and leukemia subtype. DESIGN AND METHODS: In a cohort of 1162 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia we analyzed whether there was a correlation between degree of anemia and leukemia subtype. We also studied the association between degree of anemia and event-free survival within the subtypes. RESULTS: Hemoglobin levels at diagnosis were distributed in a non-random pattern. The degree of anemia was significantly different for three distinct groups of patients compared to the remaining patients (mean hemoglobin; T-cell leukemia: 106 g/L versus 76 g/L (precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia); within precursor B-cell ALL: TEL-AML1 positive: 68 g/L versus 79 g/L; BCR-ABL positive: 93 g/L versus 76 g/L; each p<0.05). Furthermore, in contrast to the entire study group, patients with T-cell leukemia, TEL-AML1(+), and BCR-ABL(+) precursor B-cell leukemia had a more favorable prognosis if presenting with a higher hemoglobin level (>/=80 g/L). CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that the formerly reported direct correlation between severity of anemia and survival in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia mainly reflects differences in the degree of anemia between distinct biological subgroups with different treatment outcomes. On the other hand, the inverse relationship between severity of anemia and survival found within specific subgroups suggests that very low hemoglobin levels at diagnosis are associated with more advanced disease in these subgroups.","['Teuffel, Oliver', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Ludwig, Wolf D', 'Rottgers, Silja', 'Schafer, Beat W', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Niggli, Felix K']","['Teuffel O', 'Stanulla M', 'Cario G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Rottgers S', 'Schafer BW', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schrappe M', 'Niggli FK']","[""University Children's Hospital Zurich, Steinwiesstrasse 75 Zurich, 8032 Switzerland.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080924,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Anemia/blood/*epidemiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/genetics/mortality', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/genetics/mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/genetics/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/09/26 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/09/26 09:00'],"['2008/09/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13156 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13156 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Nov;93(11):1652-7. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13156.

The EVI1 gene locus was rearranged in all 13 patients and was associated with EVI1 overexpression.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied PRAME expression at diagnosis using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction in 125 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia enrolled in the Spanish PETHEMA-96 (n=45) and PETHEMA-99 (n=80) clinical trials. In addition, PRAME expression was evaluated as a marker of disease activity in 225 follow-up samples from 67 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. RESULTS: At diagnosis, PRAME expression in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia was significantly higher (p<0.001) than in patients with non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (n=213) and in healthy controls (n=10). Furthermore, patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with high PRAME expression had a favorable outcome. Thus, the 5-year relapse-free survival was better in patients with >100-fold PRAME expression (86% vs. 74%; p=0.03), and this cut-off established two sub-groups with different relapse-free survival rates among patients with a white cell count <10(9)/L (5-year relapse-free survival 94% vs. 80%, p=0.01). This effect was similar in patients with a white cell count >10(9)/L, although differences were not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, white cell count >10(9)/L (p<0.001), bone marrow blasts >90% (p=0.001), and PRAME expression <100-fold (p=0.009) were associated with short relapse-free survival. Samples at remission showed PRAME levels similar to those in normal controls while samples at relapse over-expressed PRAME again. Furthermore, 12/13 samples collected within the 6-month period preceding relapse showed a >10-fold increase in PRAME expression levels. CONCLUSIONS: Low PRAME expression defines a subgroup of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia with a short relapse-free survival.

The susceptibility of cells to cryopreservation processes, especially freeze-thawing, stimulated considerable interest in better understanding the mechanisms leading to cell injury and inactivation. In this study, we assessed the viability of cells subjected to cold stress, through long-term supercooling experiments, versus freeze-thawing stress. The viability of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and leukemia cells were assessed over time. Supercooled conditions were maintained for 71 days at -10 degrees C, and for 4 h at -15 degrees C, and -20 degrees C, without additives or emulsification. Results showed that cells could be inactivated by the only action of sub-zero temperature, that is, without any water crystallization. The loss of cell viability upon exposure to sub-zero temperatures is suggested to be caused by exposure to cold shock which induced membrane damage. During holding time in the supercooled state, elevated membrane permeability results in uncontrolled mass transfer to and from the cell maintained at cold conditions and thus leads to a loss of viability. With water crystallization, cells shrink suddenly and thus are exposed to cold osmotic shock, which is suggested to induce abrupt loss of cell viability.

The cytotoxic effect of ASNase is derived from its ability to deplete asparagine, an essential amino acid required by certain types of leukemia cells for protein synthesis and survival. Despite its efficacy in enhancing disease remission rate and prolonging complete remission duration in ALL patients, ASNase therapy is nevertheless confounded by a number of serious toxic effects, particularly to organs associated with high protein production (e.g., liver, pancreas), due to the systemic depletion of asparagine. Presented herein is a modified version of our previously established ATTEMPTS protein delivery system that carries the potential to permit a tumor specific, intracellular delivery of ASNase, thereby allowing for a significant reduction of ASNase-induced systemic toxicity. In a previous paper, we already demonstrated the in vitro feasibility of this heparin/protamine-regulated, TAT-mediated system in delivering ASNase directly into ASNase-sensitive murine lymphoma cells. In this article, we further validated the in vivo applicability of this system in animals harboring ASNase-encapsulated L5178Y lymphoma cells. Preliminary results showed that animals inoculated with L5178Y cells containing TAT-ASNase exhibited an extended survival rate of approximately 13% over those harboring L5178Y cells without the encapsulation of ASNase. Furthermore, the TAT-ASNase-treated mice also displayed a significantly improved hematological and liver histological status than the control groups. These findings bring promise to the use of the modified ATTEMPTS delivery system in achieving enhanced ASNase therapy.","['Li, Yong Tao', 'Kwon, Young Min', 'Spangrude, Gerald J', 'Liang, Jun F', 'Chung, Hee Sun', 'Park, Yoon Jeong', 'Yang, Victor C']","['Li YT', 'Kwon YM', 'Spangrude GJ', 'Liang JF', 'Chung HS', 'Park YJ', 'Yang VC']","[""Tianjin Key Laboratory for Modern Drug Delivery and High Efficiency, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['R01 CA114612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55461/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Biomed Mater Res A,Journal of biomedical materials research.

Out of a panel of cancer cell lines, we found that EphA3 was expressed only on two rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines of the embryonal histological subtype and on one of the alveolar RMS subtype, whereas it was not detected on two other cell lines of the alveolar subtype. Other EphA receptors (1-7) were, either not expressed in any, or expressed in all five RMS cell lines. Stimulation of EphA3-expressing TE671 and RD RMS cells with ephrinA5 resulted in loss of adhesion to fibronectin, decreased migration towards the stromal cell-derived growth factor-I (SDF-I), increased EphA3 phosphorylation, and increased Rho GTPase activity. In contrast, ectopic expression of EphA3 in the EphA3 negative CRL2061 cell line resulted in decreased cell adhesion. Finally, suppression of EphA3 expression by siRNA in RD cells results in increased SDF-I-mediated motility. These data indicate that EphA3 expression may define subsets of RMS tumours, and that EphA3 suppresses motility through regulation of Rho GTPases in RMS cells.","['Clifford, Noretta', 'Smith, Loraine M', 'Powell, James', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Marx, Alexander', ""O'Connor, Rosemary""]","['Clifford N', 'Smith LM', 'Powell J', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Marx A', ""O'Connor R""]","['Cell Biology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, BioSciences Institute, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Ephrin-A5)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, EphA3)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Ephrin-A5/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Receptor, EphA3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism']",,2008/09/25 09:00,2009/02/04 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21926 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Dec 1;105(5):1250-9. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21926.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy three patients with incident, histologically confirmed MM and 73 controls matched on gender and age were studied between 2001 and 2007, and blood samples were collected. Serum adiponectin, leptin, resistin, as well as MM prognostic parameters were determined. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Lower serum adiponectin and resistin levels were associated with higher risk of MM by bivariate analysis and after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, and serum levels of leptin (p < 0.0001). Adiponectin may have a protective role in MM, whereas leptin was not associated with risk for MM at a comparable level of significance and resistin levels may be decreased via a compensatory mechanism. Further studies are needed to confirm these associations and to explore the mechanisms underlying adiponectin's role in MM and plasma cell dyscrasias.","['Dalamaga, Maria', 'Karmaniolas, Konstantinos', 'Panagiotou, Anna', 'Hsi, Alex', 'Chamberland, John', 'Dimas, Cleanthi', 'Lekka, Antigoni', 'Mantzoros, Christos S']","['Dalamaga M', 'Karmaniolas K', 'Panagiotou A', 'Hsi A', 'Chamberland J', 'Dimas C', 'Lekka A', 'Mantzoros CS']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Medical School, University of Athens, Attikon, General University Hospital, 1 Rimini Street, Chaidari, 10024, Athens, Greece.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080924,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,"['0 (Adiponectin)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Resistin)']",IM,"['Adiponectin/*blood', 'Aged', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leptin/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/etiology', 'Obesity/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Resistin/*blood', 'Risk Factors']",,2008/09/25 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2007/12/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s10552-008-9233-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2009 Mar;20(2):193-9. doi: 10.1007/s10552-008-9233-7.

P190 and Spa-1 co-localized to peripheral actin structures in primary lymphoblasts and expression of Spa-1 in the leukemic lymphoblasts decreased the migration of these cells.

WEHI-3 and LLC cells exposed to calcitriol or PRI-2191 lost their migratory and adhesive potentials. The inhibition of migratory potential was higher in the LLC cells than in the WEHI-3 cells and appeared to correlate with the increased down-regulation of alphavbeta3 integrin by calcitriol or PRI-2191.

Autologous transplantation of epidermal stem cells genetically corrected with a Moloney leukemia virus (MLV)-derived retroviral vector reconstitutes LAM5 synthesis, and corrects the adhesion defect in JEB patients. However, MLV-derived vectors have genotoxic characteristics, and are unable to reproduce the physiological, basal layer-restricted expression of LAM5 chains. We have developed an alternative gene transfer strategy based on self-inactivating (SIN) or long terminal repeat (LTR)-modified lentiviral vectors, in which transgene expression is under the control of different combinations of promoter-enhancer elements derived from the keratin-14 (K14) gene. Analysis in human keratinocyte cultures and in fully differentiated skin regenerated onto immunodeficient mice showed that gene expression directed by K14 enhancers is tissue-specific and restricted to the basal layer of the epidermis. Transcriptionally targeted lentiviral vectors efficiently transduced clonogenic stem/progenitor cells derived from a skin biopsy of a JEB patient, restored normal synthesis of LAM5 in cultured keratinocytes, and reconstituted normal adhesion properties in human skin equivalents transplanted onto immunodeficient mice. These vectors are therefore an effective, and potentially more safe, alternative to MLV-based retroviral vectors in gene therapy of JEB.Molecular Therapy (2008) 16 12, 1977-1985 doi:10.1038/mt.2008.204.","['Di Nunzio, Francesca', 'Maruggi, Giulietta', 'Ferrari, Stefano', 'Di Iorio, Enzo', 'Poletti, Valentina', 'Garcia, Marta', 'Del Rio, Marcela', 'De Luca, Michele', 'Larcher, Fernando', 'Pellegrini, Graziella', 'Mavilio, Fulvio']","['Di Nunzio F', 'Maruggi G', 'Ferrari S', 'Di Iorio E', 'Poletti V', 'Garcia M', 'Del Rio M', 'De Luca M', 'Larcher F', 'Pellegrini G', 'Mavilio F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080923,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (kalinin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epidermal Cells', 'Epidermis/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Health', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/metabolism', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",,2008/09/25 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)32097-4 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2008.204 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Dec;16(12):1977-85. doi: 10.1038/mt.2008.204.

Accurate diagnosis of MDS can be difficult, and its classification requires evaluation of cytopenias, bone marrow morphology, blast percentage, and cytogenetics. These factors, as well as patient performance status and red blood cell transfusion dependence, can be used to predict prognosis in MDS. Accurate diagnosis and classification are essential for subgroup identification and prognostic assessment of patients with MDS. This article reviews essential criteria for staging and subgroup classification and summarizes prognostic scoring systems that aid in risk stratification and selection of optimal therapy. Classification systems such as the World Health Organization (WHO) classification are widely used but do not always provide sufficient prognostic information. This limitation led to the creation of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). However, this system was designed to be used only at diagnosis and may not be suitable for serial assessment of patients whose disease can evolve over time. The WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) permits dynamic estimation of survival and risk of AML transformation at multiple time points during the natural course of MDS. Prognostic scoring systems such as WPSS allow for prediction of survival and risk of leukemic evolution at any time during the course of the disease. Such an approach may provide a useful adjunct for clinical decision making, including selection of appropriate treatment options.","['Malcovati, Luca', 'Nimer, Stephen D']","['Malcovati L', 'Nimer SD']","['Department of Hematology, University of Pavia and Fondazione Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Cancer Control,Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center,9438457,,IM,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/*diagnosis', 'Precancerous Conditions/classification/diagnosis', 'Prognosis']",,2008/10/18 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/10/18 09:00'],"['2008/10/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/107327480801504s02 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Control. 2008 Oct;15 Suppl:4-13. doi: 10.1177/107327480801504s02.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the functional roles of PML in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have not been clarified, we assessed the expression of PML protein in GBM tissues and explored the mechanisms of PML-regulated cell death in GBM cells. We examined the PML mRNA level and the expression of PML protein in surgical GBM specimens. PML-regulated apoptotic mechanisms in GBM cells transfected with plasmids expressing the PML gene were examined. The protein expression of PML was significantly lower in GBM than in non-neoplastic tissues; approximately 10% of GBM tissues were PML-null. The PML mRNA levels were similar in both tissue types. The overexpression of PML activated caspase-8 and induced apoptosis in GBM cells. In these cells, PML decreased the expression of transactivated forms of NFkappaB/p65, and c-FLIP gene expression was suppressed. Therefore, PML-induced apoptosis resulted from the suppression of the transcriptional activity of NFkappaB/p65. PML overexpression decreased phosphorylated IkappaBalpha and nuclear NFkappaB/p65 and increased the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1). A proteasome inhibitor blocked the reduction of activated p65 by PML. The reduction of PML is associated with the pathogenesis of GBM. PML induces caspase-8-dependent apoptosis via the repression of NFkappaB activation by which PML facilitates the proteasomal degradation of activated p65 and the sequestration of p65 with IkappaBalpha in the cytoplasm. This novel mechanism of PML-regulated apoptosis may represent a therapeutic target for GBM.","['Kuwayama, Kazuyuki', 'Matsuzaki, Kazuhito', 'Mizobuchi, Yoshihumi', 'Mure, Hideo', 'Kitazato, Keiko T', 'Kageji, Teruyoshi', 'Nakao, Mitsuyoshi', 'Nagahiro, Shinji']","['Kuwayama K', 'Matsuzaki K', 'Mizobuchi Y', 'Mure H', 'Kitazato KT', 'Kageji T', 'Nakao M', 'Nagahiro S']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Institute of Health Biosciences, University of Tokushima Graduate School, Tokushima, Tokushima, Japan. kny1616@yahoo.co.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080923,England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,"['0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Female', 'Glioblastoma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",PMC2718984,2008/09/25 09:00,2009/05/07 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['15228517-2008-083 [pii]', '10.1215/15228517-2008-083 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 2009 Apr;11(2):132-41. doi: 10.1215/15228517-2008-083.

We used in vitro and mouse transplantation assays to study hematopoiesis in trisomy 21 fetal livers with normal GATA1 alleles. Remarkably, trisomy 21 progenitors exhibited enhanced production of erythroid and megakaryocytic cells that proliferated excessively. Our findings indicate that trisomy 21 itself is associated with cell-autonomous expansion of erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors.

The likelihood that these patients developed CLL clones with identical antibody V regions randomly is highly improbable and suggests selection by a common antigen. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from this stereotypic subset strongly bind cytoplasmic structures in HEp-2 cells. Therefore, HEp-2 cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with recombinant stereotypic subset-specific CLL mAbs, revealing a major protein band at approximately 225 kDa that was identified by mass spectrometry as nonmuscle myosin heavy chain IIA (MYHIIA). Reactivity of the stereotypic mAbs with MYHIIA was confirmed by Western blot and immunofluorescence colocalization with anti-MYHIIA antibody. Treatments that alter MYHIIA amounts and cytoplasmic localization resulted in a corresponding change in binding to these mAbs. The appearance of MYHIIA on the surface of cells undergoing stress or apoptosis suggests that CLL mAb may generally bind molecules exposed as a consequence of these events. Binding of CLL mAb to MYHIIA could promote the development, survival, and expansion of these leukemic cells.","['Chu, Charles C', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Hatzi, Katerina', 'Yan, Xiao-Jie', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Wang, Xiao Bo', 'Fales, Henry M', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Chu CC', 'Catera R', 'Hatzi K', 'Yan XJ', 'Zhang L', 'Wang XB', 'Fales HM', 'Allen SL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-Long Island Jewish (LIJ) Health System, Manhasset, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080923,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Nonmuscle Myosin Type IIA/*immunology', 'Stereoisomerism']",PMC2597608,2008/09/25 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51753-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-162024 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5122-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-06-162024.

Several treatment strategies using these agents, usually in combination with chemotherapy, but also without or with minimal use of cytotoxic agents, have provided excellent therapeutic results. Cure of APL patients, however, is also dependent on peculiar aspects related to the management and supportive measures that are crucial to counteract life-threatening complications associated with the disease biology and molecularly targeted treatment. The European LeukemiaNet recently appointed an international panel of experts to develop evidence- and expert opinion-based guidelines on the diagnosis and management of APL. Together with providing current indications on genetic diagnosis, modern risk-adapted front-line therapy and salvage treatment, the review contains specific recommendations for the identification and management of most important complications such as the bleeding disorder, APL differentiation syndrome, QT prolongation and other ATRA- and ATO-related toxicities, as well as for molecular assessment of response to treatment. Finally, the approach to special situations is also discussed, including management of APL in children, elderly patients, and pregnant women.","['Sanz, Miguel A', 'Grimwade, David', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Naoe, Tomoki', 'Lengfelder, Eva', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Sanz MA', 'Grimwade D', 'Tallman MS', 'Lowenberg B', 'Fenaux P', 'Estey EH', 'Naoe T', 'Lengfelder E', 'Buchner T', 'Dohner H', 'Burnett AK', 'Lo-Coco F']","['University Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain. msanz@uv.es']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080923,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Databases, Factual', 'Europe', 'Female', '*Health Planning Guidelines', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/complications/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Societies, Medical', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,2008/09/25 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37628-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-150250 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Feb 26;113(9):1875-91. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-04-150250.

DIF-1 has also been shown to possess pharmacological activities, such as the suppression of tumor cell growth and the promotion of glucose uptake in non-transformed mammalian cells. In this study, we tried to develop compounds that possess weaker anti-tumor activity and stronger glucose uptake-promoting activity than DIF-1. MAIN METHODS: We investigated the in vitro effects of 12 derivatives of DIF-1 on glucose consumption in mouse 3T3-L1 cells and on cell growth in K562 human leukemia cells. We also examined the effect of a good compound on the blood glucose concentration in KK-Ay diabetic mice. KEY FINDINGS: We found that some derivatives at 20 microM promoted glucose consumption more than twice as fast as the control. Of the derivatives, a compound named DIF-1(3M), which has a weaker anti-leukemic effect than DIF-1, promoted glucose consumption as strongly as DIF-1 in confluent 3T3-L1 cells. While DIF-1 at 20 microM was inhibitory to the cell growth of 3T3-L1, DIF-1(3M) at 20 microM exhibited no inhibitory effect on the growing cells. We also found that DIF-1(3M) injected (10-12.5 mg/kg body weight) intraperitoneally in mice tended to lower the blood glucose concentration. SIGNIFICANCE: The present results open the possibility for the development of new agents that possess strong glucose-uptake-promoting activity but little anti-tumor activity and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes and/or obesity.","['Kubohara, Yuzuru', 'Kikuchi, Haruhisa', 'Oshima, Yoshiteru']","['Kubohara Y', 'Kikuchi H', 'Oshima Y']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Institute for Molecular and Cellular Regulation (IMCR), Gunma University, Maebashi 371-8512, Japan. kubohara@showa.gunma-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080909,Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Differentiation-inducing factor-1, Dictyostelium)', '0 (Hexanones)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['3T3-L1 Cells', 'Animals', 'Blood Glucose/analysis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Hexanones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Male', 'Mice']",,2008/09/25 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/25 09:00'],"['2008/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0024-3205(08)00346-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.lfs.2008.08.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2008 Oct 24;83(17-18):608-12. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2008.08.012.

Here we review the recent literature that has uncovered new insight into DFF's regulation, and both its positive and negative roles in human disease. Cells from mice deficient in DFF still undergo apoptotic death without significant cell-autonomous DNA degradation. Their corpses' genomes are subsequently degraded by lysosomal DNase II after phagocytosis. However,DFF-deficient mice are more susceptible to cancer. Indeed, several different cancers in humans are associated with defects in DFF expression and it has been proposed that DFF is a p53-independent tumor suppressor. Negative aspects of DFF expression include contributing to susceptibility to acquire systemic lupus erythematosus, to chromosomal translocations that result in mixed lineage leukemias, and in the possible spreading of oncogenes and HIV due to horizontal gene transfer.","['Widlak, P', 'Garrard, W T']","['Widlak P', 'Garrard WT']","['Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, 44-100, Gliwice, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,"['0 (Protein Subunits)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', '*DNA Fragmentation', 'Deoxyribonucleases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Transfer, Horizontal', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics/metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Subunits/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2009/02/28 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00018-008-8472-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2009 Jan;66(2):263-74. doi: 10.1007/s00018-008-8472-9.,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were defined initially by Cahan: the tumors must occur at the irradiated site after a time of latency longer than 5 years and be of a different pathological type from the initially irradiated tumor. The central nervous system belongs to sensitive tissue and it seems that a threshold dose does not exist. Thus, the relative risk varies from 1.57 to 8.75 for a dose of 1 Gy. It increases with the time of observation with a maximum of 18.4 between 20 and 25 years. Thus the cerebral radiation-induced tumors would be dependent on low dose for large volumes of healthy cerebral tissue (tineas, acute leukemia), and high dose for small volumes as irradiated benign lesions (pituitary tumors, meningiomas). Several factors influence the incidence of these radiation-induced tumors, of which the age at exposure and individual susceptibility are related to heredity. To date, 3 cases of radio-associated glioblastoma and 5 cases of transformed vestibular schwannoma related to radiosurgery were reported in the literature. They do not present all the traditional criteria. Thus, we reported through our experience 2 cases illustrating these problems to confront them with the published data. The long-term risk of radiation-induced tumor requires a time of observation between 5 and 30 years. This risk is estimated at less than 1 per 1,000. It must be communicated to each patient and counterbalanced with the operational risk of a benign tumor (1 per 100 of perioperative mortality) or the hemorrhagic risk of an untreated arteriovenous malformation (1 per 100 per year).","['Muracciole, Xavier', 'Regis, Jean']","['Muracciole X', 'Regis J']","[""Service de Neurochirurgie Fonctionnelle et Stereotaxique, Hopital d'Adulte de la Timone, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Switzerland,Prog Neurol Surg,Progress in neurological surgery,0076033,,IM,"['Central Nervous System/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Radiosurgery/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Risk Factors']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['000157166 [pii]', '10.1159/000157166 [doi]']",ppublish,Prog Neurol Surg. 2008;21:207-213. doi: 10.1159/000157166.,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several abnormalities of T-cell populations have been described in HCL, the effector mechanism responsible for the increased susceptibility to infections is not known. METHODS: Blood was collected from 11 patients with HCL and 22 age- and gender-matched volunteers. Proinflammatory cytokine production by freshly isolated mononuclear cells was stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide or various heat-killed microorganisms. Cytokine concentrations were assessed by specific ELISAs. RESULTS: We demonstrate that mononuclear cells harvested from HCL patients have a specific defect of IFNgamma production when stimulated with a broad panel of bacterial stimuli. In contrast, the production of other proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6, did not differ between HCL patients and controls. CONCLUSION: The specific defect in IFNgamma production may play a role in the susceptibility of patients with hairy cell leukaemia towards intracellular pathogens.","['Netea, M G', 'Hoitink, O', 'Kullberg, B J', 'van der Meer, J W M', 'Raymakers, R']","['Netea MG', 'Hoitink O', 'Kullberg BJ', 'van der Meer JW', 'Raymakers R']","['Division of General Internal Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,"['0 (Cytokines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytokines', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mycobacterium', 'Pilot Projects']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neth J Med. 2008 Sep;66(8):340-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared BCR-ABL transcript type and level with kinase domain (KD) mutation status, genotype, and phenotype in 1855 Ph(+) leukemias. Compared with e1a2/p190 BCR-ABL cases, de novo e13-e14a2/p210 Ph(+) lymphoid leukemia more frequently showed CML-type background, had higher blast-normalized BCR-ABL transcript levels, and more frequent persistent BCR-ABL transcript in the absence of detectable lymphoblasts. Secondary lymphoid blast transformation of CML was exclusively due to e13/e14a2/p210 BCR-ABL but was associated, at a much higher level than p210 myeloid transformation, with acquisition of new KD mutations and/or Ph genomic amplification. In contrast, myeloid blast transformation was more frequently accompanied by new acquisition of acute myeloid leukemia-type chromosomal aberrations, particularly involving the EVI1 and RUNX1 loci. Therefore, higher kinase activity by mutation, transcriptional up-regulation or gene amplification appears required for lymphoid transformation by p210 BCR-ABL.","['Jones, Dan', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Thomas, Deborah', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Hai, Seema', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'de Lima, Marcos', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Jorgensen, Jeffrey L']","['Jones D', 'Luthra R', 'Cortes J', 'Thomas D', ""O'Brien S"", 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Hai S', 'Ravandi F', 'de Lima M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Jorgensen JL']","['Departments of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.

Although there is strong evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy is effective in stages II and IIIA NSCLC, its utility in stage IB disease is unclear. This report provides a mature analysis of Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9633, the only RCT designed specifically for stage IB NSCLC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 4 to 8 weeks of resection, patients were randomly assigned to adjuvant chemotherapy or observation. Eligible patients had pathologically confirmed T2N0 NSCLC and had undergone lobectomy or pneumonectomy. Chemotherapy consisted of paclitaxel 200 mg/m(2) intravenously over 3 hours and carboplatin at an area under the curve dose of 6 mg/mL per minute intravenously over 45 to 60 minutes every 3 weeks for four cycles. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: Three hundred-forty-four patients were randomly assigned. Median follow-up was 74 months. Groups were well-balanced with regard to demographics, histology, and extent of surgery. Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia were the predominant toxicity; there were no treatment-related deaths. Survival was not significantly different (hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; CI, 0.64 to 1.08; P = .12). However, exploratory analysis demonstrated a significant survival difference in favor of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who had tumors > or = 4 cm in diameter (HR, 0.69; CI, 0.48 to 0.99; P = .043). CONCLUSION: Because a significant survival advantage was not observed across the entire cohort, adjuvant chemotherapy should not be considered standard care in stage IB NSCLC. Given the magnitude of observed survival differences, CALGB 9633 was underpowered to detect small but clinically meaningful improvements. A statistically significant survival advantage for patients who had tumors > or = 4 cm supports consideration of adjuvant paclitaxel/carboplatin for stage IB patients who have large tumors.","['Strauss, Gary M', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Maddaus, Michael A', 'Johnstone, David W', 'Johnson, Elizabeth A', 'Harpole, David H', 'Gillenwater, Heidi H', 'Watson, Dorothy M', 'Sugarbaker, David J', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Vokes, Everett E', 'Green, Mark R']","['Strauss GM', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Maddaus MA', 'Johnstone DW', 'Johnson EA', 'Harpole DH', 'Gillenwater HH', 'Watson DM', 'Sugarbaker DJ', 'Schilsky RL', 'Vokes EE', 'Green MR']","['Tufts Medical Center, Division of Medical Oncology, Tufts-NEMC, Boston, MA 02111, USA. gstrauss@tuftsmedicalcenter.org']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA21661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080922,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carboplatin/administration & dosage', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Observation', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Patient Selection', 'Pneumonectomy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",PMC2652093,2008/09/24 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.16.4855 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4855 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 1;26(31):5043-51. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4855.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy-five adults age less than 60 years with untreated primary CN-AML were screened before treatment for CEBPA, FLT3, MLL, WT1, and NPM1 mutations and BAALC and ERG expression levels. Gene and microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles were obtained for the CN-AML molecular high-risk patients. RESULTS: CEBPA mutations predicted better event-free (P = .007), disease-free (P = .014), and overall survival (P < .001) independently of other molecular and clinical prognosticators. Among patients with CEBPA mutations, 91% were in the CN-AML molecular high-risk group. Within this group, CEBPA mutations predicted better event-free (P < .001), disease-free (P = .004), and overall survival (P = .009) independently of other molecular and clinical characteristics and were associated with unique gene and miRNA expression profiles. The major features of these profiles were upregulation of genes (eg, GATA1, ZFPM1, EPOR, and GFI1B) and miRNAs (ie, the miR-181 family) involved in erythroid differentiation and downregulation of homeobox genes. CONCLUSION: Pretreatment testing for CEBPA mutations identifies CN-AML patients with different outcomes, particularly in the molecular high-risk group, thus improving molecular risk-based classification of this large cytogenetic subset of AML. The gene and miRNA expression profiling provided insights into leukemogenesis of the CN-AML molecular high-risk group, indicating that CEBPA mutations are associated with partial erythroid differentiation.","['Marcucci, Guido', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Radmacher, Michael D', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Langer, Christian', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Liu, Chang-Gong', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Marcucci G', 'Maharry K', 'Radmacher MD', 'Mrozek K', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Paschka P', 'Whitman SP', 'Langer C', 'Baldus CD', 'Liu CG', 'Ruppert AS', 'Powell BL', 'Carroll AJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Kolitz JE', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. guido.marcucci@osumc.edu']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA089341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA98933/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080922,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (BAALC protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (ERG protein, human)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcriptional Regulator ERG)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcriptional Regulator ERG', 'Treatment Outcome', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",PMC2652095,2008/09/24 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.17.5554 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.5554 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 1;26(31):5078-87. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.5554.

Although PML is thought to achieve transcription activation by stabilizing the transcription factor complex, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. To clarify the role of PML in transcription regulation, we purified the PML complex and identified Fbxo3 (Fbx3), Skp1, and Cullin1 as novel components of this complex. Fbx3 formed SCF(Fbx3) ubiquitin ligase and promoted the degradation of HIPK2 and p300 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. PML inhibited this degradation through a mechanism that unexpectedly did not involve inhibition of the ubiquitination of HIPK2. PML, Fbx3, and HIPK2 synergistically activated p53-induced transcription. Our findings suggest that PML stabilizes the transcription factor complex by protecting HIPK2 and p300 from SCF(Fbx3)-induced degradation until transcription is completed. In contrast, the leukemia-associated fusion PML-RARalpha induced the degradation of HIPK2. We discuss the roles of PML and PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha, as well as those of HIPK2 and p300 ubiquitination, in transcriptional regulation and leukemogenesis.","['Shima, Yutaka', 'Shima, Takito', 'Chiba, Tomoki', 'Irimura, Tatsuro', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Kitabayashi, Issay']","['Shima Y', 'Shima T', 'Chiba T', 'Irimura T', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Molecular Oncology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080922,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (Fbxo3 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (HIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'SKP Cullin F-Box Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",PMC2593379,2008/09/24 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00897-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00897-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Dec;28(23):7126-38. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00897-08.

The infection was due to a non-pigmented strain of C. violaceum and was associated with a co-infection with Candida parapsilosis; both were successfully treated using broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals and removal of a Hickman line.","['Bosch, F J', 'Badenhorst, L', 'Le Roux, J A', 'Louw, V J']","['Bosch FJ', 'Badenhorst L', 'Le Roux JA', 'Louw VJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.', 'Division of Clinical Haematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,England,J Med Microbiol,Journal of medical microbiology,0224131,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/pharmacology', 'Candidiasis/complications/drug therapy', 'Chromobacterium/*isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Sepsis/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'South Africa/epidemiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2008/11/07 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jmm.0.2008/001883-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Microbiol. 2008 Oct;57(Pt 10):1293-1295. doi: 10.1099/jmm.0.2008/001883-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplantation event represents a strong immunogenic stimulus for host-reactive donor T cells that induce graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Therefore, in this study, we addressed the question of whether a single posttransplantation CY administration (CY2) can prevent acute GVHD-related mortality without compromising engraftment of allogeneic transplant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Splenocyte-enriched C57BL/6 bone marrow was transplanted to BALB/c recipients after mild irradiation, and conditioning with DST and 100 mg/kg CY. Following transplantation, recipients were left untreated or given on a specified day a single CY2 injection (50 mg/kg). All animals were monitored for survival, chimerism, and clinical signs of GVHD. Experimental mice that received BCL1 leukemia cells before transplantation were monitored for leukemia-related mortality as well. RESULTS: Animals that received no CY2 after transplantation died of acute GVHD. A single low-dose CY2 treatment within the first 5 days after transplantation prevented mortality in most recipients. However, only CY2 administration on days +1 or +5 preserved chimerism. Most chimeras survived GVHD-free for >200 days. Prolonged persistence of host-reactive T cells in mice (CY2 on day +5) permitted a reduction to be made in engraftment-essential irradiation dose and preserved a strong graft-vs-leukemia effect of transplantation. CONCLUSION: Acute GVHD can be prevented in mice by a single properly timed posttransplantation low-dose CY administration.","['Prigozhina, Tatyana B', 'Elkin, Gregory', 'Khitrin, Sofia', 'Slavin, Shimon']","['Prigozhina TB', 'Elkin G', 'Khitrin S', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. t.prigozhina@gmail.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080921,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Graft Survival/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00348-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Dec;36(12):1750-9. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.002.

Conflicting data exists regarding the developmental function of SCL, namely, whether it acts as a master regulator, actively patterning mesoderm toward hematopoietic development at the expense of other lineages, or is merely necessary to maintain the earliest committed hematopoietic precursors. To answer this question, we have engineered murine embryonic stem cells with a conditional doxycycline-inducible SCL transgene, and evaluated the effects of SCL expression at defined time points during in vitro development. Continual SCL expression during differentiation results in markedly increased hematopoiesis. By using pulses of gene expression over a 6-day differentiation time course, we map and characterize windows of SCL responsiveness. Notably, a pulse of SCL expression during early mesodermal patterning (48 to 72 hours of differentiation) promoted Flk1+ PDGFRalphaneg presumptive extraembryonic/lateral plate mesoderm at the expense of PDGFRalpha+ Flk1neg presumptive paraxial mesoderm. Consistent with this, the early pulse of SCL expression also expanded hematopoietic colony-forming cell numbers, while concomitantly repressing expression of paraxial and cardiac markers, and inhibited development of beating cardiomyocytes. By mixing the inducible embryonic stem cells with fluorescently labeled wild-type cells in chimeric embryoid bodies, we show that these effects of SCL are cell autonomous. These data support a master-regulatory role for SCL in mesodermal patterning, in addition to its established later roles in hematopoietic differentiation.","['Ismailoglu, Ismail', 'Yeamans, Gabriel', 'Daley, George Q', 'Perlingeiro, Rita C R', 'Kyba, Michael']","['Ismailoglu I', 'Yeamans G', 'Daley GQ', 'Perlingeiro RC', 'Kyba M']","['Lillehei Heart Institute and Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080921,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/embryology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mesoderm/cytology/*embryology', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Time Factors', 'Transgenes/physiology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/metabolism']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2009/01/23 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00351-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Dec;36(12):1593-603. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.07.005.

DC are potent antigen-presenting cells and are crucial for initiating specific immune responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We first analyzed peripheral blood samples of healthy pediatric controls (n=72). Once a range of normal parameters was established, we compared these to newly diagnosed pediatric leukemia and lymphoma patients prior to receiving therapy (n=69). Using flow cytometry, we examined blood DC cell-surface expression of CD80, CD86, CD40, CD18, CD50, CD83, CD123, CD58, CD54, and CD11c. RESULTS: Expression of each of these molecules was significantly altered except for CD80, CD83, and CD58. When compared to healthy children, absolute blood DC were reduced in children with leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma (p<0.0001) and children with Hodgkin's disease (p=0.0028). Additionally, lymphocyte function in vitro, was impaired (p=0.0489) for children with lymphoblastic malignancies, while patients with Hodgkin's disease had normal proliferative function. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that peripheral blood DC from children with newly diagnosed leukemia or lymphoma are significantly altered in number, subset distribution, and costimulation molecule expression, and that lymphocyte function is impaired compared to healthy pediatric controls.","['Caruso, Denise A', 'Fraser, Sarah', 'Hardy, Kellie', 'Amor, Gerlinda', 'Helmich, Jorinde J', 'Ashley, David M']","['Caruso DA', 'Fraser S', 'Hardy K', 'Amor G', 'Helmich JJ', 'Ashley DM']","[""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, The Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Department of Pediatrics at the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

HTLV-I Tax seems to be involved in the development of such pulmonary diseases through the local production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in T cells. However, little is known about induction of these genes by HTLV-I infection in lung epithelial cells. RESULTS: We tested infection of lung epithelial cells by HTLV-I by coculture studies in which A549 alveolar and NCI-H292 tracheal epithelial cell lines were cocultured with MT-2, an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line. Changes in the expression of several cellular genes were assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and flow cytometry. Coculture with MT-2 cells resulted in infection of lung epithelial cells as confirmed by detection of proviral DNA, HTLV-I Tax expression and HTLV-I p19 in the latter cells. Infection was associated with induction of mRNA expression of various cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecule. NF-kappaB and AP-1 were also activated in HTLV-I-infected lung epithelial cells. In vivo studies showed Tax protein in lung epithelial cells of mice bearing Tax and patients with HTLV-I-related pulmonary diseases. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HTLV-I infects lung epithelial cells, with subsequent production of cytokines, chemokines and cell adhesion molecules through induction of NF-kappaB and AP-1. These changes can contribute to the clinical features of HTLV-I-related pulmonary diseases.","['Teruya, Hiromitsu', 'Tomita, Mariko', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Ishikawa, Chie', 'Tamayose, Maki', 'Miyazato, Akiko', 'Yara, Satomi', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Iwakura, Yoichiro', 'Fujita, Jiro', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Teruya H', 'Tomita M', 'Senba M', 'Ishikawa C', 'Tamayose M', 'Miyazato A', 'Yara S', 'Tanaka Y', 'Iwakura Y', 'Fujita J', 'Mori N']","['Division of Molecular Virology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa, Japan. hiromitsu20@hotmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080922,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Adaptor Protein Complex 1)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Protein Complex 1/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial Cells/immunology/*virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lung/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/biosynthesis']",PMC2556696,2008/09/24 09:00,2008/11/07 09:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-86 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-86 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Sep 22;5:86. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is no information so far about the epigenetic characteristics of ERalpha isoforms and ERbeta in leukaemias. In the present study, the mRNA expression and promoter CpG methylation of ERalpha isoforms (i.e. ERalpha-A, -B and -C) and ERbeta in leukaemia cell lines were evaluated using RT-PCR (reverse transcription-PCR) and MSP (methylation-specific PCR) respectively. The methylation of ERs was further analysed in acute leukaemia patients by MSP and direct DNA sequencing. Although all ERalpha isoforms and ERbeta were methylated in all leukaemia cell lines, except for ERalpha-C, which was unmethylated in HL-60 and K562 cell lines, only the expression of ERalpha-A was deficient in all cell lines and its expression could be reactivated by DNA demethylation reagents. With regard to the methylation characteristics in acute leukaemia patients, only ERalpha-A was inactivated and specifically methylated (95%; 38/40) in almost all patients and unmethylated in all healthy controls, whereas ERalpha-B, -C and ERbeta were methylated in both patients and healthy controls. This result suggested that the methylated status of ERalpha-A might serve as an epigenetic biomarker of leukaemias. The present study is the first report that demonstrates selective inactivation of ERalpha isoforms through the promoter CpG methylation pathway in leukaemias.","['Yao, Jie', 'Huang, Qing', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bing', 'Fu, Wei-Ling']","['Yao J', 'Huang Q', 'Zhang XB', 'Fu WL']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Southwest Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*CpG Islands', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/*genetics/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2008/09/24 09:00,2009/10/09 06:00,['2008/09/24 09:00'],"['2008/09/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/09 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20080140 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20080140 [doi]']",ppublish,Biosci Rep. 2009 Aug;29(4):211-6. doi: 10.1042/BSR20080140.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study is to analyze the most important criteria that determined whether these diseases were recognized or rejected as ODs according to No. 1303 in 2006. METHODS: In 2006, 70 suspected cases of OD No. 1303 reported in North Rhine-Westphalia were examined in terms of diagnosis, notifiers, cumulative benzene exposures, professions, coexposures, delays in notification, latency periods, interim periods, and recognition criteria. RESULTS: 70 benign and malignant diseases of myeloid and lymphoid origin were reported as suspected ODs, among them 41 B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (B-cell NHL). Latency periods ranged between 14 and 57 years (median 37; mean 36.3+/-11.4; n=45), estimated cumulative benzene exposures varied from 0 to 144 ppm-years (median 12; mean 11.4+/-22.8; n=59). Four of 70 suspected cases were recognized as OD No. 1303. In 37 cases (52.9%), the nature of the disease was assessed as being nontypical of OD No. 1303, in 50 cases (71.4%), no sufficient benzene exposure could be found. Mature-cell NHL and Hodgkin's lymphoma were not recognized as OD. Cumulative benzene exposures<or=12.3 ppm-years were not regarded as being sufficient to cause OD No. 1303. CONCLUSION: When diagnosing hematologic diseases, physicians should ask the patients about their occupational history and, in particular, consider benzene exposures dating back several decades. To improve the state of knowledge of OD No. 1303, it is important that diseases are consistently classified according to WHO criteria and any kind of myeloid and lymphoid disease, including NHL, is reported.","['Beelte, Stefanie', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Jansing, Paul-Josef']","['Beelte S', 'Haas R', 'Germing U', 'Jansing PJ']","['Landesinstitut fur Gesundheit und Arbeit des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen, Zentrum fur Gesundheit in der Arbeit, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['ger'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20080921,Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,['J64922108F (Benzene)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Occupational Medicine/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Occupations', 'Time Factors']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-008-1090-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2008 Aug 15;103(8):553-60. doi: 10.1007/s00063-008-1090-3.

Leukemic cells of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) could be differentiated to DC-like cells possessing the ability of stimulating anti-leukemic immune response. Despite obvious progress in DC-based immunotherapy, some discrepancies were reported in differentiation potential of AML blasts from all patients toward DC like cells. The present study, as a local experience, was set up to generate DCs from AML blasts of various subtypes. Leukemic Blasts from 16 Iranian AML patients were differentiated into functional DCs by culturing in the presence of rhGM-CSF, rhIL-4 and TNF-alpha for 8 days. The morphology, expression of key surface molecules and allostimulatory activity of resultant DCs were compared with primary blasts and cultured but cytokine untreated control groups. The pattern of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) expression was used to approve the leukemic origin of generated DCs. Neo-expression or upregulation of DC-associated markers were occurred during culturing period in cytokine treated cells compared with primary blasts and cultured but cytokine untreated control groups: CD1a (63.22% vs. 3.22% and 11.79%), CD83 (41.27% vs. 0.11% and 0.70%), CD40 (15.17% vs. 0.00% and 0.04%), CD80 (49.96 vs. 0.02% and 0.32%), CD86 (56.49% vs. 0.50% and 5.71%) and HLA-DR (52.52% vs. 14.32% and 2.49%) respectively. The potency of generated DCs to induce allogeneic T cell proliferation increased significantly compared to pre and post culture control groups (27,533.4 +/- 2,548.3, 8,820.4 +/- 1,639.4 and 3,200.35 +/- 976 respectively). The expression pattern of ACE in AML-DCs, blast cells and DCs derived from normal monocytes (7.93%, 1.28% and 74.97% respectively) confirmed the leukemic origin of DCs. Our data confirmed the generation of sufficient AML-derived cells with the properties of DCs in all cases. This potency of AML blasts, offers a useful route for active immunotherapy of AML patients.","['Bagheri, Kambiz', 'Alimoghadam, Kamran', 'Pourfathollah, Ali Akbar', 'Hassan, Zuhair Muhammad', 'Hajati, Jamshid', 'Moazzeni, Seyyed Mohammad']","['Bagheri K', 'Alimoghadam K', 'Pourfathollah AA', 'Hassan ZM', 'Hajati J', 'Moazzeni SM']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Tarbiat Modares University, P.O.

It is, therefore, important to find nontoxic drugs which can be used together with TRAIL. In this study, we investigated natural compounds that can overcome resistance to TRAIL, and found that butein, a polyphenol, exhibits significant synergism with TRAIL. Treatment with TRAIL in combination with subtoxic concentrations of butein sensitizes TRAIL-resistant human leukemia U937 cells to apoptosis. Butein increased caspase-3 activity and expression of death receptor DR5. The apoptotic cell death induced by combined treatment was significantly reduced by z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, suggesting a critical role of caspase-3 in apoptosis. These results indicate that butein sensitizes TRAIL-resistant U937 cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis in a caspase-3 dependent manner which might be correlated with upregulation of death receptor DR5. Our data suggests that combined treatment with butein and TRAIL may provide a safe and effective strategy for treating cancer.","['Kim, Nayoung']",['Kim N'],"[""Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA 02115, USA. nayoung.kim@childrens.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080920,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '4WVS5M0LGF (butein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chalcones/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12272-001-1286-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2008 Sep;31(9):1179-86. doi: 10.1007/s12272-001-1286-2.

Several of these pathways are implicated in disease pathogenesis, which has prompted efforts to develop GSK3-specific inhibitors for therapeutic applications. However, before now, there has been no strong rationale for targeting GSK3 in malignancies. Here we report pharmacological, physiological and genetic studies that demonstrate an oncogenic requirement for GSK3 in the maintenance of a specific subtype of poor prognosis human leukaemia, genetically defined by mutations of the MLL proto-oncogene. In contrast to its previously characterized roles in suppression of neoplasia-associated signalling pathways, GSK3 paradoxically supports MLL leukaemia cell proliferation and transformation by a mechanism that ultimately involves destabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27(Kip1). Inhibition of GSK3 in a preclinical murine model of MLL leukaemia provides promising evidence of efficacy and earmarks GSK3 as a candidate cancer drug target.","['Wang, Zhong', 'Smith, Kevin S', 'Murphy, Mark', 'Piloto, Obdulio', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Wang Z', 'Smith KS', 'Murphy M', 'Piloto O', 'Somervaille TC', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA055029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080917,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'G1 Phase', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",PMC4084721,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature07284 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07284 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 Oct 30;455(7217):1205-9. doi: 10.1038/nature07284.

However, there may now be light at the end of this long tunnel. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members may be divided into two subclasses, one comprising Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-w and the other Mcl-1 and Bcl2A1. Neutralization of both subclasses is required for apoptosis induction. Solution of the structure of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins has led to the design of novel small molecule inhibitors. Although many such molecules have been synthesized, rigorous verification of their specificity has often been lacking. Further studies have revealed that many putative Bcl-2 inhibitors are not specific and have other cellular targets, resulting in non-mechanism based toxicity. Two notable exceptions are ABT-737 and a related orally active derivative, ABT-263, which bind with high affinity to Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-w and may prove to be useful tools for mechanistic studies. ABT-263 is in early clinical trials in lymphoid malignancies, small-cell lung cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and some patients have shown promising results. In in vitro studies, primary cells from patients with various B-cell malignancies are exquisitely sensitive to ABT-737, exhibiting novel morphological features of apoptosis including marked outer mitochondrial membrane rupture.","['Vogler, M', 'Dinsdale, D', 'Dyer, M J S', 'Cohen, G M']","['Vogler M', 'Dinsdale D', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cohen GM']","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, PO Box 138, Lancaster Road, Leicester LE1 9HN, UK.']",['eng'],"['MC_U132615750/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080919,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['*Aniline Compounds/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', '*Biphenyl Compounds/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', '*Nitrophenols/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', '*Sulfonamides/chemistry/therapeutic use']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/03/31 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2008137 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.137 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2009 Mar;16(3):360-7. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2008.137.

This compound has been used, among others, in the industrial production of paints and glass and also for the conservation of leather and wood. Although arsenic trioxide is highly toxic, this compound was shown to have a therapeutic potential as early as the fifteenth century. The period between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries resulted in the development of new arsenic-based drugs which were applied for the treatment of skin diseases and acute promyelocytic leukemia. The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide is mainly related to the induction of apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells. In particular it involves effects on the activities of JNK kinases, NF-kB transcription factor, glutathione, caspases, as well as pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Experiments investigating the effect of arsenic trioxide on cell lines such as glioma and prostate, breast, stomach, liver, and ovarian cancer are in progress. There are also clinical trials underway aimed at the use of arsenic trioxide with ascorbic acid, retinoid acid, and growth factors in combined therapy.","['Izdebska, Magdalena', 'Grzanka, Alina', 'Szczepanski, Mariusz Andrzej', 'Litwiniec, Anna']","['Izdebska M', 'Grzanka A', 'Szczepanski MA', 'Litwiniec A']",['Katedra i Zaklad Histologii i Embriologii Collegium Medicum Uniwersytetu Mikolaja Kopernika w Toruniu.'],['pol'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080909,Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online),Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),101206517,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Ascorbic Acid/therapeutic use', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/therapeutic use', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['868643 [pii]'],epublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw (Online). 2008 Sep 9;62:463-7.,,,39,,Wybrane mechanizmy terapeutycznego oddzialywania trojtlenku arsenu w leczeniu nowotworow.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their levels are controlled by a complex cell surface-located group of enzymes called ectonucleotidases. There are four major families of ectonucleotidases, nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases (NTPDases/CD39), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterases (E-NPPs), alkaline phosphatases and ecto-5'-nucleotidase. In the last few years, substantial progress has been made toward the molecular identification of members of the ectonucleotidase families and their enzyme structures and functions. In this review, there is an emphasis on the involvement of NTPDase and 5'-nucleotidase activities in disease processes in several tissues and cell types. Brief background information is given about the general characteristics of these enzymes, followed by a discussion of their roles in thromboregulatory events in diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and cancer, as well as in pathological conditions where platelets are less responsive, such as in chronic renal failure. In addition, immunomodulation and cell-cell interactions involving these enzymes are considered, as well as ATP and ADP hydrolysis under different clinical conditions related with alterations in the immune system, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Finally, changes in ATP, ADP and AMP hydrolysis induced by inborn errors of metabolism, seizures and epilepsy are discussed in order to highlight the importance of these enzymes in the control of neuronal activity in pathological conditions. Despite advances made toward understanding the molecular structure of ectonucleotidases, much more investigation will be necessary to entirely grasp their role in physiological and pathological conditions.","['Schetinger, Maria Rosa C', 'Morsch, Vera Maria', 'Bonan, Carla Denise', 'Wyse, Angela T S']","['Schetinger MR', 'Morsch VM', 'Bonan CD', 'Wyse AT']","['Laboratorio de Enzimologia Toxicologica, Departamento de Quimica, CCNE, Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, Avenida Roraima, no 1000, Cidade Universitaria, Bairro Camobi, Santa Maria-RS, 97105-900, Brazil. mariaschetinger@gmail.com']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Biofactors,"BioFactors (Oxford, England)",8807441,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.6.1.5 (Apyrase)', 'EC 3.6.1.5 (CD39 antigen)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*physiology"", 'Adenosine/physiology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Apyrase/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Atherosclerosis/blood/enzymology', 'Blood Coagulation/*physiology', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Demyelinating Diseases/enzymology', 'Epilepsy/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Myocardial Infarction/blood/enzymology', 'Neoplasms/diet therapy/enzymology', 'Platelet Activation/physiology', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Seizures/enzymology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tamoxifen/therapeutic use', 'Thrombosis/physiopathology']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/biof.5520310205 [doi]'],ppublish,Biofactors. 2007;31(2):77-98. doi: 10.1002/biof.5520310205.,,,148,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum activity-time profile after the first dose of recombinant asparaginase was similar to that of Asparaginase medac. The trough serum activities were greater than the desired threshold of 100 U/L in both treatment groups. Asparagine was completely depleted in serum and in cerebrospinal fluid, whereas glutamine levels were only moderately influenced. No significant difference between the 2 treatments regarding the degree of asparagine depletion, duration of depletion, complete remission rate, and minimal residual disease status at the end of induction, overall frequency or intensity of adverse events was seen. Observed adverse reactions are known as possible and labeled side effects of asparaginase treatment and chemotherapy.

METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in which the mortality and cancer incidence rates of participants (n = 10,983) were compared with rates in the general male Australian population. Dose reconstructions were carried out by a panel of health physicists. Mortality and cancer rates were compared with the general population and between groups of subjects categorised by assessed radiation exposure. RESULTS: All-cause mortality was not raised. Mortality and incidence were significantly raised for cancers of the head and neck, lung, colon and rectum, and prostate, and for all cancers combined. For oesophageal cancer, melanoma, all leukaemias and non-chronic lymphatic leukaemia (non-CLL leukaemia), incidence was significantly raised, but mortality was non-significantly raised. No association was found between radiation exposure and overall cancer incidence or mortality, or with any cancer or cancer deaths occurring in excess. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence that the excess cancers and cancer deaths were caused by radiation exposure at the test sites. Possible contributing factors are high smoking prevalence and demographic differences from the Australian population with whom rates were compared. Asbestos is a likely contributor to some cancers in naval personnel.","['Gun, R T', 'Parsons, J', 'Crouch, P', 'Ryan, P', 'Hiller, J E']","['Gun RT', 'Parsons J', 'Crouch P', 'Ryan P', 'Hiller JE']","['Discipline of Public Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia. richard.gun@adelaide.edu.au']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080919,England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Weapons/statistics & numerical data', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology/mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/analysis', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiometry/methods']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['oem.2007.034652 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2007.034652 [doi]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 2008 Dec;65(12):843-8. doi: 10.1136/oem.2007.034652.

After further diagnostic evaluation, ALCL was noted in the bone marrow, masked by the myeloid hyperplasia and eosinophilia. This case emphasizes the importance of a full diagnostic workup for T-cell malignancies, including ALCL rather than focusing on the far less common eosinophilia-associated myeloid malignancies in the clinicopathologic setting of marked eosinophilia. Moreover, bone marrow involvement by ALCL is exceedingly rare and when noted, presents as one or more localized lytic lesions.

HBZ forms heterodimers with c-Jun, a member of the AP-1 family, and promotes its proteasomal degradation. Although most proteasomal substrates are targeted for degradation via conjugation of polyubiquitin chains, we show that ubiquitination is not required for HBZ-mediated proteasomal degradation of c-Jun. We demonstrate that HBZ directly interacts with both the 26 S proteasome and c-Jun and facilitates the delivery of c-Jun to the proteasome without ubiquitination. HBZ acts as a tethering factor between the 26 S proteasome and its substrate, thereby bypassing the targeting function of ubiquitination.

Almost one in every five malignancies can be attributed to infectious agents. Among infection-related neoplasms, cancers of the stomach, liver and cervix uteri detain the highest incidence figures, and are known to be largely attributable to Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and C viruses, and human papilloma virus, respectively. Other infectious organisms can also cause cancer; these include the Epstein-Barr virus (nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and different types of lymphoma), Human herpes virus-8 (Kaposi's Sarcoma), human T-cell leukemia virus type I (leukaemia, lymphoma), liver flukes (cholangiocarcinoma) and schistosomiasis (bladder cancer). Infection with human immunodeficiency virus, although strongly associated with an excess of cancer incidence at many cancer sites, is probably not carcinogenic per se, but acts mainly via immunodeficiency. The burden of infection-related cancers is still underestimated worldwide, due to the use of conservative population prevalence and risk ratio estimates. Furthermore, associations with new infectious agents remain yet to be explored.","['de Martel, Catherine', 'Franceschi, Silvia']","['de Martel C', 'Franceschi S']","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, 150 cours Albert Thomas, Lyon Cedex 08, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080920,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,,IM,"['Communicable Diseases/*complications/microbiology/parasitology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/microbiology/parasitology']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/07/31 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(08)00177-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.critrevonc.2008.07.021 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2009 Jun;70(3):183-94. doi: 10.1016/j.critrevonc.2008.07.021.

SDF-1 is a homeostatic chemokine that signals through CXCR4 which is expressed by hematopoietic tumor cells. The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is involved in the migration process of leukemic cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of berberine on the SDF-1-induced HL-60 cells, primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) migration. Transwell migration chambers (8 microm) were used to assess the role of berberine on leukemic cell migration; Flow cytometry was used to analyze the role of berberine on the CXCR4 expression; SDF-1 protein level secreted by bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) was evaluated by ELISA. Results demonstrated that berberine could partly inhibit SDF-1-induced AML cells as well as LSCs migration. Berberine could reduce SDF-1 protein level secreted by BMSCs in the microenvironment but not affect CXCR4 expression on HL-60 cell membrane, and we hypothesized that berberine could inhibit AML cells migration partly by reducing the secreting of SDF-1 by BMSCs and inhibiting HERG1 K(+) channels of leukemic cells. Therefore, it is speculated that berberine might be a potentially effective agent for prevention of leukemia.","['Li, Huiyu', 'Guo, Linlin', 'Jie, Shenghua', 'Liu, Wei', 'Zhu, Jiang', 'Du, Wen', 'Fan, Lingling', 'Wang, Xiaojuan', 'Fu, Bingjie', 'Huang, Shiang']","['Li H', 'Guo L', 'Jie S', 'Liu W', 'Zhu J', 'Du W', 'Fan L', 'Wang X', 'Fu B', 'Huang S']","['Center for Stem Cell Research and Application, Union Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277# Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080904,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0I8Y3P32UF (Berberine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Berberine/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CXCL12/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/30 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(08)00275-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2008.08.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2008 Nov;62(9):573-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2008.08.003.

Instead, an unusual amount of cholesterol deposits was observed with mucormycosis and aspergillosis in the lungs. Cholesterol deposition was observed not only in perihilar but also in subpleural regions without apparent bronchial obstruction in both lungs.

Acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia in Down's syndrome is characterised by a somatic mutation in GATA1. Constitutive activation of the JAK/STAT (Janus kinase and signal transducer and activator of transcription) pathway occurs in several haematopoietic malignant diseases. We tested the hypothesis that mutations in JAK2 might be a common molecular event in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia associated with Down's syndrome. METHODS: JAK2 DNA mutational analysis was done on diagnostic bone marrow samples obtained from 88 patients with Down's syndrome-associated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia; and 216 patients with sporadic acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Down's syndrome-associated acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, and essential thrombocythaemia. Functional consequences of identified mutations were studied in mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells. FINDINGS: Somatically acquired JAK2 mutations were identified in 16 (18%) patients with Down's syndrome-associated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The only patient with non-Down's syndrome-associated leukaemia but with a JAK2 mutation had an isochromosome 21q. Children with a JAK2 mutation were younger (mean [SE] age 4.5 years [0.86] vs 8.6 years [0.59], p<0.0001) at diagnosis. Five mutant alleles were identified, each affecting a highly conserved arginine residue (R683). These mutations immortalised primary mouse haematopoietic progenitor cells in vitro, and caused constitutive Jak/Stat activation and cytokine-independent growth of BaF3 cells, which was sensitive to pharmacological inhibition with JAK inhibitor I. In modelling studies of the JAK2 pseudokinase domain, R683 was situated in an exposed conserved region separated from the one implicated in myeloproliferative disorders. INTERPRETATION: A specific genotype-phenotype association exists between the type of somatic mutation within the JAK2 pseudokinase domain and the development of B-lymphoid or myeloid neoplasms. Somatically acquired R683 JAK2 mutations define a distinct acute lymphoblastic leukaemia subgroup that is uniquely associated with trisomy 21. JAK2 inhibitors could be useful for treatment of this leukaemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The viability of tumor cells was evaluated by MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays, after incubation with the ethanolic extract of SU (EESU) (0.15-20mg/mL) or equivalent concentrations of its partitioned fractions (chloroformic, hexanic, and methanolic). In vivo studies were performed in EAT-bearing mice treated intraperitoneally with 5, 10, and 25mg/kg of the EESU or equivalent doses of the fractions for 10 days. The methotrexate (1.5mg/kg), for 10 days, was used as control. RESULTS: SU and fractions, except the methanolic, decreased the viability of the cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In vivo results showed a significant dose-dependent antitumoral efficacy of SU against EAT growth. The best results in prolonging life span were produced by 25mg/kg of EESU. In these animals, the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor were markedly decreased after the treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The data presented herein could open interesting perspectives for further research of SU as a candidate anticancer agent.","['Nogueira, Iara Antonia L', 'Leao, Aryane B B', 'Vieira, Marcelo de S', 'Benfica, Polyana L', 'da Cunha, Luiz Carlos', 'Valadares, Marize C']","['Nogueira IA', 'Leao AB', 'Vieira Mde S', 'Benfica PL', 'da Cunha LC', 'Valadares MC']","['Laboratorio de Farmacologia e Toxicologia Celular, Faculdade de Farmacia, Universidade Federal de Goias, UFG, Goiania, GO, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080902,Ireland,J Ethnopharmacol,Journal of ethnopharmacology,7903310,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Brazil', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Euphorbiaceae/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medicine, Traditional', 'Mice', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/analysis']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/05/15 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2007/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-8741(08)00465-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jep.2008.08.026 [doi]']",ppublish,J Ethnopharmacol. 2008 Dec 8;120(3):474-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jep.2008.08.026.

The aim of this study was to reveal molecular mechanisms linked to the inhibition of erythroid differentiation by TNFalpha. In this study, we showed that the inhibition of erythropoietin (Epo)-mediated differentiation by TNFalpha lead to a downregulation of hemoglobin synthesis and was correlated to a modulation of key erythroid transcription factors. Thus, a reverse of the transcription factor GATA-1/GATA-2 balance normally present during erythropoiesis, as well as a downregulation of the cofactor of GATA-1, friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), and the coregulating transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NF-E2) was observed after TNFalpha treatment. Moreover, we showed a reduction of GATA-1/FOG-1 interaction due to a reduced transcription of GATA-1 and a proteasome-dependent FOG-1 degradation after TNFalpha treatment. These changes led to an inhibition of erythroid gene expression including Epo receptor (EpoR), alpha- and gamma-globin, erythroid-associated factor (ERAF), hydroxymethylbilane synthetase (HMBS), and glycophorin A (GPA). An analysis of distinct signaling pathway activations then revealed an activation of p38 by TNF, as well as a corresponding involvement of this mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the cytokine-dependent inhibition of erythroid differentiation. Indeed the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, abrogated the inhibitory effect of TNFalpha on the major erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 as well as erythroid marker expression in Epo-induced TF-1 cells. Overall, these data contribute to a better understanding of cytokine-dependent anemia, by giving first hints about key erythroid transcription factor modulations after TNFalpha treatment as well as an involvement of p38 in the inhibition of erythroid differentiation.","['Buck, Isabelle', 'Morceau, Franck', 'Cristofanon, Silvia', 'Heintz, Caroline', 'Chateauvieux, Sebastien', 'Reuter, Simone', 'Dicato, Mario', 'Diederich, Marc']","['Buck I', 'Morceau F', 'Cristofanon S', 'Heintz C', 'Chateauvieux S', 'Reuter S', 'Dicato M', 'Diederich M']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire du Cancer, Hopital Kirchberg, 9 rue Edward Steichen, L-2540 Luxembourg, Luxembourg.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080902,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (ZFPM1 protein, human)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00594-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.08.025 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Nov 15;76(10):1229-39. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.08.025.

Under conditions of low folate, dUMP accumulates producing DNA strand breaks and micronucleus formation as a result of excessive uracil incorporation into DNA in place of thymine. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important folate metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible conversion of 5,10-methylenetretrahydrofolate, which is the methyl donor for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is the methyl donor for remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Certain common polymorphisms within the MTHFR gene (C677T, A1298C) result in reduced enzymatic activity and have been associated with reduced risk for a variety of cancers such as acute lymphocytic leukemia, lung and colorectal cancer. These common polymorphisms are also associated with hyperhomocysteinemia that has been reported to be an increased risk factor for neural tube defects and cardiovascular disease. In this chapter, we consider the role that MTHFR plays in relation to folate metabolism and the possible contribution made in relation to certain important clinical outcomes.","['Thomas, Philip', 'Fenech, Michael']","['Thomas P', 'Fenech M']","['CSIRO Human Nutrition, Adelaide BC, Adelaide, South Australia 5000.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nutritional Status', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Pre-Eclampsia/*genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Racial Groups/genetics']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0083-6729(08)00413-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0083-6729(08)00413-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2008;79:375-92. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(08)00413-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antifolates, represented by methotrexate, continue to occupy a unique niche among the modern day pharmacopoeia for cancer along with other pathological conditions. This article focuses on the biology of the membrane transport system termed the ""reduced folate carrier"" or RFC with a particular emphasis on RFC structure and function. The ubiquitously expressed RFC is the major transporter for folates in mammalian cells and tissues. Loss of RFC expression or function portends potentially profound physiological or developmental consequences. For chemotherapeutic antifolates used for cancer, loss of RFC expression or synthesis of mutant RFC protein with impaired function results in antifolate resistance due to incomplete inhibition of cellular enzyme targets and low levels of substrate for polyglutamate synthesis. The functional properties for RFC were first documented nearly 40 years ago in murine leukemia cells. Since 1994, when RFC was first cloned, tremendous advances in the molecular biology of RFC and biochemical approaches for studying the structure of polytopic membrane proteins have led to an increasingly detailed picture of the molecular structure of the carrier, including its membrane topology, its N-glycosylation, identification of functionally and structurally important domains and amino acids, and helix packing associations. Although no crystal structure for RFC is yet available, biochemical and molecular studies, combined with homology modeling, based on homologous bacterial major facilitator superfamily transporters such as LacY, now permit the development of experimentally testable hypotheses designed to establish RFC structure and mechanism.","['Matherly, Larry H', 'Hou, Zhanjun']","['Matherly LH', 'Hou Z']","['Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA053535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mammals/*metabolism', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Conformation', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Substrate Specificity']",PMC3806226,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0083-6729(08)00405-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S0083-6729(08)00405-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2008;79:145-84. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(08)00405-6.,,,,['NIHMS509761'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of previous studies have shown that this compound has in vitro growth-inhibitory activity in human cancer cells, however, the mechanism by which this action occurs is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of platycodon D on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and evaluated the association of these effects with apoptotic tumor cell death using a human leukemic U937 cell line. The results of this study demonstrate that platycodon D mediates ROS production, and that this mediation is followed by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP, DJm), activation of caspase-3, and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Both the cytotoxic effects and apoptotic characteristics induced by platycodon D treatment were significantly inhibited by z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, which demonstrates the important role that caspase-3 plays in the observed cytotoxic effect. Additionally, the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) gene was transcriptionally activated and the levels of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-activated gene-1 (NAG-1) protein were elevated in platycodon D-treatedU937 cells. However, the quenching of ROS generation in response to treatment with a ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, reversed the platycodon D-induced apoptosis effects via inhibition of Egr-1 activation, ROS production, MMP collapse, and the subsequent activation of caspase-3. Although further studies are needed to demonstrate that increased expression of Egr-1 by platycodon D leads directly to NAG-1 induction and subsequent apoptosis, our observations clearly indicate that ROS induced through Egr-1 activation are involved in the early molecular events involved in the platycodon D-induced apoptotic pathway.","['Shin, Dong Yeok', 'Kim, Gi Young', 'Li, Wei', 'Choi, Byung Tae', 'Kim, Nam Deuk', 'Kang, Ho Sung', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Shin DY', 'Kim GY', 'Li W', 'Choi BT', 'Kim ND', 'Kang HS', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Busan 614-052, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080830,France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', 'CWJ06TA2GI (platycodin D)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Medicine, East Asian Traditional', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Plant Roots', 'Platycodon/*chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Saponins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/04/11 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0753-3322(08)00273-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biopha.2008.08.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2009 Feb;63(2):86-94. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2008.08.001.

Metabolism of furan includes the formation of an unsaturated dialdehyde, cis-2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA). In view of the multifunctional electrophilic reactivity of BDA, adduct formation with protein and DNA may explain some of the toxic effects. Short-term tests for genotoxicity of furan in mammalian cells are inconclusive, little is known for BDA. We investigated BDA generated by hydrolysis of 2,5-diacetoxy-2,5-dihydrofuran for genotoxicity in L5178Y tk+/- mouse lymphoma cells using standard procedures for the comet assay, the micronucleus test, and the mouse lymphoma thymidine kinase gene mutation assay, using 4-h incubation periods. Cytotoxicity was remarkable: cell viability at concentrations>or=50 microM was reduced to <50%. In the dose range up to 25 microM, viability was >90%. Measures of comet-tail length and thymidine-kinase mutant frequency were increased 1.6- and 2.4-fold above control, respectively. Analysis of three fully independent replicates with a linear mixed-effects model showed a highly significant increase with concentration for both endpoints. Compared to methyl methanesulfonate used as a positive control, BDA was of similar potency with respect to genotoxicity, but it was much more cytotoxic. Furan added to cell cultures at doses that resulted in time-averaged effective concentrations of up to 3100 microM was neither cytotoxic nor genotoxic. A potential cross-linking activity of BDA was investigated by checking whether gamma radiation-induced DNA migration in the comet assay could be reduced by pre-treatment with BDA. In contrast to the effect of the positive control glutaraldehyde, BDA treatment did not reduce the comet tail length. On the contrary, an increase was observed at >or=100 microM BDA, which was attributable to early apoptotic cells. Although BDA was found to be a relatively potent genotoxic agent in terms of the concentration necessary to double the background measures, cytotoxicity strongly limited the concentration range that produced interpretable results. This may explain some of the inconclusive results and indicates that non-genotoxic effects must be taken into account in the discussion of the modes of toxic and carcinogenic action of furan.","['Kellert, Marco', 'Brink, Andreas', 'Richter, Ingrid', 'Schlatter, Josef', 'Lutz, Werner K']","['Kellert M', 'Brink A', 'Richter I', 'Schlatter J', 'Lutz WK']","['Department of Toxicology, University of Wurzburg, Versbacher Strasse 9, 97078 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080828,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Mutagens)', '2363-83-9 (malealdehyde)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (thymidine kinase 1)', 'UC0XV6A8N9 (furan)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Breaks', 'DNA Damage', 'Furans/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics/metabolism']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(08)00258-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.08.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Dec 8;657(2):127-32. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.08.014.

Treatment with KPS-A significantly increased apoptotic DNA fragmentation in human histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells as shown by DAPI staining, flow cytometry, and agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition, stimulation of U937 cell with KPS-A induced a series of intracellular events: (1) the activations of caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3; (2) the translocations of Bid and Bax proteins to mitochondria; (3) the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; and (4) the increased release of cytochrome c to the cytosol. Pretreatment with a specific caspases-8, -9 or -3 inhibitor, neutralized the pro-apoptotic activity of KPS-A in U937 cells. We further demonstrated that KPS-A markedly induced an increase in intracellular Ca2+ level, which was reversed by EGTA, a general calcium chelator, but not by TMB-8 and dantrolene, intracellular Ca2+ release blockers. Moreover, KPS-A-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase activation were substantially reduced in the presence of EGTA. Taken together, these results suggest that KPS-A may play therapeutic role for leukemia via the potent apoptotic activity through Ca2+/caspases-8/MPT/caspases-9/caspases-3 signaling pathway.","['Choi, Jung-Hye', 'Lee, Heon-Woo', 'Park, Hee-Juhn', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon', 'Lee, Kyung-Tae']","['Choi JH', 'Lee HW', 'Park HJ', 'Kim SH', 'Lee KT']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Pharmacy, Kyung-Hee University, 1 Hoegi-Dong, Seoul 130-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080830,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (kalopanax saponin A)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/pharmacokinetics']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/08/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(08)00463-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2008.08.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2008 Nov;46(11):3486-92. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2008.08.026.

Starting from a approximately 5% fraction of a UCB graft, we report the feasibility and biological characteristics of ex vivo expansion of frozen/thawed CB T cells by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibody-coated Dynal beads in the presence of interleukin (IL)-2. We postulated that while undergoing expansion, UCB T cells may mature toward a Th1/Tc1 phenotype and acquire the potential for cytotoxicity. Whereas an almost 2-log expansion also led to the acquisition of IL-12Ralpha and an increase in Th1 characteristics, postexpansion lymphocytes produced less interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granzyme B; stored almost no perforin; and lacked cytotoxicity against allogeneic targets. Collectively, these suggest relative safety from acute/hyperacute graft-versus-host disease. CD8(+) T cells expanded preferentially, whereas a higher rate of apoptosis in CD4(+) T cells also promoted an inverted CD4/CD8 ratio. Most expanded T cells retained expression of CD27, CD28, and L-selectin but down-regulated CCR-7. In summary, UCB T cell proliferation sustained by CD3/CD28 co-stimulatory beads and IL-2 can lead to clinically relevant doses of DLI from a very small fraction of the UCB graft, although future strategies to reduce apoptosis may enhance their clinical potential.","['Mazur, Melissa A', 'Davis, Craig C', 'Szabolcs, Paul']","['Mazur MA', 'Davis CC', 'Szabolcs P']","['Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Durham, North Carolina; Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) have been shown to regulate many aspects of the immune system, including NK cell-mediated responses. We have demonstrated that in vivo administration of IL-2 led to activation and expansion of both NK cells and immunosuppressive Tregs. Therefore, we attempted to augment NK cell antitumor effects by concurrently depleting Tregs using anti-CD25. Increased NK cell activation by IL-2 was found to be correlated with an increase in classical, short-term NK cell in vitro killing assays regardless of the depletion of Tregs. But when splenocytes of the treated mice were used in long-term tumor outgrowth experiments, we observed that prior depletion of Tregs from IL-2 administration led to improved antitumor effects compared with either treatment alone. Importantly, these in vitro data are correlated with subsequent in vivo survival of leukemia-bearing mice, in which co-treatment of IL-2 with anti-CD25 led to significantly improved survival compared with mice treated with either IL-2 alone or with Treg depletion. Prior depletion of NK1.1(+) cells, but not of CD8(+) cells, completely abrogated all antitumor effects mediated by IL-2 and anti-CD25 combination therapy. These findings demonstrate that superior NK cell-mediated antileukemic effects can be achieved with IL-2 administration and concurrent depletion of CD25(+) cells.","['Hallett, William H D', 'Ames, Erik', 'Alvarez, Maite', 'Barao, Isabel', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Blazar, Bruce R', 'Murphy, William J']","['Hallett WHD', 'Ames E', 'Alvarez M', 'Barao I', 'Taylor PA', 'Blazar BR', 'Murphy WJ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.', 'University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'University of Minnesota Cancer Center and Department of Pediatrics, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Nevada School of Medicine, University of Nevada Reno, Reno, Nevada.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: The Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre (AFBMTC), Rawalpindi, Pakistan from May 2001 to April 2007. METHODOLOGY: All consecutive newly diagnosed patients of acute promyelocytic leukemia, treated at Armed Forces Bone Marrow Transplant Centre, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, between May 2001 and April 2007, were included and given chemotherapy according to availability of ATRA. Diagnosis was confirmed on morphology/ karyotyping/ molecular analysis. Eligibility criteria included confirmed morphologic diagnosis and/or by demonstration of t(15;17) and/or PML/RAR proportional to re-arrangement, no prior chemotherapy, normal hepatic and renal function, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2 and no contraindications to ATRA (history of sensitivity to Vit. A or other retinoids). All patients having history of cardiac failure (LVEF < 50) and arrhythmias, ECOG performance status 3 and 4, relapse / refractory disease, ALT twice normal values, serum creatinine > 150 micromol/L and pregnancy were excluded from this study. Survival was calculated from the date of chemotherapy to death or last follow-up according to Kaplan-Meier and Cox (Proportional hazard) regression analysis methods. RESULTS: During the 6 years study period, 31 newly diagnosed patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia received treatment at AFBMTC. Seventeen patients received anthracycline-based remission induction and consolidation chemotherapy, while 14 received ATRA-based remission induction, consolidation and by two years maintenance therapy. Overall Survival (OS), Disease Free Survival (DFS) and mortality were 29.4%, 29.4% and 70.6% respectively in 17 patients who received anthracycline based chemotherapy, whereas in patients who received ATRA-based chemotherapy OS, DFS and mortality was 71.4%, 64.2% and 28.6% respectively. Major causes of mortality were septicemia and chemotherapy related toxicity.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has improved the detection rate of genomic alterations in CLL from approximately 50% using conventional cytogenetics to greater than 80%. More recently, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has gained popularity as a clinical tool that can be applied to detect genomic gains and losses of prognostic importance in CLL. Array CGH and FISH are particularly useful in CLL because genomic gains and losses are key events with both biologic and prognostic significance, while balanced translocations have limited prognostic value. Although FISH has a higher technical sensitivity, it requires separate, targeted hybridizations for the detection of alterations at genomic loci of interest. Array CGH, on the other hand, has the ability to provide a genome-wide survey of genomic aberrations with a single hybridization reaction. Array CGH is expanding the known genomic regions of importance in CLL and allows these regions to be evaluated in the context of a genome-wide perspective. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the use of genomic aberrations as tools for risk-stratifying patients for therapy, thus increasing the need for reliable and high-yield methods to detect these genomic changes. In this review, we consider the use of array CGH as a clinical tool for the identification of genomic alterations with prognostic significance in CLL, and suggest ways to integrate this test into the clinical molecular diagnostic laboratory work flow.","['Higgins, Russell A', 'Gunn, Shelly R', 'Robetorye, Ryan S']","['Higgins RA', 'Gunn SR', 'Robetorye RS']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis/*methods', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2008/09/23 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/23 09:00'],"['2008/09/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1251 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03256292 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2008;12(5):271-80. doi: 10.1007/BF03256292.,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, 25% of cases still lack defined genetic hallmarks. To identify genomic aberrancies in childhood ALL patients nonclassifiable by conventional methods, we performed a single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) array-based genomic analysis of leukemic cells from 29 cases. The vast majority of cases analyzed (19/24, 79%) showed genomic abnormalities; at least one of them affected either genes involved in cell cycle regulation or in B-cell development. The most relevant abnormalities were CDKN2A/9p21 deletions (7/24, 29%), ETV6 (TEL)/12p13 deletions (3/24, 12%), and intrachromosomal amplifications of chromosome 21 (iAMP21) (3/24, 12%). To identify variation in expression of genes directly or indirectly affected by recurrent genomic alterations, we integrated genomic and gene expression data generated by microarray analyses of the same samples. SMAD1 emerged as a down-regulated gene in CDKN2A homozygous deleted cases compared with nondeleted. The JAG1 gene, encoding the Jagged 1 ligand of the Notch receptor, was among a list of differentially expressed (up-regulated) genes in ETV6-deleted cases.

METHODS: Two thousand five hundred and eleven consecutive new referral cases of acute leukemia (AL) were evaluated based on WHO classification. RESULTS: It included 1,471 cases (58%) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 964 cases (38%) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 45 cases (1.8%) of chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CMLBC), 37 cases (1.5%) of biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL), 1 case of Triphenotypic AL, and 2 cases of acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL). Common subtypes of ALL were B-cell ALL (76%), which comprised of intermediate stage/CALLA positive (73%), early precursor/proBALL (3%). T-cell ALL constituted 24% (351 cases) of ALL. Common subtypes of AML included AMLM2 (27%), AMLM5 (15%), AMLM0 (12%), AMLM1 (12%), APML (11%), and AML t(8;21) (9%). CMLBC was commonly of myeloid blast crisis subtype (40 cases). CONCLUSION: B-cell ALL was the commonest subtype in children and AML in adults. Overall incidence of AML in adults was low (53% only). CD13 was most sensitive and CD117 most specific for determining myeloid lineage. A minimal primary panel of nine antibodies consisting of three myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, and CD117), B-cell lymphoid marker (CD19), T-cell marker (CD7), with CD45, CD10, CD34, and HLADR could assign lineage to 92% of AL.

Therefore, whole blood analysis has importance in clinical therapy. This study combined solid-phase extraction and on-line stacking capillary electrophoresis to examine the levels of MTX and its eight metabolites in whole blood. A higher conductivity buffer (HCB) was used to accumulate large amount of samples into a narrow zone, which resulted in effective stacking and sharp peaks. A fused-silica capillary was filled with phosphate buffer (80 mM, pH 2.5) containing 15% v/v tetrahydrofuran and 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate. Then HCB (100 mM phosphate, pH 2.5; 1 psi, 60 s) was injected for accumulating large volume of analytes (1 psi, 200 s). Owing to the pH difference between sample zone and HCB, dynamic pH junction was generated for focusing. Meanwhile, sweeping made further stacking by using sodium dodecyl sulfate in phosphate buffer. The limits of detection (S/N=3) were 0.1 microM for MTX, 0.2 microM for 7-hydroxymethotrexate and 2,4-diamino-N(10)-methylpteroic acid, 0.3 microM for MTX-(Glu)(n=2--5), and 0.5 microM for MTX-(Glu)(n=6--7). During validation, this method showed good linearity (r> / =0.9914) and reproducibility (relative standard deviation and relative error, both less than 13%). The applications were performed to monitor blood MTX and its metabolites in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

This was shown to successfully knockout expression of endogenous EphA1 and enforce expression of the ALPP reporter by the EphA1 promoter. Staining for the ALPP reporter protein demonstrated an epithelially restricted expression pattern in mouse tissues. In EphA1 null mice, two separate phenotypes were identified: abnormal tail development manifesting as a kinky tail was found in approximately 80% of homozygous adults.

Attempts at improving outcomes face the dilemma posed by the need to avoid excessive toxicity while maintaining the efficacy of treatment. Dose reductions and avoidance of infusions of intermediate and high-dose methotrexate are common in this group. PROCEDURE: In a matched pair analysis we compared adverse effects and survival after ALL chemotherapy using intermediate and high doses of methotrexate in children with and without Down syndrome. RESULTS: Following intermediate and high doses of methotrexate to treat primary ALL, children with DS did not require opiate analgesia and parenteral nutrition for severe mucositis more often than children without DS. Children with DS spent more days in hospital and missed more doses of maintenance chemotherapy. Chemotherapy dose reductions were common and in this study had no detectable adverse impact. Event-free and overall survival (OS) of children with ALL was lower in the DS than the non-Down syndrome (NDS) control group. The difference, however, was no longer significant during the recent treatment era. CONCLUSIONS: The feasibility of all treatment elements that are efficacious in pediatric ALL needs to be carefully considered in children with DS. In addition to survival data, the prospective collection of data on both adverse events and treatment modifications is essential to strike a balance between the avoidance of adverse effects and the need for intensive therapy that will safely improve ALL outcomes in this group.","['Shah, Niketa', 'Al-Ahmari, Ali', 'Al-Yamani, Arwa', 'Dupuis, Lee', 'Stephens, Derek', 'Hitzler, Johann']","['Shah N', 'Al-Ahmari A', 'Al-Yamani A', 'Dupuis L', 'Stephens D', 'Hitzler J']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Humans', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21737 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jan;52(1):14-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21737.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the expression pattern of FCRL1-5 genes was studied in 73 Iranian ALL patients and 35 normal subjects using semi-quantitative RT-PCR method. FCRL protein expression was also investigated by flow cytometry. Our results indicate significant down-regulation of all FCRL genes in ALL compared to normal subjects. Although, FCRL mRNA expression was almost exclusively confined to normal isolated B-cells compared to T-cells, but these genes were similarly expressed in B-ALL, T-ALL and different B-ALL immunophenotypic subtypes. Surface protein expression of FCRL1, 2, 4, and 5 molecules in 10 ALL and 5 normal samples confirmed the PCR results. Expression profile of FCRL molecules in different subtypes of ALL argues against their potential implication as suitable targets for classification and/or immunotherapy of ALL.","['Kazemi, Tohid', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein', 'Memarian, Ali', 'Shabani, Mahdi', 'Sharifian, Ramazan A', 'Vossough, Parvaneh', 'Ansaripour, Bita', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Kazemi T', 'Asgarian-Omran H', 'Memarian A', 'Shabani M', 'Sharifian RA', 'Vossough P', 'Ansaripour B', 'Rabbani H', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080919,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (FCRL2 protein, human)', '0 (FCRL4 protein, human)', '0 (FCRL5 protein, human)', '0 (FCRLA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/04/22 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0589-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Jun;58(6):989-96. doi: 10.1007/s00262-008-0589-z.

METHODS: We examined MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production stimulated by CysLTs (LTC(4), LTD(4), and LTE(4)) in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukemia cell line, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Moreover, we examined the inhibitory effect of pranlukast, a CysLT(1) receptor antagonist, and inhibitors of three major mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) on the induction of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production by CysLTs. RESULTS: ELISA demonstrated that CysLTs induced MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production in THP-1 cells and PBMCs. PCR demonstrated that LTD(4) increased MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta mRNA expressions in THP-1 cells. Pranlukast blocked MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production promoted by LTD(4) in THP-1 cells and PBMCs. Moreover, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) attenuated the induction of MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production by LTD(4) in THP-1 cells whereas the inhibitors of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or p38 MAPK did not. CONCLUSION: CysLTs induce MIP-1alpha and MIP-1beta production mediated by ERK via binding to the CysLT(1) receptor in human monocytes/macrophages.","['Ichiyama, Takashi', 'Hasegawa, Masanari', 'Hashimoto, Kunio', 'Matsushige, Takeshi', 'Hirano, Reiji', 'Furukawa, Susumu']","['Ichiyama T', 'Hasegawa M', 'Hashimoto K', 'Matsushige T', 'Hirano R', 'Furukawa S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, Yamaguchi, Japan. ichiyama@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080919,Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (cysteinyl-leukotriene)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chemokine CCL3/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL4/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cysteine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Leukotrienes/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['000155745 [pii]', '10.1159/000155745 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 2009;148(2):147-53. doi: 10.1159/000155745.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles were generated from bone marrow blasts at initial diagnosis from a cohort of 99 children with National Cancer Institute-defined high-risk ALL who were treated uniformly on the Children's Oncology Group (COG) 1961 study. For prediction of early response, genes that correlated to marrow status on day 7 were identified on a training set and were validated on a test set. An additional signature was correlated with long-term outcome, and the predictive models were validated on three large, independent patient cohorts. Results We identified a 24-probe set signature that was highly predictive of day 7 marrow status on the test set (P = .0061). Pathways were identified that may play a role in early blast regression. We have also identified a 47-probe set signature (which represents 41 unique genes) that was predictive of long-term outcome in our data set as well as three large independent data sets of patients with childhood ALL who were treated on different protocols. However, we did not find sufficient evidence for the added significance of these genes and the derived predictive models when other known prognostic features, such as age, WBC, and karyotype, were included in a multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Genes and pathways that play a role in early blast regression may identify patients who may be at risk for inferior responses to treatment. A fully validated predictive gene expression signature was defined for high-risk ALL that provided insight into the biologic mechanisms of treatment failure.","['Bhojwani, Deepa', 'Kang, Huining', 'Menezes, Renee X', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Sather, Harland', 'Moskowitz, Naomi P', 'Min, Dong-Joon', 'Potter, Jeffrey W', 'Harvey, Richard', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Seibel, Nita', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Horstmann, Martin A', 'Relling, Mary V', 'den Boer, Monique L', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Carroll, William L']","['Bhojwani D', 'Kang H', 'Menezes RX', 'Yang W', 'Sather H', 'Moskowitz NP', 'Min DJ', 'Potter JW', 'Harvey R', 'Hunger SP', 'Seibel N', 'Raetz EA', 'Pieters R', 'Horstmann MA', 'Relling MV', 'den Boer ML', 'Willman CL', 'Carroll WL']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, New York University Cancer Institute, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['U01 CA88361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA114762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk Assessment', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC2736991,2008/09/20 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/27/4376 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.4519 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 20;26(27):4376-84. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.4519.,['J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 20;26(27):4367-8.

These cells orchestrate inflammatory responses. Proinflammatory mediators are stored in granular structures within the mast cell cytosol. Control of mast cell granule exocytosis is a major therapeutic goal for allergic and inflammatory diseases. However, the proteins that control granule biogenesis and abundance in mast cells have not been elucidated. In neuroendocrine cells, whose dense core granules are strikingly similar to mast cell granules, granin proteins regulate granulogenesis. Our studies suggest that the Secretogranin III (SgIII) protein is involved in secretory granule biogenesis in mast cells. SgIII is abundant in mast cells, and is organized into vesicular structures. Our results show that over-expression of SgIII in mast cells is sufficient to cause an expansion of a granular compartment in these cells. These novel granules store inflammatory mediators that are released in response to physiological stimuli, indicating that they function as bona fide secretory vesicles. In mast cells, as in neuroendocrine cells, we show that SgIII is complexed with Chromogranin A (CgA). CgA is granulogenic when complexed with SgIII. Our data show that a novel non-granulogenic truncation mutant of SgIII (1-210) lacks the ability to interact with CgA. Thus, in mast cells, a CgA-SgIII complex may play a key role in secretory granule biogenesis. SgIII function in mast cells is unlikely to be limited to its partnership with CgA, as our interaction trap analysis suggests that SgIII has multiple binding partners, including the mast cell ion channel TRPA1.","['Prasad, Prerna', 'Yanagihara, Angel A', 'Small-Howard, Andrea L', 'Turner, Helen', 'Stokes, Alexander J']","['Prasad P', 'Yanagihara AA', 'Small-Howard AL', 'Turner H', 'Stokes AJ']","[""Center for Biomedical Research at The Queen's Medical Center, Honolulu, HI 96813, USA.""]",['eng'],"['P20RR016467/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM 070634/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chromogranin A)', '0 (Chromogranins)', '0 (chromogranin A, rat)', '0 (secretogranin 3, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromogranin A/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Chromogranins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mastocytoma/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'PC12 Cells', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sequence Deletion']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/7/5024 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.7.5024 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Oct 1;181(7):5024-34. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.7.5024.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent progress in the field, two important aspects of this cytotoxic mechanism remain poorly understood. First, TCR-signaling pathway(s) that selectively induces granule exocytosis in CTL has not been defined to date. Second, it is unclear how Ag receptor-induced signals are converted into mobilization of lytic granules. We recently demonstrated that protein kinase C delta (PKC delta) selectively regulates TCR-induced lytic granule polarization in mouse CD8(+) CTL. To better understand how PKC delta facilitates granule movement, here we studied dynamics of intracellular localization of PKC delta in living CD8(+) CTL. Strikingly, we found that PKC delta localizes to the secretory lysosomes and polarizes toward immunological synapse during the process of target cell killing. Also, biochemical and structure-function studies demonstrated that upon TCR ligation, PKC delta becomes rapidly phosphorylated on the activation loop and regulates granule exocytosis in a kinase-dependent manner. Altogether, our current studies provide new insights concerning the regulation of TCR-induced lytic granule exocytosis by revealing novel intracellular localization of PKC delta, providing the first example of colocalization of a kinase with secretory lysosomes in CD8(+) CTL and demonstrating that PKC delta directly transduces TCR signals leading to polarized granule secretion.","['Ma, Jennifer S Y', 'Haydar, Tarik F', 'Radoja, Sasa']","['Ma JS', 'Haydar TF', 'Radoja S']","[""Center for Cancer and Immunology, Children's National Medical Center, Children's Research Institute, Washington, DC 20010, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Prkcd protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/genetics', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Polarity/genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/genetics', 'Immunological Synapses/genetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lysosomes/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/7/4716 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.7.4716 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Oct 1;181(7):4716-22. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.7.4716.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This practice is inefficient and frequently results in inappropriate therapy and treatment-related toxicity. In contrast, personalized treatment has the potential to increase efficacy and decrease toxicity. CONTENT: We reviewed the literature relevant to prognostic, predictive, and toxicity-related markers in cancer, with particular attention to systematic reviews, prospective randomized trials, and guidelines issued by expert panels. To achieve personalized treatment for cancer, we need markers for determining prognosis, predicting response to therapy, and predicting severe toxicity related to treatment. Among the best-validated prognostic markers currently available are serum concentrations of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) for patients with nonseminoma germ cell tumors and tissue concentrations of both urokinase plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) for breast cancer patients. Clinically useful therapy predictive markers are estrogen and progesterone receptors to select patients with breast cancer for treatment with endocrine therapy and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) to select breast cancer patients for treatment with trastuzumab (Herceptin). Markers available for identifying drug-induced adverse reactions include thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) to predict toxicity from thiopurines in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase to predict toxicity from irinotecan in the treatment of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Validated prognostic, predictive, and toxicity markers should help cancer treatment move from the current trial-and-error approach to more personalized treatment.","['Duffy, Michael J', 'Crown, John']","['Duffy MJ', 'Crown J']","[""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, St Vincent's University Hospital, Dublin, Ireland.

The main goal of this work consists in the exploration of new strategies and in the development of new clustering methods to improve the accuracy and robustness of clustering results, taking into account the uncertainty underlying the assignment of examples to clusters in the context of gene expression data analysis. METHODOLOGY: We propose a fuzzy ensemble clustering approach both to improve the accuracy of clustering results and to take into account the inherent fuzziness of biological and bio-medical gene expression data. We applied random projections that obey the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma to obtain several instances of lower dimensional gene expression data from the original high-dimensional ones, approximately preserving the information and the metric structure of the original data. Then we adopt a double fuzzy approach to obtain a consensus ensemble clustering, by first applying a fuzzy k-means algorithm to the different instances of the projected low-dimensional data and then by using a fuzzy t-norm to combine the multiple clusterings. Several variants of the fuzzy ensemble clustering algorithms are proposed, according to different techniques to combine the base clusterings and to obtain the final consensus clustering. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We applied our proposed fuzzy ensemble methods to the gene expression analysis of leukemia, lymphoma, adenocarcinoma and melanoma patients, and we compared the results with other state of the art ensemble methods. Results show that in some cases, taking into account the natural fuzziness of the data, we can improve the discovery of classes of patients defined at bio-molecular level. The reduction of the dimension of the data, achieved through random projections techniques, is well-suited to the characteristics of high-dimensional gene expression data, thus resulting in improved performance with respect to single fuzzy k-means and with respect to ensemble methods based on resampling techniques. Moreover, we show that the analysis of the accuracy and diversity of the base fuzzy clusterings can be useful to explain the advantages and the limitations of the proposed fuzzy ensemble approach.","['Avogadri, Roberto', 'Valentini, Giorgio']","['Avogadri R', 'Valentini G']","[""DSI, Dipartimento di Scienze dell' Informazione, Universita degli Studi di Milano, Via Comelico 39, 20135 Milano, Italy. avogadri@dsi.unimi.it""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080917,Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', '*Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/05/29 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2007/11/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/05/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0933-3657(08)00101-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.artmed.2008.07.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 2009 Feb-Mar;45(2-3):173-83. doi: 10.1016/j.artmed.2008.07.014.

We demonstrated that CREB is overexpressed in acute myeloid and leukemia cells compared to normal hematopoietic stem cells. CREB knockdown inhibits leukemic cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, but does not affect long-term hematopoietic reconstitution. METHODS: To understand downstream pathways regulating CREB, we performed expression profiling with RNA from the K562 myeloid leukemia cell line transduced with CREB shRNA. RESULTS: By combining our expression data from CREB knockdown cells with prior ChIP data on CREB binding we were able to identify a list of putative CREB regulated genes. We performed extensive analyses on the top genes in this list as high confidence CREB targets. We found that this list is enriched for genes involved in cancer, and unexpectedly, highly enriched for histone genes. Furthermore, histone genes regulated by CREB were more likely to be specifically expressed in hematopoietic lineages. Decreased expression of specific histone genes was validated in K562, TF-1, and primary AML cells transduced with CREB shRNA. CONCLUSION: We have identified a high confidence list of CREB targets in K562 cells. These genes allow us to begin to understand the mechanisms by which CREB contributes to acute leukemia. We speculate that regulation of histone genes may play an important role by possibly altering the regulation of DNA replication during the cell cycle.","['Pellegrini, Matteo', 'Cheng, Jerry C', 'Voutila, Jon', 'Judelson, Dejah', 'Taylor, Julie', 'Nelson, Stanley F', 'Sakamoto, Kathleen M']","['Pellegrini M', 'Cheng JC', 'Voutila J', 'Judelson D', 'Taylor J', 'Nelson SF', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. matteop@mcdb.ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['F32 HL085013/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL075826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32HL085013/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL83077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL75826/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL083077/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01HL72367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL072367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080918,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Genes, cdc', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Response Elements']",PMC2647550,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/03/19 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-264 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-264 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Sep 18;8:264. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-264.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) belongs to the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines and signals through LIFR/gp130. Three factors which may regulate the direction of LIF secretion were studied: the site of stimulation, signal peptides, and expression levels. Stimulation with IL-1beta is known to promote IL-6 secretion from the stimulated membrane (apical or basolateral) in the human intestinal epithelial cell line Caco-2. Since LIF is related to IL-6, LIF secretion was also tested in Caco-2 following IL-1beta stimulation. Signal peptides may influence the trafficking of LIF. Two isoforms of murine LIF, LIF-M and LIF-D, encode different signal peptides which have been associated with different locations of the mature protein in fibroblasts. To determine the effect of the signal peptides on LIF secretion, secretion levels were compared in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) clones which expressed murine LIF-M or LIF-D or human LIF under the control of an inducible promoter. Low and high levels of LIF expression were also compared since saturation of the apical or basolateral route would reveal specific transporters for LIF. RESULTS: When Caco-2 was grown on permeable supports, LIF was secreted constitutively with around 40% secreted into the apical chamber. Stimulation with IL-1beta increased LIF production. After treating the apical surface with IL-1beta, the percentage secreted apically remained similar to the untreated, whereas, when the cells were stimulated at the basolateral surface only 20% was secreted apically. In MDCK cells, an endogenous LIF-like protein was detected entirely in the apical compartment. The two mLIF isoforms showed no difference in their secretion patterns in MDCK. Interestingly, about 70% of murine and human LIF was secreted apically from MDCK over a 400-fold range of expression levels within clones and a 200,000-fold range across clones. CONCLUSION: The site of stimulation affected the polarity of LIF secretion, while, signal peptides and expression levels did not. Exogenous LIF is transported in MDCK without readily saturated steps.","['Hill, Eric J', 'Vernallis, Ann B']","['Hill EJ', 'Vernallis AB']","['School of Life and Health Sciences, Aston University, Birmingham, UK. e.j.hill@aston.ac.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080918,England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Polarity', 'Dogs', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism']",PMC2556326,2008/09/20 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2121-9-53 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2121-9-53 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2008 Sep 18;9:53. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-9-53.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of their frequency and favorable impact on prognostic outcome, screening for this aberration is currently recommended in routine diagnostic characterization of AML. Several techniques enabling to detect NPM1 mutation have been reported, but all require sophisticated equipment, which represent an obstacle particularly in countries with limited resources. METHODS: We designed an RT-PCR strategy to amplify NPM1 exon 12 followed by electrophoresis and fragment visualization on polyacrylamide gels to discriminate a 4-5 bp size difference resulting from mutations in this gene. A hemi-nested method was designed to increase sensitivity for the study of minimal residual disease (MRD). RESULTS: The assay enabled specific detection of NPM1 mutations in 12/36 patients. A 10(-2) sensitivity level was obtained using one amplification round, while the hemi-nested PCR approach yielded a 10(-5) sensitivity level, therefore proving useful to assess MRD in patients carrying the mutation. The results were independently validated in 24 AML cases by sequencing analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This simple and low-cost assay may integrate diagnostic work-up of AML and could be used for assessment of response to therapy in patients with NPM1 mutations.","['Calvo, Karina Lucrecia', 'Ojeda, Mara Jorgelina', 'Ammatuna, Emanuele', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Targovnik, Hector Manuel', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Noguera, Nelida Ines']","['Calvo KL', 'Ojeda MJ', 'Ammatuna E', 'Lavorgna S', 'Ottone T', 'Targovnik HM', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Noguera NI']","['Department of Chemical Biochemistry (Hematology), Facultad de Ciencias Bioquimicas y Farmaceuticas, Universidad Nacional de Rosario, Rosario, Argentina.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel/*methods', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*analysis/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1155 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01155.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Jan;82(1):69-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01155.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantification of WT1 in bone marrow samples may be useful as a marker of minimal residual disease (MRD) and may predict the relapse of AML after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). METHODS AND RESULTS: The quantitative expression of WT1 was measured in 38 AML patients (16 males and 22 females) at diagnosis, at the time of transplant and after the allogeneic HSCT (at precise time points). All cases showed high WT1 expression levels at diagnosis with a mean of 4189 (SD 3325) and a median of 3495 (range 454-13923) copies WT1/10(4)Abl. At transplant, 25 patients (66%) were in complete cytologic remission (CcR) and 13 (34%) had refractory or relapsed AML. Bone marrow samples from patients transplanted in CcR showed significantly lower WT1 expression levels during HSCT compared with the samples from patients with a relapsed or refractory AML (P = 0.004). After HSCT, a rapid decline in WT1 expression levels was observed in all patients who attained or maintained a condition of CcR. Six of 38 patients (13%) relapsed after HSCT and all of them had an increase in WT1 expression at/or before relapse. Five of these six patients died of leukemia and one was successfully reinduced with donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) + chemotherapy with a rapid reduction of WT1 levels. Besides, we found a complete concordance between WT1 expression levels and other disease markers (when available). CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, there was a complete concordance between WT1 expression levels (measured by quantitative RT-PCR at precise time points) and status of AML before and after allogeneic HSCT. WT1 may be useful as a non-specific leukemia marker for monitoring MRD and as a predictor of AML clinical relapse. Based on these results, cases with increase of WT1 levels after HSCT and without graft vs. host disease may be candidate to discontinuation of immunosuppression and/or DLI therapy.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Chiarvesio, Alexia', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Simeone, Erica', 'Pipan, Corrado', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Candoni A', 'Tiribelli M', 'Toffoletti E', 'Cilloni D', 'Chiarvesio A', 'Michelutti A', 'Simeone E', 'Pipan C', 'Saglio G', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Medical and Morphologic Research, University of Udine, Udine, Italy. candoni.anna@aoud.sanita.fvg.it']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080917,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (WT1 Proteins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]']","['EJH1158 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01158.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2009 Jan;82(1):61-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01158.x.

Anemia, thrombocytopenia, and blasts in his peripheral blood were noted, and 31.4% blasts were found in a bone marrow aspiration. The blasts were positive for myeloperoxidase and esterase staining. Furthermore, karyotype analysis of bone marrow cells showed t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) and MLL abnormality was detected on RT-PCR A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (M4) with 11q23 (MLL) abnormality was made. Loeys-Dietz syndrome is a Marfan-like congenital connective tissue disorder caused by a heterozygous missense mutation of a TGF-beta receptor I or II gene. The TGF-beta family inhibits the proliferation of normal epithelial cells and induces apoptosis, and is therefore known as a tumor suppressor factor. In this article, we discussed the association between Loeys-Dietz syndrome with a TGF-beta receptor gene mutation and cancer.","['Togashi, Yosuke', 'Sakoda, Hiroto', 'Sugahara, Hiroyuki', 'Asagoe, Kosuke', 'Matsuzawa, Yuji']","['Togashi Y', 'Sakoda H', 'Sugahara H', 'Asagoe K', 'Matsuzawa Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Sumitomo Hospital.']",['jpn'],,"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Marfan Syndrome/*complications/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2008/09/20 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/09/20 09:00'],"['2008/09/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2008 Aug;49(8):664-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of particular importance is their ability to transfer malignancy to non-obese diabetic-severe combined immunodeficient (NOD-SCID) mice. Furthermore, numerous studies demonstrate that acute myeloid leukemia arises from mutations at the level of stem cell, and chronic myeloid leukemia is also a stem cell disease. In this review, we will evaluate the main characteristics of LSCs elucidated in several well-documented leukemias. In addition, we will discuss points of therapeutic intervention. Promising therapeutic approaches include the targeting of key signal transduction pathways (for example, PI3K, Rac and Wnt) with small-molecule inhibitors and specific cell surface molecules (for example, CD33, CD44 and CD123), with effective cytotoxic antibodies. Also, statins, which are already widely therapeutically used for a variety of diseases, show potential in targeting LSCs. In addition, drugs that inhibit ATP-binding cassette transporter proteins are being extensively studied, as they are important in drug resistance-a frequent characteristic of LSCs. Although the specific targeting of LSCs is a relatively new field, it is a highly promising battleground that may reveal the Holy Grail of cancer therapy.","['Misaghian, N', 'Ligresti, G', 'Steelman, L S', 'Bertrand, F E', 'Basecke, J', 'Libra, M', 'Nicoletti, F', 'Stivala, F', 'Milella, M', 'Tafuri, A', 'Cervello, M', 'Martelli, A M', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Misaghian N', 'Ligresti G', 'Steelman LS', 'Bertrand FE', 'Basecke J', 'Libra M', 'Nicoletti F', 'Stivala F', 'Milella M', 'Tafuri A', 'Cervello M', 'Martelli AM', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA098195-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01098195/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080918,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Drug Delivery Systems/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/etiology/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC2627788,2008/09/19 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008246 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.246 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2009 Jan;23(1):25-42. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.246.

As these drugs target different angiogenic regulators, and as cancers are inherently heterogeneous, a detailed characterization of angiogenesis in individual cancers is needed. Hence, we measured bone marrow microvessel density (MVD), plasma concentrations of eight angiogenesis-related parameters and the expression in blood mononuclear cells of 40 angiogenesis-related mRNAs in 93 patients with haematological neoplasias (acute myeloid leukaemia; chronic lymphatic leukaemia; multiple myeloma (MM); or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)) before start and after completion of cancer therapy. Compared with healthy individuals, the patients had significantly increased bone marrow MVD, especially patients with advanced stage disease. A novel finding was that patients with NHL also had increased bone marrow MVD. The plasma levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased. VEGF levels were highest in those who did not achieve complete remission after cancer therapy. The mRNA expression of IL-8 was upregulated 15-fold. Our data show that patients with haematological malignancies have increased bone marrow MVD; hence, supporting the notion that bone marrow angiogenesis plays a role in the pathogenesis and progression of these cancers.

Either a matched family donor or an unrelated donor was used in 29 (46%) and 34 (54%) patients, respectively.

Besides several oxidative metabolites and an N-desmethyl metabolite, as previous reported, a novel metabolite with a mass addition of 621 atomic mass units to the parent was detected as the major metabolite in the incubations with rat liver microsomes, using NADPH as a cofactor. The analysis of MS(2) and MS(n) data revealed that this metabolite corresponded to adenine dinucleotide phosphate (ADP+) conjugate of imatinib. The ADP+ adduct was scaled up from rat liver microsomal incubations and isolated for NMR analysis. NMR data confirmed and conclusively showed the conjugation had occurred between the pyridine nitrogen of imatinib to the ribose ring of ADP+ moiety. The formation of this adduct was enzymatic and required NADP+ as a reactant. In addition, ADP+ adducts of imatinib N-oxide and desmethyl imatinib were also detected as minor metabolites in the incubations with rat liver microsomes. In contrast, only trace levels of ADP+ adducts of imatinib and desmethyl imatinib were detected in the incubations with human liver microsomes. Imatinib-ADP+ adducts have been observed only in in vitro studies to date. The physiological role of these adducts is not clear, nor is their in vivo relevance.","['Ma, Shuguang', 'Subramanian, Raju', 'Xu, Yang', 'Schrag, Michael', 'Shou, Magang']","['Ma S', 'Subramanian R', 'Xu Y', 'Schrag M', 'Shou M']","['Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Schering-Plough Research Institute, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, NJ 07033, USA. shuguang.ma@spcorp.com']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20080917,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Microsomes, Liver/*metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/chemistry', 'NADP/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Piperazines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Rats']",,2008/09/19 09:00,2009/06/06 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.108.023085 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.108.023085 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2008 Dec;36(12):2414-8. doi: 10.1124/dmd.108.023085.

Characterizing the molecular basis of hematopoietic differentiation is therefore important for understanding and treating disease. Retinoic acid induces expression of ankyrin repeat-containing protein with a suppressor of cytokine signaling box 2 (ASB2) in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells, and ASB2 expression inhibits growth and promotes commitment, recapitulating an early step critical for differentiation. ASB2 is the specificity subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and is proposed to exert its effects by regulating the turnover of specific proteins; however, no ASB2 substrates had been identified. Here, we report that ASB2 targets the actin-binding proteins filamin A and B for proteasomal degradation. Knockdown of endogenous ASB2 in leukemia cells delays retinoic acid-induced differentiation and filamin degradation; conversely, ASB2 expression in leukemia cells induces filamin degradation. ASB2 expression inhibits cell spreading, and this effect is recapitulated by knocking down both filamin A and filamin B. Thus, we suggest that ASB2 may regulate hematopoietic cell differentiation by modulating cell spreading and actin remodeling through targeting of filamins for degradation.","['Heuze, Melina L', 'Lamsoul, Isabelle', 'Baldassarre, Massimiliano', 'Lad, Yatish', 'Leveque, Sophie', 'Razinia, Ziba', 'Moog-Lutz, Christel', 'Calderwood, David A', 'Lutz, Pierre G']","['Heuze ML', 'Lamsoul I', 'Baldassarre M', 'Lad Y', 'Leveque S', 'Razinia Z', 'Moog-Lutz C', 'Calderwood DA', 'Lutz PG']","['Universite de Toulouse, Universite Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['R01 GM068600/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM068600-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080917,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ASB2 protein, human)', '0 (Actins)', '0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Contractile Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Filamins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC2597609,2008/09/19 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51754-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-12-128744 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5130-40. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-12-128744.

The transforming ability of Tax, the viral oncoprotein, is believed to depend on interactions with cell cycle regulators and on transactivation of genes that control cellular proliferation, including proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cofactor associated with DNA replication and repair. Tax associates with cellular transcription factors to alter their affinity for cognate DNA elements, leading to increased or decreased transcription from that promoter. Although it has been demonstrated that Tax transactivates the PCNA promoter, the mechanism of transcriptional activation is unknown. Here we report a cellular complex that binds specifically to a novel site within the minimal Tax-responsive element of the TATAA-less PCNA promoter. Mutation at this binding site or Tax expression inhibited complex formation and increased promoter activity, suggesting that the complex is a transcriptional repressor. The activation of PCNA gene expression by Tax and consequential decrease in nucleotide excision repair mediated by PCNA overexpression could contribute to the reduced DNA repair capacity and genomic instability observed in HTLV-1-infected cells.","['Edwards, Dustin C', 'Marriott, Susan J']","['Edwards DC', 'Marriott SJ']","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, MS-385, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA-77371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077371/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI007471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 AI-07471/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080917,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA Repair', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Response Elements', '*Transcriptional Activation']",PMC2583679,2008/09/19 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00356-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00356-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Dec;82(23):11714-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00356-08.

Therefore, the composition of this envelope can provide important information about the budding process and its location. Here, we present mass spectrometry analysis of the lipid content of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MLV). The results of this comprehensive survey found that the overall lipid content of these viruses mostly matched that of the plasma membrane, which was considerably different from the total lipid content of the cells. However, several lipids are enriched in comparison to the composition of the plasma membrane: (i) cholesterol, ceramide, and GM3; and (ii) phosphoinositides, phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol. Interestingly, microvesicles, which are similar in size to viruses and are also released from the cell periphery, lack phosphoinositides, suggesting a different budding mechanism/location for these particles than for retroviruses. One phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)], has been implicated in membrane binding by HIV Gag. Consistent with this observation, we found that PI(4,5)P(2) was enriched in HIV-1 and that depleting this molecule in cells reduced HIV-1 budding. Analysis of mutant virions mapped the enrichment of PI(4,5)P(2) to the matrix domain of HIV Gag. Overall, these results suggest that HIV-1 and other retroviruses bud from cholesterol-rich regions of the plasma membrane and exploit matrix/PI(4,5)P(2) interactions for particle release from cells.","['Chan, Robin', 'Uchil, Pradeep D', 'Jin, Jing', 'Shui, Guanghou', 'Ott, David E', 'Mothes, Walther', 'Wenk, Markus R']","['Chan R', 'Uchil PD', 'Jin J', 'Shui G', 'Ott DE', 'Mothes W', 'Wenk MR']","['Centre for Life Sciences (CeLS), Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, 28 Medical Drive, Level 04-21, Singapore 117607, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI065284/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'ND1-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080917,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'HIV-1/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*chemistry', 'Lipids/*analysis', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Secretory Vesicles/chemistry', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/chemistry/genetics']",PMC2573248,2008/09/19 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00981-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00981-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Nov;82(22):11228-38. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00981-08.

18799030,NLM,MEDLINE,20100831,20150313,,27,9,2008 Sep,[Role of high mobility group box 1 in adriamycin-induced apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells].,929-33,,"BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: High mobility group box l (HMGB1), a nuclear DNA-binding protein, stabilizes the structure and function of chromatin, regulates gene transcription. Recent studies found that HMGB1 is associated with the proliferation and metastasis of many tumors, including breast cancer, colon carcinoma, and melanoma, and is rich in various solid cancer tissues and immature cells. This study was to explore the role of HMGB1 in adriamycin (ADM)-induced apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells. METHODS: K562 cells were transiently transfected with recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-HMGB1. The expression of HMGB1 in K562 cells were detected by Western blot and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) of ADM for K562 cells was determined by WST-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. The protein level of Bcl-2 was detected by Western blot. The activities of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 were assayed with Caspase Colorimetric Assay Kit. RESULTS: The mRNA and protein levels of HMGB1 in K562 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-HMGB1 were increased by about 85% and 56% respectively as compared with those in K562 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1. Overexpression of HMGB1 in K562 cells by transient transfection significantly increased the resistance to ADM; the IC(50) of ADM was increased from (0.06+/-0.00) microg/mL to (3.46+/-0.06) microg/mL. When treated with 1 microg/mL ADM, the apoptosis rate was significantly lower in HMGB1-transfected K562 cells than in pcDNA3.1-transfected K562 cells [(12.00+/-1.26)% vs. (44.50+/-1.87)%, P<0.05]. Overexpression of HMGB1 in K562 cells significantly inhibited ADM-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 protein. After treatment of ADM, the activities of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9 in HMGB1-transfected K562 cells were inhibited as compared with those in pcDNA3.1-transfected K562 cells (Caspase-3: 1.55+/-0.06 vs. 2.55+/-0.06 at 12 h, 1.86+/-0.10 vs. 2.85+/-0.06 at 24 h, P<0.05; Caspase-9: 1.40+/-0.08 vs. 2.03+/-0.05 at 12 h, 1.55+/-0.06 vs. 2.22+/-0.05 at 24 h, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: HMGB1 overexpression could inhibit ADM-induced apoptosis in leukemia K562 cells through regulating the protein level of Bcl-2 and the activities of Caspase-3 and Caspase-9.","['Yu, Yan', 'Xie, Min', 'He, Yu-Lei', 'Xu, Wang-Qiong', 'Zhu, Shan', 'Cao, Li-Zhi']","['Yu Y', 'Xie M', 'He YL', 'Xu WQ', 'Zhu S', 'Cao LZ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, 410008, PR China.']",['chi'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (HMGB1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase 9/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HMGB1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Plasmids', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2008/09/19 09:00,2010/09/02 06:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X200809929 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2008 Sep;27(9):929-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is recognized that there is a theoretical potential of developing an excess of malignancies in children born after ART. With the advancement and introduction of newer techniques in ART there is an increase in the micromanipulation of gametes and embryos in vitro and extended exposure to the in vitro environment. These include the use of gonadotropins for superovulation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, blastocyst culture, assisted hatching, and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Although these approaches aim to enhance pregnancy rates and its outcome, the risk of associated long-term health hazards cannot be disregarded. More recently there is some evidence suggesting a link between ART and epigenetic alterations leading to DNA modifications and imprinting disorders. Two of these genetic imprinting disorders that are known to cause birth defects and childhood malignancies, Beckwith-Wiedmann syndrome and Angelman syndrome have been associated with ART. Systemic reviews of the literature identified published studies, but were unable to identify the precise risks of imprinting disorders and childhood cancers in children conceived with ART. Overall, most studies have not shown any increase in the incidence of childhood cancers after ART. With more women resorting to ART, careful counseling should be offered to all couples especially those requiring intracytoplasmic sperm injection for abnormal sperm parameters. TARGET AUDIENCE: Obstetricians & Gynecologists, Family Physicians. LEARNING OBJECTIVES: After completion of this article, the reader should be able to distinguish for patients the lack of irrefutable evidence for an increased risk of childhood malignancies in children conceived using assisted reproductive technology (ART), explain potential mechanisms of injury to the gametes and/or embryo during ART which might predispose to childhood illness, and appraise future articles on this topic for credibility both to likelihood of true relationship to possible childhood cancers as well as biologic basis for potential relationship.","['Neelanjana, Mukhopadhaya', 'Sabaratnam, Arulkumaran']","['Neelanjana M', 'Sabaratnam A']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Luton and Dunstable NHS Trust, Luton, Bedfordshire, United Kingdom. n.m@doctors.org.uk']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Obstet Gynecol Surv,Obstetrical & gynecological survey,0401007,,IM,"['Child', 'Chromosome Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/epidemiology/genetics', 'Reproductive Techniques, Assisted/*adverse effects', 'Retinoblastoma/epidemiology/genetics']",,2008/09/19 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['0006254-200810000-00023 [pii]', '10.1097/OGX.0b013e318181a9f0 [doi]']",ppublish,Obstet Gynecol Surv. 2008 Oct;63(10):669-76. doi: 10.1097/OGX.0b013e318181a9f0.,,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective cohort study aims to determine the epidemiology of TE and to identify potential risk factors for TE in children with cancer. METHODS: We used logistic regression to determine the association of age (<10 years vs. > or =10 years), gender, type of cancer, presence or absence of intra-thoracic disease (mediastinal mass or any primary or metastatic pulmonary disease), type of central venous line (CVL) and CVL-dysfunction (difficulty of blood draw, infusion or documented CVL infection) on the risk of developing TE. RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 726 patients [7.9%; 95% confidence intervals (CI); 6.0,10.0] developed TE; children with brain tumors (n = 201) had significantly lower prevalence of TE (0.5%; P < 0.001). Older patients had increased risk of developing TE compared to younger patients [Odds ratios (OR) 1.8; 95% CI; 1.0,3.2; P = 0.036]. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (OR 4.6; 95% CI; 1.8, 12.3; P = 0.002), lymphoma (OR 3.8; 95% CI; 1.3, 11.1; P = 0.016), and sarcoma (OR 4.3; 95% CI; 1.4, 13.3; P = 0.012) had an increased risk of TE. Subgroup analyses showed that patients with CVL-dysfunction and intra-thoracic disease had a higher prevalence of TE compared to those without CVL-dysfunction (22.8% vs. 8.8%; 95% CI; 4.0, 24.3; P = 0.006) and intra-thoracic disease (18.0% vs. 6.1%; 95% CI; 2.4, 21.4; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: TE is common in children with cancer. Age and type of cancer are independent risk factors for TE in children with non-CNS cancers. CVL-dysfunction and intra-thoracic disease are significantly associated with the diagnosis of TE.","['Athale, Uma', 'Siciliano, Sabrina', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Pai, Nikhil', 'Cox, Stephanie', 'Lathia, Anita', 'Khan, Anees', 'Armstrong, Ankelly', 'Chan, Anthony K C']","['Athale U', 'Siciliano S', 'Thabane L', 'Pai N', 'Cox S', 'Lathia A', 'Khan A', 'Armstrong A', 'Chan AK']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. athaleu@mcmaster.ca']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/complications/therapy', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sarcoma/complications/therapy', 'Thromboembolism/diagnosis/*epidemiology/etiology']",,2008/09/19 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21734 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Dec;51(6):792-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21734.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that in benign (primary and HES) and cancerous-endometrial epithelial cells (EEC) (An3Ca, SK-UT2 and Ishikawa), leptin in a dose-dependent manner regulates vascular endothelial growth factor, (VEGF); interleukin-1 beta, (IL-1beta); leukemia inhibitory factor, (LIF) and their respective receptors, VEGFR2, IL-1R tI and LIFR. Remarkably, leptin induces a greater increase in VEGF/VEGFR2 and LIF levels in cancer than in benign cells. However, IL-1beta was only increased by leptin in benign primary-EEC. Cancer-EEC expressed higher levels of leptin receptor (full-length OB-Rb and short isoforms) in contrast to benign primary-EEC. Leptin-mediated activation of JAK2 (janus kinase 2) was upstream to the activation of PI-3K (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase) and/or MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling pathways. Leptin induction of cytokines/receptors generally involved JAK2 and MAPK activation, but PI-3K phosphorylation was required for leptin increase of LIF, IL-1/IL-1R tI. Leptin-mediated activation of mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin), mainly linked to MAPK, played a central role in leptin regulation of all cytokines and receptors. These results suggest that leptin's effects are cell-specific and could confer a proliferative or cell survival advantage or possibly promote endometrial thickness. Leptin's effects on proangiogenic molecules were more evident in malignant versus benign cells and may imply that there is an underlying shift in leptin-induced cell signaling pathways in endometrial cancer cells.","['Carino, Cecilia', 'Olawaiye, Alexander B', 'Cherfils, Salandre', 'Serikawa, Takehiro', 'Lynch, Maureen P', 'Rueda, Bo R', 'Gonzalez, Ruben R']","['Carino C', 'Olawaiye AB', 'Cherfils S', 'Serikawa T', 'Lynch MP', 'Rueda BR', 'Gonzalez RR']","['Boston Biomedical Research Institute (BBRI), Watertown, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA098333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA098333-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 098333/PHS HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood supply/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Endometrial Neoplasms/blood supply/*metabolism', 'Endometrium/blood supply/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/metabolism', 'Leptin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",PMC2892183,2008/09/19 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.23887 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Dec 15;123(12):2782-90. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23887.,,,,['NIHMS70964'],,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The objective of this review was to briefly highlight the treatment breakthroughs in leukemia and MDS. Therapeutic progress happened through better understanding of disease pathophysiologies and rational development of targeted agents, like imatinib mesylate in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and through astute, empirical discoveries in the clinic, like all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and chlorodeoxyadenosine in hairy cell leukemia (HCL). Today, the 5- to 10-year survival rates in patients with APL and HCL exceed 80%. In patients with CML, imatinib therapy has been associated with estimated 5- to 7-year survival rates from 85% to 90%. In patients with adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, modern intensive regimens have improved the 5-year survival rates from 20% up to 40%. In patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chemoimmunotherapy recently produced high rates of quality responses and improved long-term outcome. In younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the 5-year survival rates range from 40% to 50%, although elderly AML remains a therapeutic challenge. In patients with MDS, it was recently demonstrated that epigenetic therapy with hypomethylating agents improved survival. Much therapeutic progress has been witnessed in leukemia and MDS, and much more is expected to occur soon.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Wierda, William', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Keating, Michael', 'Freireich, Emil J']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J', 'Wierda W', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Issa JP', 'Estey E', 'Keating M', 'Freireich EJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

In addition to associations of several HLA antigens with leukaemias, it has been observed that patients with leukaemia have an increase in the frequency of HLA identical siblings, higher degree of HLA compatibility with their parents as well as higher parental HLA sharing rate in comparison to the families without patients suffering from leukaemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To test hypothesis that susceptibility to leukaemia can be caused by influence of a recessive genes associated with the major histocompatibility complex in man, we analysed the distribution of I class HLA antigens in 77 families of patients suffering from different types of leukaemia. In the affected families and in 72 families of healthy controls, we investigated HLA identical sibling frequency, parental sharing of one, two or three HLA antigens and degree of compatibility of parents and offsprings: existence of haploidentity, compatibility in l' and 4/4 HLA antigens of A and B loci. RESULTS: We have found that in families with affected persons there is a statistically significant difference in number of HLA identical siblings in comparison to the group of healthy controls (t = 2.63). Also the results have shown that among the parents of affected persons there is a statistically significant difference in mutual compatibility in one (t = 3.012) and two (t = 2.4) HLA antigens. In addition, we observed an increase in the frequency of higher rate of compatibility between patients and their parents (t = 3.88) in l' HLA antigens, to their mothers (t = 2.83) and to their fathers (t = 2.55), respectively, in comparison to the healthy control group. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show that in families with persons suffering from leukaemia there are possible recessive factors associated with HLA system which could cause distorsion of HLA antigens segregation and as a possible genetical risk factor contribute to development of leukaemia.","['Vojvodic, Svetlana']",['Vojvodic S'],['Zavod za transfuziju krvi Novi Sad. ssvu@EUnet.yu'],['srp'],,"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Serbia,Med Pregl,Medicinski pregled,2985249R,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'Histocompatibility', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology', 'Parents', 'Siblings']",,2008/09/19 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/09/19 09:00'],"['2008/09/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2298/mpns0802022v [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pregl. 2008 Jan-Feb;61(1-2):22-6. doi: 10.2298/mpns0802022v.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet, few factors that contribute to this process are known. We have explored the role of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) and bone morphogenetic protein-6 (BMP-6) and one target gene, TGFbeta inducible early gene 1 (TIEG1), in the communication between stroma cells and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines and their escape from chemotherapy. Here, we have demonstrated TIEG1 expression in both normal B progenitor cells and ALL cells, which increased rapidly upon TGFbeta and BMP-6 treatment. Stimulation with TGFbeta or BMP-6, as well as overexpression of TIEG1 inhibited proliferation. Furthermore, interaction with stroma cells induced TIEG1 expression in ALL cells, inhibited their proliferation and protected the cells against chemotherapeutic treatment. Similarly, treatment with TGFbeta or BMP-6, as well as overexpression of TIEG1, protected ALL cells against chemotherapy-induced cell death. These data suggest that TGFbeta and BMP-6 in the bone marrow microenvironment allow leukemia cells to escape therapy. Further, the data indicate that TIEG1 might be involved in mediating this effect from the microenvironment onto the leukemia cells.","['Dosen-Dahl, Guri', 'Munthe, Else', 'Nygren, Marit Kveine', 'Stubberud, Heidi', 'Hystad, Marit E', 'Rian, Edith']","['Dosen-Dahl G', 'Munthe E', 'Nygren MK', 'Stubberud H', 'Hystad ME', 'Rian E']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Montebello, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BMP6 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6)', '0 (Early Growth Response Transcription Factors)', '0 (KLF10 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 6/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Early Growth Response Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/01/17 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/17 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.23833 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Dec 15;123(12):2759-66. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23833.,,['Int J Cancer. 2009 May 1;24(9):2250'],,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Carotenoids are a family of natural pigments and have several biological functions. Among carotenoids, fucoxanthin is known to have antitumorigenic activity, but the precise mechanism of action is not elucidated. We evaluated the anti-ATL effects of fucoxanthin and its metabolite, fucoxanthinol. Both carotenoids inhibited cell viability of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines and ATL cells, and fucoxanthinol was approximately twice more potent than fucoxanthin. In contrast, other carotenoids, beta-carotene and astaxanthin, had mild inhibitory effects on HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines. Importantly, uninfected cell lines and normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were resistant to fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol. Both carotenoids induced cell cycle arrest during G(1) phase by reducing the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin D2, CDK4 and CDK6, and inducing the expression of GADD45alpha, and induced apoptosis by reducing the expression of Bcl-2, XIAP, cIAP2 and survivin. The induced apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9. Fucoxanthin and fucoxanthinol also suppressed IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and JunD expression, resulting in inactivation of nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1. Mice with severe combined immunodeficiency harboring tumors induced by inoculation of HTLV-1-infected T cells responded to treatment with fucoxanthinol with suppression of tumor growth, showed extensive tissue distribution of fucoxanthinol, and the presence of therapeutically effective serum concentrations of fucoxanthinol.

We report that Notch1 is a prevalent and major mutational target in chemically induced mouse lymphoma. The regions of the gene that are frequently mutated are the heterodimerization domain and the N-terminal ligand-binding region, important for protein stability, and the polypeptide rich in proline, glutamate, serine and threonine (PEST) domains, which is critical for protein degradation. Another gene, CDC4, is also involved in Notch1 degradation and shows frequent mutations. Mutations in the heterodimerization and the ligand-binding regions may cause ligand-independent signaling, whereas mutations preventing protein degradation result in accumulation of intracellular Notch1. We analyzed 103 chemical-induced mouse lymphomas for mutations in the Notch1 gene using single strand conformation analysis (SSCA) and DNA sequencing. Genetic alterations resulting in premature truncation of Notch1 were identified in 28 tumors, whereas 8 revealed alterations in the heterodimerization and 16 harbored deletions in the ligand-binding region.

These results were fully confirmed by the molecular mass of rMnSOD as evaluated by ES/MS analysis (26662.7 Da) and the nucleotide sequence of the MnSOD cDNA. The role of the leader peptide in rMnSOD was investigated using a fluorescent and/or (68)Gallium-labelled synthetic peptide. The labelled peptide permeated MCF-7 cells and uptake could be inhibited in the presence of an excess of oestrogen. In vivo it was taken up by the tumour, suggesting that the molecule can be used for both therapy and diagnosis. The in vitro and in vivo pharmacology tests confirmed that rMnSOD is only oncotoxic for tumour cells expressing oestrogen receptors. Pharmacokinetic studies in animals performed with (125)I- and (131)I-labelled proteins confirmed that, when administered systemically, rMnSOD selectively reached the tumour, where its presence was unambiguously demonstrated by scintigraphic and PET scans. PCR analysis revealed that Bax gene expression was increased and the Bcl2 gene was down regulated in MCF7 cells treated with rMnSOD, which suggests that the protein induces a pro-apoptotic mechanism.","['Mancini, Aldo', 'Borrelli, Antonella', 'Schiattarella, Antonella', 'Aloj, Luigi', 'Aurilio, Michela', 'Morelli, Franco', 'Pica, Alessandra', 'Occhiello, Antonella', 'Lorizio, Roberto', 'Mancini, Roberto', 'Sica, Alessandro', 'Mazzarella, Lelio', 'Sica, Filomena', 'Grieco, Paolo', 'Novellino, Ettore', 'Pagnozzi, Daniela', 'Pucci, Piero', 'Rommelaere, Jean']","['Mancini A', 'Borrelli A', 'Schiattarella A', 'Aloj L', 'Aurilio M', 'Morelli F', 'Pica A', 'Occhiello A', 'Lorizio R', 'Mancini R', 'Sica A', 'Mazzarella L', 'Sica F', 'Grieco P', 'Novellino E', 'Pagnozzi D', 'Pucci P', 'Rommelaere J']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biotherapy, National Cancer Institute G.

Median age was 44 years (range 18-55) and median time from diagnosis to transplant 58.5 months. All patients had failed prior fludarabine-based chemotherapy and all but two patients had chemo-resistant refractory disease at time of transplant. A 'myeloablative' conditioning regimen was used in 11 patients and 'reduced intensity' in one. Bone marrow was the source of hematopoietic stem cells in 10 patients and peripheral blood in two. Donors were matched sibling in nine patients, unrelated in two and partial phenotypic match father in one. Grade II-IV acute and chronic graft versus host disease was documented in five and four patients, respectively. To date, six patients (50%) have died including four early deaths from infection. Complete remission (CR) was documented in eight patients (66.7%) post-transplant; six are currently alive whereas one died at 7 months from infection while still in CR and one relapsed 7 months post-transplant and died later. One CR patient relapsed after 4.5 years but was successfully re-transplanted and remains in second CR for 6.5+ years. Another patient recently relapsed after 10.5 years of CR. Duration of ASCT-induced CR in the remaining four patients was 6.5+, 8.5+, 9+ and 10+ years. All surviving patients displayed excellent performance status without ongoing chronic graft versus host disease. We conclude that ASCT is an effective salvage therapy for fludarabine-refractory CLL but late relapses can occur.","['Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Hogan, William J', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Elliott, Michelle A', 'Gastineau, Dennis A', 'Ansell, Stephen M', 'Dispenzieri, Angela', 'Gertz, Morie A', 'Hayman, Suzanne R', 'Inwards, David J', 'Lacy, Martha Q', 'Micallef, Ivana N', 'Porrata, Luis F', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Malhotra P', 'Hogan WJ', 'Litzow MR', 'Elliott MA', 'Gastineau DA', 'Ansell SM', 'Dispenzieri A', 'Gertz MA', 'Hayman SR', 'Inwards DJ', 'Lacy MQ', 'Micallef IN', 'Porrata LF', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['902502659 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802263535 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Sep;49(9):1724-30. doi: 10.1080/10428190802263535.,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Sep;49(9):1651-2.

HCL is defined, according to the WHO classification, as a mature (peripheral) B-cell neoplasm (1). HCL accounts for between 2-3% of all leukemia cases, with about 600 new cases diagnosed in the U.S. each year (1). HCL occurs more commonly in males, with an overall male to female ratio of approximately 4:1. The median age of onset is 52 years. This disease is seen more commonly in Caucasians and appears to be especially frequent in Ashkenazi Jewish males, with rare occurrence in persons of Asian and African descents (1). Hairy cells are distinct, clonal B cells arrested at a late stage of maturation. They are small B lymphoid cells that possess oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm with characteristic micro-filamentous (""hairy"") projections. They strongly express CD103, CD22, and CD11c (2). These cells typically infiltrate the bone marrow, the spleen, and to a lesser extent the liver, lymph nodes, and skin. Many patients present with splenomegaly and pancytopenia. Other clinical manifestations include recurrent opportunistic infections and vasculitis. Historically, HCL was considered uniformly fatal (2). However, recent treatment advances, using purine analogues such as Cladribine and Pentostatin, led to a significant improvement in prognosis with achievement of high response rates and durable remissions (2).","['Cannon, Timothy', 'Mobarek, Dalia', 'Wegge, Julia', 'Tabbara, Imad A']","['Cannon T', 'Mobarek D', 'Wegge J', 'Tabbara IA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Examination', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', '*Leukemia, Hairy Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2008/11/18 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['902506653 [pii]', '10.1080/07357900801965034 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2008 Oct;26(8):860-5. doi: 10.1080/07357900801965034.,,,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ligand-independent activation of FLT3 occurs in about 30% of acute myeloid leukemia cases and is one goal for selectively targeted therapies. However, the function of FLT3/FL in the regulation of non-malignant immature hematopoietic cells is poorly characterized. In order to elucidate the role of FLT3 in normal hematopoiesis, human adult CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells were cultured in cytokine-supplemented liquid culture in the presence or absence of FLT3 inhibition by CEP-701 (lestaurtinib). Total cell number, lineage-committed, and primitive progenitors and apoptosis were assayed. FLT3 expression and FL secretion in various conditions were analyzed by fluorescent activated cell sorter and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Effects of nonspecific targeting of FLT3 were evaluated with addition of imatinib (Gleevec) to cell cultures. It is demonstrated that FLT3 inhibition impaired cell and progenitor cell growth and increased the rate in apoptosis. Effects were observed independent of addition of FL. The dose-dependent growth inhibition was partially equalized by inhibiting FL with a neutralizing antibody. FLT3 inhibition resulted in markedly increased production of FL by cultured CD34(+) cells as well as upregulation of FLT3 expression. Imatinib mimicked effects of selective FLT3 inhibition. In conclusion, FLT3 and its ligand regulate proliferation of hematopoietic progenitor cells in an autocrine/paracrine manner Nonspecific inhibition of FLT3 may contribute to hematotoxicity caused by imatinib treatment.","['Weisel, Katja C', 'Yildirim, Sedat', 'Schweikle, Eric', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Mohle, Robert']","['Weisel KC', 'Yildirim S', 'Schweikle E', 'Kanz L', 'Mohle R']","['Medical Center, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University of Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Strasse 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany. katja.weisel@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080917,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Furans', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0605-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Mar;88(3):203-11. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0605-6.

Babassu mesocarp is popularly used in Brazil as a food additive, and in popular medicine against several conditions, such as inflammations, menstrual pains and leukaemia. From babassu Orbignya speciosa (Mart.) Barb. Rodr. [Arecaceae (Palmae)] epicarp/mesocarp, an ethanol extract was prepared and named OSEME, which was tested on the viability,morphology and metabolism of several cell lines, such as the leukaemic cell lines, HL-60, K562 and the latter multidrug resistant counterpart K562-Lucena 1, the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7, the mouse fibroblast cell line 3T3-L1 and fresh human lymphocytes. OSEME promoted a dose-dependent decrease on the viability of all cells. This effect was much more pronounced on the tumoral cell lines than on non-tumoral cells, a phenomenon revealed by the dose of OSEME which promotes half of maximal effect (ID50). The decrease on viability was followed by shrinkage of cells, alteration on their morphology, and a markedly nuclear condensation. Curiously, stimulation of 6-phosphofructokinase activity (6.6-times) was observed on HL-60 cells, treated with OSEME, when compared to control treated with ethanol (vehicle). These results support evidences to suggest OSEME as a promising source of novel antineoplasic agents.","['Renno, Magdalena N', 'Barbosa, Gleyce M', 'Zancan, Patricia', 'Veiga, Venicio F', 'Alviano, Celuta S', 'Sola-Penna, Mauro', 'Menezes, Fabio S', 'Holandino, Carla']","['Renno MN', 'Barbosa GM', 'Zancan P', 'Veiga VF', 'Alviano CS', 'Sola-Penna M', 'Menezes FS', 'Holandino C']","['Departamento de Medicamentos, Faculdade de Farmacia, Centro de Ciencias da Saude, UFRJ, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,An Acad Bras Cienc,Anais da Academia Brasileira de Ciencias,7503280,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Arecaceae/*chemistry', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Mice', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/02/24 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2007/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0001-37652008000300008 [pii]', '10.1590/s0001-37652008000300008 [doi]']",ppublish,An Acad Bras Cienc. 2008 Sep;80(3):467-76. doi: 10.1590/s0001-37652008000300008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-six (40.4%) out of 163 patients developed 79 pulmonary complications. Infectious etiology was the leading cause (92.4%). The most identified infectious agents were Gram (-) bacteria, followed by fungi. Acute respiratory distress syndrome, leukostasis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, pulmonary edema, and pneumothorax were among the noninfectious causes. The pulmonary complications in the induction and consolidation phase of leukemia therapy were more severe and the mortality rate was higher. Tachypnea, shock, oxygen and mechanical ventilation requirement, disseminated intravascular coagulation, involvement of other organs or systems, cytopenias, requirement of modification in antimicrobial drugs were found to be related with increased mortality risk. The mortality rate of pulmonary complications was 8.9%. Pulmonary infections in the maintenance phase of the therapy were frequently treated with oral antibiotics, and they were generally rapidly taken under control. In conclusion, pulmonary complications are frequent in children with acute leukemia, and early diagnosis and appropriate management are important to avoid mortality owing to pulmonary complications, especially in neutropenic patients receiving induction or consolidation phase of chemotherapy.","['Erdur, Bars', 'Yilmaz, Sebnem', 'Oren, Hale', 'Demircioglu, Fatih', 'Cakmakc, Handan', 'Irken, Gulersu']","['Erdur B', 'Yilmaz S', 'Oren H', 'Demircioglu F', 'Cakmakc H', 'Irken G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Multiple Organ Failure/etiology/mortality', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/complications', 'Pneumonia/*complications/drug therapy/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Pneumothorax/complications/epidemiology', 'Pulmonary Edema/complications/epidemiology', 'Respiration, Artificial/statistics & numerical data', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31816916e4 [doi]', '00043426-200807000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jul;30(7):522-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31816916e4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A clumsy gait, muscle weakness in his fingers, and inverted champagne bottlelike muscle in the lower limbs were noticed after remission induction treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which included VCR at a total dose of 8 mg/m. An electrophysiologic study showed an almost normal median motor nerve conduction velocity (approximately 50 m/s), markedly reduced M-wave amplitude and sensory disturbance. He was diagnosed as CMT type 2 based on his symptoms and electrophysiologic findings. His symptoms gradually worsened, and even after VCR was discontinued, he could not walk alone for 7 months. VCR has previously been considered to be relatively safe in CMT type 2, however, some patients with CMT type 2 might show severe neurologic toxicities, as seen in patients with CMT type 1.","['Nishikawa, Takuro', 'Kawakami, Kiyoshi', 'Kumamoto, Takashi', 'Tonooka, Shiro', 'Abe, Akiko', 'Hayasaka, Kiyoshi', 'Okamoto, Yasuhiro', 'Kawano, Yoshifumi']","['Nishikawa T', 'Kawakami K', 'Kumamoto T', 'Tonooka S', 'Abe A', 'Hayasaka K', 'Okamoto Y', 'Kawano Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima City Hospital, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical, Kagoshima, Japan. adu44150@ams.odn.ne.jp']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease/*complications/diagnosis', 'Contraindications', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Gait Disorders, Neurologic/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Muscle Weakness/chemically induced/etiology', 'Neural Conduction/drug effects', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31816624a4 [doi]', '00043426-200807000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jul;30(7):519-21. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e31816624a4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyse the protective effects of long-term expression of the CCR5Delta32 protein, recombinant lentiviral vectors were used to deliver the CCR5Delta32 gene into human cell lines and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells that had been immortalized by human T-cell leukemia virus type 1. Blasticidin S-resistant cell lines expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 showed a significant reduction in HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion assays. It was shown that CD4(+) T lymphocytes expressing the lentivirus-encoded CCR5Delta32 gene were highly resistant to infection by a primary but not by a laboratory-adapted X4 strain, suggesting different infectivity requirements. In contrast to previous studies that analysed the CCR5Delta32 protective effects in a transient expression system, this study showed that long-term expression of CCR5Delta32 conferred resistance to HIV-1 despite cell-surface expression of the HIV co-receptors. The results suggest an additional unknown mechanism for generating the CCR5Delta32 resistance phenotype and support the hypothesis that the CCR5Delta32 protein acts as an HIV-suppressive factor by altering the stoichiometry of the molecules involved in HIV-1 entry. The lentiviral-CCR5Delta32 vectors offer a method of generating HIV-resistant cells by delivery of the CCR5Delta32 gene that may be useful for stem cell- or T-cell-based gene therapy for HIV-1 infection.","['Jin, Qingwen', 'Marsh, Jon', 'Cornetta, Kenneth', 'Alkhatib, Ghalib']","['Jin Q', 'Marsh J', 'Cornetta K', 'Alkhatib G']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Indiana University Vector Production Facility, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Indiana University Vector Production Facility, Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['A152019-01/PHS HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052019-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052019-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U42 RR11148/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052019/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052019-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 DK049218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U42 RR011148/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052019-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI052019-01A1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 DK49218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, CCR5)']",IM,"['CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/metabolism', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Receptors, CCR5/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",PMC2679520,2008/09/18 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.2008/003624-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2008 Oct;89(Pt 10):2611-2621. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.2008/003624-0.,,,,['NIHMS111136'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we aimed to define the molecular basis for the increased drug resistance and searched for novel strategies to circumvent it. The situation in CLL LN could be mimicked by prolonged in vitro CD40 stimulation, which resulted in up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-xL, A1/Bfl-1, and Mcl-1 proteins, and afforded resistance to various classes of drugs (fludarabine, bortezomib, roscovitine). CD40 stimulation also caused ERK-dependent reduction of Bim-EL protein, but ERK inhibition did not prevent drug resistance. Drugs combined with sublethal doses of the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 displayed partial and variable effects per individual CD40-stimulated CLL. The antiapoptotic profile of CD40-triggered CLL resembled BCR-Abl-dependent changes seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which prompted application of c-Abl inhibitors imatinib or dasatinib. Both compounds, but especially dasatinib, prevented the entire antiapoptotic CD40 program in CLL cells, and restored drug sensitivity. These effects also occurred in CLL samples with dysfunctional p53. Importantly, ex vivo CLL LN samples also displayed strong ERK activation together with high Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 but low Bim levels. These data indicate that CLL cells in chemoresistant niches may be sensitive to therapeutic strategies that include c-Abl inhibitors.","['Hallaert, Delfine Y H', 'Jaspers, Annelieke', 'van Noesel, Carel J', 'van Oers, Marinus H J', 'Kater, Arnon P', 'Eldering, Eric']","['Hallaert DY', 'Jaspers A', 'van Noesel CJ', 'van Oers MH', 'Kater AP', 'Eldering E']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Stem Cell Niche/*pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51755-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-146704 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5141-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-146704.

We present the first systematic comparison of risks by lymphoma subtype for a broad range of putative risk factors in a population-based case-control study, including diffuse large B-cell (DLBCL; N = 416), follicular (N = 318), and marginal zone lymphomas (N = 106), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL; N = 133). We required at least 2 of 3 analyses to support differences in risk: (1) polytomous logistic regression, (2) homogeneity tests, or (3) dichotomous logistic regression, analyzing all 7 possible pairwise comparisons among the subtypes, corresponding to various groupings by clinical behavior, genetic features, and differentiation. Late birth order and high body mass index (>/= 35) kg/m(2)) increased risk for DLBCL alone. Autoimmune conditions increased risk for marginal zone lymphoma alone. The tumor necrosis factor G-308A polymorphism (rs1800629) increased risks for both DLBCL and marginal zone lymphoma. Exposure to certain dietary heterocyclic amines from meat consumption increased risk for CLL/SLL alone. We observed no significant risk factors for follicular lymphoma alone. These data clearly support both etiologic commonality and heterogeneity for lymphoma subtypes, suggesting that immune dysfunction is of greater etiologic importance for DLBCL and marginal zone lymphoma than for CLL/SLL and follicular lymphoma.","['Morton, Lindsay M', 'Wang, Sophia S', 'Cozen, Wendy', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Chatterjee, Nilanjan', 'Davis, Scott', 'Severson, Richard K', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Vasef, Mohammad A', 'Rothman, Nathaniel', 'Blair, Aaron', 'Bernstein, Leslie', 'Cross, Amanda J', 'De Roos, Anneclaire J', 'Engels, Eric A', 'Hein, David W', 'Hill, Deirdre A', 'Kelemen, Linda E', 'Lim, Unhee', 'Lynch, Charles F', 'Schenk, Maryjean', 'Wacholder, Sholom', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Hoar Zahm, Shelia', 'Chanock, Stephen J', 'Cerhan, James R', 'Hartge, Patricia']","['Morton LM', 'Wang SS', 'Cozen W', 'Linet MS', 'Chatterjee N', 'Davis S', 'Severson RK', 'Colt JS', 'Vasef MA', 'Rothman N', 'Blair A', 'Bernstein L', 'Cross AJ', 'De Roos AJ', 'Engels EA', 'Hein DW', 'Hill DA', 'Kelemen LE', 'Lim U', 'Lynch CF', 'Schenk M', 'Wacholder S', 'Ward MH', 'Hoar Zahm S', 'Chanock SJ', 'Cerhan JR', 'Hartge P']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Rockville, MD, USA. mortonli@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['N01 PC067010/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 PC067008/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-PC-67009/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 PC065064/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 PC067009/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N02-PC-71105/PC/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmunity', 'Birth Order', 'Body Mass Index', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone', 'Lymphoma, Follicular', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Meat/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",PMC2597610,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51756-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-133587 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 15;112(13):5150-60. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-133587.

These translocations are restricted to an 8.3-kb breakpoint region resulting in fusion of amino terminal MLL sequences in frame to 1 of more than 60 different translocation partners. The translocations consistently delete the plant homeodomain (PHD) fingers and more carboxyl terminal MLL sequences. The function of the PHD fingers is obscure and their specific role in transformation has not been explored. Here we show that inclusion of the PHD fingers in the MLL fusion protein MLL-AF9 blocked immortalization of hematopoietic progenitors. Inclusion of 2 or more PHD fingers reduced association with the Hoxa9 locus and suppressed Hoxa9 up-regulation in hematopoietic progenitors. These data provide an explanation for why MLL translocation breakpoints exclude the PHD fingers and suggest a possible role for these domains in regulating the function of wild-type MLL.,"['Muntean, Andrew G', 'Giannola, Diane', 'Udager, Aaron M', 'Hess, Jay L']","['Muntean AG', 'Giannola D', 'Udager AM', 'Hess JL']","['Department ofPathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, USA.']",['eng'],"['T32 HL007622/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07622/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA92251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA78815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-AF9 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide/genetics', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",PMC2597135,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/01/13 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51819-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-134056 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Dec 1;112(12):4690-3. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-134056.

This study examined the expression and activation of Notch receptors in B-CLL cells and the role of Notch signaling in sustaining the survival of these cells. Our results show that B-CLL cells but not normal B cells constitutively express Notch1 and Notch2 proteins as well as their ligands Jagged1 and Jagged2. Notch signaling is constitutively activated in B-CLL cells, and its activation is further increased in B-CLL cells, which resist spontaneous apoptosis after 24-hour ex vivo culture. Notch stimulation by a soluble Jagged1 ligand increases B-CLL cell survival and is accompanied by increased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (c-IAP2) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression. In contrast, Notch-signaling inhibition by the gamma-secretase inhibitor I (GSI; z-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO) and the specific Notch2 down-regulation by small-interfering RNA accelerate spontaneous B-CLL cell apoptosis. Apoptotic activity of GSI is accompanied by reduction of NF-kappaB activity and c-IAP2 and XIAP expression. Overall, our findings show that Notch signaling plays a critical role in B-CLL cell survival and apoptosis resistance and suggest that it could be a novel potential therapeutic target.","['Rosati, Emanuela', 'Sabatini, Rita', 'Rampino, Giuliana', 'Tabilio, Antonio', 'Di Ianni, Mauro', 'Fettucciari, Katia', 'Bartoli, Andrea', 'Coaccioli, Stefano', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Marconi, Pierfrancesco']","['Rosati E', 'Sabatini R', 'Rampino G', 'Tabilio A', 'Di Ianni M', 'Fettucciari K', 'Bartoli A', 'Coaccioli S', 'Screpanti I', 'Marconi P']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, General Pathology and Immunology Section, University of Perugia, Perugia.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080916,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (JAG1 protein, human)', '0 (JAG2 protein, human)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Jagged-2 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/metabolism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/metabolism', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Jagged-2 Protein', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/02/10 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)37815-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-139725 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2009 Jan 22;113(4):856-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-139725.

NCI-H295R human adrenocortical cells were treated with LIF (0.01-100 ng/ml) for 3-48 h with or without 8-bromo-cAMP (8-Br-cAMP; 1 mM).

LIF also increased 8-Br-cAMP-induced cortisol and DHEA production and STAR mRNA accumulation, while it attenuated 8-Br-cAMP-induced HSD3B2 expression and androstenedione production. It had an additive effect on tumour necrosis factor-induced cortisol production. LIF had no effect on apoptosis, but it increased slightly the number of metabolically active cells (up to 120% of control, P<0.05).

Immobilized FN significantly promoted the proliferation of Nalm-6 cells through the synergistic effects of VLA-4 and VLA-5. Furthermore, FN induced the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) of Nalm-6 cells. The MAPK kinase 1 (MEK1) inhibitor, PD98059, and Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, inhibited the FN-promoted proliferation of Nalm-6 cells. These results demonstrate that the interactions of FN and VLA-4/VLA-5 transmit the growth signals that are mediated through Src family tyrosine kinases and the MAPK cascade in Nalm-6 cells.

The process of immune reconstitution can be dissimilar according to the nature of the disease, type and doses of drugs, and age of the patients. Recently, several studies have examined immune reconstitution in children and young adults after intensive chemotherapy for solid tumours or stem cell transplantation. The aim of the present study is to evaluate immune reconstitution (cellular and humoral) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during the maintenance phase of therapy and to correlate between the complicating infections and the abnormalities in immune system during reconstitution. To achieve this goal, 36 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (24 females and 12 males) in the maintenance phase of therapy with 12 healthy children of matched age and sex served as a control group were recruited in this study. The patients were taken consecutively from the Hematology/Oncology Outpatient Clinic of Mansoura University Children's Hospital (MUCH). They were subjected to thorough history taking, clinical examination and laboratory investigations in the form of: complete blood count, serum creatinine, liver function tests and evaluation of the immune system by estimation of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19 and CD56 (cellular immunity) by flow cytometry and immunoglobulins A, M and G (humoral immunity) at the first and the third month of maintenance therapy. The results of the study documented presence and persistence of leucopenia and lymphopenia during maintenance therapy with decreased medians of CD3, CD4 and CD8 from the first to the third month of therapy and in comparison to the control group. The other markers CD19, CD56, IgA, IgM, IgG and CD4/CD8 ratio showed increasing median from the first to the third month of therapy. Also we detect a significant correlation between infection and CD19 and serum IgM at the first month and between infection and CD19, IgM and CD4/CD8 ratio at the third month of therapy. In conclusion, persistent immunosuppression is documented in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during maintenance therapy. Reconstitution of B lymphocytes and Natural killer cells occurs early while T cell reconstitution shows delayed recovery of both T helper and T suppressor cells. Immunosupression during maintenance therapy has no major clinical impact in terms of increased incidence or severity of systemic infections.","['El-Chennawi, Farha A', 'Al-Tonbary, Youssef A', 'Mossad, Youssef M', 'Ahmed, Mona A']","['El-Chennawi FA', 'Al-Tonbary YA', 'Mossad YM', 'Ahmed MA']","[""Clinical Pathology Department, Immunology Unit, Mansoura University Children's Hospital, Mansoura, Egypt.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*immunology', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/blood', 'Infections/etiology/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*immunology/microbiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,2008/09/18 09:00,2009/03/25 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/102453308X316086 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2008 Aug;13(4):203-9. doi: 10.1179/102453308X316086.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A minority of patients undergo thrombohemorrhagic complications, which might be prevented by cytoreductive treatment in high risk categories. Alkylating agents (ALK) have been demonstrated to increase the risk of acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes in patients with myeloproliferative disorders, whereas the potential oncogenicity of hydroxyurea (HU) remains a matter of debate. In this study, we retrospectively investigated long-term development of hematological and non-hematological second malignancies in 331 patients with ET, analyzing possible associations with chemotherapy treatments. Median follow-up was 108 months. Of the 194 patients who were treated with chemotherapy, 116 (60%) received only HU, 38 (19.5%) only ALK (busulfan or melphalan) and 40 (20.5%) ALK followed by HU. After a median time of 87 months from the diagnosis of ET, 43 patients developed a second malignancy, hematological in 15 and non-hematological in 28, for an overall cumulative incidence of 13%. According to the type of treatment, second malignancies were documented in 11.2% of patients treated with only HU, in 26.3% of patients who received only ALK, and in 25% of those treated with ALK followed by HU.

Inversion at the MYH11 locus is one of the most frequent chromosomal aberrations found in acute myeloid leukemia. We have previously shown that MYH11 mutations occur in human colorectal cancer, and may also be associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. The mutations found in human intestinal neoplasia result in unregulated proteins with constitutive motor activity, similar to the mutant myh11 underlying the zebrafish meltdown phenotype characterized by disrupted intestinal architecture. Recently, MYH1 and MYH9 have been identified as candidate breast cancer genes in a systematic analysis of the breast cancer genome. METHODS: The aim of this study was to investigate the role of somatic MYH11 mutations in two common tumor types; breast and prostate cancers. A total of 155 breast cancer and 71 prostate cancer samples were analyzed for those regions in MYH11 (altogether 8 exons out of 42 coding exons) that harboured mutations in colorectal cancer in our previous study. RESULTS: In breast cancer samples only germline alterations were observed. One prostate cancer sample harbored a frameshift mutation c.5798delC, which we have previously shown to result in a protein with unregulated motor activity. CONCLUSION: Little evidence for a role of somatic MYH11 mutations in the formation of breast or prostate cancers was obtained in this study.","['Alhopuro, Pia', 'Karhu, Auli', 'Winqvist, Robert', 'Waltering, Kati', 'Visakorpi, Tapio', 'Aaltonen, Lauri A']","['Alhopuro P', 'Karhu A', 'Winqvist R', 'Waltering K', 'Visakorpi T', 'Aaltonen LA']","['Department of Medical Genetics and Translational Genome-Scale Biology Research Program, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland. pia.alhopuro@helsinki.fi']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080917,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (MYH11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Exons', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology']",PMC2562392,2008/09/18 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/09/18 09:00'],"['2008/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2008/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-263 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-263 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Sep 17;8:263. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-263.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Imatinib mesylate is potentially teratogenic and its use during pregnancy in humans can lead to abortion or development of fetal abnormalities in nearly 40% of fully reported cases. We report a case of a 28-year-old woman who delivered a healthy child of normal weight after having been treated with imatinib for Ph1-positive CML during the first four months of her pregnancy. She refused advocated interruption and for the rest of the pregnancy was treated with interferon. The treatment was associated with a rapid 2-log increase in the leukemia clone measured by the real-time polymerase chain reaction.

Global inhibition of myeloid Src family kinase (SFK) activity with the broad-spectrum pyrrolo-pyrimidine inhibitor, A-419259, blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis in CML cell lines, suggesting that transformation by Bcr-Abl requires SFK activity. However, the contribution of Hck and other individual SFKs to Bcr-Abl signaling is less clear. Here, we developed an A-419259-resistant mutant of Hck by replacing the gatekeeper residue (Thr-338; c-Src numbering) in the inhibitor-binding site with a bulkier methionine residue (Hck-T338M). This substitution reduced Hck sensitivity to A-419259 by more than 30-fold without significantly affecting kinase activity in vitro. Expression of Hck-T338M protected K-562 CML cells and Bcr-Abl-transformed TF-1 myeloid cells from the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects of A-419259. These effects correlated with persistence of Hck-T338M kinase activity in the presence of the compound, and were accompanied by sustained Erk and Stat5 activation. In contrast, control cells expressing equivalent levels of wild-type Hck retained sensitivity to the inhibitor. We also show for the first time that A-419259 induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in primary CD34(+) CML cells with equal potency to imatinib. These data suggest that Hck has a nonredundant function as a key downstream signaling partner for Bcr-Abl and may represent a potential drug target in CML.","['Pene-Dumitrescu, T', 'Peterson, L F', 'Donato, N J', 'Smithgall, T E']","['Pene-Dumitrescu T', 'Peterson LF', 'Donato NJ', 'Smithgall TE']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA101828-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM077629/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM077629-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM077629/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA101828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080915,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (A 419259)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (HCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insecta', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-hck/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC2738638,2008/09/17 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008330 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.330 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Nov 27;27(56):7055-69. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.330.

Here, we have extended the follow-up to a median of 5 years and have included data on an additional 18 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-two patients, age 42 to 72 years, who had fludarabine-refractory CLL were conditioned with 2 Gy total-body irradiation alone or combined with fludarabine followed by HCT from related (n = 52) or unrelated (n = 30) donors. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) and partial remission were achieved in 55% and 15% of patients, respectively. Higher CR rates were noted after unrelated HCT (67% v 48%). The 5-year incidences of nonrelapse mortality (NRM), progression/relapse, overall survival, and progression-free survival were 23%, 38%, 50%, and 39%, respectively. Among 25 patients initially reported in CR, 8% relapsed and 8% died as a result of NRM, whereas 84% have remained alive and in CR. Among 14 responding patients who were tested and who had molecular eradication of their disease, two died as a result of NRM, two relapsed, and 10 have remained negative. At 5 years, 76% of living patients were entirely well, whereas 24% continued to receive immunosuppression for chronic graft-versus-host disease; the median performance status in each group was 100% and 90%, respectively. Lymphadenopathy > or = 5 cm, but not cytogenetic abnormalities at HCT, predicted relapse. In a risk-stratification model, patients who had lymphadenopathy less than 5 cm and no comorbidities had a 5-year OS of 71%. CONCLUSION: Nonmyeloablative HCT resulted in a median survival of 5 years for patients who had fludarabine-refractory CLL with sustained remissions and in the continued resolution of chronic graft-versus-host disease in surviving patients.","['Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Sandmaier, Brenda M', 'Maris, Michael', 'Shizuru, Judith', 'Maziarz, Richard', 'Agura, Edward', 'Chauncey, Thomas R', 'Pulsipher, Michael A', 'McSweeney, Peter A', 'Wade, James C', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Langston, Amelia', 'Radich, Jerald', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Blume, Karl G', 'Storb, Rainer', 'Maloney, David G']","['Sorror ML', 'Storer BE', 'Sandmaier BM', 'Maris M', 'Shizuru J', 'Maziarz R', 'Agura E', 'Chauncey TR', 'Pulsipher MA', 'McSweeney PA', 'Wade JC', 'Bruno B', 'Langston A', 'Radich J', 'Niederwieser D', 'Blume KG', 'Storb R', 'Maloney DG']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. msorror@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78902/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080915,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",PMC2652085,2008/09/17 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.4757 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4757 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 20;26(30):4912-20. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4757.

In contrast to the more common lymphoblastic lymphoma of T-cell lineage, B-LBL can be an extranodal disease, with a propensity to involve skin and bone. Most reported cases of B-LBL in the skin, a rarity in adults, are manifestations of existing systemic disease. OBSERVATIONS: We report 2 unusual cases of primary cutaneous B-LBL in adults. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies, not previously reported in primary cutaneous B-LBL to our knowledge, demonstrated rearrangement of the MLL gene in one patient and possible hyperdiploidy in the other, both reported in precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Review of the literature identified 13 reported cases of B-LBL occurring primarily in the skin, in addition to our 2 cases. Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma is more common in children and in young adults, with a tropism for the head and neck region. Histologically, B-LBL must be differentiated from other high-grade lymphoid tumors and small ""blue round cell"" tumors. Because of the common absence of mature B-cell markers in immunohistochemical studies and the frequent expression of CD99, B-LBL may present a diagnostic challenge. Although there is a suggestion in a limited number of patients that abbreviated therapy may provide long-term disease control, the risk of relapse remains significant, particularly if a patient's condition is misdiagnosed and the patient is treated as having mature B-cell lymphoma. In the absence of prospective studies for this population, patients with B-LBL are treated currently with intensive acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens.","['Shafer, Danielle', 'Wu, Hong', 'Al-Saleem, Tahseen', 'Reddy, Kavita', 'Borghaei, Hossein', 'Lessin, Stuart', 'Smith, Mitchell']","['Shafer D', 'Wu H', 'Al-Saleem T', 'Reddy K', 'Borghaei H', 'Lessin S', 'Smith M']","['Departments of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Arch Dermatol,Archives of dermatology,0372433,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Back', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Diploidy', 'Forehead', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Scalp', 'Skin/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics/immunology/*pathology']",,2008/09/17 09:00,2008/10/18 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['144/9/1155 [pii]', '10.1001/archderm.144.9.1155 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol. 2008 Sep;144(9):1155-62. doi: 10.1001/archderm.144.9.1155.,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To gain new insights into the structure, function, and regulation of these complexes, we reconstituted them and performed various molecular analyses. We found that BRPF proteins bridge the association of MOZ and MORF with ING5 and EAF6. An N-terminal region of BRPF1 interacts with the acetyltransferases; the enhancer of polycomb (EPc) homology domain in the middle part binds to ING5 and EAF6. The association of BRPF1 with EAF6 is weak, but ING5 increases the affinity. These three proteins form a trimeric core that is conserved from Drosophila melanogaster to humans, although authentic orthologs of MOZ and MORF are absent in invertebrates. Deletion mapping studies revealed that the acetyltransferase domain of MOZ/MORF is sufficient for BRPF1 interaction. At the functional level, complex formation with BRPF1 and ING5 drastically stimulates the activity of the acetyltransferase domain in acetylation of nucleosomal histone H3 and free histones H3 and H4. An unstructured 18-residue region at the C-terminal end of the catalytic domain is required for BRPF1 interaction and may function as an ""activation lid."" Furthermore, BRPF1 enhances the transcriptional potential of MOZ and a leukemic MOZ-TIF2 fusion protein. These findings thus indicate that BRPF proteins play a key role in assembling and activating MOZ/MORF acetyltransferase complexes.","['Ullah, Mukta', 'Pelletier, Nadine', 'Xiao, Lin', 'Zhao, Song Ping', 'Wang, Kainan', 'Degerny, Cindy', 'Tahmasebi, Soroush', 'Cayrou, Christelle', 'Doyon, Yannick', 'Goh, Siew-Lee', 'Champagne, Nathalie', 'Cote, Jacques', 'Yang, Xiang-Jiao']","['Ullah M', 'Pelletier N', 'Xiao L', 'Zhao SP', 'Wang K', 'Degerny C', 'Tahmasebi S', 'Cayrou C', 'Doyon Y', 'Goh SL', 'Champagne N', 'Cote J', 'Yang XJ']","['Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, Quebec H3G 0B1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['64289-2/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada', '87253-1/CAPMC/ CIHR/Canada']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080915,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BRPF1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ING5 protein, human)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6B protein, human)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",PMC2573306,2008/09/17 09:00,2008/11/14 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01297-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01297-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Nov;28(22):6828-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01297-08.

This lowering may result from insufficiency of one of the transcription factors of cd20. Of these, purine-rich box-1 (PU.1) is poorly expressed in CLL. To estimate its weight in CD20 expression, pu.1 cDNA was transfected into CLL B cells and shown to raise the membrane expression of CD20 and to improve the rituximab-induced lysis of transfected cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and all-trans-retinoic acids were not involved in the defective expression of PU.1 or the excessive methylation of the pu.1 gene, because 6 of 14 CLL samples tested were normally methylated. This was confirmed by the failure of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors to restore pu.1 transcription in hypermethylated CLL, and, in fact, the expression of PU.1 was down-regulated by excessive expression of the FMS proto-oncogene-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) receptor. This abnormality is consistent with our finding of elevated levels of Flt3 ligand (FL) in 20 of 23 CLL sera tested. We propose that FL-dependent increased Flt3 signaling prevents the expression of PU.1, which down-regulates that of CD20, and accounts for resistance of leukemic B cells to rituximab-induced lysis.","['Mankai, Amani', 'Bordron, Anne', 'Renaudineau, Yves', 'Martins-Carvalho, Christine', 'Takahashi, Shinichiro', 'Ghedira, Ibtissem', 'Berthou, Christian', 'Youinou, Pierre']","['Mankai A', 'Bordron A', 'Renaudineau Y', 'Martins-Carvalho C', 'Takahashi S', 'Ghedira I', 'Berthou C', 'Youinou P']","['Immunologie et Pathologie Research Unit, Medical School, Brest, France.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC22A2 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Organic Cation Transporter 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Rituximab', 'Trans-Activators/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/biosynthesis/metabolism']",,2008/09/17 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/18/7512 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6446 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Sep 15;68(18):7512-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6446.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we analyzed its influence on hematopoiesis in a mouse model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The isolation of nemorosone was carried out employing the RP-HPLC (reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography) technique. Cytotoxicity was assessed in human leukemia cell lines including parental and chemotherapy-refractory sublines based on the MTT compound. Its effects on the cell cycle were analyzed using FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting) and Western blot techniques. Studies on the drug-induced early apoptotic process were carried out by means of fluorescence microscopy. Major signal transducers and the enzymatic inhibition of immunoprecipitated Akt/PKB were detected by Western blot. Hematopoiesis was analyzed in NMRI nu/nu mice after chronic nemorosone treatment, measuring hematological parameters by conventional laboratory techniques. RESULTS: Nemorosone proved cytotoxic in both parental and chemoresistant leukemia cell lines with IC50 values between 2.10 and 3.10 mg/ml. No cross-resistances could be detected. Cell cycle studies showed apoptosis induction accompanied by an increase in the G0/G1 population in both cell lines studied, whereas a significant decrease in the S-phase was found in Jurkat cells. Nemorosone induced a down-regulation of cyclins A, B1, D1, and E as well as a dephosphorylation of cdc2. Major signal transduction elements such as ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, as well as important oncoproteins such as c-Myb and BCR/ABL were also found down-regulated. The enzymatic activity of immunoprecipitated Akt/PKB was substantially inhibited in vitro. Moreover, subchronic nemorosone treatment induced reversible monocytosis and thrombocytosis in the mouse model examined. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we demonstrate for the first time that nemorosone exerts cytotoxicity in leukemia cells, partly by targeting the Akt/PKB signal transducer, affecting protein levels and cell cycle progression. Finally, in vivo studies suggest that nemorosone significantly affects hematopoiesis in mice.","['Diaz-Carballo, D', 'Malak, S', 'Freistuhler, M', 'Elmaagacli, A', 'Bardenheuer, W', 'Reusch, H P']","['Diaz-Carballo D', 'Malak S', 'Freistuhler M', 'Elmaagacli A', 'Bardenheuer W', 'Reusch HP']","['Abteilung fur Klinische Pharmakologie, Ruhr-Universitat Bochum, Germany. david.diaz-carballo@rub.de']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Benzophenones)', '0 (nemorosone)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzophenones/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Clusia/*chemistry', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,2008/09/17 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.5414/cpp46428 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2008 Aug;46(8):428-39. doi: 10.5414/cpp46428.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, n-alkyl glucopyranosides (hexyl, heptyl, and octyl) completely inhibit ultrasound-induced (1057 kHz) cytolysis (Sostaric, et al. Free Radical Biol. Med. 2005, 39, 1539-1548). The efficacy of protection from ultrasound-induced cytolysis was determined by the n-alkyl chain length of the glucopyranosides, indicating that protection efficacy depended on adsorption of n-alkyl glucopyranosides to the gas/solution interface of cavitation bubbles and/or the lipid membrane of cells. The current study tests the hypothesis that ""sonoprotection"" (i.e., protection of cells from ultrasound-induced cytolysis) in vitro depends on the adsorption of glucopyranosides at the gas/solution interface of cavitation bubbles. To test this hypothesis, the effect of ultrasound frequency (from 42 kHz to 1 MHz) on the ability of a homologous series of n-alkyl glucopyranosides to protect cells from ultrasound-induced cytolysis was investigated. It is expected that ultrasound frequency will affect sonoprotection ability since the nature of the cavitation bubble field will change. This will affect the relative importance of the possible mechanisms for ultrasound-induced cytolysis. Additionally, ultrasound frequency will affect the lifetime and rate of change of the surface area of cavitation bubbles, hence the dynamically controlled adsorption of glucopyranosides to their surface. The data support the hypothesis that sonoprotection efficiency depends on the ability of glucopyranosides to adsorb at the gas/solution interface of cavitation bubbles.","['Sostaric, Joe Z', 'Miyoshi, Norio', 'Cheng, Jason Y', 'Riesz, Peter']","['Sostaric JZ', 'Miyoshi N', 'Cheng JY', 'Riesz P']","['Radiation Biology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. sostaric.2@osu.edu']",['eng'],['Z01 SC006358-24/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080913,United States,J Phys Chem B,The journal of physical chemistry.

Typical JBS features include developmental delay/mental retardation, short stature, congenital heart defects, thrombocytopenia, and characteristic dysmorphic facial features. We report on a family in which a 4-year-old girl as well as her mother and maternal uncle present with subtle features of JBS. Notably, neither thrombocytopenia nor congenital anomalies were detected in this family. Cytogenetic analyses revealed normal karyotypes. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and whole-genome oligonucleotide array CGH analyses, we identified an approximately 5 Mb deletion of the terminal part of chromosome 11q in all the three affected family members. The deletion breakpoint was mapped between 129,511,419 and 129,519,794 bp. This is the smallest deletion reported in a JBS patient. Interestingly, the FLI1 (friend leukemia virus integration 1) hematopoiesis factor gene located approximately 6.5 Mb from 11qter and usually deleted in patients with JBS, is intact. Our data support previous hypotheses that FLI1 haploinsufficiency is responsible for thrombocytopenia in patients with JBS.","['Bernaciak, Joanna', 'Szczaluba, Krzysztof', 'Derwinska, Katarzyna', 'Wisniowiecka-Kowalnik, Barbara', 'Bocian, Ewa', 'Sasiadek, Maria Malgorzata', 'Makowska, Izabela', 'Stankiewicz, Pawel', 'Smigiel, Robert']","['Bernaciak J', 'Szczaluba K', 'Derwinska K', 'Wisniowiecka-Kowalnik B', 'Bocian E', 'Sasiadek MM', 'Makowska I', 'Stankiewicz P', 'Smigiel R']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

Of particular concern is cancer's effect on productivity and work ability, which in turn is important for persons' financial situation, life satisfaction, and social relationships. We explored the extent to which Norwegian cancer survivors stay affiliated to working life compared to the cancer-free population, and quantified cancer-associated earning declines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Logistic regression models were estimated to explore the impact of cancer on employment using register data covering the entire Norwegian population in 2001, 567,000 men and 549,300 women 40-59 years old, of whom 34,000 were diagnosed with cancer. These analyses revealed that a cancer diagnosis was strongly associated with not being employed. Log-linear regression models were used to estimate the effect of cancer on labor earnings in 2001 for those employed. Cancer was associated with a 12% decline in earnings overall. Leukemia, lymphomas, lung, brain, bone, colorectal, and head-and-neck cancer resulted in the largest reductions in employment and earnings. Earning declines were strongly associated with educational level. In addition, linear regression models were used to estimate differentials in earnings before and after cancer. These results accorded well with those from cross-sectional models. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Cancer survivors are less likely to be employed than the cancer-free population, and undertake modifications in their employment, e.g. reduce work-hours or hold lower-wage jobs, which result in reduced earnings. A social class gradient is present and must be addressed to accommodate appropriate intervention from welfare societies.","['Syse, Astri', 'Tretli, Steinar', 'Kravdal, Oystein']","['Syse A', 'Tretli S', 'Kravdal O']","['Cancer Registry of Norway, Montebello, Oslo, Norway. astri.syse@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080613,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adult', 'Educational Status', 'Employment/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Income/statistics & numerical data', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*economics/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Work/*statistics & numerical data']",,2008/09/17 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11764-008-0053-2 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2008 Sep;2(3):149-58. doi: 10.1007/s11764-008-0053-2.

This study describes the characteristics of arm and hand swelling in relation to perceived physical and mental health functioning among breast cancer survivors 9-16 years post-diagnosis who previously participated in a clinical trial coordinated by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB 8541). METHODS: Eligible survivors of CALGB 8541 completed questionnaires assessing demographics, arm/hand swelling, perceived physical functioning, and mental health. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-five women (94% white, mean age = 63, on average 12.4 years post-diagnosis) completed questionnaires (participation rate = 78%). Seventy-five women (31%) reported arm/hand swelling since their surgery. Of these women, 76% reported current swelling and half reported constant swelling, mainly in the upper arm. Swelling was reported as mild or moderate in 88% of the women. Women who reported severe swelling had significantly worse physical functioning and trended toward worse depressive symptoms and poorer mental health (lower mental SF-36 scores) as well. Activity-limiting swelling was also significantly associated with worse physical functioning. Although swelling interfered with wearing clothing (36%) and perceptions about general appearance (32%), only 37% of women sought treatment for swelling. CONCLUSIONS: Arm/hand swelling is a chronic problem for a subgroup of long-term survivors of breast cancer, negatively affecting physical functioning. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Educational efforts are needed as part of a comprehensive survivorship care plan to raise awareness about lymphedema so that survivors may identify this complication, seek treatment early, and potentially improve their physical functioning.","['Oliveri, Jill M', 'Day, Jeannette M', 'Alfano, Catherine M', 'Herndon, James E 2nd', 'Katz, Mira L', 'Bittoni, Marisa A', 'Donohue, Kathleen', 'Paskett, Electra D']","['Oliveri JM', 'Day JM', 'Alfano CM', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Katz ML', 'Bittoni MA', 'Donohue K', 'Paskett ED']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, A356 Starling-Loving Hall, 320 W. 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA026806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180821/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA016450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA79883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA012046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA057707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA004457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA131029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA008025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA045389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA131029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA059518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA011789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AG16602/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA077440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA004326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA041287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA047559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG016602/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA003927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080916,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arm/*physiopathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/epidemiology/physiopathology/*rehabilitation', 'Female', 'Hand/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphedema/*epidemiology/*physiopathology', 'Mental Health/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Motor Activity/*physiology', 'Perception/physiology', 'Prognosis', 'Recovery of Function/physiology', '*Survivors']",PMC3910496,2008/09/17 09:00,2009/02/13 09:00,['2008/09/17 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/13 09:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11764-008-0065-y [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2008 Dec;2(4):233-42. doi: 10.1007/s11764-008-0065-y.

Several important prognostic parameters defining pathogenic and clinical subgroups of CLL have been identified and validated recently. The biological significance of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain variable region gene (IgHV) mutational status and associated ZAP-70 over-expression, CD38 and chromosomal aberrations have enabled to identify patients at high risk for early disease progression and inferior survival. Moreover, studies of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) structure and receptor signalling have been most helpful in revealing some new aspects of the biology of this disease. In particular, the analysis of IG genes has revealed that the expressed IgHV/IgKV/IgLV gene repertoires of CLL cells differ from those of normal B cells. A further unique feature of the CLL IG repertoire is the existence of subsets of cases with ""stereotyped"" BCRs. Accumulating molecular and phenotypic data support the notion that CLL development and evolution is not a simple scholastic event and strongly indicates a role for antigen in driving the cell of origin for at least some subsets of CLL cases.","['Kostareli, Efterpi', 'Smilevska, Tatjana', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Kouvatsi, Anastasia', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles']","['Kostareli E', 'Smilevska T', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Kouvatsi A', 'Anagnostopoulos A']","['Haematology Department and HCT Unit, G.
