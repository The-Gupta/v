This retrospective epidemiological study reviewed 91 children with malignancy over a 5 year period between 2011 and 2015 and analyzed potential risk factors for CLABSI. METHODS: Symptoms, laboratory and microbiology characteristics, subsequent treatment and outcome were recorded and analyzed. All the collected data were processed through SPSS for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Among 40 episodes of CLABSI recorded in 30 patients, the rate of CLABSI was estimated as 2.62 episodes per 1,000 days of central venous catheter (CVC) carriage. Most of the bacterial pathogens isolated in CLABSI episodes were Gram positive, including different strains of staphylococci, while Gram-negative bacteria were involved in 30% of episodes. Invasive mycosis was isolated in 7.5% of episodes, accounting for the highest catheter removal rate. Intensive chemotherapy and prolonged hospitalization proved to be independent risk factors for CVC infection. In children with neutropenia, the risk for CLABSI was also fourfold greater (P = 0.001). Children with leukemia had a fivefold greater risk for CLABSI (P = 0.005). Finally, although 36% of patients received antibiotic lock therapy, in 15% of these patients catheter replacement could not be avoided due to persistent serious infection. CONCLUSIONS: Younger age, neutropenia, hematologic malignancy and longer catheterization are important risk factors for CLABSI, but further research is required for the prevention of catheter-related infection in children with malignancy.",['(c) 2017 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Miliaraki, Marianna', 'Katzilakis, Nikolaos', 'Chranioti, Ioanna', 'Stratigaki, Maria', 'Koutsaki, Maria', 'Psarrou, Maria', 'Athanasopoulos, Emmanouil', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia']","['Miliaraki M', 'Katzilakis N', 'Chranioti I', 'Stratigaki M', 'Koutsaki M', 'Psarrou M', 'Athanasopoulos E', 'Stiakaki E']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University Hospital of Heraklion, University of Crete, Heraklion, Greece.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3343-5110'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bacteremia/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Catheter-Related Infections/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/diagnosis/*etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['catheter-related infection', 'central venous catheter', 'child', 'hematologic neoplasm', 'leukemia']",2017/04/05 06:00,2018/04/10 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2016/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13289 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2017 Jul;59(7):769-775. doi: 10.1111/ped.13289.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to explain the biological and clinical relevance of this epigenetic phenomenon in B-cell neoplasms. RECENT FINDINGS: Here, we summarize new findings demonstrating that B-cell lymphomas display increased DNA methylation heterogeneity compared to their normal counterparts. This plasticity of cytosine methylation manifests both as intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity and is associated with worse prognosis and poor clinical outcome in lymphoma patients. Recent studies of different subtypes of B-cell lymphomas have revealed that epigenetic aberrations and heterogeneous cytosine methylation patterning are common features of all neoplasms derived from B-lymphocytes, irrespective of maturation stage. With regard to mechanisms driving this process, recent reports suggest that cytosine methylation heterogeneity arises through passive and active processes. One factor implicated in active generation of cytosine methylation heterogeneity is activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which mediates DNA methylation changes and introduces epigenetic heterogeneity in normal germinal center B cells, the cells of origin of mature B-cell neoplasms such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. SUMMARY: Understanding the scope and mechanism of epigenetic heterogeneity in cancer is of paramount importance to our understanding of clonal plasticity and treatment responses in B-cell lymphomas.",,"['Dominguez, Pilar M', 'Teater, Matt', 'Shaknovich, Rita']","['Dominguez PM', 'Teater M', 'Shaknovich R']","['aDivisions of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine bDepartments of Physiology and Biophysics, Institute for Computational Biomedicine, Weill Cornell Medicine cDepartment of Pathology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Germinal Center/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2017/04/05 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000348 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):402-408. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000348.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mammals express six main histone methyltransferase (HMT) enzymes that modify H3K4 by monomethylation, dimethylation or trimethylation. Recent studies examine roles of some of these HMTs and their cofactors in hematopoiesis and leukemia. We discuss these emerging studies together with prior embryonic stem data, revealing how these enzymes function. RECENT FINDINGS: Murine models have been employed to conditionally or constitutively knockout HMTs (MLL1/KMT2A, MLL2/KMT2B, MLL3/KMT2C, MLL4/KMT2D, SETD1A/KMT2F and SETD1B/KMT2G) as well as specific domains or partners of these enzymes in normal hematopoietic populations and in the context of hematologic malignancies. These studies demonstrate that global or gene-specific changes in H3K4 modification levels can be attributed to particular enzymes in particular tissues. SUMMARY: Loss-of-function studies indicate largely nonoverlapping roles of the six H3K4 HMTs. These roles are not all necessarily due to differences in enzymatic activity and are not always accompanied by large global changes in histone modification. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in hematologic malignancy are restricted to MLL1 and MLL3/MLL4, but emerging data indicate that SETD1A/SETD1B and MLL2 can be critical in leukemia as well.",,"['Yang, Weiwei', 'Ernst, Patricia']","['Yang W', 'Ernst P']","['aGenetics Program, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire bDepartment of Pediatrics and of Pharmacology, Hematology, Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant Section, University of Colorado, Denver/Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Multigene Family', 'Organ Specificity', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding']",,,2017/04/05 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000346 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):322-328. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000346.,"['R01 HL090036/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK120369/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA224436/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI129426/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 OD019716/OD/NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Histones)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",PMC5603181,['NIHMS892641'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric Germ Cell Tumor With Somatic Malignant Transformation.,388-394,10.1097/MPH.0000000000000823 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Germ cell tumors with somatic malignant transformation (GCT with SMT) are rare in children and poorly described. Data are missing to determine if therapies should target the GCT, the SMT compound, or both simultaneously. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective national study was conducted in the Societe Francaise des cancers de l'Enfant (SFCE) Centers. Medical records from patients aged 0 to 18 years diagnosed with GCT with SMT between 2000 and 2015 were analyzed. Any stages and primary sites were considered as well as synchronous and metachronous cases. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were identified. Thirteen patients had synchronous GCT with SMT. In the latter cases, primaries were ovary (5), mediastinum (3), pineal gland (3), sacrococcyx (1), and parametrium (1). SMT histologies were central primitive neuroectodermal tumor (5), embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (3) or thyroid papillary adenocarcinoma, leukemia, poorly differentiated carcinoma, mixed sarcomas, and miscellaneous histology (1 case each). Chemotherapy was targeted against the GCT (3), the SMT (6), or both components (3). The last patient received surgery exclusively. Partial or complete response to chemotherapy was observed in 5/10 assessable cases: 2/3 patients treated with GCT-dedicated chemotherapy, 3/6 patients treated with SMT-dedicated therapy, and 0/1 treated with combined therapy. In addition, 2 patients with mediastinal GCT primary had metachronous SMT, with acute myeloid leukemia and thyroid papillary adenocarcinoma, 8 months and 8 years, respectively, after the diagnoses of GCT. Two patients (1 synchronous and 1 metachronous) were cured with surgery exclusively. At the end of follow-up, 6 patients died of their disease including all 4 with postsurgical macroscopic residue. CONCLUSIONS: GCT with SMT constitutes a very rare entity in children and adolescents. Surgical removal of the tumor is the cornerstone of the treatment and might be sufficient in selected cases. In the remaining cases, the best management is still unknown and should take into account both components and their respective chemosensitivity.

BACKGROUND: Asparaginase, a primary treatment for the most common childhood cancer, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), is a well-described cause of pancreatitis. Further, pancreatitis is among the most burdensome and common complications of asparaginase treatment and represents a major reason for early-drug termination and inferior outcomes. The literature lacks clarity about the risk factors for AAP, and this knowledge gap has hampered the ability to reliably predict which patients are likely to develop AAP. STUDY: In an expansive screen, 1842 citations were funneled into a review of 59 full articles, of which 10 were deemed eligible based on predetermined inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of the 10 identified studies, only 2 studies showed that children above 10 years of age had a >2-fold risk of AAP compared with younger children. Patients placed in high-risk ALL categories had a greater incidence of pancreatitis in 2 studies. In addition, use of pegylated asparaginase resulted in a higher incidence of AAP in 1 study. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, older age, asparaginase formulation, higher ALL risk stratification, and higher asparaginase dosing appear to play a limited role in the development of AAP.

This study aims to determine clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with isolated del(16q) in MNs in comparison to AMLs with isolated inv(16). Methods: Clinicopathologic features were retrospectively reviewed in 18 MNs with del(16q) and 34 AMLs with inv(16) patients from seven institutions. Results: MNs with del(16q) occurred in elderly patients, often as secondary MNs. Blood monocytes and marrow eosinophils were lower in del(16q) than inv(16). Deletion of CBFB but not CBFB-MYH11 rearrangement was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in 14 of 14 del(16q) patients. The median overall survival was shorter in del(16q) than in inv(16) patients (12 vs 94 months, log rank P = .0002).

Despite extremely aggressive therapy targeting donor T cells, patients with grade III or greater aGVHD of the lower GI tract, who do not respond to therapy with corticosteroids, have a dismal prognosis. Thus, efforts to improve understanding of the function of local immune and non-immune cells in regulating the inflammatory process in the GI tract during aGVHD are needed. Here, we demonstrate, using murine models of allogeneic BMT, that type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in the lower GI tract are sensitive to conditioning therapy and show very limited ability to repopulate from donor bone marrow. Infusion of donor ILC2s was effective in reducing the lethality of aGVHD and in treating lower GI tract disease. ILC2 infusion was associated with reduced donor proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 cells, accumulation of donor myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) mediated by ILC2 production of IL-13, improved GI tract barrier function, and a preserved graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) response.

The objective of this study was to map the prevalence of external ear canal disorders and the pathogens causing otitis externa in stray cats roaming around the region of Ghent, Belgium. Methods One hundred and thirty stray cats were randomly selected during a local trap-neuter-return programme. All cats were European Shorthairs. This study included clinical, otoscopic and cytological evaluation of both external ears of each cat. Prospective data used as parameters in this study included the sex, age and body condition score of each cat, as well as the presence of nasal and/or ocular discharge, and the results of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) Snap tests. Results Remarkably, very few (sub)clinical problems of the external ear canal were found in the stray cat population. Malassezia species was by far the most common organism found in the external ear canals of the 130 stray cats. A total of 96/130 (74%) cats were found to have Malassezia species organisms present in one or both ears based on the cytological examination. No correlation was found between the parameters of sex, age, body condition score, the presence of nasal and/or ocular discharge and FIV and FeLV status, and the presence of parasites, bacteria or yeasts. Conclusions and relevance This study provides more information about the normal state of the external ear canal of stray cats. The ears of most stray cats are relatively healthy. The presence of Malassezia species organisms in the external ear canal is not rare among stray cats.",,"['Bollez, Anouck', 'de Rooster, Hilde', 'Furcas, Alessandra', 'Vandenabeele, Sophie']","['Bollez A', 'de Rooster H', 'Furcas A', 'Vandenabeele S']","['Small Animal Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium.', 'Small Animal Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium.', 'Small Animal Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium.', 'Small Animal Department, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent University, Merelbeke, Belgium.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,IM,"['Animals', 'Belgium/epidemiology', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/microbiology/virology', 'Cats', 'Dermatomycoses/epidemiology/microbiology/veterinary', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Lentivirus Infections/epidemiology/veterinary/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*isolation & purification', 'Malassezia/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Otitis Externa/epidemiology/microbiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/veterinary/virology', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology/veterinary/virology']",,,2017/04/05 06:00,2019/05/28 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1098612X17700808 [doi]'],ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2018 Feb;20(2):149-154. doi: 10.1177/1098612X17700808.

The aim of this randomised clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of supplementation with oral FO for 9 weeks on nutritional parameters and inflammatory nutritional risk in patients with haematological malignancies during the beginning of chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with leukaemia or lymphoma were randomised to the unsupplemented group (UG) (n = 13) or supplemented group (SG) (n = 9). SG received 2 g/day of fish oil for 9 weeks. Nutritional status, serum acute-phase proteins and plasma fatty acids were evaluated before (T0) and after (T1) the intervention period. Data were analysed using two models; model 1, comprising data from all patients included in the study, and model 2, comprising data from UG patients with no increase in the proportions of EPA and DHA in plasma and data from SG patients showing an at least 100% increase in plasma EPA and DHA. RESULTS: SG showed an increased plasma proportion of EPA and DHA in both models. In model 2, C-reactive protein (CRP) and CRP/albumin ratio showed larger reductions in the SG. Overall long-term survival in both models (465 days after the start of the chemotherapy) was higher in the group ingesting fish oil (P < 0.05).

Therefore, no wonder that the heterochromatin condensation state in nuclear segments of mature granulocytes was much larger than in non-segmented nuclei of granulocytic progenitors. On the other hand, the sum of mean diameters of all nuclear segments per cell was close to the mean nuclear diameter of early granulocytic progenitors.

Cytogenetic monitoring was performed by chromosome banding analyses (CBA) of BM cells and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses of peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear CD34+ cells using extended probe panels. Out of 144 patients screened for study enrollment, 24% failed to meet inclusion criteria due to cytogenetic findings. Eighty-seven patients were followed with a median observation time of 30 months. Cytogenetic response detected by FISH and CBA in 74 and 66% of patients, respectively, was predictive for hematologic response as well as of high prognostic relevance. After 2 years, AML rate was 8% for all patients. Karyotype evolution was detected in 21 (FISH)-34% (CBA) of patients associated with significantly shorter AML-free survival. Disease progression was first detectable on the cytogenetic level on average 5-6 months before recurrence of transfusion dependence.

HCT carries the risk of severe complications, while the toxicity profile of dasatinib and nilotinib may lead to adverse reactions affecting the quality of life (QoL). We present the results of observational analysis of CML patients who underwent HCT after exposure to second-generation TKI (TKI2), with respect to their quality of life assessed comparatively after transplantation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eligible subjects included 19 patients. The quality of life and global health assessment were performed with a questionnaire comparing the signs and symptoms present during the TKI2-therapy with those related to post-transplant complications, including psychosocial problems. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Most patients had no/few problems with exhausting activities, no/few difficulties during long-distance walks, and do not/rarely rest in the daytime. Seventeen (89.5%) patients reported at least one symptom related to TKI2-therapy and most of them disappeared after HCT. Thirteen (68.4%) patients noted no serious complication after HCT. Most patients claimed to have a very good QoL and general health compared to the period prior to HCT. We found statistically significant improvement in global health (p = 0.016) and QoL (p = 0.043) after HCT.

Polyethylene glycol-conjugated asparaginase (PEG-ASP) has a lower immunogenicity and is a standard treatment in all pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of PEG-ASP instead of L-ASP as used in the BFM-90 regimen (PEG-ASP-BFM-90) for adult LBL. METHODS: Between June 2012 and July 2015, we treated 30 adult patients with newly diagnosed LBL, using PEG-ASP-BFM-90 in a prospective, multicenter and single-arm clinical study at 5 participating institutions in China. RESULTS: All the 30 patients, including 19 males and 11 females with a median age of 30 (range: 18-62) years, completed 128 times of the PEG-ASP, with the median of 4 (range: 2-6) times. Patients did not receive radiotherapy at this time. The overall response rate was 86.7% (26/30), with 50.0% (15/30) complete response and 36.7% (11/30) partial response. The 3-year overall survival was 46.0% [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 28.2%-64.8%], and the 3-year progression-free survival was 43.0% (95% CI, 25.7%-62.0%). Major adverse events were myelosuppression, reduced fibrinogen, liver dysfunction and digestive tract toxicities. No allergic reaction and no treatment-related mortality or severe complications were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Our clinical data and observed outcomes indicate that 1 dose of PEG-ASP can replace multiple doses of native L-ASP in BFM-90, with predominantly grade 3-4 neutropenia for adult LBL, and no therapy-related deaths. The effect is similar to previous reports of PEG-ASP-containing regimens for adult ALL. Major advantages include less serious allergic reactions, 2-3 weeks of action duration, and convenience for patients and physicians.",,"['Zheng, Wen', 'Ren, Hanyun', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Xue, Mei', 'Zhang, Yongqing', 'Xie, Yan', 'Lin, Ningjing', 'Tu, Meifeng', 'Liu, Weiping', 'Ping, Lingyan', 'Ying, Zhitao', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Deng, Lijuan', 'Wang, Xiaopei', 'Song, Yuqin', 'Zhu, Jun']","['Zheng W', 'Ren H', 'Ke X', 'Xue M', 'Zhang Y', 'Xie Y', 'Lin N', 'Tu M', 'Liu W', 'Ping L', 'Ying Z', 'Zhang C', 'Deng L', 'Wang X', 'Song Y', 'Zhu J']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Air Force General Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100142, China."", ""Department of Hematology, the 309th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing 100091, China."", 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education/Beijing), Department of Lymphoma, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin J Cancer Res,Chinese journal of cancer research = Chung-kuo yen cheng yen chiu,9315242,,,['NOTNLM'],"['PEG-asparaginase', 'lymphoblastic lymphoma', 'treatment']",2017/04/05 06:00,2017/04/05 06:01,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2017.01.08 [doi]', 'cjcr-29-1-zhengwen [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Cancer Res. 2017 Feb;29(1):66-74. doi: 10.21147/j.issn.1000-9604.2017.01.08.,,,PMC5348477,,,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,

Continuation of hormonal intrauterine devices (IUDs) - widely used and highly effective contraceptives that also decrease menstrual flow - is controversial during hematopoietic stem cell transplants (SCTs) due to infectious and vaginal bleeding concerns. CASE REPORT: A 23-year-old nulligravid female was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, positive for FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A and RUNX1, with normal cytogenetics). She elected to retain her existing levonorgestrel-containing IUD during chemotherapy and SCT. During and following treatment, she remained amenorrheic without infection, despite severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Eight months later, she remains in remission without IUD-related complications. DISCUSSION: This is the first report of levonorgestrel IUD retention during hematopoietic SCT. Despite severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, the patient developed neither pelvic infection by retaining her IUD nor significant vaginal bleeding. Future studies are needed to confirm the safety of levonorgestrel IUDs in women undergoing SCT.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Brady, Paula C', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ginsburg, Elizabeth S']","['Brady PC', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ginsburg ES']","[""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, U.S.A. pbrady2@partners.org."", ""Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, U.S.A."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Biology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, U.S.A.""]",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Adult', 'Contraceptive Agents, Female/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gravidity', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Intrauterine Devices, Medicated/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Levonorgestrel/*administration & dosage', 'Menstruation/drug effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*IUD', '*chemotherapy', '*contraception', '*hematopoietic stem cell transplant', '*intrauterine device', '*levonorgestrel', '*menstrual suppression', '*oncofertility']",2017/04/05 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]']","['37/4/1985 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11541 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Apr;37(4):1985-1987. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11541.,,"['0 (Contraceptive Agents, Female)', '5W7SIA7YZW (Levonorgestrel)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to examine if there is a general increased risk of other cancers in colorectal cancer families, which are defined as having two or more cases of colorectal cancer in close relatives. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study used a detailed family history of cancer diagnoses in a cohort of more than 3,000 consecutive colorectal cancer cases. A comparison was made between families with sporadic and those with familial colorectal cancer cases. Detailed morphology data were used to find further support for putative syndromes. RESULTS: There were significantly more non-colorectal cancers in the family history of the familial CRC cases (p<0.001), with significantly more gastric cancers (p<0.001), prostate cancers (p<0.001), urinary bladder cancers (p<0.001) and melanomas (p=0.002), leukaemia/lymphomas (p=0.004), gynaecological cancers (p=0.007) and breast cancers (p=0.023). There was also some support for different morphological profiles for four of the five tested syndromes. CONCLUSION: This study found support for a general increased risk of one or more different cancer syndromes involving families with colorectal cancer and other cancers. Further studies will define the different possible syndromes and determine the genetic background.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Forsberg, Anna', 'Keranen, Anne', 'VON Holst, Susanna', 'Picelli, Simone', 'Papadogiannakis, Nikos', 'Ghazi, Sam', 'Lindblom, Annika']","['Forsberg A', 'Keranen A', 'VON Holst S', 'Picelli S', 'Papadogiannakis N', 'Ghazi S', 'Lindblom A']","['Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Division of Pathology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden annika.lindblom@ki.se.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Aged', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Syndrome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Colorectal cancer', '*familial', '*prevention', '*syndrome']",2017/04/05 06:00,2017/04/14 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['37/4/1831 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11518 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Apr;37(4):1831-1835. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11518.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last five years, the progress in understanding the pathophysiology of this immune based-process helped redefine graft versus host reaction and opened new possibilities for novel preventive and therapeutic approaches. The evolution in the field of immunology widened the horizons for hematopoietic stem cell transplant leading to the availability of different stem cell sources for potential graft and incorporation of novel conditioning regimens. There is conflicting data about the impact of the graft source and the conditioning regimen used in the process of AHSCT on the incidence of aGVHD. Many studies have reported increased risk of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and to a less extent aGVHD with the use of peripheral blood stem cell and bone marrow compared to umbilical cord stem cell. The conditioning regimen, either myeloablative, non-myeloablative or reduced intensity may have different impact on the incidence of GVHD. Several preventive modalities have been adopted by different transplant centers but, to date, there is no standardized regimen. As for treatment, immunosuppression using steroids remains the first line of intervention. Several novel therapeutic options are being investigated for treatment of steroid-refractory aGVHD including the use of mesenchymal stem cells, anti thymocyte globulin and extra corporeal photophoresis. This review discusses the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical features, and advances in the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of aGVHD.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Nassereddine, Samah', 'Rafei, Hind', 'Elbahesh, Ehab', 'Tabbara, Imad']","['Nassereddine S', 'Rafei H', 'Elbahesh E', 'Tabbara I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington DC, U.S.A.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington DC, U.S.A.', 'Clearview Cancer Institute, Huntsville, AL, U.S.A.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and GW Cancer Center, George Washington University Medical Faculty Associates, Washington DC, U.S.A. itabbara@mfa.gwu.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/*prevention & control', 'Humans']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute graft versus host disease', '*allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*bone marrow transplantation', '*leukemia', '*review']",2017/04/05 06:00,2017/04/14 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2017/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['37/4/1547 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11483 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Apr;37(4):1547-1555. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11483.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this proliferative burst, expression of the Rag genes is transiently repressed to prevent the generation of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks in cycling large pre-B cells. The Rag genes are then reexpressed in small, resting pre-B cells for immunoglobulin light chain gene rearrangement. We previously identified c-Myb as a repressor of Rag transcription during clonal expansion using Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed B cells. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms by which c-Myb achieved precise spatiotemporal repression of Rag expression remained obscure. Here, we identify two mechanisms by which c-Myb represses Rag transcription. First, c-Myb negatively regulates the expression of the Rag activator Foxo1, an activity dependent on M303 in c-Myb's transactivation domain, and likely the recruitment of corepressors to the Foxo1 locus by c-Myb. Second, c-Myb represses Rag transcription directly by occupying the Erag enhancer and antagonizing Foxo1 binding to a consensus forkhead site in this cis-regulatory element that we show is crucial for Rag expression in Abelson pre-B cell lines. This work provides important mechanistic insight into how spatiotemporal expression of the Rag genes is tightly controlled during B lymphocyte development to prevent mistimed dsDNA breaks and their deleterious consequences.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Timblin, Greg A', 'Xie, Liangqi', 'Tjian, Robert', 'Schlissel, Mark S']","['Timblin GA', 'Xie L', 'Tjian R', 'Schlissel MS']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA.', 'Office of the President, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California, USA markschl@umich.edu.', 'Office of the President, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2271-0196'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'CRISPR-Cas Systems/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Forkhead Box Protein O1/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell development', '*V(D)J recombination', '*c-Myb', '*chromatin remodeling', '*transcriptional regulation']",2017/04/05 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/04/05 06:00'],"['2016/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00437-16 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00437-16 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2017 May 31;37(12). pii: MCB.00437-16. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00437-16.

It is unknown if intermittent interruption of ibrutinib therapy contributes to altered clinical outcomes. We therefore evaluated the effect of ibrutinib dose adherence on patient outcomes in the phase 3 RESONATE trial. The overall mean dose intensity (DI) was 95% with median treatment duration of approximately 9 months. Pharmacokinetic assessment of ibrutinib exposure at 420-mg dose suggested similar exposure regardless of patient weight or age. As assessed by independent review committee, patients with higher DI experienced longer median progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those with lower DI regardless of del17p and/or TP53 status. Of 79 patients requiring a drug hold, treatment was restarted at the original dose in 73 (92%) patients. Mean duration of a missed-dose event was 18.7 days (range, 8-56).

Mouse embryonic DRG cells expressed pluripotency-related transcription factors [octamer-binding transcription factor 4, SRY (sex determining region Y)-box containing gene (Sox) 2, and Nanog] that play essential roles in maintaining the pluripotency of ES cells. Furthermore, the DRG cells differentiated into ectoderm-, mesoderm- and endoderm-derived cells. In addition, these cells produced primordial germ cell-like cells and embryoid body-like spheres. We also showed that the combination of leukemia inhibitor factor/bone morphogenetic protein 2/fibroblast growth factor 2 effectively promoted maintenance of the pluripotency of the PSCs present in DRGs, as well as that of neural crest-derived stem cells (NCSCs) in DRGs, which were previously shown to be present there. Furthermore, the expression of pluripotency-related transcription factors in the DRG cells was regulated by chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7 and Sox10, which are indispensable for the formation of NCSCs, and vice versa. These findings support the possibility that PSCs in mouse embryonic DRGs are NCSCs.",['(c) 2017.

Since there is a latency period between initial FA exposure and the development of leukemia, the subsequent impact of FA on hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells (HSCs/HPCs) in post-exposure stage is crucial for a deep understanding of FA-induced hematotoxicity. BALB/c mice were exposed to 3mg/m(3) FA for 2weeks, mimicking occupational exposure, and were monitored for another 7days post-exposure. Meanwhile, we included benzene (BZ) as a positive control, separately and together with FA because co-exposure occurs frequently. After 7-day recovery, colonies of progenitors for CFU-GM and BFU-E, and nucleated bone marrow cells in FA-exposed mice were comparable to controls, although they were significantly reduced during exposure. Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in CFU-GM and BFU-E from FA-exposed mice were higher than controls, although the increase in 8-OHdG was not significant. Granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) level in the FA group was lower than controls, but the expression level for the receptor was not upregulated. It suggests that HSCs/HPCs in FA-exposed mice respond to a small amount of GM-CSF and proliferate rapidly, which may cause a possible risk of expansion of abnormal stem/progenitor cell clones. FA co-exposure with BZ was more potent for promoting CFU-GM formation and inducing ROS in BFU-E and 8-OHdG in CFU-GM during the post-exposure period. The compensation of myeloid progenitors with elevated ROS and 8-OHdG may lead to a risk of transforming normal HSCs/HPCs to leukemic stem/progenitor cells. Thus, co-exposure may pose a greater leukemia risk.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the perioperative outcomes of THA in patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample identified patients who underwent THA from 2000 to 2011 (n = 2,864,412). Patients diagnosed with any hematologic malignancy (n = 18,012) were further stratified into Hodgkin disease (n = 786), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 5062), plasma cell dyscrasias (n = 2067), leukemia (n = 5644), myeloproliferative neoplasms (n = 3552), and myelodysplastic syndromes (n = 1082). Propensity matching for demographics, hospital characteristics, and comorbidities identified 17,810 patients with any hematologic malignancy and 17,888 controls; additional matching was performed to compare hematologic malignancy subtypes with controls. Multivariate regression was used to analyze surgical and medical complications, length of stay (LOS), and costs. RESULTS: Compared to controls, hematologic malignancies increased the risk of any surgery-related complication (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; P < .0001) and any general medical complication (OR, 1.47; P < .0001). Additionally, hematologic malignancies were associated with an increase in LOS (0.16 days; P = .004) and increased costs ($1,101; P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing THA have an increased risk of perioperative complications, longer LOS, and higher costs. The risk quantification for adverse perioperative outcomes in association with increased cost may help to design different risk stratification and reimbursement methods in such populations.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

In the presence of methylene blue (MB) as an intercalator, the hybridization of QDs-(N)DNA with the target BCR/ABL fusion gene (complementary DNA), brings the MB (acceptor) at close proximity of the QDs (donor), leading to FRET upon photoexcitation of the QDs. The enhancement in the emission intensity of MB was used to follow up the hybridization, which was linearly proportional to concentration of the target complementary DNA in a range from 1.0 x 10(-9) to 1.25 x 10(-7) M.

Excluding smudge cells from the manual differential count (MDIFF), a common laboratory practice, yields unreliable results and consequently necessitates performing the MDIFF testing on an albuminized blood smear. Objective: To assess the reliability of counting smudge cells as lymphocytes in the MDIFFs on nonalbuminized smears and automated differentials (ADIFFs) as a substitute for MDIFFs. Methods: We compared corresponding results of MDIFFs on nonalbuminized smears vs MDIFFs on albuminized smears (group A, n = 82), ADIFFs vs MDIFFs on nonalbuminized smears (group B, n = 68), and ADIFF vs MDIFFs on albuminized smears (group C, n = 50). Smudge cells on the nonalbuminized smears were counted as lymphocytes. We focused on 2 white blood cell types: neutrophils and lymphocytes. Results: Respective means for % lymphocytes and % neutrophils were 83.2 vs 83.2 and 14.0 vs 13.6 for Group A, 75.0 vs 77.0 and 20.2 vs 19.8 for Group B, and 76.1 vs 79.3 and 18.7 vs 17.4 for Group C. Respective correlation coefficients for % lymphocytes and % neutrophils were 0.92 and 0.94 for group A, 0.94 and 0.97 for group B, and 0.88 and 0.92 for group C. Conclusion: Counting smudge cells as lymphocytes on nonalbuminized blood smears yielded reliable MDIFF results. Reportable ADIFF results were generated by the analyzer on 73% of the specimens, of which 93% were reliable.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017. All rights reserved.

However, problems of T-depleted transplants are rejection, slow recovery of the immune system and high incidence of relapse of leukemia and myeloma. The major problem of allogeneic transplantation is the separation of a graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effect from GVHD.

Bosutinib (Bosu), a SRC inhibitor, has already been applied to the treatment of human chronic myelogenous leukemia and also has been assessed its safety in dogs. AIM: The aim of this study was to clarify a novel anti-tumour mechanism of Bosu in canine and human melanoma cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The canine and human melanoma cells were treated with Bosu and its effects were evaluated by the cell viability, the protein expression levels such as caspase-3 and LC3, Annexin V/Propidium iodide staining, and confocal immunostaining. RESULTS: Bosu induced the massive caspase-independent cell death, and blocked autophagy flux, which resulted from lysosomal dysfunction. Lysosomal dysfunction caused by Bosu was due to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), which resulted in the release of lysosomal hydrolases including cathepsin B. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bosu induces the cell death through induction of LMP in melanoma cells and is a promising therapeutic agent for treatment of melanoma in both dogs and humans.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Noguchi, S', 'Shibutani, S', 'Fukushima, K', 'Mori, T', 'Igase, M', 'Mizuno, T']","['Noguchi S', 'Shibutani S', 'Fukushima K', 'Mori T', 'Igase M', 'Mizuno T']","['Laboratory of Veterinary Radiology, Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Biomedical Science Center for Translational Research, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Hygiene, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Clinical Oncology, Faculty of Applied Biological Sciences, Gifu University, Gifu, Japan.', 'The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Biomedical Science Center for Translational Research, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0915-4829'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dog Diseases/drug therapy', 'Dogs', 'Lysosomes/*drug effects', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/veterinary', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['SRC inhibitor', 'blockage of autophagy flux', 'caspase-independent cell death', 'cathepsin B', 'lysosomal membrane permeabilization', 'melanoma']",2017/04/04 06:00,2018/08/28 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vco.12312 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2018 Mar;16(1):69-76. doi: 10.1111/vco.12312.

The presence of the most frequent alteration, the P2RY8/CRLF2 fusion, was shown to be associated with a high relapse incidence in children treated according to ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) protocols, which is poorly understood. Moreover, the frequency of other alterations has not been systematically analyzed yet. PROCEDURE: CRLF2 mRNA expression and potential genetic aberrations causing a CRLF2 high expression were prospectively assessed in 1,105 patients treated according to the Associazione Italiana Ematologia Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP)-BFM ALL 2009 protocol. Additionally, we determined copy number alterations in selected B-cell differentiation genes for all CRLF2 high-expressing pB-ALL cases, as well as JAK2 and CRLF2 mutations. RESULTS: A CRLF2 high expression was detected in 26/178 (15%) T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cases, 21 of them (81%) had been stratified as high-risk patients by treatment response. In pB-ALL, a CRLF2 high expression was determined in 91/927 (10%) cases; the P2RY8/CRLF2 rearrangement in 44/91 (48%) of them, supernumerary copies of CRLF2 in 18/91 (20%), and, notably, the IGH/CRLF2 translocation was detected in 16/91 (18%). Remarkably, 7 of 16 (44%) patients with IGH/CRLF2 translocation had already relapsed. P2RY8/CRLF2- and IGH/CRLF2-positive samples (70 and 94%, respectively) were characterized by a high frequency of additional deletions in B-cell differentiation genes such as IKZF1 or PAX5. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that this high frequency of genetic aberrations in the context of a high CRLF2 expression could contribute to the high risk of relapse in P2RY8/CRLF2- and IGH/CRLF2-positive ALL.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Schmah, Juliane', 'Fedders, Birthe', 'Panzer-Grumayer, Renate', 'Fischer, Susanna', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Dagdan, Elif', 'Bens, Susanne', 'Schewe, Denis', 'Moericke, Anja', 'Alten, Julia', 'Bleckmann, Kirsten', 'Siebert, Reiner', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Cario, Gunnar']","['Schmah J', 'Fedders B', 'Panzer-Grumayer R', 'Fischer S', 'Zimmermann M', 'Dagdan E', 'Bens S', 'Schewe D', 'Moericke A', 'Alten J', 'Bleckmann K', 'Siebert R', 'Schrappe M', 'Stanulla M', 'Cario G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", ""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel & University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",['NOTNLM'],"['CRLF2', 'IGH/CRLF2', 'P2RY8/CRLF2', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'prognosis']",2017/04/04 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26539 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26539.

In this study, the infection characteristics were determined and risk factors analyzed based on the Taiwan Pediatric Oncology Group (TPOG) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) protocol. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed fever events during chemotherapy in 252 patients treated during two consecutive clinical trials at a single institution between 1997 and 2012. Patients were classified as standard, high, and very high risk by treatment regimen according to the TPOG definitions. We analyzed the characteristics and risk factors for infection. RESULTS: Fever occurred in 219 patients (86.9%) with a mean of 2.74 episodes per person. The fever events comprised 64% febrile neutropenia, 39% clinically documented infections, and 44% microbiologically documented infections. The microbiologically documented infections were mostly noted during the induction phase and increased in very high risk patients (89 vs. 24% and 46% in standard-risk and high-risk patients, respectively). Younger age and higher risk (high-risk and very high risk groups) were risk factors for fever and microbiologic and bloodstream infections. Female gender and obesity were additive risk factors for urinary tract infection (odds ratios = 3.52 and 3.24, P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Infections developed primarily during the induction phase, for which younger age and higher risk by treatment regimen were risk factors. Female gender and obesity were additive risk factors for urinary tract infection.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Meng-Ju', 'Chang, Hsiu-Hao', 'Yang, Yung-Li', 'Lu, Meng-Yao', 'Shao, Pei-Lan', 'Fu, Chun-Min', 'Chou, An-Kuo', 'Liu, Yen-Lin', 'Lin, Kai-Hsin', 'Huang, Li-Min', 'Lin, Dong-Tsamn', 'Jou, Shiann-Tarng']","['Li MJ', 'Chang HH', 'Yang YL', 'Lu MY', 'Shao PL', 'Fu CM', 'Chou AK', 'Liu YL', 'Lin KH', 'Huang LM', 'Lin DT', 'Jou ST']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Febrile Neutropenia/chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Obesity', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', '*Urinary Tract Infections/chemically induced/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'child', 'infection', 'risk factors']",2017/04/04 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2016/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26535 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26535.

M4eo comprises a distinct morphology compared to M4 without eosinophilia (M4eo-) and therefore may be indicative for a different pathogenesis. PROCEDURES: Morphology and cytogenetic/molecular analyses of a Dutch cohort of pediatric acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML-M4) patients were performed and studied in order to analyze the association between the presence of eosinophilia morphology (M4eo+), inv(16)/t(16;16) (inv(16)+), clinical features, and outcome. RESULTS: Of the 119 included patients with available combined morphological and cytogenetic results, 60% had M4eo- without inv(16) (inv(16)-), 10% had M4eo-/inv(16)+, 13% had M4eo+/inv(16)-, and 17% had M4eo+/inv(16)+. M4eo+ was significantly associated with the presence of inv(16)/t(16;16) (P < 0.001). Patients with M4eo+ had no significantly superior outcome compared with patients with M4eo-, whereas patients with inv(16)+ had significantly superior probabilities of event-free survival and probabilities of overall survival compared with patients without inv(16)-. Patients with M4eo+/inv(16)+ had no significantly better outcome than those with M4eo-/inv(16)+. CONCLUSION: The prognostically favorable impact of distinct morphology with eosinophilia probably relies on its association with inv(16)/t(16;16). Simultaneous presence of both eosinophilia and inv(16) was not associated with superior outcome in our study. These results may be relevant for risk-group classification and risk-group adapted treatment and underline the importance of accurate cytogenetic analysis.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Klein, Kim', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Bank, Ingrid E M', 'Beverloo, H Berna', 'Zwaan, C Michel', 'Kaspers, Gertjan L']","['Klein K', 'de Haas V', 'Bank IEM', 'Beverloo HB', 'Zwaan CM', 'Kaspers GL']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Cardiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus University Medical Center/Dutch Working Group Hemato-oncological Genome Diagnostics, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Eosinophilia/genetics/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', '*Registries', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['M4eo', 'acute myelomonocytic leukemia', 'eosinophilia', 'inv(16)/t(16;16)', 'pediatric AML']",2017/04/04 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/03 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26512 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26512.

Eight of 10 patients with molecular relapse eventually progressed to hematological relapse, although most were treated with immunological intervention by aggressive discontinuation of immunosuppressive therapy or donor lymphocyte infusion. Among these 12 patients, four of seven patients that obtained MRD(neg) CR following post-transplant chemotherapy remain alive and disease-free after their second HSCT; however, all five patients who underwent a second HSCT in non-CR died of disease or treatment-related complications. As the FCM-MRD monitoring system used in the current study was probably not sensitive enough to detect MRD, which could be elucidated by immunological intervention, more sensitive diagnostic tools are mandatory for post-transplant MRD monitoring.

We aim to study the genomics of endometrial receptivity in IF patients under controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) during which ET is generally practised in IVF. METHOD OF STUDY: Endometrial gene expression profiling in IF patients (n=10) and oocyte donors (n=8) were compared during window of implantation under COS by microarray. Enrichment analysis of microarray data was performed to determine dysregulated pathways. Microarray results were validated by real-time PCR. Localization of genes related to immune response (progestagen-associated endometrial protein (PAEP), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interleukin-6 signal transducer (IL6ST) was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The gene ontology, pathway analysis and enrichment mapping revealed significant downregulation in activation and regulation of immune and inflammation response in IF patients under COS. The lower expression of PAEP, LIF and IL6ST in cases compared to controls by real time and immunohistochemistry suggests the functional importance of these genes. CONCLUSION: Importance of immune and inflammatory response in endometrial receptivity adds on to the current knowledge of gene expression profile in IF under COS. The panel of genes involved in these pathways would be useful in determining further line of treatment for IF during IVF.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Fli1 deficiency accelerates early steps of angiogenesis, including detachment of pre-existing pericytes and extracellular matrix degradation by endothelial proteinases, but the impact of Fli1 deficiency on the other steps of angiogenesis has not been investigated. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of Fli1 deficiency on migration, proliferation, cell survival and tube formation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs). HDMECs transfected with FLI1 siRNA exhibited a greater migratory property in scratch assay and transwell migration assay and a higher proliferation rate in BrdU assay than HDMECs transfected with non-silencing scrambled RNA. In flow cytometry-based apoptosis assay, FLI1 siRNA-transduced HDMECs revealed the decreased number of annexin and propidium iodide-double-positive apoptotic cells compared with control cells, reflecting the promotion of cell survival. On the other hand, tubulogenic activity on Matrigel was remarkably suppressed in Fli1-deficient HDMECs relative to control cells. These results indicate that Fli1 deficiency promotes migration, proliferation and cell survival, while abating tube formation of endothelial cells, suggesting that Fli1 deficiency is potentially attributable to the development of both proliferative obliterative vasculopathy (occlusion of arterioles and small arteries) and destructive vasculopathy (loss of small vessels) characteristic of SSc vasculopathy.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Familial CLL is defined as more than one case of CLL among blood relatives, a phenomenon reported in approximately 5%-10% of all CLL patients. OBJECTIVE: Given the known predisposition of CLL among Ashkenazi Jews, we studied the features of familial CLL in an Israeli population. METHODS: This is a retrospective study, in which we reviewed the demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of a total of 332 patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma. RESULTS: Familial CLL was recorded in 41 cases (12.3%) of the patients. The age at diagnosis was younger in patients with familial CLL (by almost 3.5 years). Familial CLL was strongly associated with Ashkenazi Jewish origin. Patients with familial CLL more commonly presented with higher hemoglobin and lower serum beta-2-microglobulin levels. No significant differences were detected between sporadic and familial CLL in disease stage, time to treatment, second cancers, or overall survival. CONCLUSION: Familial cases of CLL in an Israeli population show a disproportionate ethnic distribution toward Jews of Ashkenazi origin. The clinical characteristics and the overall outcome are not substantially different from sporadic cases.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Among 267 consecutive patients with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined PV, 55 (21%) patients displayed an AMC of >/=1 x 10(9) /L and 18 (7%) an AMC of >/=1.5 x 10(9) /L. In general, PV patients with monocytosis were significantly older and displayed higher frequencies of leukocytosis (81% vs. 50% at AMC >/=1 x 10(9) /L) and TET2/SRSF2 mutations (57%/29% vs. 19%/1% at AMC >/= 1.5 x 10(9) /L). In univariate analysis, AMC >/=1.5 x 10(9) /L adversely affected overall (OS; P = .004; HR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4-4.8) and myelofibrosis-free (MFFS; P = .02; HR 4.4, 95% CI 1.3-15.1) survival; during multivariable analysis, significance was borderline sustained for OS (P = .05) and MFFS (P = .06). Other independent risk factors for OS included unfavorable karyotype (P = .02, HR 3.39, 95% CI 1.17-9.79), older age (P < .0001, HR 3.34 95% CI 1.97-5.65), and leukocytosis >/=15 x 10(9) /L (P = .004, HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.26-3.29). In conclusion, in the current study, we encountered a higher than expected prevalence of monocytosis in patients with PV and the mutation profile and age distribution of PV patients with monocytosis is akin to those of patients with CMML and might partly contribute to their worse prognosis.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Barraco, Daniela', 'Cerquozzi, Sonia', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M', 'Lasho, Terra', 'Finke, Christy', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Barraco D', 'Cerquozzi S', 'Gangat N', 'Patnaik MM', 'Lasho T', 'Finke C', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Pardanani A', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6768-8987', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6998-662X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*blood/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera/*blood/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24740 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Jul;92(7):640-645. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24740.

Yet, it is unknown whether hyperleukocytosis still retains prognostic value for AML patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Furthermore, it is unknown whether hyperleukocytosis holds prognostic significance when modern molecular markers such as FLT3-ITD and NPM1 are accounted for. To determine whether hyperleukocytosis is an independent prognostic factor influencing outcome in transplanted AML patients we performed a retrospective analysis using the registry of the acute leukemia working party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation. A cohort of 357 patients with hyperleukocytosis (159 patients with white blood count [WBC] 50 K-100 K, 198 patients with WBC >/= 100 K) was compared to 918 patients without hyperleukocytosis. Patients with hyperleukocytosis were younger, had an increased rate of favorable risk cytogenetics, and more likely to be FLT3 and NPM1 mutated. In multivariate analysis, hyperleukocytosis was independently associated with increased relapse incidence (hazard ratio [HR] of 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14-2.12; P = .004), decreased leukemia-free survival (HR of 1.38, 95% CI, 1.07-1.78; P = .013), and inferior overall survival (HR of 1.4, 95% CI, 1.07-1.84; P = .013).

METHODS: A retrospective analyzed was performed to compare the outcome of 71 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk Dynamic International Prognosis Scoring System+ (DIPSS+) primary (PMF) or secondary (SMF) myelofibrosis with an indication of ASCT as they ultimately underwent the procedure (n=34) or not (n=37). RESULTS: Five-year overall survival (OS) was not statistically different between both groups (allograft: 52% vs no allograft: 34%, P=.12). However, progression to myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia at 5 years was significantly lower in transplanted patients (14% vs 50%, P=.01). In univariate analysis, 5-year OS was significantly higher for transplanted vs non-transplanted patients with unfavorable karyotype (75% vs 0%, P=.001), SMF (71% vs 20%, P=.001) or high DIPSS+ score (46% vs 15%, P=.03). There was also a trend for better 5-year OS in allografted patients with high JAK2V617F burden (>65%) (75% vs 8%, P=.07). Interestingly, the survival of patients who did not proceed to ASCT was dramatically increased by the use of ruxolitinib.

The aim of this study was to derive a novel once-daily intravenous (IV) busulfan dosing nomogram for pediatric patients undergoing HSCT using a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model. A population PK analysis was performed using 2183 busulfan concentrations in 137 pediatric patients (age: 0.6-22.2 years), who received IV busulfan once-daily for 4 days before undergoing HSCT. Based on the final population PK model, an optimal once-daily IV busulfan dosing nomogram was derived. The percentage of simulated patients achieving the daily target area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) by the new nomogram was compared with that by other busulfan dosing regimens including the FDA regimen, the EMA regimen, and the empirical once-daily regimen without therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). A one-compartment open linear PK model incorporating patient's body surface area, age, dosing day, and aspartate aminotransferase as a significant covariate adequately described the concentration-time profiles of busulfan. An optimal dosing nomogram based on the PK model performed significantly better than the other dosing regimens, resulting in >60% of patients achieving the target AUC while the percentage of patients exceeding the toxic AUC level was kept <25% during the entire treatment period. A novel once-daily busulfan dosing nomogram for pediatric patients undergoing HSCT is useful for clinicians, particularly in a setting where TDM service is not readily available or to optimize the dose on day 1.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Rhee, Su-Jin', 'Lee, Ji Won', 'Yu, Kyung-Sang', 'Hong, Kyung Taek', 'Choi, Jung Yoon', 'Hong, Che Ry', 'Park, Kyung Duk', 'Shin, Hee Young', 'Song, Sang Hoon', 'Kang, Hyoung Jin', 'Lee, Howard']","['Rhee SJ', 'Lee JW', 'Yu KS', 'Hong KT', 'Choi JY', 'Hong CR', 'Park KD', 'Shin HY', 'Song SH', 'Kang HJ', 'Lee H']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Seoul National University College of Medicine and Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Transdisciplinary Studies, Graduate School of Convergence Science and Technology, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4010-0837'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24734 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Jul;92(7):607-613. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24734.

In this phase 1 study, we investigated the safety and efficacy of AMG 900, an orally administered, highly potent, selective, small-molecule inhibitor of both Aurora kinase A and B, in patients with AML . Patients with pathologically documented AML who either declined standard treatments or had relapsed from or were refractory to previous therapies were enrolled. Two every-2-week dose-escalation schedules using a modified 3 + 3 + 3 design were evaluated AMG 900 given daily for 4 days with 10 days off (4/10 schedule), and AMG 900 given daily for 7 days with 7 days off (7/7 schedule). Thirty-five patients were enrolled at 9 different dose levels: 22 patients on the 4/10 schedule (doses from 15 to 100 mg daily), and 13 patients on the 7/7 schedule (doses from 30 to 50 mg daily). Both schedules were tolerated; nausea (31%), diarrhea (29%), febrile neutropenia (29%), and fatigue (23%) were the most common treatment-related adverse events. Three patients (9%) achieved complete response with incomplete count recovery. Patients with higher baseline expression of a set of specific pathway-related genes (BIRC5, AURKA, TTK, CDC2, and CCNB1) were more likely to respond in an exploratory biomarker analysis. AMG 900 was tolerated in a general AML population, and pathway-specific biomarkers identified a potential target population. Future research efforts will be directed toward further exploration of biomarkers of response and combination of AMG 900 with other anticancer agents.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Schuster, Michael W', 'Jain, Nitin', 'Advani, Anjali', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Gamelin, Erick', 'Rasmussen, Erik', 'Juan, Gloria', 'Anderson, Abraham', 'Chow, Vincent F', 'Friberg, Gregory', 'Vogl, Florian D', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Schuster MW', 'Jain N', 'Advani A', 'Jabbour E', 'Gamelin E', 'Rasmussen E', 'Juan G', 'Anderson A', 'Chow VF', 'Friberg G', 'Vogl FD', 'Sekeres MA']","['Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Medical Hematology/Oncology Stony Brook University School of Medicine, Stony Brook, New York, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Research and Development, Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, California, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Aurora Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Biomarkers', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Phthalazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24736 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Jul;92(7):660-667. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24736.

Few effective therapies are available for lower risk MDS patients, especially after the failure of hypomethylating agents. MDS progenitor cells are dependent on the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) for survival, which makes it an attractive therapeutic target. As a proteosomal inhibitor, bortezomib is thought to have inhibitory activity against NF-kappaB. We designed a proof-of-principle study of subcutaneous (SC) bortezomib in lower risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kappaB activation in their bone marrow. Fifteen patients were treated, their median age was 71 (range 56-87), 33% were low and 67% int-1 by IPSS, median number of prior therapies was 2, all patients were transfusion dependent. Baseline median pp65 percentage was 31% and 11 patients had evidence of ring sideroblasts (RS). SC bortezomib was safe, well tolerated with no excess toxicity. Three patients out of the 15 (20%) had evidence of response with hematologic improvement (HI-E). Bortezomib caused a decrease in pp65 levels in 7 out of 13 evaluable patients (54%, P = .025). Of interest, unexpectedly, we observed a significant decrease in RS in 7 out of 10 (70%) evaluable patients during treatment. In conclusion, this study suggests that NF-kappaB activation, measured by pp65 levels, may be a useful biomarker in MDS. Bortezomib is safe in this patient population but has modest clinical activity. The role of the proteasome in the genesis of RS needs further study.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Daher, May', 'Hidalgo Lopez, Juliana Elisa', 'Randhawa, Jasleen K', 'Jabbar, Kausar Jabeen', 'Wei, Yue', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Hearn, Katherine', 'Estrov, Zeev', 'Reyes, Steven', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos E', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Daher M', 'Hidalgo Lopez JE', 'Randhawa JK', 'Jabbar KJ', 'Wei Y', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Borthakur G', 'Kadia T', 'Konopleva M', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Hearn K', 'Estrov Z', 'Reyes S', 'Bueso-Ramos CE', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Division of Cancer Medicine, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Texas, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6026-8397', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1670-6513', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Banding', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/07/29 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24746 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Jul;92(7):674-682. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24746.

Due to the lack of CMML-specific clinical trials, the impact of these agents in the natural history of CMML is not fully understood. We present the largest retrospective series of CMML (n = 151) treated with HMA. Mean age at diagnosis was 69 years (range 50-88). According to the CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS): 17 (15%) were low-risk, 45 (39%) intermediate-1 risk, 42 (36%) intermediate-2, and 12 (10%) high-risk. 35 (23%) patients received single agent azacitidine, 73 (48%) single agent decitabine, and 43 (29%) combinations. With a median follow-up of 17 months, overall response rate (ORR) was 75%, with 41% achieving complete response (CR). Median overall survival (OS) was 24 months (95%CI: 20-28) and event-free survival 14 months (95%CI: 11-17). By multivariate analysis, age < 70 years, higher levels of hemoglobin, absence of blast in peripheral blood and lower CPSS cytogenetic risk predicted for better OS. CR was significantly higher in those patients treated with decitabine (58.3%) when compared with azacitidine (20.6%) (P < .001). 13 patients (9%) received allo-SCT after a median of 4 cycles of HMA. 66 patients (50%) had HMA failure: 26 primary (34%) and 50 secondary (66%), including 35 (46%) that transformed to AML.

We describe transplant outcomes in 42 patients reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) registry who underwent allo-HSCT for aCML between 1997 and 2006. Median age was 46 years. Median time from diagnosis to transplant was 7 months. Disease status was first chronic phase in 69%. Donors were human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings in 64% and matched unrelated (MUD) in 36%. A reduced intensity conditioning was employed in 24% of patients. T-cell depletion was applied in 87% and 26% of transplants from MUD and HLA-identical siblings, respectively. According to the EBMT risk-score, 45% of patients were 'low-risk', 31% 'intermediate-risk' and 24% 'high-risk'. Following allo-HSCT, 87% of patients achieved complete remission. At 5 years, relapse-free survival was 36% and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 24%, while relapse occurred in 40%. Patient age and the EBMT score had an impact on overall survival. Relapse-free survival was higher in MUD than in HLA-identical sibling HSCT, with no difference in NRM.

This unit describes a protocol for determining DNA ploidy in fixed samples with simultaneous surface immunophenotyping. It is an easy method for simultaneous 6- to 8-color immunophenotyping and DNA content analysis using FxCycle Violet (FCV; DAPI) dye. This protocol is a one-step modification of routine multicolor immunophenotyping that includes surface staining followed by fixation and then DNA staining with FCV. It utilizes mature lymphocytes from the sample as an internal control for determination of DNA index. It is a sensitive method that allows DNA-ploidy determination and cell cycle analysis in a rare tumor population as low as 100 events, as well as DNA ploidy determination in various subsets of hematopoietic cells in the same sample based on their immunophenotype.

The proposed testing procedures employ maximum-type statistics and the parametric bootstrap techniques to compute the critical values. Different from the existing tests that heavily rely on the structural conditions on the unknown covariance matrices, the proposed tests allow general covariance structures of the data and therefore enjoy wide scope of applicability in practice. To enhance powers of the tests against sparse alternatives, we further propose two-step procedures with a preliminary feature screening step.

Through extensive numerical experiments on synthetic data sets and an human acute lymphoblastic leukemia gene expression data set, we illustrate the performance of the new tests and how they may provide assistance on detecting disease-associated gene-sets.

Determining when to use empiric anti-VRE antibiotic therapy in this population remains a clinical challenge. Methods.: A single-center cohort representing 664 admissions for induction or hematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) from 2006 to 2014 was selected. We derived a prediction score using risk factors for VRE BSI and evaluated the model's predictive performance by calculating it for each of 16232 BSI at-risk inpatient days. Results.: VRE BSI incidence was 6.5% of admissions (2.7 VRE BSI per 1000 BSI at-risk days). Adjusted 1-year mortality and length of stay were significantly higher in patients with VRE BSI. VRE colonization (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 8.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.4-20.6; P < .0001), renal insufficiency (aOR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.0-5.8; P = .046), aminoglycoside use (aOR = 4.7; 95% CI = 2.2-9.8; P < .0001), and antianaerobic antibiotic use (aOR = 2.8; 95% CI = 1.3-5.8; P = .007) correlated most closely with VRE BSI. A prediction model with optimal performance included these factors plus gastrointestinal disturbance, severe neutropenia, and prior beta-lactam antibiotic use. The score effectively risk-stratified patients (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.79-0.89). At a threshold of >/=5 points, per day probability of VRE BSI was increased nearly 4-fold. Conclusions.: This novel predictive score is based on risk factors reflecting a plausible pathophysiological model for VRE BSI in patients with hematological malignancy. Integrating VRE colonization status with risk factors for developing BSI is a promising method of guiding rational use of empiric anti-VRE antimicrobial therapy in patients with hematological malignancy. Validation of this novel predictive score is needed to confirm clinical utility.","['(c) The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious', 'Diseases Society of America.

The study included 8,383 ALL cases diagnosed at age </=19 years in 2000-2010. Census tract-level composite SEP index in quintiles was assigned based on residence at the time of diagnosis. Incidence rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals associated with SEP and race/ethnicity, adjusted for sex, age, and year of diagnosis, were estimated using Poisson regression models. The incidence rate of childhood ALL was negatively associated with SEP among Hispanics but was positively associated among children of other races/ethnicities. As compared with the lowest SEP, the adjusted incidence rate ratios for children with the highest SEP were 1.29 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.15, 1.44) for non-Hispanic whites, 1.67 (95% CI: 1.20, 2.34) for non-Hispanic blacks, 1.57 (95% CI: 1.17, 2.09) for Asians/Pacific Islanders, 2.33 (95% CI: 0.93, 5.83) for American Indians/Alaska Natives, and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.60, 0.81) for Hispanics. The findings of a reverse association in Hispanics need to be confirmed and further explained in future studies using different measures of SEP.","['(c) The Author 2017.

It binds to its cellular partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif, which folds upon binding into an alpha helix. We have applied a structure-based coarse-grained model, with an explicit Debye-Huckel charge model, to probe the importance of electrostatic interactions both in the early and the later stages of this model coupled folding and binding process. This model was carefully calibrated with the experimental data on helical content and affinity, and shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. We find that intramolecular electrostatic interactions influence the unbound states of PUMA only marginally. Our results further suggest that intermolecular electrostatic interactions, and in particular non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in formation of the initial encounter complex. We are able to reveal the binding mechanism in more detail than is possible using experimental data alone however, and in particular we uncover the role of non-native electrostatic interactions. We highlight the potential importance of such electrostatic interactions for describing the binding reactions of IDPs.

How STAT5 mediates this effect is unclear. Here we found that activation of STAT5 worked together with defects in signaling components of the precursor to the B cell antigen receptor (pre-BCR), including defects in BLNK, BTK, PKCbeta, NF-kappaB1 and IKAROS, to initiate B-ALL. STAT5 antagonized the transcription factors NF-kappaB and IKAROS by opposing regulation of shared target genes. Super-enhancers showed enrichment for STAT5 binding and were associated with an opposing network of transcription factors, including PAX5, EBF1, PU.1, IRF4 and IKAROS.

Using mice and zebrafish as model systems, we showed that SMARCD2 controls early steps in the differentiation of myeloid-erythroid progenitor cells. In vitro, SMARCD2 interacts with the transcription factor CEBPvarepsilon and controls expression of neutrophil proteins stored in specific granules.

Here we show that granulocyte development requires SMARCD2, a subunit of ATP-dependent SWI/SNF (BAF) chromatin-remodeling complexes. Smarcd2-deficient mice fail to generate functionally mature neutrophils and eosinophils, a phenotype reminiscent of neutrophil-specific granule deficiency (SGD) in humans, for which loss-of-function mutations in CEBPE (encoding CEBPvarepsilon) have been reported. SMARCD2-containing SWI/SNF complexes are necessary for CEBPvarepsilon transcription factor recruitment to the promoter of neutrophilic secondary granule genes and for granulocyte differentiation. The homologous SMARCD1 protein (63% identical at the amino acid level) cannot replace the role of SMARCD2 in granulocyte development. We find that SMARCD2 functional specificity is conferred by its divergent coiled-coil 1 and SWIB domains. Strikingly, both CEBPE and SMARCD2 loss-of-function mutations identified in patients with SGD abolish the interaction with SWI/SNF and thereby secondary granule gene expression, thus providing a molecular basis for this disease.",,"['Priam, Pierre', 'Krasteva, Veneta', 'Rousseau, Philippe', ""D'Angelo, Giovanni"", 'Gaboury, Louis', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Lessard, Julie A']","['Priam P', 'Krasteva V', 'Rousseau P', ""D'Angelo G"", 'Gaboury L', 'Sauvageau G', 'Lessard JA']","['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Leukemia Cell Bank of Quebec, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Muscle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2016/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['ng.3812 [pii]', '10.1038/ng.3812 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 2017 May;49(5):753-764. doi: 10.1038/ng.3812.

We hypothesized that improvements in outcomes in adult AML may be further achieved by increased anthracycline dose during consolidation therapy. Patients and Methods Patients with AML in complete remission after induction therapy were randomly assigned to receive two cycles of consolidation therapy with cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days, etoposide 75 mg/m(2) daily for 5 days, and idarubicin 9 mg/m(2) daily for either 2 or 3 days (standard and intensive arms, respectively). The primary end point was leukemia-free survival (LFS). Results Two hundred ninety-three patients 16 to 60 years of age, excluding those with core binding factor AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia, were randomly assigned to treatment groups (146 to the standard arm and 147 to the intensive arm). Both groups were balanced for age, karyotypic risk, and FLT3-internal tandem duplication and NPM1 gene mutations. One hundred twenty patients in the standard arm (82%) and 95 patients in the intensive arm (65%) completed planned consolidation ( P < .001). Durations of severe neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were prolonged in the intensive arm, but there were no differences in serious nonhematological toxicities. With a median follow-up of 5.3 years (range, 0.6 to 9.9 years), there was a statistically significant improvement in LFS in the intensive arm compared with the standard arm (3-year LFS, 47% [95% CI, 40% to 56%] v 35% [95% CI, 28% to 44%]; P = .045). At 5 years, the overall survival rate was 57% in the intensive arm and 47% in the standard arm ( P = .092). There was no evidence of selective benefit of intensive consolidation within the cytogenetic or FLT3-internal tandem duplication and NPM1 gene mutation subgroups. Conclusion An increased cumulative dose of idarubicin during consolidation therapy for adult AML resulted in improved LFS, without increased nonhematologic toxicity.",,"['Bradstock, Kenneth F', 'Link, Emma', 'Di Iulio, Juliana', 'Szer, Jeff', 'Marlton, Paula', 'Wei, Andrew H', 'Enno, Arno', 'Schwarer, Anthony', 'Lewis, Ian D', ""D'Rozario, James"", 'Coyle, Luke', 'Cull, Gavin', 'Campbell, Phillip', 'Leahy, Michael F', 'Hahn, Uwe', 'Cannell, Paul', 'Tiley, Campbell', 'Lowenthal, Ray M', 'Moore, John', 'Cartwright, Kimberly', 'Cunningham, Ilona', 'Taper, John', 'Grigg, Andrew', 'Roberts, Andrew W', 'Benson, Warwick', 'Hertzberg, Mark', 'Deveridge, Sandra', 'Rowlings, Philip', 'Mills, Anthony K', 'Gill, Devinder', 'Bardy, Peter', 'Campbell, Lynda', 'Seymour, John F']","['Bradstock KF', 'Link E', 'Di Iulio J', 'Szer J', 'Marlton P', 'Wei AH', 'Enno A', 'Schwarer A', 'Lewis ID', ""D'Rozario J"", 'Coyle L', 'Cull G', 'Campbell P', 'Leahy MF', 'Hahn U', 'Cannell P', 'Tiley C', 'Lowenthal RM', 'Moore J', 'Cartwright K', 'Cunningham I', 'Taper J', 'Grigg A', 'Roberts AW', 'Benson W', 'Hertzberg M', 'Deveridge S', 'Rowlings P', 'Mills AK', 'Gill D', 'Bardy P', 'Campbell L', 'Seymour JF']","[""Kenneth F.

In mice, LIF receptor expression (LIFR) is largely restricted to the uterine luminal epithelium (LE). LIF, secreted from the endometrial glands (GEs), binds to the LIFR, activating the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activation of transcription (STAT) 3 (Jak-Stat3) signaling pathway in the LE. JAK-STAT activation converts the LE to a receptive state so that juxtaposed blastocysts begin to implant. To specifically delete the LIFR in the LE, we derived a line of mice in which Cre recombinase was inserted into the endogenous lactoferrin gene (Ltf-Cre). Lactoferrin expression in the LE is induced by E2, and we demonstrate that Cre recombinase activity is restricted to the LE and GE. To determine the requirement of the LIFR in implantation, we derived an additional mouse line carrying a conditional (floxed) Lifrflx/flx gene. Crossing Ltf-Cre mice with Lifrflx/flx mice generated Lifrflx/Delta:LtfCre/+ females that were overtly normal but infertile. Many of these females, despite repeated matings, did not become pregnant. Unimplanted blastocysts were recovered from the Lifrflx/Delta:LtfCre/+ uteri and, when transferred to wild-type recipients, implanted normally, indicating that uterine receptivity rather than the embryo's competency is compromised. The loss of Lifr results in both the failure for STAT3 to translocate to the LE nuclei and a reduction in the expression of the LIF regulated gene Msx1 that regulates uterine receptivity. These results reveal that uterine expression of the LIFR is essential for embryo implantation and further define the components of the LIF signaling pathway necessary for effective implantation.",,"['Cheng, JrGang', 'Rosario, Gracy', 'Cohen, Tatiana V', 'Hu, Jianbo', 'Stewart, Colin L']","['Cheng J', 'Rosario G', 'Cohen TV', 'Hu J', 'Stewart CL']","['Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702.', 'Institute of Medical Biology, 138648 Singapore.', 'Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702.', 'Cancer and Developmental Biology Laboratory, Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute at Frederick, Frederick, Maryland 21702.', 'Institute of Medical Biology, 138648 Singapore.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Animals', 'Embryo Implantation/*genetics', 'Embryo Loss/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Organ Specificity/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['3077227 [pii]', '10.1210/en.2017-00103 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 2017 Jun 1;158(6):1916-1928. doi: 10.1210/en.2017-00103.,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)']",PMC5460932,,,,,,,['Endocrinology. 2017 Jun 1;158(6):1575-1576.

Azacitidine (AZA) is increasingly used prior to HSCT, however in Europe it is only approved for patients who are not eligible for HSCT. Patients and methods: We conducted a phase II multicenter study to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of HSCT after treatment with AZA in 70 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 19 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). After a median of four cycles (range 1-11): 24% of patients achieved complete remission, 14% partial remission, 8% hematologic improvement, 32% had stable and 22% progressive disease. Ten patients discontinued treatment before the planned four cycles, due to an adverse event in nine cases. Results: A HSC donor was identified in 73 patients, and HSCT was performed in 54 patients (74% of patients with a donor). Main reasons for turning down HSCT were lack of a donor, an adverse event, or progressive disease (9, 12, and 16 patients, respectively). At a median follow-up of 20.5 months from enrolment, response to AZA was the only independent prognostic factor for survival. Compared to baseline assessment, AZA treatment did not affect patients' comorbidities at HSCT: the HCT-CI remained stable in 62% patients, and worsened or improved in 23% and 15% of patients, respectively. Conclusions: Our study shows that HSCT is feasible in the majority of patients with HR-MDS/AML/CMML-2 after AZA treatment. As matched unrelated donor was the most frequent source of donor cells, the time between diagnosis and HSCT needed for donor search could be 'bridged' using azacitidine. These data show that AZA prior to HSCT could be a better option than intensive chemotherapy in higher-risk MDS. The trial has been registered with the EudraCT number 2010-019673-1.","['(c) The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the', 'European Society for Medical Oncology.

As several lines of evidence suggest that interferon gamma (IFNgamma) production in CML patients might have a central role in the response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy, we analyzed if IFNgamma modulates BCL6 expression in CML cells. Although separate IFNgamma or IM treatment only slightly upregulated BCL6 expression, combined treatment induced remarkable BCL6 upregulation in CML lines and primary human CD34+ CML stem cells. We proved that during combined treatment, inhibition of constitutive signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5 activation by IM allowed the specific enhancement of the STAT1 dependent, direct upregulation of BCL6 by IFNgamma in CML cells. By using colony-forming assay, we found that IFNgamma enhanced the ex vivo colony or cluster-forming capacity of human CML stem cells in the absence or presence of IM, respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of the transcriptional repressor function of BCL6 in the presence of IM and IFNgamma almost completely blocked the cluster formation of human CML stem cells. On the other hand, by using small interfering RNA knockdown of BCL6, we demonstrated that in an IM-treated CML line the antiapoptotic effect of IFNgamma was independent of BCL6 upregulation. We found that IFNgamma also upregulated several antiapoptotic members of the BCL2 and BIRC gene families in CML cells, including the long isoform of MCL1, which proved to be essential for the antiapoptotic effect of IFNgamma in an IM-treated CML line.

The choice between high-dose therapy with autologous HCT and allogeneic HCT with reduced-intensity conditioning remains controversial in patients with relapsed lymphoma. We retrospectively analyzed incidence and risk factors for the development of t-AML/MDS in lymphoma patients treated with autologous or allogeneic HCT. A total of 13 810 lymphoma patients who received autologous (n=9963) or allogeneic (n=3847) HCT between 1985 and 2012 were considered. At a median overall survival (OS) of 52 and 46 months in autologous and allogeneic HCT groups, respectively, lymphoma patients receiving autologous HCT (1.38% at 3 years after autologous HCT) had a significant risk for developing t-AML/MDS compared to allogeneic HCT (0.37% at 3 years after allogeneic HCT, P<0.001). Significant risk factors for the development of t-AML/MDS after autologous and allogeneic HCT were high-stage risk at HCT (P=0.04) or secondary malignancies (P<0.001) and receiving cord blood stem cell (P=0.03) or involved field radiotherapy (P=0.002), respectively. Strategies that carefully select lymphoma patients for autologous HCT, by excluding lymphoma patients with high-stage risk at HCT, may allow the identification of individual lymphoma patients at particular high risk for t-AML/MDS.",,"['Yamasaki, S', 'Suzuki, R', 'Hatano, K', 'Fukushima, K', 'Iida, H', 'Morishima, S', 'Suehiro, Y', 'Fukuda, T', 'Uchida, N', 'Uchiyama, H', 'Ikeda, H', 'Yokota, A', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Yamaguchi, H', 'Kuroda, J', 'Nakamae, H', 'Adachi, Y', 'Matsuoka, K-I', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Atsuta, Y', 'Suzumiya, J']","['Yamasaki S', 'Suzuki R', 'Hatano K', 'Fukushima K', 'Iida H', 'Morishima S', 'Suehiro Y', 'Fukuda T', 'Uchida N', 'Uchiyama H', 'Ikeda H', 'Yokota A', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Yamaguchi H', 'Kuroda J', 'Nakamae H', 'Adachi Y', 'Matsuoka KI', 'Nakamura Y', 'Atsuta Y', 'Suzumiya J']","['Department of Hematology and Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Haematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Rinku General Medical Center, Izumisano, Japan.', 'Division of Cell Therapy, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, Toyoake, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Kyoto Daiichi Hospital, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Chiba Aoba Municipal Hospital, Chiba, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City University Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Japan Community Health Care Organization Kobe Central Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan.', 'Third Department of Internal of Medicine, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Ube, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine and Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Haematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allografts', 'Autografts', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2018/03/23 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/26 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt201752 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2017.52 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Jul;52(7):969-976. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2017.52.

One hundred and four patients (52 cases with cytogenetic relapse and 52 controls without relapse) with chronic-phase CML on imatinib therapy and have completed 5 years of follow-up were enrolled. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped; C1236T, C3435T, G2677T/A in MDR1 gene and A6986G in CYP3A5 gene, using PCR-RFLP method and validated by direct gene sequencing. Imatinib trough levels were measured using LC-MS/MS. Patients with CC genotype for MDR1-C1236T polymorphism were at significantly higher risk for cytogenetic relapse [OR =4.382, 95% CI (1.145, 16.774), p = .022], while those with TT genotype for MDR1-C3435T polymorphism had significantly lower risk of relapse [OR =0.309, 95% CI (0.134, 0.708), p = .005]. Imatinib trough levels were lower in patients with relapse compared to those without relapse (1551.4 +/- 1324.1 vs. 2154.2 +/- 1358.3 ng/mL; p = .041).

We have previously demonstrated the induction of apoptosis by esculetin on NB4 human leukaemia cells by an ill-defined mechanism related to ROS levels. In this work, we analyze the effect of the simultaneous treatment with esculetin and two oxidants to observe the early events in the mechanism of esculetin-induced apoptosis. Our results show that, from the early time of 15 min, esculetin acts synergistically with H2O2 to decrease cell viability and metabolic activity and to increase apoptosis in NB4 cells. In contrast, the early oxidative effects of t-BHP are neutralised by esculetin, protecting human leukaemia NB4 cells from apoptosis. Esculetin seems to restrict the increase in peroxides caused by H2O2 or t-BHP in the time interval analyzed. These results contribute to a better understanding of the cytotoxic effect caused by esculetin on NB4 cells. At the same time, the early neutralisation of exogenous oxidants could be of interest to prevent diseases related to oxidative stress imbalance.",,"['Rubio, Virginia', 'Garcia-Perez, Ana I', 'Tejedor, M Cristina', 'Herraez, Angel', 'Diez, Jose C']","['Rubio V', 'Garcia-Perez AI', 'Tejedor MC', 'Herraez A', 'Diez JC']","['Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, 28871 Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, 28871 Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, 28871 Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, 28871 Madrid, Spain.', 'Unidad de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Departamento de Biologia de Sistemas, Universidad de Alcala, Alcala de Henares, 28871 Madrid, Spain.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9900-6845', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6435-505X']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry/toxicity', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Umbelliferones/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide/chemistry/toxicity']",,,2017/04/04 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2017/9491045 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2017;2017:9491045. doi: 10.1155/2017/9491045.

Although no microorganisms were isolated, the patient recovered with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Since that date, she has presented multiple episodes of pneumonia and recurrent episodes of bronchospasm. At 1 year 5 months of age, the patient began with recurrent episodes of oropharyngeal, vaginal, and skin candidiasis, which improved transiently after using oral azole drugs. At 2.5 years of age, she was admitted with lupus-like syndrome, including serositis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and positive antinuclear (1:80) and dsDNA (1:10) autoantibodies. Available immunologic testing was not contributory. Imaging studies revealed bilateral ethmoidal sinusitis and mild hepatomegaly. Bone marrow analysis did not showed evidence of leukemia or myelodysplasia, while renal biopsy concluded mild mesangial proliferation.

They are an excellent instrument for regenerative treatment and co-culture with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this experimental study, K562 cell lines were either treated with butyric acid and co-cultured with MSCs, or cultivated in a conditioned medium from MSCs plus butyric acid for erythroid differentiation. We used the trypan blue dye exclusion assay to determine cell counts and viability in each group. For each group, we separately assessed erythroid differentiation of the K562 cell line with Giemsa stain under light microscopy, expression of specific markers of erythroid cells by flowcytometry, and erythroidspecific gene expressions by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: There was enhandced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells with butyric acid compared to the K562 cell line co-cultured with MSCs and butyric acid. Erythroid differentiation of the K562 cell line cultivated in conditioned medium with butyric acid was higher than the K562 cell line co-cultured with MSCs and butyric acid, but less than K562 cell line treated with butyric acid only. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that MSCs significantly suppressed erythropoiesis. Therefore, MSCs would not be a suitable optimal treatment strategy for patients with erythroid leukemia.",,"['Saleh, Mahshid', 'Shamsasanjan, Karim', 'Movassaghpour, Ali Akbari', 'Akbarzadehlaleh, Parvin', 'Molaeipour, Zahra']","['Saleh M', 'Shamsasanjan K', 'Movassaghpour AA', 'Akbarzadehlaleh P', 'Molaeipour Z']","['Hematology Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacutical Biotechnology, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Erythroid Differentiation', 'K562 Cells', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells']",2017/04/04 06:00,2017/04/04 06:01,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2016/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2016.4133 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2017 Apr-Jun;19(1):127-136. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2016.4133.

Plasma exchange (PEX) with or without steroids constitutes standard first-line therapy with rituximab typically reserved for refractory cases. Therapies beyond rituximab lack strong evidence for routine use. Recently, bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor used commonly in patients with multiple myeloma, was shown to induce remission in patients with refractory TTP. Here, we report a case of severe, relapsed TTP that was refractory to PEX, steroids, and rituximab that underwent remission following three cycles of bortezomib. We discuss the salient features of our case, the mechanism of action of bortezomib, and the very few other similar reports that exist in the literature.

A meta-analysis is generally acknowledged as one of the best methods for secondary research, and so it was applied in this study with the aim of elucidating how the NQO1 C609T and C465T polymorphisms are related to the risk of AL. METHODS: Relevant studies were searched in the PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, and Wanfang databases, and the obtained data were analyzed using Stata (version 12.1). The allele-contrast model was applied, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate relationship strengths. Meta-regression was used to identify sources of heterogeneity, and subgroup analyses were conducted. Publication bias was analyzed using funnel plots, with the trim-and-fill method used to analyze the effect of publication bias on pooled results. In addition, sensitivity analysis, the fail-safe number method, and cumulative analysis by publication year were performed to measure the stability of the obtained results. RESULTS: This meta-analysis included 28 relevant studies involving 5,953 patients and 8,667 controls. Overall, the C609T polymorphism was associated with the risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; OR =1.18, 95% CI =1.00-1.39, P=0.05). Meanwhile, race was found to be a potential source of heterogeneity for the relationship between the C609T polymorphism and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) risk, and the subgroup analysis identified the C609T polymorphism as a risk factor for AML in Asians (OR =1.34, 95% CI =1.03-1.74, P=0.03). The number of studies about C465T polymorphism was too small to pool the data. CONCLUSION: There are increased risks of ALL in all subjects and of AML in Asians for carriers of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism. Further studies are needed to verify the associations of the C465T polymorphism with the risk of AL.",,"['He, Hairong', 'Zhai, Xiaoyu', 'Liu, Xiaomin', 'Zheng, Jie', 'Zhai, Yajing', 'Gao, Fan', 'Chen, Yonghua', 'Lu, Jun']","['He H', 'Zhai X', 'Liu X', 'Zheng J', 'Zhai Y', 'Gao F', 'Chen Y', 'Lu J']","['Clinical Research Center.', ""Clinical Research Center; College of Pharmacy, Xi'an Medical University."", 'Dialysis Department of Nephrology Hospital.', 'Clinical Research Center.', ""Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University."", 'Clinical Research Center.', ""School of Public Health, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."", 'Clinical Research Center.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'NQO1', 'polymorphism']",2017/04/04 06:00,2017/04/04 06:01,['2017/04/04 06:00'],"['2017/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S132503 [doi]', 'ott-10-1793 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Mar 23;10:1793-1801. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S132503. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5370065,,20170323,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,

However, very few TKIs completely eradicate the leukemic clone and persistence of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) remains challenging, warranting new, distinct targets for improved treatments. We demonstrated that the scaffold protein AHI-1 is highly deregulated in LSCs and interacts with multiple proteins, including Dynamin-2 (DNM2), to mediate TKI-resistance of LSCs. We have now demonstrated that the SH3 domain of AHI-1 and the proline rich domain of DNM2 are mainly responsible for this interaction. DNM2 expression was significantly increased in CML stem/progenitor cells; knockdown of DNM2 greatly impaired their survival and sensitized them to TKI treatments.

ABT-737 competitively binds to surface hydrophobic grooves of anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family, counteracting their protective effect. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation and/or induce apoptosis in a number of different types of cancer cells. The present study was designed to analyze the combined effects of ABT-737 and resveratrol on human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of these agents against MOLT-4 leukemia cells was determined using the Coulter electrical impedance method, comet assay, and flow cytometry, light microscopy and western blot techniques. The results are the first data showing that ABT-737 combined with resveratrol markedly decreased the cell viability, increased DNA damage, caused the cell cycle perturbation, and synergistically enhanced apoptosis in MOLT-4 cells, when compared to the data obtained after application of the single agent. Moreover, the simultaneous treatment of leukemia cells with ABT-737 and resveratrol resulted in a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential, an increase of p53 protein level and up-regulation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. The obtained data indicate that the combination of ABT-737 and resveratrol is a promising approach for acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment that should be further explored.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years, several studies were conducted to evaluate the safety of TKIs discontinuation. We performed a systematic review of the literature to determine the incidence of CML relapse, to identify possible factors relapse rates and to evaluate the long-term safety in CML patients with stable undetectable BCR-ABL transcript level who discontinued TKIs. DESIGN: Studies evaluating TKIs discontinuation in CML patients with undetectable BCR-ABL transcript level were identified by electronic search of MEDLINE and EMBASE database until May 2015. Weighted mean proportion and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of CML relapse was calculated using a fixed-effects and a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: Fifteen cohort studies, for a total of 509 patients, were included. Nine studies were at low-risk of bias. All 15 studies included only patients on imatinib. Overall weighted mean molecular relapse rate of CML was 51% (95% CI 44-58%; I(2) = 55). Weighted mean molecular relapse rate at 6-month follow-up was 41% (95% CI 32-51%; I(2) = 78). Eighty percent of molecular relapses occurred in the first 6 months. All 509 patients were alive at 2-year follow-up and only one patient (0.8%, 95% CI 0.2-1.8%; I(2) = 0) has progressed to a blastic crisis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that imatinib discontinuation is feasible for the majority of CML patients with stable undetectable BCR-ABL transcript level. Approximately 50% of patients remain therapy-free after imatinib discontinuation. Restarting TKIs therapy was followed by a very high rate of molecular response, with no deaths 2 years after discontinuation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Cells expressing Jak2-V617F exhibit constitutive STAT, MAPK, and PI3K signalling, and constitutive association of the multi-site docking protein Gab1 to PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Here, we demonstrate the crucial role of Gab1 for the proliferation of Jak2-V617F-positive human erythroleukaemia (HEL) cells. In Jak2-V617F-expressing cells Gab1 is constitutively phosphorylated by Erk1/2 on serine residue 552, which regulates binding to PIP3. Additionally, Gab1 is constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine residue 627. Tyrosine 627 is a SHP2 binding site and required for Gab1-dependent Erk1/2 activation. As previously shown, Jak2-V617F-dependent Erk1/2 and PI3K activation act synergistically on the proliferation of Jak2-V617F-positive cells. Here, we examined whether constitutive membrane association of Gab1 explains cytokine-independent Gab1 phosphorylation in Jak2-V617F-expressing cells. Although we could demonstrate Jak2-V617F-dependent constitutive serine 552 and tyrosine 627 phosphorylation of Gab1, interestingly, both phosphorylations do not require binding of Gab1 to PIP3 at the plasma membrane. Instead, we observed a constitutive interaction of Gab1 with the erythropoietin receptor in Jak2-V617F-expressing cells, which depends on Janus kinase activity. Thus, constitutive Gab1-dependent signalling in Jak2-V617F-expressing cells does not occur due to the constitutive association of Gab1 with PIP3 at the plasma membrane.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

Here, we further increased tumor selectivity by simplification of the molecule through replacing the 4-methoxyphenyl moiety by an alkyl chain. Several 2-amino-3-methylcarboxylate thiophene derivatives containing at C-5 an alkyl group consisting of at least 6 (hexyl) to 9 (nonyl) carbon units showed pronounced anti-proliferative activity in the mid-nanomolar range with 500- to 1000-fold tumor cell selectivity. The compounds preferentially inhibited the proliferation of T-lymphoma CEM and Molt/4, prostate PC-3, kidney Caki-1 and hepatoma Huh-7 tumor cells, but were virtually inactive against other tumor cell lines including B-lymphoma Raji and cervix carcinoma HeLa cells. The novel prototype drug 3j (containing a 5-heptyl chain) elicited a cytotoxic, rather than cytostatic activity, already after 4 h of exposure. The unusual tumor selectivity could not be explained by a differential uptake (or efflux) of the drug by sensitive versus resistant tumor cells. Exposure of a fluorescent derivative of 3j revealed pronounced uptake of the drug in the cytoplasm, no visible appearance in the nucleus, and a predominant localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations may be helpful to narrow down the intracellular localization and identification of the molecular target of the 5-substituted thiophene derivatives.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

The relationship between these processes is unclear and we report here that galectins display oxidative-stress specific expression patterns in neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells. Three galectins (-1, -3, and -10) are upregulated in response to either menadione or DMSO exposure whereas galectins -9 and -12 exhibited a stimulus-dependent downregulation. Changes in galectin expression are oxidant dependent based on the observations that 1) oxidative stress biomarkers HMOX1 (heme oxygenase-1) and NCF1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1, which is also a biomarker of neutrophil differentiation) are elevated in both cases, and 2) the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine restores basal expression of galectin-3 following oxidant exposure. In addition, our results suggest that the regulation of oxidative stress-sensitive galectins involves DNA hypomethylation mechanisms. Expression of galectin-3 and galectin-12 exhibits an opposite relationship to the expression of HMOX1/NCF1, suggesting a stimulatory and inhibitory role of these galectins in neutrophil-like differentiation of HL-60 cells. We also show that the inhibition of galectins reduces the growth rate of HL-60 cells, and facilitates their neutrophil-like differentiation. Collectively, our findings indicate that the process of cellular differentiation implicates, in part, oxidative stress-sensitive galectins, which further highlights a biological significance of galectin network remodeling in cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: SNPs in exons and parts of adjacent introns of the TP53 gene were analyzed in 235 CLL patients observed during 2005-2012 years. Data on individuals of European descent from the 1000 Genomes Project data set were used as a reference. RESULTS: In the recessive model of inheritance, we found borderline associations between CLL risk and C/C genotype of rs1642785 (p=0.048); G/G genotype of rs2909430 (in men only; p=0.036) and Pro72Pro genotype of rs1042522 (in men only; p=0.045). Risk of CLL was increased also in carriers of rare haplotypes (p=0.0049). Besides, genotypes Pro72Pro of rs1042522, C/C of rs1642785, and G/G of rs2909430 were associated with an increased incidence of TP53 mutations. Median of overall survival in rs1800372 carriers was comparable to that of patients with TP53 mutations. Other evaluated SNPs were not associated with survival.

The current subanalysis from the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials as First-Line Treatment (ENEST1st) study evaluated whether age has an impact on the achievement of deeper molecular responses or safety with frontline nilotinib in patients with CML. METHODS: ENEST1st is an open-label, multicenter, single-arm, prospective study of nilotinib 300 mg twice daily in patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic phase. The patients were stratified into the following 4 groups based on age: young (18-39 years), middle age (40-59 years), elderly (60-74 years), and old (>/=75 years). The primary end point was the rate of molecular response 4 ([MR(4)] BCR-ABL1 </=0.01% on the international scale) at 18 months from the initiation of nilotinib. RESULTS: Of the 1091 patients enrolled, 1089 were considered in the analysis, of whom, 23% (n = 243), 45% (n = 494), 27% (n = 300), and 5% (n = 52) were categorized as young, middle age, elderly, and old, respectively. At 18 months, the rates of MR(4) were 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27.8-40.0%) in the young, 39.6% (95% CI, 35.3-44.0%) in the middle-aged, 40.5% (95% CI, 34.8-46.1%) in the elderly, and 35.4% (95% CI, 21.9-48.9%) in the old patients. Although the incidence of adverse events was slightly different, no new specific safety signals were observed across the 4 age groups.

METHODS: The HEL cells were treated with bufalin at various concentrations to observe cellular morphology, proliferation assay and cell cycle. The mRNA and protein expression levels of WT1 were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot and immunocytochemistry, DNA methylation of WT1 and protein expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) and DNMT3b were analyzed by methylation-specific PCR, and Western blot respectively. RESULTS: The bufalin was effective to inhibit proliferation of HEL cells in a dose-dependent manner, their suppression rates were from 23.4%+/-2.1% to 87.2%+/-5.4% with an half maximal inhibit concentration (IC50) of 0.046 mumol/L. Typical apoptosis morphology was observed in bufalin-treated HEL cells. The proliferation index of cell cycle decreased from 76.4%+/-1.9% to 49.7%+/-1.3%. The expression levels of WT1 mRNA and its protein reduced gradually with increasing doses of bufalin, meanwhile, the methylation status of WT1 gene changed from unmethylated into partially or totally methylated. While, the expression levels of DNMT3a and DNMT3b protein gradually increased by bufalin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Bufalin can not only significantly inhibit the proliferation of HEL cells and arrest cell cycle at G0/G1 phase, but also induce cellular apoptosis and down-regulate the expression level of WT1. Our results provide the evidence of bufalin for anti-leukemia, its mechanism may involve in increasing WT1 methylation status which is related to the up-regulation of DNMT3a and DNMT3b proteins in erythroid leukemic HEL cells.",,"['Wang, Li-Pei', 'Zhao, Yan-Na', 'Sun, Xin', 'Gao, Rui-Lan']","['Wang LP', 'Zhao YN', 'Sun X', 'Gao RL']","['College of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', 'College of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310053, China.', ""Institution of Oncology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310006, China. fallingyezi@126.com."", 'College of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 310053, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin J Integr Med,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,101181180,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects/genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects/genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methyltransferase 3a', 'DNA methyltransferase 3b', ""Wilm's tumor 1 gene"", 'bufalin', 'human erythroid leukemic cells', 'methylation']",2017/04/02 06:00,2017/04/25 06:00,['2017/04/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2017/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11655-017-2404-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s11655-017-2404-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin J Integr Med. 2017 Apr;23(4):288-294. doi: 10.1007/s11655-017-2404-1.

LSCs are quiescent and resistant to chemotherapy and can cause relapse of the disease. HSCs in niches are needed to generate blood cell precursors that are committed to unilineage differentiation and eventually production of mature blood cells, including red blood cells, megakaryocytes, myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Thus far, three types of HSC niches are recognized: endosteal, reticular and perivascular niches. However, we argue here that there is only one type of HSC niche, which consists of a periarteriolar compartment and a perisinusoidal compartment. In the periarteriolar compartment, hypoxia and low levels of reactive oxygen species preserve the HSC pool. In the perisinusoidal compartment, hypoxia in combination with higher levels of reactive oxygen species enables proliferation of progenitor cells and their mobilization into the circulation. Because HSC niches offer protection to LSCs against chemotherapy, we review novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit homing of LSCs in niches for the prevention of dedifferentiation of leukemic cells into LSCs and to stimulate migration of leukemic cells out of niches. These strategies enhance differentiation and proliferation and thus sensitize leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Finally, we list clinical trials of therapies that tackle LSCs in HSC niches to circumvent their protection against chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Both feeder layers were expanded up to 8th passage. Signaling molecules viz. bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and pluripotency-associated transcriptional factors (POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4, MYC and FOXD3) were immunolocalized in the both feeder types. A clear variation in the expression pattern of key signaling molecules with passaging was registered in both feeders compared to primary culture (0 passage). The conditioned media (CM) was collected from different passages (2, 4, 6, 8) of both the feeder layers and was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Concomitant to expression profile, protein quantification also revealed differences in the concentration of signaling molecules at different time points. Conjointly, expression and secretory profile revealed that 2nd passage of BFF and 6th passage of BWJ exhibit optimal levels of key signaling molecules thus may be selected as best passages for embryonic stem cells (ESCs) propagation. Further, the effect of mitomycin-C (MMC) treatment on the expression profile of signaling molecules in the selected passages of BFF and BWJ revealed that MMC modulates the expression profile of these molecules. In conclusion, the results indicate that feeder layers vary in expression and secretory pattern of vital signaling molecules with passaging. Based on these findings, the appropriate feeder passages may be selected for the quality propagation of buffalo ESCs.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The current risk stratification strategy in clinical practice is limited to karyotyping and limited molecular studies screening for genetic mutations such as FLT-3 and NPM1. There is opportunity to identify further molecular prognostic markers, which may also lay the groundwork for the development of novel targeted therapies. Complex molecular technologies require transition into widely available laboratory platforms, for better integration into routine clinical practice. METHOD: In a defined subset (MYC/BCL2 or MYC/BCL2) of AML patients (n=20), we examined expression signature of several genes (n=12) of established prognostic value in AML. RNA expression and MYC/BCL2 protein pattern was correlated with 3 cytogenetic risk groups and overall survival. RESULTS: K-means++ unsupervised clustering defined 2 distinct groups with high and low transcript levels of BAALC/MN1/MLLT11/EVI1/SOCS2 genes (>2.5-fold difference; P<0.001). This mRNA signature trended with higher prevalence of MYC/BCL2 coexpression (P<0.057) and poor overall survival (P<0.036), but did not correlate with conventional cytogenetic risk groups (P<0.084). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study provides useful data, which may help further refine the prognostic scheme of AML patients outside conventional cytogenetic risk groups.

The model assumes that data are independently and identically sampled from a finite mixture of Student's distributions, which can reduce the sensitiveness to outliers. Latent random variables that represent the features' salience are included in the model for the indication of the relevance of features. As a result, the model is expected to simultaneously realize clustering, feature selection, and outlier detection. Inference is carried out by a tree-structured variational Bayes algorithm. Full Bayesian treatment is adopted in the model to realize automatic model selection. Controlled experimental studies showed that the developed model is capable of modeling the data set with outliers accurately. Furthermore, experiment results showed that the developed algorithm compares favorably against existing unsupervised probability model-based Bayesian feature selection algorithms on artificial and real data sets. Moreover, the application of the developed algorithm on real leukemia gene expression data indicated that it is able to identify the discriminating genes successfully.",,"['Sun, Jianyong', 'Zhou, Aimin', 'Keates, Simeon', 'Liao, Shengbin']","['Sun J', 'Zhou A', 'Keates S', 'Liao S']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst,IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems,101616214,,,,,2017/04/01 06:00,2017/04/01 06:01,['2017/04/01 06:00'],"['2017/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/01 06:01 [medline]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2619061 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE Trans Neural Netw Learn Syst. 2018 Apr;29(4):1187-1199. doi: 10.1109/TNNLS.2016.2619061.

Modulating PU.1 expression in AML cells, we found that PU.1 supports tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis via two mechanisms: (a) by repressing NF-kappaB activity via a novel direct PU.1-RelA/p65 protein-protein interaction, and (b) by directly inducing TRAIL receptor DR5 expression. Thus, expression of NF-kappaB-regulated antiapoptotic genes was sustained in PU.1-depleted AML cells upon TRAIL treatment and DR5 levels were decreased. Last, PU.1 deficiency significantly increased AML cell resistance to anthracycline treatment.

One major issue that hinders their advancement to clinic is the persistence of undifferentiated iPS cells in iPS-derived tissue. In this report, we show that the CDKs inhibitor, Dinaciclib, selectively eliminates iPS cells without affecting the viability of cardiac cells. We found that low nanomolar concentration of dinaciclib increased DNA damage and p53 protein levels in iPSCs. This was accompanied by negative regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1. Gene knockdown experiments revealed that p53 downregulation only increased the threshold of dinaciclib induced apoptosis in iPS cells. Dinaciclib also inhibited the phosphorylation of Serine 2 of the C-terminal domain of RNA Polyemrase II through CDK9 inhibition. This resulted in the inhibition of transcription of MCL-1 and the pluripotency genes, NANOG and c-MYC. Even though dinaciclib caused a slight downregulation of MCL-1 in iPS-derived cardiac cells, the viability of the cells was not significantly affected, and beating iPS-derived cardiac cell sheet could still be fabricated. These findings suggest a difference in tolerance of MCL-1 downregulation between iPSCs and iPS-derived cardiac cells which could be exploited to eliminate remaining iPS cells in bioengineered cell sheet tissues.",,"['Alsayegh, Khaled', 'Matsuura, Katsuhisa', 'Sekine, Hidekazu', 'Shimizu, Tatsuya']","['Alsayegh K', 'Matsuura K', 'Sekine H', 'Shimizu T']","[""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), King Saudi bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.', ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", ""Department of Cardiology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", ""Institute of Advanced Biomedical Engineering and Science, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indolizines', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Pyridinium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,,2017/04/01 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2017/04/01 06:00'],"['2016/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep45577 [pii]', '10.1038/srep45577 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Mar 31;7:45577. doi: 10.1038/srep45577.,,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",PMC5374522,,20170331,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of MS is especially challenging in patients without an antecedent history of leukemia. METHODS: We present 2 cases of intraoral MS that presented as de novo lesions. A detailed review of cases of intraoral MS that either preceded or presented along with leukemia has been done with emphasis on diagnostic criteria used. RESULTS: Two male patients aged 28 and 5 years presented with MS with one patient presenting with concomitant AML. A combination of morphological and immunohistochemical methods was used for diagnosis. A thorough review of world literature revealed 44 cases of intraoral MS that presented as de novo lesions.

Acute leukemia has been reported to harbor multiple genes aberrantly silenced by hypermethylation. AIM: In present study, we investigated the prevalence of hypermethylation of caspase-8 (CASP8), TMS1 and DAPK genes in correlation with clinicopathological factors in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case-control study has been conducted based on bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 125 ALL patients and 100 sex-age matched healthy controls. Methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bisulfite sequencing PCR was performed to analyze the methylation status of these genes. Reverse transcription PCR and real time PCR was carried out to determine changes in the mRNA expression level of the genes due to hypermethylation. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of the 5 CpG islands of the CASP8, TMS1 and DAPK gene promoters was found in 3.2, 6.4, and 13.6% of 125 childhood ALL samples from north Indian population, respectively. There were significant differences in pattern of hypermethylation of TMS1 (p = 0.045) and DAPK (p &lt; 0.001) between patients and healthy controls. Down-regulation of mRNA expression was found in cases in which CASP8, TMS1 and DAPK were hypermethylated. CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicated the impact of hypermethylation-mediated inactivation of CASP8, TMS1 and DAPK genes, which is associated with risk of childhood ALL. This abnormality occurs in leukemogenesis and it may be used as a biomarker and for predicting the prognosis of ALL.",,"['Nikbakht, M', 'Jha, A K', 'Malekzadeh, K', 'Askari, M', 'Mohammadi, S', 'Marwaha, R K', 'Kaul, D', 'Kaur, J']","['Nikbakht M', 'Jha AK', 'Malekzadeh K', 'Askari M', 'Mohammadi S', 'Marwaha RK', 'Kaul D', 'Kaur J']","['Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 1411713131, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology, IMS Engineering College, Ghaziabad (U.P.) 160012, India.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center (MMRC); Hormozgan University of Medical Science (HUMS); Bandar Abbass 7919915519, Iran.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Panjab University, Chandigarh 160014, India.', 'Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14176-13151, Iran.', 'Advanced Pediatrics Center, PGIMER, Chandigarh 160014, India.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine and Biotechnology, PGIMER, Chandigarh 160014, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, Panjab University, Chandigarh 160014, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspase 8/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,,2017/04/01 06:00,2017/06/29 06:00,['2017/04/01 06:00'],"['2017/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/29 06:00 [medline]']",['9423 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2017 Mar;39(1):57-64.,,"['0 (CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (PYCARD protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DAPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To avoid contamination with other proteins, anti-histone H1 IgGs were subjected to strongly acidic pH 2.0 during gel filtration through HPLC column. The effects of the anti-histone H1 IgGs on cell viability and cell cycle were tested by MTS-assay and flow cytometry, correspondingly. The cross-reactivity of the anti-histone H1 antibodies towards heterogenetic and cellular antigens was evaluated by Western-blot analysis. RESULTS: It was found that incubation of CEM cells with the HPLC-purified anti-histone H1 IgGs resulted in significant stimulation of cell growth by 46% after 48 h of incubation. These IgGs possess an antigenic poly-specificity to positively charged heterogenetic antigens and different cellular antigens. FITC-labeled and biotinylated anti-histone H1 IgGs are internalized by CEM cells and preferentially accumulated in the cytoplasm.

The aim of this study was to provide a nationwide population-based statistical analysis of Korean patients with lymphoid malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Korea Central Cancer Registry analyzed the incidence and survival of patients with lymphoid malignancies from the Korean National Cancer Incidence Database. Diseases were grouped by clinically relevant categories based on the 2008 World Health Organization classification. RESULTS: Overall 65,948 lymphoid diseases were identified between 1999 and 2012. The incidence of most subtypes increased with age, except for precursor cell neoplasms. Male predominance (male:female ratio=1.28:1) was observed. In 2012, annual age-standardized incidence rates per 100,000 persons of Hodgkin's lymphoma, mature B-cell neoplasm, mature T/natural killer (NK)-cell neoplasm, and precursor cell neoplasm were 0.46, 6.60, 0.95, and 1.50, respectively, and they increased yearly from 1999. Composite Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were extremely rare. Survival improvement estimated using 5-year relative survival rate was observed in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (71.1%-83.0%), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (49.5%-61.5%), plasma cell neoplasms (20.2%-36.9%), and lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (41.5%-56.3%) between 1993 and 2012. However, survival rates of T/NK-cell lymphoma (excluding cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) ranged from 40.5%-43.5% during the study period. Survival rates decreased with age in most subtypes.

The first ADC to receive marketing authorization was gemtuzumab ozogamicin, which comprises an anti-CD33 antibody conjugated to a highly potent DNA-targeting antibiotic, calicheamicin, approved in 2000 for treating acute myeloid leukemia. It was withdrawn from the US market in 2010 following an unsuccessful confirmatory trial. The development of two classes of highly potent microtubule-disrupting agents, maytansinoids and auristatins, as payloads for ADCs resulted in approval of brentuximab vedotin in 2011 for treating Hodgkin lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and approval of ado-trastuzumab emtansine in 2013 for treating HER2-positive breast cancer. Their success stimulated much research into the ADC approach, with >60 ADCs currently in clinical evaluation, mostly targeting solid tumors. Five ADCs have advanced into pivotal clinical trials for treating various solid tumors-platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, mesothelioma, triple-negative breast cancer, glioblastoma, and small cell lung cancer. The level of target expression is a key parameter in predicting the likelihood of patient benefit for all these ADCs, as well as for the approved compound, ado-trastuzumab emtansine.

RECENT FINDINGS: Ph-like ALL is a high-risk subtype of B cell precursor ALL with characteristic genomic alterations in children and adults. A standard approach for diagnosis is missing and currently mainly based on gene expression analysis. The incidence is age depended and highest in adolescents and younger adults (age 16-39) where 19-28% of patients belong to this subtype. Ph-like ALL is associated with persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) and inferior prognosis. Some genomic alterations respond to specific treatment approaches and provide hope for tailored therapies. Ph-like ALL in adults is an aggressive and high-risk subtype of B cell precursor ALL.

The chromosomal translocation t(8;21), fusing the DNA binding domain of AML1 to the corepressor eight-twenty-one (ETO), is frequently associated with acute myeloid leukemia and generates the AML1/ETO (AE) fusion protein. AE represses target genes usually activated by AML1 and also affects the endogenous repressive function of ETO at Notch target genes. In order to analyze the contribution of CBFbeta in AE-mediated leukemogenesis and deregulation of Notch target genes, we introduced two point mutations in a leukemia-initiating version of AE in mice, called AE9a, that disrupt the AML1/CBFbeta interaction (AE9aNT). We report that the AE9a/CBFbeta interaction is not required for the AE9a-mediated aberrant expression of AML1 target genes, while upregulation/derepression of Notch target genes does require the interaction with CBFbeta. Using retroviral transduction to express AE9a in murine adult bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors, we observed that both AE9a and AE9aNT lead to increased myeloproliferation in vivo. However, both development of leukemia and long-term replating capacity are only observed with AE9a but not with AE9aNT. Thus, deregulation of both AML1 and Notch target genes is required for the development of AE9a-driven leukemia.",,"['Thiel, V N', 'Giaimo, B D', 'Schwarz, P', 'Soller, K', 'Vas, V', 'Bartkuhn, M', 'Blatte, T J', 'Dohner, K', 'Bullinger, L', 'Borggrefe, T', 'Geiger, H', 'Oswald, F']","['Thiel VN', 'Giaimo BD', 'Schwarz P', 'Soller K', 'Vas V', 'Bartkuhn M', 'Blatte TJ', 'Dohner K', 'Bullinger L', 'Borggrefe T', 'Geiger H', 'Oswald F']","['University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Genetics, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Biochemistry, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, CCHMC, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', 'University Medical Center Ulm, Center for Internal Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine I, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/*metabolism']",,,2017/04/01 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/04/01 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017105 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.105 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2491-2502. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.105.

However, the incidence of Burkitt lymphoma (BL) remains strikingly elevated. Most BL present a t(8;14) chromosomal translocation which must take place at a time of spatial proximity between the translocation partners. The two partner genes, MYC and IGH, were found colocalized only very rarely in the nuclei of normal peripheral blood B-cells examined using 3D-FISH while circulating B-cells from HIV-infected individuals whose exhibited consistently elevated levels of MYC-IGH colocalization. In vitro, incubating normal B-cells from healthy donors with a transcriptionally active form of the HIV-encoded Tat protein rapidly activated transcription of the nuclease-encoding RAG1 gene. This created DNA damage, including in the MYC gene locus which then moved towards the center of the nucleus where it sustainably colocalized with IGH up to 10-fold more frequently than in controls. In vivo, this could be sufficient to account for the elevated risk of BL-specific chromosomal translocations which would occur following DNA double strand breaks triggered by AID in secondary lymph nodes at the final stage of immunoglobulin gene maturation.

Here we show that matrix metalloproteinase-sensitive hydrogels prepared from poly(ethylene glycol) and heparin functionalized with adhesion ligands and pro-angiogenic factors can be instrumental to produce robust three-dimensional culture models, allowing for the analysis of acute myeloid leukemia development and response to treatment. We evaluated the growth of four leukemia cell lines, KG1a, MOLM13, MV4-11 and OCI-AML3, as well as samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. Furthermore, endothelial cells and mesenchymal stromal cells were co-seeded to mimic the vascular niche for acute myeloid leukemia cells. Greater drug resistance to daunorubicin and cytarabine was demonstrated in three-dimensional cultures and in vascular co-cultures when compared with two-dimensional suspension cultures, opening the way for drug combination studies.

However, the underlying mechanism and strategy to alleviate renal injury remain unclear. In the present study, we assessed the protective effect of bamboo leaf extract on the DN, and investigated the underlying mechanism by which bamboo leaf extract ameliorating DN. Diabetic rats were induced by 4 weeks high sugar and high fat diet, and then injected a single dose of STZ (35mg/kg) into abdominal cavity. Different dose of bamboo extract (50mg/kg, 100mg/kg and 200mg/kg) were orally administered every day for a period of 12 weeks. Body weight, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbAlc), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), and 24-hour urinary protein (24 h-UP) were assessed. Total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity and MDA (methane dicarboxylic aldehyde, MDA) level were tested by assay kit. Microstructural changes were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and electron microscopy. Expression of phosphorylated ser/thr protein kinase (P-AKT), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (P-GSK-3beta), B cell lymphoma/leukemia 2-associated X protein (BAX) and cleaved-cysteinyl aspartate-specific proteinase-3 (Cleaved Caspase-3) were measured by Western-Blotting (WB). Results showed that diabetic rats had weight loss, high blood glucose, HbAlc, BUN, Scr and 24-UP and T-SOD activity were increased and MDA level was decreased in diabetic rats. Moreover, hyperglycemia could injury renal tissue ultrastructure, inhibit P-AKT level and increase P-GSK-3beta, BAX and Cleaved Caspase-3 levels in rats. However, bamboo leaf extract treatment could reduce body weight loss, BUN, Scr, 24 h-UP and MDA level, improve T-SOD activity and alleviate renal injury in diabetic rats. Furthermore, bamboo leaf extract increased P-AKT level, decreased P-GSK-3beta, BAX and Cleaved Caspase-3 levels in STZ-diabetic rats. In conclusion, our study suggested that bamboo leaf extract ameliorated DN in diabetic rats, and this protective effect is possibly related to suppressing oxidative stress through activating AKT signaling pathway. Bamboo leaf extract treatment may be a potential promising therapy for DN.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed central mechanism of action of HMAs, is the reversal of aberrant methylation in tumor cells, thus reactivating CpG-island promoters and leading to (re)expression of tumor suppressor genes. Recent investigations into the mode of action of azacitidine (AZA) and decitabine (DAC) have revealed new molecular mechanisms that impinge on tumor immunity via induction of an interferon response, through activation of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) that are normally epigenetically silenced. Although the global demethylation of DNA by HMAs can induce anti-tumor effects, it can also upregulate the expression of inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors and their ligands, resulting in secondary resistance to HMAs. Recent studies have, however, suggested that this could be exploited to prime or (re)sensitize tumors to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapies. In recent years, immune checkpoints have been targeted by novel therapies, with the aim of (re)activating the host immune system to specifically eliminate malignant cells. Antibodies blocking checkpoint receptors have been FDA-approved for some solid tumors and a plethora of clinical trials testing these and other checkpoint inhibitors are under way. This review will discuss AZA and DAC novel mechanisms of action resulting from the re-expression of pathologically hypermethylated promoters of gene sets that are related to interferon signaling, antigen presentation and inflammation. We also review new insights into the molecular mechanisms of action of transient, low-dose HMAs on various tumor types and discuss the potential of new treatment options and combinations.",,"['Wolff, Florian', 'Leisch, Michael', 'Greil, Richard', 'Risch, Angela', 'Pleyer, Lisa']","['Wolff F', 'Leisch M', 'Greil R', 'Risch A', 'Pleyer L']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', '3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Mullner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', '3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Mullner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.', '3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, Mullner Hauptstrasse 48, A-5020, Salzburg, Austria. l.pleyer@salk.at.', 'Salzburg Cancer Research Institute - Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials, Salzburg, Austria. l.pleyer@salk.at.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria. l.pleyer@salk.at.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immune Evasion/drug effects', 'Immunity/*genetics', 'Molecular Mimicry/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Azacitidine', '*Cancer', '*DNA methylation', '*Decitabine', '*Endogenous retroviral elements', '*Hypomethylating agents', '*Immune checkpoint blockade', '*Immune checkpoint inhibitors', '*Tumor microenvironment']",2017/04/01 06:00,2017/06/13 06:00,['2017/04/01 06:00'],"['2016/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-017-0168-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12964-017-0168-z [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2017 Mar 31;15(1):13. doi: 10.1186/s12964-017-0168-z.,,,PMC5374693,,20170331,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cells from the AML-infiltrated skin from an M6 patient were infected with a lentivirus carrying OCT4, SOX2, KLF4 and C-MYC to induce iPSCs. The characteristics of the iPSCs were confirmed by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining. The proliferation ability of iPSCs was detected with a CCK-8 assay. The expression of pluripotency markers was measured by immunostaining, and the expression of stem cell-related genes was detected by qRT-PCR; distortion during the induction process was detected by karyotype analysis; the differentiation potential of iPSCs was determined by embryoid body-formation and teratoma-formation assays. ALP staining confirmed that these cells exhibited positive staining and had the characteristics of iPSCs. RESULTS: The CCK-8 assay showed that the iPSCs had the ability to proliferate. Immunostaining demonstrated that iPSC clones showed positive expression of NANOG, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, TRA-1-60 and TRA-1-81. qRT-PCR results revealed that the mRNA expression of Nanog, Lin28, Cripto, FOX3, DNMT3b, DPPA2, and DPPA4 significantly increased in iPSCs. Karyotype analysis found no chromosome aberration in the iPSCs. The results of the embryoid body-formation and teratoma-formation assays indicated that the iPSCs had the potential to differentiate into all three germ layers.

As compared to gammaH2AX foci levels in normal bone marrow samples (0.2 focus per CD34+ cell+/-0.0; mean+/-standard error of mean), increased levels of gammaH2AX foci were detected in 16/16 MDS bone marrow samples (2.8 foci per CD34+ cell+/-0.5), 18/18 AML bone marrow samples (5.5 foci per blast+/-0.5), 1/1 MDS cell line (6.4 foci per cell) and 6/6 AML cell lines (12.0 foci per cell+/-0.6). gammaH2AX and 53BP1 co-localized in all tested samples forming diffuse, clustered and marginal patterns. Further, DDR proteins were expressed heterogeneously suggesting impairment of the DDR. In summary, our results provide evidence for a continuous increase of DSB across the spectrum from MDS to AML in conjunction with an impaired DDR. Co-localization of gammaH2AX and 53BP1 indicates promotion of (in)effective nonhomologous end-joining repair mechanisms at sites of DSB. Moreover, gammaH2AX/53BP1 foci distribution presumably reveals a non-random spatial organization of the genome in MDS and AML.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

B-ALL cases usually carry a primary genetic event, often a chromosome translocation, and a constellation of secondary genetic alterations that are acquired and selected dynamically in a nonlinear fashion. As far as we are aware of, for the first time, we studied centrosome aberration in patients with B-ALL to understand the progression of the disease. A cytogenetic study was carried out by GTG-banded karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. DNA index study was carried out with flow cytometry. Indirect immunostaining of centrosomes was performed on mononuclear cells using primary and corresponding secondary antibodies for centrosome-specific protein gamma-tubulin. Three primary and corresponding secondary antibodies to three different centrosome-specific proteins, namely alpha-tubulin, gamma-tubulin and pericentrin, were used for indirect immunostaining. The study was carried out on 50 patients with B-ALL. Centrosomal abnormalities were detected in 36 (72%) patients and the remainder (28%) had normal centrosome structure and numbers. Out of these 36 patients with abnormal centrosome, structural abnormalities were detected in 12 (33.3%) and numerical abnormalities in six (16.6%). Both structural and numerical aberrations were detected in 18 (50%) patients. When correlated with the cytogenetic and DNA index findings, 26/27 (96.2%) patients had centrosome defects concomitant with both abnormal karyotype and aneuploidy. Out of 50 patients with B-ALL, 17 (34%) had normal karyotype detected by both karyotype and DNA index, among these, seven (41.17%) patients had centrosome aberration. The morphological and structural abnormalities of the centrosome present in B-ALL cells have a role in disease development and can be considered as prognostic markers.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Kerketta, Lily S', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha', 'Nadkarni, Anita', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Vundinti, Babu Rao']","['Kerketta LS', 'Ghosh K', 'Nadkarni A', 'Madkaikar M', 'Vundinti BR']","['National Institute of Immunohematology, Parel, Mumbai, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohematology, Parel, Mumbai, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohematology, Parel, Mumbai, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohematology, Parel, Mumbai, India.', 'National Institute of Immunohematology, Parel, Mumbai, India vbaburao@hotmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens/metabolism', 'Centrosome/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotype', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*centrosome aberrations', '*chromosomal abnormalities', '*hyperdiploidy', '*polyploidy', '*prognosis']",2017/03/31 06:00,2017/06/02 06:00,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['31/2/215 [pii]', '10.21873/invivo.11048 [doi]']",ppublish,In Vivo. 2017 Mar-Apr;31(2):215-220. doi: 10.21873/invivo.11048.,,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (pericentrin)']",PMC5411748,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the acquisition of multidrug resistance (MDR) has seriously affected the quality of life and survival rate of patients. The overexpression of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent binding cassette (ABC) transporters are the two main causes of MDR. Apollon and MDR1 are the most important and representative members, respectively, among the IAPs and ABC transporters. In the present study, we investigated the role of Apollon and MDR1 in chemotherapy resistance and their mechanism of interaction. We respectively knocked down the expression of Apollon and MDR1 using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in adriamycin (ADM) resistant human CML K562 cells and examined the drug sensitivity, the consequences with regard to ADM accumulation and the alterations in the expression of Apollon and MDR1. The expression levels of Apollon and MDR1 mRNA were higher in the K562/ADM cells compared with the parental K562 cells as determined by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The plasmids of Apollon and MDR1 shRNA were respectively stably transfected into K562/ADM cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The transfection efficiency was detected by fluorescence microscopy. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay revealed that Apollon or MDR1 knockdown significantly increased the chemosensitivity of the K562/ADM cells to ADM. Flow cytometric assay revealed that K562/ADM/shMDR1 cells exhibited a significantly increased intracellular accumulation of ADM, and that changes were not found in the K562/ADM/shApollon cells. Compared with the parental K562/ADM cells, a significantly decreased expression of Apollon mRNA and protein was determined in the K562/ADM/shApollon cells without affecting the expression of MDR1 as determined by RT-PCR and western blotting. Likewise, the expression levels of MDR1 mRNA and protein also markedly downregulated in the K562/ADM/shMDR1 cells had no effect on Apollon expression. Collectively, our findings demonstrated, for the first time, that downregulation of Apollon or MDR1 through stable transfection with the Apollon- or MDR1-targeting shRNA induced MDR reversal through respective inhibition of Apollon or MDR1 expression and function. However, the reversal mechanism of Apollon and MDR1 revealed no direct interaction with each other.",,"['Chen, Jie-Ru', 'Jia, Xiu-Hong', 'Wang, Hong', 'Yi, Ying-Jie', 'Li, You-Jie']","['Chen JR', 'Jia XH', 'Wang H', 'Yi YJ', 'Li YJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Hospital of Binzhou Medical University, Binzhou, Shandong 256603, P.R.

Using murine C2C12 myoblasts, we demonstrate that activation of skeletal muscle differentiation results in loss of PML and PML NBs prior to myotube fusion. Myotube formation was associated with marked chromatin reorganization and the relocalization of DAXX from PML NBs to chromocentres. MyoD expression was sufficient to cause PML NB loss, and silencing of PML induced DAXX relocalization. Fusion of C2C12 cells using the reptilian reovirus p14 fusogenic protein failed to disrupt PML NBs yet still promoted DAXX redistribution and loss; whereas ectopic expression of PML in differentiated cells only partially restored PML NB formation and DAXX localization at NBs. Finally, we determined that the C-terminal SUMO-interacting motif of DAXX is required for its colocalization with ATRX in heterochromatin domains during myotube formation. These data support a model in which activation of myogenic differentiation results in PML NB loss, chromatin reorganization and DAXX relocalization, and provides a paradigm for understanding the consequence of PML loss in other cellular contexts, such as during cancer development and progression.",,"['Salsman, Jayme', 'Rapkin, Lindsy M', 'Margam, Nandini N', 'Duncan, Roy', 'Bazett-Jones, David P', 'Dellaire, Graham']","['Salsman J', 'Rapkin LM', 'Margam NN', 'Duncan R', 'Bazett-Jones DP', 'Dellaire G']","['Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology Program, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.', 'Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0612-5114', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3466-6316']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Heterochromatin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Models, Biological', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Muscle Development/*physiology', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/cytology/*metabolism', 'Myoblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/physiology']",,,2017/03/31 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017151 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.151 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Mar 30;8(3):e2724. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.151.,['MOP-84260/CIHR/Canada'],"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Daxx protein, mouse)', '0 (Heterochromatin)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)']",PMC5386546,,20170330,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the most significant side effects associated with asparaginase administration is immune suppression, which limits its application in clinic. Macrophages are phagocytic immune cells and have a central role in inflammation and host defense. We reported here that asparaginase disturbed the function of macrophages including phagocytosis, proliferation, ROS and nitric oxide secretion, interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) secretion, and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC-II) molecule expression, thus induced immune suppression in interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. We also observed that asparaginase inhibited autophagy in macrophages via activating Akt/mTOR and suppressing Erk1/2 signaling pathway as evidenced by less formation of autophagosomes, downregulation of autophagy-related protein LC3-II, and decreased number of autophagy-like vacuoles. Further study discovered that treatment with autophagy inhibitor 3-MA in place of asparaginase on activated macrophages could also downregulate phagocytosis, cytokine secretion, and MHC-II expression. Moreover, incubation with autophagy inducer trehalose restored the capacity of phagocytosis, IL-6 and TNF-alpha secretion, and MHC-II expression in macrophages. These results prove the important role of autophagy in the function of macrophages, and activation of autophagy can overcome asparaginase-induced immune suppression in macrophages.",,"['Song, Ping', 'Wang, Ziyu', 'Zhang, Xuyao', 'Fan, Jiajun', 'Li, Yubin', 'Chen, Qicheng', 'Wang, Shaofei', 'Liu, Peipei', 'Luan, Jingyun', 'Ye, Li', 'Ju, Dianwen']","['Song P', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang X', 'Fan J', 'Li Y', 'Chen Q', 'Wang S', 'Liu P', 'Luan J', 'Ye L', 'Ju D']","['Department of Microbiological and Biochemical Pharmacy & The Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery, Ministry of Education, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, 826 Zhangheng Road, Shanghai, 201203, P.

In this study, we first modified near-infrared fluorescent indium phosphide quantum dots (InP QDs) with a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody to afford targeted drug delivery function. Then, a miR-92a inhibitor, an antisense microRNA that enhances the expression of tumor suppressor p63, was attached to the VEGFR2-InP QDs via electrostatic interactions. The functionalized InP nanocomposite (IMAN) selectively targets tumor sites and allows for infrared imaging in vivo. We further explored the mechanism of this active targeting. The IMAN was endocytosed and delivered in the form of microvesicles via VEGFR2-CD63 signaling. Moreover, the IMAN induced apoptosis of human myelogenous leukemia cells through the p63 pathway in vitro and in vivo.

In the last ten years, next generation sequencing based studies identified novel germline mutations in the background of familial aggregation of certain haematologic disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). This is supported by the fact that the myeloid neoplasms with genetic predisposition represent a new category in the revised 2016 World Health Organization classification. According to the new classification, these disorders are subdivided based on the clinical and genetic features, including myeloid neoplasms with germline predisposition alone, or with pre-existing platelet disorder, cytopaenias or other organ failures. The predisposing genetic factors include mutations in the RUNX1, CEBPA, GATA2, ANKRD26, ETV6, DDX41, TERC or TERT and SRP72 genes. The genes affected in these syndromes are important regulators of haemopoiesis and are frequently implicated in leukaemogenesis, providing deeper insight into the understanding of normal and malignant haemopoiesis. Despite the growing knowledge of germline predisposing events in the background of familial myeloid malignancies, the germline genetic component is still unknown in a subset of these pedigrees. Here, we present the first study of inherited myeloid malignancies in Hungary. We identified three families with apparent clustering of myeloid malignancies with nine affected individuals across these pedigrees. All tested individuals were negative for CEBPA, GATA2, RUNX1, ANKRD26, ETV6, DDX41, TERC or TERT and SRP72 mutations, suggesting the presence of so far unidentified predisposing mutations.",,"['Kiraly, Attila Peter', 'Kallay, Krisztian', 'Gango, Ambrus', 'Kellner, Adam', 'Egyed, Miklos', 'Szoke, Anita', 'Kiss, Richard', 'Valyi-Nagy, Istvan', 'Csomor, Judit', 'Matolcsy, Andras', 'Bodor, Csaba']","['Kiraly AP', 'Kallay K', 'Gango A', 'Kellner A', 'Egyed M', 'Szoke A', 'Kiss R', 'Valyi-Nagy I', 'Csomor J', 'Matolcsy A', 'Bodor C']","['MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, United St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Hematology, Kaposi Mor Teaching Hospital, Kaposvar, Hungary.', 'Department of Hematology, Kaposi Mor Teaching Hospital, Kaposvar, Hungary.', '2nd Department of Medicine and Cardiology Centre, Medical Faculty, Albert Szent-Gyorgyi Clinical Centre, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'United St. Istvan and St. Laszlo Hospital, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. bodor.csaba1@med.semmelweis-univ.hu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0729-692X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathol Oncol Res,Pathology oncology research : POR,9706087,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Hungary/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Prognosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Familial MDS/AML', 'Genetic predisposition', 'Germline mutation']",2017/03/31 06:00,2018/08/15 06:00,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12253-017-0216-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12253-017-0216-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathol Oncol Res. 2018 Jan;24(1):83-88. doi: 10.1007/s12253-017-0216-4.

ATL occurs, after a long latency period, only in about 5% of 10-20 millions infected individuals. ATL has a dismal prognosis with a median survival of less than 1 year, mainly due to its resistance to chemotherapy and to a profound immunosuppression. The viral oncoprotein, Tax, plays a major role in ATL oncogenic transformation by interfering with cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA repair. The diversity in ATL clinical features and prognosis led to Shimoyama classification of ATL into four clinical subtypes (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering) requiring different therapeutic strategies. Clinical trials, mainly conducted in Japan, demonstrated that combination of chemotherapy could induce acceptable response rate in the lymphoma subtype but not in acute ATL. However, long-term prognosis remains poor for both subtypes, due to a high relapse rate. Similarly, whether managed by a watchful waiting or treated with chemotherapy, the indolent forms (smoldering and chronic) have a poor long-term outcome. An international meta-analysis showed improved survival in the leukemic subtypes of ATL (chronic, smoldering as well as a subset of the acute subtype) with the use of two antiviral agents, zidovudine and interferon-alpha, and accordingly, this combination should be considered the standard first-line treatment in this context. ATL patients with lymphoma subtype benefit from induction chemotherapy, given simultaneously or sequentially with an antiviral combination of zidovudine and interferon-alpha. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation remains a promising and potentially curative approach but is limited to a small number of patients. Novel drugs such as arsenic trioxide in combination with interferon-alpha or monoclonal antibodies such as anti-CXCR4 have shown promising results and warrant further investigation.",,"['Nasr, Rihab', 'Marcais, Ambroise', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Nasr R', 'Marcais A', 'Hermine O', 'Bazarbachi A']","['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiology, Americain University of Beirut, 113-6044, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Department of Hematology, Necker Hospital, University of Paris Descartes, 149, rue de Sevres, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Necker Hospital, University of Paris Descartes, 149, rue de Sevres, Paris, France.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Anatomy, Cell Biology and Physiology, Americain University of Beirut, 113-6044, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, 113-6044, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Oxides/*therapeutic use', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*Antiviral drugs', '*Shimoyama classification', '*Therapeutic strategies']",2017/03/31 06:00,2018/02/02 06:00,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-6872-5_15 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2017;1582:197-216. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-6872-5_15.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Around 5% of the infected individuals develop adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) or a neurological disease termed tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) after a clinical latency of years to decades. Through the use of two promoters and alternative splicing HTLV-1 expresses at least 12 different proteins. HTLV-1 establishes a life-long persistent infection by inducing the clonal expansion of infected cells, a property largely ascribed to the viral genes Tax and HBZ. However, the fact that ATL arises in a minority of infected individuals after a long clinical latency suggests the existence of factors counterbalancing the oncogenic potential of HTLV-1 in the context of natural infection.To study the role of the different HTLV-1 gene products in the HTLV-1 life cycle, we optimized a transfection protocol for primary T-cells using an approach based on the electroporation of in vitro-transcribed RNA. Results showed that the RNA transfection technique combines a high transfection efficiency with low toxicity, not only in Jurkat T-cells but also in primary T-cells. These findings suggest that RNA electroporation is preferable for experiments aimed at investigating the role of HTLV-1 gene products in the context of primary T-cells, which represent the main target of HTLV-1 in vivo.",,"['Manicone, Mariangela', 'Rende, Francesca', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Thoma-Kress, Andrea K', 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Manicone M', 'Rende F', 'Cavallari I', 'Thoma-Kress AK', 'Ciminale V']","['Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Via Gattamelata 64, Padova, 35128, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Via Gattamelata 64, Padova, 35128, Italy.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto, IRCCS, Via Gattamelata 64, Padova, 35128, Italy.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Schlossgarten 5, Erlangen, 91054, Germany.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, Via Gattamelata 64, Padova, 35128, Italy. v.ciminale@unipd.it.', 'Istituto Oncologico Veneto, IRCCS, Via Gattamelata 64, Padova, 35128, Italy. v.ciminale@unipd.it.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['*Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Electroporation', '*Gene Expression', '*Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', '*RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', '*Retroviridae Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*HTLV-1', '*In vitro transcription', '*Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)', '*RNA electroporation']",2017/03/31 06:00,2018/02/02 06:00,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-6872-5_12 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2017;1582:155-170. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-6872-5_12.,,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, this number is based on the study of nearly 1.5 billion people living in known human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) endemic areas, for which reliable epidemiological data are available. However, for some highly populated regions including India, the Maghreb, East Africa, and some regions of China, no consistent data are yet available which prevents a more accurate estimation. Thus, the number of HTLV-1 infected people in the world is probably much higher. The prevalence of HTLV-1 prevalence varies depending on age, sex, and economic level in most HTLV-1 endemic areas. HTLV-1 seroprevalence gradually increases with age, especially in women. HTLV-1 has a simian origin and was originally acquired by humans through interspecies transmission from STLV-1 infected monkeys in the Old World. Three main modes of HTLV-1 transmission have been described; (1) from mother-to-child after prolonged breast-feeding lasting more than six months, (2) through sexual intercourse, which mainly, but not exclusively, occurs from male to female and lastly, (3) from contaminated blood products, which contain HTLV-1 infected lymphocytes. In specific areas, such as Central Africa, zoonotic transmission from STLV-1 infected monkeys to humans is still ongoing.The diagnostic methods used to study the epidemiological aspects of HTLV-1 infection mainly consist of serological assays for the detection of antibodies specifically directed against different HTLV-1 antigens. Screening tests are usually based on enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence enzyme-linked immunoassay (CLEIA) or particle agglutination (PA). Confirmatory tests include mostly Western blots (WB)s or innogenetics line immunoassay (INNO-LIA) and to a lesser extent immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The search for integrated provirus in the DNA from peripheral blood cells can be performed by qualitative and/or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR is widely used in most diagnostic laboratories and quantification of proviral DNA is useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of HTLV-1 associated diseases such as adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). PCR also provides amplicons for further sequence analysis to determine the HTLV-1 genotype present in the infected person. The use of new generation sequencing methodologies to molecularly characterize full and/or partial HTLV-1 genomic regions is increasing. HTLV-1 genotyping generates valuable molecular epidemiological data to better understand the evolutionary history of this virus.",,"['Cassar, Olivier', 'Gessain, Antoine']","['Cassar O', 'Gessain A']","[""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, F-75015, Paris, France. olivier.cassar@pasteur.fr."", 'CNRS, UMR 3569, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, F-75015, Paris, France. olivier.cassar@pasteur.fr.', ""Unite d'Epidemiologie et Physiopathologie des Virus Oncogenes, Departement de Virologie, Institut Pasteur, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, F-75015, Paris, France."", 'CNRS, UMR 3569, 28 rue du Dr. Roux, F-75015, Paris, France.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,IM,"['Animals', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'Haplorhini', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Molecular Epidemiology/*methods', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Diagnostic methods', '*Genotyping', '*HTLV-1 epidemiology', '*HTLV-1 seroprevalence', '*HTLV-1 transmission']",2017/03/31 06:00,2018/02/02 06:00,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-6872-5_1 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2017;1582:3-24. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-6872-5_1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to these properties, LSCs are supposed to facilitate the development of relapse. The existence of LSCs is demonstrated by the ability to engraft and initiate human AML in immune-compromised mouse models. Although several lines of evidence suggest the complex heterogeneity of phenotypes displayed by LSC, many studies consider the CD34+/CD38- compartment as the most relevant. To increase the understanding of the true LSC, techniques such as multicolor flow cytometry, side-population assay and ALDH assay are utilized in many laboratories and could aid in this. A better understanding of different LSC phenotypes is necessary to enhance risk group classification, guide clinical decision-making and to identify new therapeutic targets.

In neurons, latency is anticipated to be the default transcriptional program; however, limited information exists on the molecular mechanisms that force the virus to enter the latent state.

Knocked down cells were treated with doxorubicin in the presence or absence of cAMP-elevating agents. p53 protein level and apoptosis were assessed by western blot analysis and flow cytometry, respectively. p53 protein expression was reduced in cells treated with combination of cAMP-elevating agents and doxorubicin in contrast to cells treated with doxorubicin alone even in CREB-knocked down cells.

It exists in two forms: the constitutive proteasome (20Sc) and the immunoproteasome (20Si), which both have separate diagnostic significance. The aim of this work was to develop new methods for 20Si and 20Sc determination. Five alternative specific biosensors usable with the surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRI) technique for 20Si determination have been developed. Specific 20Si entrapment on the biosensor surface from an analyzed solution was achieved by means of an immobilized specific 20Si receptor. Four of the biosensors contain newly synthesized specific 20Si receptors, while the fifth contains the inhibitor ONX 0914. A method for 20Sc determination using an SPRI biosensor containing PSI inhibitor has been developed. By the introduction of an inhibitor blocking 20Si, 20Sc is selectively determined. All of the methods developed for 20Si and 20Sc determination exhibit good selectivity and satisfactory precision, recoveries and dynamic response ranges. 20Si and 20Sc were determined in blood plasma samples from healthy donors and patients with acute leukemia. In the case of these patients 20Si was the major component, and its level was more than one order of magnitude higher than in the healthy donors.",,"['Sankiewicz, Anna', 'Markowska, Agnieszka', 'Lukaszewski, Zenon', 'Puzan, Beata', 'Gorodkiewicz, Ewa']","['Sankiewicz A', 'Markowska A', 'Lukaszewski Z', 'Puzan B', 'Gorodkiewicz E']","['Department of Electrochemistry, Institute of Chemistry, University of Bialystok, Ciolkowskiego 1K, 15-245 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Medical University of Bialystok, Kilinskiego 1, 15-089 Bialystok, Poland.', 'Faculty of Chemical Technology, Poznan University of Technology, pl.

These include genetic alterations and aberrant expression of many apoptosis regulators, among which the Bcl2 family members play a central role. AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the association of pro-apoptotic Bax gene expression and Bcl2/Bax ratio with the clinical features of CLL patients as well as with molecular prognostic markers, namely the mutational status of rearranged immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) genes and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene expression. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of Bax mRNA and Bcl2/Bax mRNA ratio in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 58 unselected CLL patients and 10 healthy controls by the quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We detected significant Bax gene overexpression in CLL samples compared to non-leukemic samples (p=0.003), as well as an elevated Bcl2/Bax ratio (p=<0.001). Regarding the association with prognostic markers, the Bcl2/Bax ratio showed a negative correlation to lymphocyte doubling time (r=-0.307; p=0.0451), while high-level Bax expression was associated with LPL-positive status (p=0.035). Both the expression of Bax and Bcl2/Bax ratio were higher in patients with unmutated vs. mutated IGHV rearrangements, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that dysregulated expression of Bcl2 and Bax, which leads to a high Bcl2/Bax ratio in leukemic cells, contributes to the pathogenesis and clinical course of CLL.",,"['Vucicevic, Ksenija', 'Jakovljevic, Vladimir', 'Colovic, Natasa', 'Tosic, Natasa', 'Kostic, Tatjana', 'Glumac, Irena', 'Pavlovic, Sonja', 'Karan-Djurasevic, Teodora', 'Colovic, Milica']","['Vucicevic K', 'Jakovljevic V', 'Colovic N', 'Tosic N', 'Kostic T', 'Glumac I', 'Pavlovic S', 'Karan-Djurasevic T', 'Colovic M']","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.', 'Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Kragujevac, Kragujevac, Serbia.', 'Hematology Clinic, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, Serbia; Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.', 'Medical Faculty, University of Belgrade, Belgrade, Serbia.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Serbia,J Med Biochem,Journal of medical biochemistry,101315490,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bax', 'Bcl2/Bax ratio', 'apoptosis', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'expression analysis']",2017/03/31 06:00,2017/03/31 06:01,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/08/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/09/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1515/jomb-2015-0017 [doi]', 'jomb-2015-0017 [pii]']",ppublish,J Med Biochem. 2016 Apr;35(2):150-157. doi: 10.1515/jomb-2015-0017.

A case report.,54-59,10.6001/actamedica.v23i1.3270 [doi],"Introduction. We report a case of a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia whose treatment with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was followed by chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) with lung involvement and bronchiectasis. This report illustrates an unusual course of a fast progression of the bronchiectasis due to BMT. Case description. A 33-year-old female was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. An allogeneic BMT was performed. One month after the transplantation, acute GVHD with skin involvement occurred. Treatment with prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been started. Nine months later, the patient was examined by a pulmonologist due to progressive dyspnoea. A pulmonary computed tomography (CT) scan showed normal parenchyma of the lungs and no changes to the bronchi. A CT scan performed 7 months later revealed bronchiectasis for the first time. No clinical response was associated with the treatment and the patient's respiratory status progressively deteriorated. During the final hospitalization, a CT scan performed 1 year later revealed huge cystic bronchiectasis in both lungs. Despite the prophylaxis and treatment of GVHD and aggressive antimicrobial therapy, the patient died one year after the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Conclusions. This case demonstrates that a fast and fatal course of bronchiectasis, that occurs after BMT, should always be considered as a possible manifestation of chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) following allogeneic BMT.",,"['Labzentyte, Violeta', 'Zemnickiene, Silvija', 'Danila, Edvardas', 'Sileikiene, Virginija', 'Zablockis, Rolandas', 'Gruslys, Vygantas']","['Labzentyte V', 'Zemnickiene S', 'Danila E', 'Sileikiene V', 'Zablockis R', 'Gruslys V']","['Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Clinic of Infectious and Chest Diseases, Dermatovenereology and Allergology, Vilnius University, Lithuania.', 'Centre of Pulmonology and Allergology, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics, Lithuania.', 'Clinic of Infectious and Chest Diseases, Dermatovenereology and Allergology, Vilnius University, Lithuania.', 'Centre of Pulmonology and Allergology, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics, Lithuania.', 'Clinic of Infectious and Chest Diseases, Dermatovenereology and Allergology, Vilnius University, Lithuania.', 'Centre of Pulmonology and Allergology, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics, Lithuania.', 'Clinic of Infectious and Chest Diseases, Dermatovenereology and Allergology, Vilnius University, Lithuania.', 'Centre of Pulmonology and Allergology, Vilnius University Hospital Santariskiu Clinics, Lithuania.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Lithuania,Acta Med Litu,Acta medica Lituanica,9442465,,,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow transplantation', 'bronchiectasis', 'chronic graft versus host disease', 'computed tomography']",2016/01/01 00:00,2016/01/01 00:01,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.6001/actamedica.v23i1.3270 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Med Litu. 2016;23(1):54-59. doi: 10.6001/actamedica.v23i1.3270.,,,PMC4924631,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients are predisposed to malignancies such as sarcoma, breast cancer, leukemia, and other malignancies. Breast cancer, the most common malignancy in adult patients with LFS, has an early-onset presentation and is usually treated as per the guidelines for the general population due to the limited literature about breast cancer in LFS. We aimed to describe our institutional experience treating patients with breast cancer and LFS to contribute to literature about this entity. DESIGN: Retrospective single-institution case-series study. We searched for cases with LFS and breast cancer from 01/01/2000 to 12/31/2015 with treatment received at our institution. RESULTS: We identified 4 cases (2 African Americans, 1 Indian, and 1 Hispanic) in 4 different families, who were diagnosed with LFS after presenting with breast cancer. Three cases were triple-negative disease and 1 case was ER+, HER2 positive disease. They were treated with mastectomy and a third-generation breast chemotherapy regimen and/or trastuzumab-containing regimen. Radiation therapy was used in 2 patients. Breast cancer recurrence was seen in 1 patient, while three other malignancies were identified after breast cancer treatment (1 breast sarcoma, 1 leiomyosarcoma, and 1 myelodysplastic syndrome). A patient, who underwent surveillance with a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, was found to have a stage I leiomyosarcoma and was treated with surgical resection, but then developed metastatic disease requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Breast cancer among patients with LFS needs a multidisciplinary treatment approach. Surgical management follows the guidelines for the general population. Risk-benefit assessment of chemotherapy and radiotherapy needs to be performed carefully in a case-by-case approach. Patients should undergo multimodality cancer surveillance, preferably in the context of a clinical trial.",,"['Nandikolla, Amara G', 'Venugopal, Sangeetha', 'Anampa, Jesus']","['Nandikolla AG', 'Venugopal S', 'Anampa J']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press),Breast cancer (Dove Medical Press),101591856,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Li-Fraumeni syndrome', 'TP53', 'breast cancer', 'hereditary breast cancer']",2017/03/31 06:00,2017/03/31 06:01,['2017/03/31 06:00'],"['2017/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/BCTT.S134241 [doi]', 'bctt-9-207 [pii]']",epublish,Breast Cancer (Dove Med Press). 2017 Mar 23;9:207-215. doi: 10.2147/BCTT.S134241. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5367777,,20170323,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,

However, their roles in glioblastoma (GBM) remain unexplored. Here, through a functional screening of ZBTB genes, we identify that BCL6 is required for GBM cell viability and that BCL6 overexpression is associated with worse prognosis. In a somatic transgenic mouse model, depletion of Bcl6 inhibits the progression of KrasG12V-driven high-grade glioma. Transcriptome analysis demonstrates the involvement of BCL6 in tumor protein p53 (TP53), erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ErbB), and MAPK signaling pathways. Indeed, BCL6 represses the expression of wild-type p53 and its target genes in GBM cells. Knockdown of BCL6 augments the activation of TP53 pathway in response to radiation. Importantly, we discover that receptor tyrosine kinase AXL is a transcriptional target of BCL6 in GBM and mediates partially the regulatory effects of BCL6 on both MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and S6K-RPS6 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase-ribosomal protein S6) axes. Similar to BCL6 silencing, depletion of AXL profoundly attenuates GBM proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, targeted inhibition of BCL6/nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR) complex by peptidomimetic inhibitor not only significantly decreases AXL expression and the activity of MEK-ERK and S6K-RPS6 cascades but also displays a potent antiproliferative effect against GBM cells.

The MEK5/ERK5 MAPK cascade is essential for the early step of myogenesis. In this study, we generated C2C12 stable cell lines that expressed YAP (C2C12-YAP cells) and found that ERK5 and MEK5 were activated in C2C12-YAP cells compared with control C2C12 (C2C12-vector) cells. C2C12-YAP stable cells also differentiated into myotubes better than C2C12-vector cells, and expressed elevated levels of myogenin, a transcription factor that regulates myogenesis, as well as elevated levels of myosin heavy chain, a skeletal muscle marker. Western blot analysis revealed that Src and c-Abl (Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1) activation were enhanced in C2C12-YAP cells. Conversely, treatment of inhibitors of c-Abl, Src, or MEK5 inhibited activation of MEK5 and ERK5 and myogenesis of C2C12 myoblasts. Specific interactions between YAP and proteins in the ERK5 pathway, such as MEK kinase 3 (MEKK3) and ERK5, were illustrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. MEKK3 contains the PPGY motif (aa 178-181), which may interact with YAP. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that expression of MEKK3 Y181F mutant inhibited MEK5/ERK5 activation and myogenic differentiation. These results suggest that YAP promotes muscle differentiation by activating the Abl/Src/MEKK3/MEK5/ERK5 kinase cascade.-Chen, T.-H., Chen, C.-Y., Wen, H.-C., Chang, C.-C., Wang, H.-D., Chuu, C.-P., Chang, C.-H.

In this retrospective analysis, short-acting L-asparaginase (L-ASP) and long-acting polyethylene glycol (PEG)-asparaginase (PEG-ASP) were compared for grade 3-4 toxicities and characterized by patient and drug-related factors to identify strategies for toxicity avoidance in adults with ALL. Asparaginase was administered during sequential courses of chemotherapy using a pediatric-inspired treatment regimen. Forty-eight patients who received PEG-ASP and nine patients who received L-ASP were identified. The rates of toxicity were as follows for the PEG-ASP and L-ASP groups, respectively: hepatotoxicity (60% vs. 33%, P = 0.275), pancreatitis (17% vs. 22%, P = 0.650), thrombosis (19.0% vs. 0%, P = 0.328), or any grade 3-4 toxicity (71% vs. 44%, P = 0.143). Toxicity did not correlate with dose, either by individual dose based on flat or BSA-based measures. Logistic regression identified obesity as a risk factor for heptatotoxicity (OR = 8.44, 95% CI: 1.395-51.117). Hypofibrinogenemia was identified as a pharmacodynamic marker for predicting hepatotoxicity.

We evaluated via univariate and multivariate analyses the diagnostic biomarkers, and the cutoff levels used in the CDSS, except those for fibrinogen, were found to be valid. In subgroup analyses, the value of fibrinogen was found to be mainly unfit for the acute promyelocytic leukemia group. Forty-six patients (17.7%) had elevated fibrinogen levels (>4 g/L) and tended to have a poor prognosis, and thus we redetermined the cutoff value of fibrinogen (<1 g/L or >4 g/L was defined as abnormal). As a result, all of the markers used in the CDSS had prognostic value (including for the promyelocytic leukemia group); meanwhile, this modification also resulted in a larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared to the CDSS and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis score. We believe that, with regard to prognosis prediction, this cutoff value modification for fibrinogen is preferable for DIC patients with a tendency toward severe hypofibrinogenemia.

Through an ex vivo functional screen of 94 cytokines, we identified that the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) elicited profound expansion of myeloid progenitors in approximately 67% of AML patients while suppressing the growth of normal progenitors. Levels of IL-1beta and IL-1 receptors were increased in AML patients, and silencing of the IL-1 receptor led to significant suppression of clonogenicity and in vivo disease progression. IL-1 promoted AML cell growth by enhancing p38MAPK phosphorylation and promoting secretion of various other growth factors and inflammatory cytokines. Treatment with p38MAPK inhibitors reversed these effects and recovered normal CD34(+) cells from IL-1-mediated growth suppression. These results highlight the importance of ex vivo functional screening to identify common and actionable extrinsic pathways in genetically heterogeneous malignancies and provide impetus for clinical development of IL-1/IL1R1/p38MAPK pathway-targeted therapies in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

Broad-spectrum antifungal prophylaxis seems logical, but selective use is important due to its substantial disadvantages, including interference with diagnostic assays, selection for resistance, drug toxicity and drug-drug interactions. Antimould prophylaxis should be restricted to high-risk groups, such as patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, allogeneic HSCT patients with prior invasive fungal infection, graft-versus-host-disease or extended neutropenia, recipients of a solid organ transplant, or patients with a high-risk inherited immunodeficiency. An empirical approach, whereby mould-active therapy is started in neutropenic patients with fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, is widely applied but incurs the clinical and cost penalties associated with overtreatment. A benefit for all-cause mortality using empirical therapy has not been shown, but it is recommended for high-risk patients who remain febrile after 4-7 days of broad-spectrum antibiotics and in whom extended neutropenia is anticipated. There is growing interest in delaying antifungal treatment until an invasive fungal infection is confirmed ('pre-emptive' or 'diagnostics-driven' management), prompted by the development of more sensitive diagnostic techniques. Comparisons of empirical versus pre-emptive regimens are sparse, particularly with modern triazole agents, but treatment costs are lower with pre-emptive therapy and the available evidence has not indicated reduced efficacy. Pre-emptive treatment may be appropriate in neutropenic patients who remain febrile after administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics but who are clinically stable. Further work is required to define accurately the specific patient subgroups in which each management approach is optimal.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Here we use imaging to track granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) behaviour in mice during emergency and leukaemic myelopoiesis. In the steady state, we find individual GMPs scattered throughout the bone marrow. During regeneration, we observe expanding GMP patches forming defined GMP clusters, which, in turn, locally differentiate into granulocytes. The timed release of important bone marrow niche signals (SCF, IL-1beta, G-CSF, TGFbeta and CXCL4) and activation of an inducible Irf8 and beta-catenin progenitor self-renewal network control the transient formation of regenerating GMP clusters. In leukaemia, we show that GMP clusters are constantly produced owing to persistent activation of the self-renewal network and a lack of termination cytokines that normally restore haematopoietic stem-cell quiescence. Our results uncover a previously unrecognized dynamic behaviour of GMPs in situ, which tunes emergency myelopoiesis and is hijacked in leukaemia.",,"['Herault, Aurelie', 'Binnewies, Mikhail', 'Leong, Stephanie', 'Calero-Nieto, Fernando J', 'Zhang, Si Yi', 'Kang, Yoon-A', 'Wang, Xiaonan', 'Pietras, Eric M', 'Chu, S Haihua', 'Barry-Holson, Keegan', 'Armstrong, Scott', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle']","['Herault A', 'Binnewies M', 'Leong S', 'Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Zhang SY', 'Kang YA', 'Wang X', 'Pietras EM', 'Chu SH', 'Barry-Holson K', 'Armstrong S', 'Gottgens B', 'Passegue E']","['The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Cambridge University Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Cambridge University Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."", 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA."", 'Cambridge University Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Wellcome Trust and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0XY, UK.', 'The Eli and Edythe Broad Center of Regeneration Medicine and Stem Cell Research, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Self Renewal', 'Cellular Reprogramming', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Progenitor Cells/*cytology/*pathology', 'Granulocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Imaging', '*Myelopoiesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Niche/physiology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",,,2017/03/30 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/03/30 06:00'],"['2016/02/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['nature21693 [pii]', '10.1038/nature21693 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2017 Apr 6;544(7648):53-58. doi: 10.1038/nature21693.

Here, we evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of blinatumomab in patients with relapsed or refractory Ph(+) ALL. Patients and Methods This open-label phase II study enrolled adults with Ph(+) ALL who had relapsed after or were refractory to at least one second-generation or later TKI or were intolerant to second-generation or later TKIs and intolerant or refractory to imatinib. Blinatumomab was administered in 28-day cycles by continuous intravenous infusion. The primary end point was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) during the first two cycles. Major secondary end points included minimal residual disease response, rate of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, relapse-free survival, overall survival, and adverse events (AEs). Results Of 45 patients, 16 (36%; 95% CI, 22% to 51%) achieved CR/CRh during the first two cycles, including four of 10 patients with the T315I mutation; 88% of CR/CRh responders achieved a complete minimal residual disease response. Seven responders (44%) proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, including 55% (six of 11) of transplantation-naive responders. Median relapse-free survival and overall survival were 6.7 and 7.1 months, respectively. The most frequent AEs were pyrexia (58%), febrile neutropenia (40%), and headache (31%). Three patients had cytokine release syndrome (all grade 1 or 2), and three patients had grade 3 neurologic events, one of which (aphasia) required temporary treatment interruption. There were no grade 4 or 5 neurologic events. Conclusion Single-agent blinatumomab showed antileukemia activity in high-risk patients with Ph(+) ALL who had relapsed or were refractory to TKIs. AEs were consistent with previous experience in Ph(-) ALL.",,"['Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Boissel, Nicolas', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Ottmann, Oliver', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Topp, Max S', 'Fielding, Adele K', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Ritchie, Ellen K', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Sterling, Lulu Ren', 'Benjamin, Jonathan', 'Stein, Anthony']","['Martinelli G', 'Boissel N', 'Chevallier P', 'Ottmann O', 'Gokbuget N', 'Topp MS', 'Fielding AK', 'Rambaldi A', 'Ritchie EK', 'Papayannidis C', 'Sterling LR', 'Benjamin J', 'Stein A']","['Giovanni Martinelli and Cristina Papayannidis, Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology ""L. and A.

METHOD: A repeat-dose dose-ranging toxicity study was designed to determine the tolerability of DHA-dFdC when administered to DBA/2 mice by intravenous (i.v.) injection on a repeat-dose schedule (i.e. injections on days 0, 3, 7, 10, and 13). In order to determine the effect of a lethal dose of DHA-dFdC, mice were injected i.v. with three doses of DHA-dFdC at 100 mg/kg on days 0, 3, and 5 (i.e. a lethal-RD). The body weight of mice was recorded two or three times a week. At the end of the study, major organs (i.e. heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, lung, and pancreas) of mice that received the lethal-RD or RD-MTD were weighed, and blood samples were collected for analyses. Finally, DHA-dFdC was i.v. injected into DBA/2 mice with syngeneic L1210 mouse leukemia cells to evaluate its efficacy at or below RD-MTD. RESULTS: The RD-MTD of DHA-dFdC is 50 mg/kg. At 100 mg/kg, a lethal-RD, DHA-dFdC decreases the weights of mouse spleen and liver and significantly affected certain blood parameters (i.e. white blood cells, lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophil segmented). At or below its RD-MTD, DHA-dFdC significantly prolonged the survival of L1210 leukemia-bearing mice. CONCLUSION: DHA-dFdC has dose-dependent toxicity, affecting mainly spleen at a lethal-RD. At or below its RD-MTD, DHA-dFdC is effective against leukemia in a mouse model.",,"['Valdes, Solange', 'Naguib, Youssef W', 'Finch, Rick A', 'Baze, Wallace B', 'Jolly, Christopher A', 'Cui, Zhengrong']","['Valdes S', 'Naguib YW', 'Finch RA', 'Baze WB', 'Jolly CA', 'Cui Z']","['Pharmaceutics Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712, USA.', 'Pharmaceutics Division, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas, 78712, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, Michale E.

In 2008, she was found abnormal in blood routine test, after bone marrow routine, chromosome and fusion gene tests, she was diagnosed with CML (chronic phase). She did not receive regular treatment until 3 months prior, and is currently being treated with Dasatimib. She achieved hematological remission, but had no significant improvement in chromosome and fusion gene figures.

In this study, we observed the impact of Haishengsu (Hss) on the proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 cells in the leukemic cell line by taking tretinoin and AS2O3 as a positive control and making a comparative analysis between the effect of Hss and tretinoin and AS2O3. We found that Hss could significantly inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells and caused most of the cells to stay in the G0/G1 phase. Its effect was much stronger than that of tretinoin and AS2O3, and the ability of Hss to induce differentiation was close to tretinoin. Hss functions probably by inhibiting the expression of the Bcl-2 and MPO genes and further promoting the expression of the Bax gene. Hss has a significant effect on both inhibiting the proliferation and inducing the differentiation of HL-60 cells.

APL was first described as a distinct subtype of AML in 1957 by Dr Leif Hillestad who recognized the pattern of an acute leukemia associated with fibrinolysis, hypofibrinogenemia and catastrophic hemorrhage. In the intervening years, the characteristic morphology of APL has been described fully with both classical hypergranular and variant microgranular forms. Both are characterized by a balanced translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17, [t(15;17)(q24;q21)], giving rise to a unique fusion gene PML-RARA and an abnormal chimeric transcription factor (PML-RARA), which disrupts normal myeloid differentiation programs. The success of current treatments for APL is in marked contrast to the vast majority of patients with non-promyelocytic AML. The overall prognosis in non-promyelocytic AML is poor, and although there has been an improvement in overall survival in patients aged <60 years, only 30%-40% of younger patients are still alive 5 years after diagnosis. APL therapy has diverged from standard AML therapy through the empirical discovery of two agents that directly target the molecular basis of the disease. The evolution of treatment over the last 4 decades to include all-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide, with chemotherapy limited to patients with high-risk disease, has led to complete remission in 90%-100% of patients in trials and rates of overall survival between 86% and 97%.",,"['McCulloch, Derek', 'Brown, Christina', 'Iland, Harry']","['McCulloch D', 'Brown C', 'Iland H']","['Institute of Hematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Hematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.', 'Institute of Hematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ATRA', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic trioxide']",2017/03/30 06:00,2017/03/30 06:01,['2017/03/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S100513 [doi]', 'ott-10-1585 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2017 Mar 14;10:1585-1601. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S100513. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5359123,,20170314,,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,['Onco Targets Ther. 2017 May 08;10 :2511-2512.

Several recent studies have shown that SDF1-3'A polymorphism (rs1801157) is associated with susceptibility to hematological malignancy, but published studies' results are disputed. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the relationship between SDF1-3'A polymorphism and the risk of hematological malignancy based on the existing literature. We carried out a comprehensive literature search using the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Chinese Wan Fang, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. And the raw data were extracted and calculated in standard steps of meta-analysis. Overall, nine qualified studies containing 1,576 cases and 1,674 controls were included in the ultimate meta-analysis. The pooled results displayed that AA genotype significantly increased the risk of hematological malignancy. The result of subgroup analysis further indicated that SDF1-3'A polymorphism was significantly associated with increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma, but was not associated with increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In addition, SDF1-3'A polymorphism was associated with increased risk of hematological malignancy in Africans and Asians, but not in Caucasians. In conclusion, our meta-analysis firstly demonstrated that SDF1-3'A polymorphism may be associated with increased risk of hematological malignancy, especially for chronic myeloid leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma and the non-Caucasian population.

Whether this receptor plays a functional role in leukemogenesis remains unknown. We identified endoglin expression on the majority of blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Using a xenograft model, we find that CD105(+) blasts are endowed with superior leukemogenic activity compared with the CD105(-) population. We test the effect of targeting this receptor using the monoclonal antibody TRC105, and find that in AML, TRC105 prevented the engraftment of primary AML blasts and inhibited leukemia progression following disease establishment, but in B-ALL, TRC105 alone was ineffective due to the shedding of soluble CD105. However, in both B-ALL and AML, TRC105 synergized with reduced intensity myeloablation to inhibit leukemogenesis, indicating that TRC105 may represent a novel therapeutic option for B-ALL and AML.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Dourado, Keina M C', 'Baik, June', 'Oliveira, Vanessa K P', 'Beltrame, Miriam', 'Yamamoto, Ami', 'Theuer, Charles P', 'Figueiredo, Camila A V', 'Verneris, Michael R', 'Perlingeiro, Rita C R']","['Dourado KMC', 'Baik J', 'Oliveira VKP', 'Beltrame M', 'Yamamoto A', 'Theuer CP', 'Figueiredo CAV', 'Verneris MR', 'Perlingeiro RCR']","['Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Instituto de Ciencias da Saude, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Laboratory for the Diagnosis of Onco-Hematological Disorders, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'TRACON Pharmaceuticals, Inc, San Diego, CA; and.', 'Instituto de Ciencias da Saude, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Brazil.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Lillehei Heart Institute, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9412-1118'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endoglin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2017/03/30 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2017/03/30 06:00'],"['2017/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33418-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2017-01-763581 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 May 4;129(18):2526-2536. doi: 10.1182/blood-2017-01-763581.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Infection-related mortality was evaluated retrospectively in 49 pediatric patients. RESULTS: A total of 173 chemotherapy courses were administered as first-line chemotherapy. Four patients died during induction: one patient due to intracranial bleeding, two patients due to typhlitis, and one patient due to invasive fungal infection with pulmonary vascular invasion and massive bleeding. Another two patients died with resistant disease. During consolidation there were four infection-related deaths and one death due to cardiotoxicity. In first-line chemotherapy mortality was 22% (11/49); infection-related mortality was 14% (7/49). Event-free survival and overall survival at 6 years were 42.9% and 61.2% (95% CI: 44-76 and 66-99 months), respectively.

Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is highly expressed in TNBC, where level of overexpression correlates with poor prognosis and an aggressive disease course. Herein, we describe the discovery through targeted kinase inhibitor library screening, and structure-guided design of a series of ATP-competitive indolinone derivatives with subnanomolar inhibition constants towards MELK. The most potent compound, 17, inhibits the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and proliferation of TNBC cells exhibiting selectivity for cells expressing high levels of MELK. These studies suggest that further elaboration of 17 will furnish MELK-selective inhibitors with potential for development in preclinical models of TNBC and other cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Such an approach does not allow an examination of the correlates of meeting the combined guidelines versus a single guideline, or one guideline versus the other. Here, we report the prevalence and correlates of meeting the combined and independent exercise guidelines in hematologic cancer survivors (HCS). METHODS: In a population-based, cross-sectional survey of 606 HCS from Alberta, Canada using a mailed questionnaire, we obtained separate assessments of aerobic and strength exercise behaviors, as well as separate assessments for motivations, regulations, and reflective processes using the multi-process action control framework (M-PAC). RESULTS: Overall, 22% of HCS met the combined exercise guideline, 22% met aerobic-only, 10% met strength-only, and 46% met neither exercise guideline. HCS were more likely to meet the combined guideline over the aerobic-only guideline if they had no children living at home, and over both the aerobic and strength-only guidelines if they had completed university. As hypothesized, those meeting the combined guideline also had a more favorable strength-specific M-PAC profile (i.e., motivations, regulations, and reflective processes) than those meeting the aerobic-only guideline, and a more favorable aerobic-specific M-PAC profile than those meeting the strength-only guideline. Interestingly and unexpectedly, HCS meeting the combined guidelines also reported significantly greater aerobic-specific perceived control, planning, and obligation/regret than those meeting the aerobic-only guideline, and greater strength-specific perceived control, planning, and obligation/regret than those meeting the strength-only guideline. CONCLUSIONS: Few HCS are meeting the combined exercise guidelines. M-PAC based variables are strong correlates of meeting the combined guidelines compared to aerobic or strength only guidelines. Strategies to help HCS meet the combined guidelines may need to promote more favorable behavioral regulations and reflective processes for both types of exercise rather than just the type of exercise in which HCS are deficient.",,"['Vallerand, James R', 'Rhodes, Ryan E', 'Walker, Gordon J', 'Courneya, Kerry S']","['Vallerand JR', 'Rhodes RE', 'Walker GJ', 'Courneya KS']","['Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'School of Exercise Science, Physical & Health Education, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, Canada.', 'Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada. kerry.courneya@ualberta.ca.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act,The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,101217089,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alberta', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Educational Status', '*Exercise/psychology', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Guidelines as Topic', '*Health Behavior', '*Hodgkin Disease', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Motivation', 'Muscle Strength', '*Patient Compliance/psychology/statistics & numerical data', 'Resistance Training', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Survivors/psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Intention-behavior gap', '*M-PAC', '*Multi-process action control framework', '*Physical activity']",2017/03/30 06:00,2017/07/06 06:00,['2017/03/30 06:00'],"['2017/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12966-017-0498-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12966-017-0498-7 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Behav Nutr Phys Act. 2017 Mar 28;14(1):44. doi: 10.1186/s12966-017-0498-7.,['CIHR/Canada'],,PMC5371229,,20170328,,,,,,,,,,,

In this focused review, we discuss the utility of established MDS prognostic models and a novel tool at the time of HMA failure, along with the strengths and limitations of each.",,"['Patel, Sagar S', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Nazha, Aziz']","['Patel SS', 'Sekeres MA', 'Nazha A']","['a Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland , OH , USA.', 'a Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland , OH , USA.', 'a Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology , Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic , Cleveland , OH , USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9949-3615'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*hypomethylating agents', '*prognostic models', '*risk stratification']",2017/03/30 06:00,2018/04/18 06:00,['2017/03/30 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2017.1307361 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Nov;58(11):2532-2539. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2017.1307361.

We investigated the potential of a cocktail of small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed against the oncoprotein E6 (E6), the oncoprotein E7 (E7), or the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 (MCL-1). The combination of siRNA anti-E7 and anti-MCL-1 demonstrated high efficacy on multiple HPV16 and HPV18 cell lines and no effects on healthy keratinocytes. This gene therapy has been considered for a vaginal administration since this route of application holds high potential for the treatment of diseases in the female reproductive tracts. Therefore, PEGylated lipoplexes have been designed and characterized to protect siRNA and to diffuse in the mucosal environment before they reach the cervico/vaginal epithelium. This new nanovector complexed to the combination of active siRNA induced an efficient mRNA knockdown since biological effects were obtained in vitro. This work also provided evidence that the PEGylated lipoplexes had appropriate physicochemical properties to diffuse into a mucin network according to size measurement experiments in artificial mucus. After demonstrating the distribution and the efficacy of siRNA into a 3D-cervical model lesion and through porcine vaginal mucosa, in vivo experiments in mouse have been performed under physiological conditions. This study revealed a complete and sustained coverage of the mucosal epithelium following an unique vaginal administration of fluorescent PEGylated lipoplexes. Overall, our results showed the potential of the PEGylated lipoplexes for the prolonged delivery of active siRNA to treat HPV-induced lesions.",,"['Lechanteur, Anna', 'Furst, Tania', 'Evrard, Brigitte', 'Delvenne, Philippe', 'Piel, Geraldine', 'Hubert, Pascale']","['Lechanteur A', 'Furst T', 'Evrard B', 'Delvenne P', 'Piel G', 'Hubert P']","['Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM and double daggerLaboratory of Experimental Pathology, GIGA-Cancer, University of Liege , 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM and double daggerLaboratory of Experimental Pathology, GIGA-Cancer, University of Liege , 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM and double daggerLaboratory of Experimental Pathology, GIGA-Cancer, University of Liege , 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM and double daggerLaboratory of Experimental Pathology, GIGA-Cancer, University of Liege , 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM and double daggerLaboratory of Experimental Pathology, GIGA-Cancer, University of Liege , 4000 Liege, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmacy, CIRM and double daggerLaboratory of Experimental Pathology, GIGA-Cancer, University of Liege , 4000 Liege, Belgium.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6586-8896'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Human papillomavirus 16/genetics', 'Human papillomavirus 18/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Papillomavirus E7 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Swine', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Vagina/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HPV', '*PEG', '*cervical cancer', '*lipoplexes', '*siRNA', '*vaginal']",2017/03/30 06:00,2018/02/21 06:00,['2017/03/29 06:00'],"['2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01154 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2017 May 1;14(5):1706-1717. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.6b01154.

Second-line treatments, including hypomethylating agents (HMAs), lenalidomide (LEN), and investigational drugs, may be used after ESA failure in some countries, but their effect on disease progression and overall survival (OS) is unknown. Here, we analyzed outcome after ESA failure and the effect of second-line treatments. Patients and Methods We examined an international retrospective cohort of 1,698 patients with non-del(5q) lower-risk MDS treated with ESAs. Results Erythroid response to ESAs was 61.5%, and median response duration was 17 months. Of 1,147 patients experiencing ESA failure, 653 experienced primary failure and 494 experienced relapse after a response. Primary failure of ESAs was associated with a higher risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression, which did not translate into an OS difference. Of 450 patients (39%) who received second-line treatment, 194 received HMAs, 148 received LEN, and 108 received other treatments (MISC), whereas 697 received RBC transfusions only. Five-year AML cumulative incidence was 20.3%, 20.3%, and 11.3% for those receiving HMAs, LEN, and MISC, respectively ( P = .05). Five-year OS for patients receiving HMA, LEN, and MISC was 36.5%, 41.7%, and 51%, respectively ( P = .21). In a multivariable analysis adjusted for age, sex, revised International Prognostic Scoring System score, and progression at ESA failure, there was no significant OS difference among the three groups. Conclusion In this large, multicenter, retrospective cohort of patients with non-del(5q) lower-risk MDS treated with ESAs, none of the most commonly used second-line treatments (HMA and LEN) significantly improved OS. Early failure of ESAs was associated with a higher risk of AML progression.",,"['Park, Sophie', 'Hamel, Jean-Francois', 'Toma, Andrea', 'Kelaidi, Charikleia', 'Thepot, Sylvain', 'Campelo, Maria Diez', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Balleari, Enrico', 'Kaivers, Jennifer', 'Sapena, Rosa', 'Gotze, Katharina', 'Muller-Thomas, Catharina', 'Beyne-Rauzy, Odile', 'Stamatoullas, Aspasia', 'Kotsianidis, Ioannis', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Steensma, David P', 'Fensterl, Jaime', 'Roboz, Gail J', 'Bernal, Teresa', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Calabuig, Marisa', 'Guerci-Bresler, Agnes', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Cheze, Stephane', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Rose, Christian', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Gioia, Daniela', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Cametti, Giovanni', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Sanna, Alessandro', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Sanz, Guillermo F', 'Dreyfus, Francois', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Park S', 'Hamel JF', 'Toma A', 'Kelaidi C', 'Thepot S', 'Campelo MD', 'Santini V', 'Sekeres MA', 'Balleari E', 'Kaivers J', 'Sapena R', 'Gotze K', 'Muller-Thomas C', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Stamatoullas A', 'Kotsianidis I', 'Komrokji R', 'Steensma DP', 'Fensterl J', 'Roboz GJ', 'Bernal T', 'Ramos F', 'Calabuig M', 'Guerci-Bresler A', 'Bordessoule D', 'Cony-Makhoul P', 'Cheze S', 'Wattel E', 'Rose C', 'Vey N', 'Gioia D', 'Ferrero D', 'Gaidano G', 'Cametti G', 'Pane F', 'Sanna A', 'Germing U', 'Sanz GF', 'Dreyfus F', 'Fenaux P']","[""Sophie Park, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Grenoble Alpes, Universite Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble; Jean-Francois Hamel and Sylvain Thepot, CHU d'Angers; Sylvain Thepot, Universite d'Angers, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 1232, and LabEx IGO, Angers; Andrea Toma, CHU Henri Mondor, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Paris (AP-HP), Universite Paris-Est Creteil; Rosa Sapena and Pierre Fenaux, CHU Saint Louis, AP-HP, Universite Paris X; Francois Dreyfus, CHU Cochin, AP-HP, Universite Paris V, Paris; Charikleia Kelaidi, CHU Avicenne, Avicenne; Odile Beyne-Rauzy, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse; Aspasia Stamatoullas, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen; Agnes Guerci-Bresler, CHU Nancy, Nancy; Dominique Bordessoule, CHU Dupuytren, Limoges; Pascale Cony-Makhoul, Centre Hospitalier Annecy Genevois, Epagny Metz-Tessy; Stephane Cheze, CHU de Caen, Caen; Eric Wattel, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre Benite, Lyon; Christian Rose, Universite Catholique de Lille, Lille; Norbert Vey, Institut Paoli-Calmettes Marseille, Marseille, France; Maria Diez Campelo, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca; Teresa Bernal, Hospital Central de Asturias, Oviedo; Fernando Ramos, Hospital de Leon, Leon; Marisa Calabuig, Hospital Clinico de Valencia; Guillermo F.

While significant progress has been made characterising small-scale genetic mutations and larger-scale chromosomal translocations that contribute to the development of various blood cancers, less is understood about the complex microenvironment of the bone marrow (BM), which is known to be a key player in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), AML and MM. This niche acts as a sanctuary for the cancerous cells, protecting them from chemotherapeutics and encouraging clonal cell survival. It does this by upregulating a plethora of signalling cascades within the malignant cell, with the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway taking a critical role. This review will focus on how the PI3K pathway influences disease progression and the individualised role of the PI3K subunits.

The derivation of high-quality (so-called ""true naive state"") iPSCs of non-human primates enhances their application and safety for human regenerative medicine. Although several attempts have been made to convert human and non-human primate PSCs into a truly naive state, it is unclear which evaluation methods can discriminate them as being truly naive. Here we attempted to derive naive cynomolgus monkey (Cm) (Macaca fascicularis) embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and iPSCs. Several characteristics of naive Cm ESCs including colony morphology, appearance of naive-related mRNAs and proteins, leukaemia inhibitory factor dependency, and mitochondrial respiration were confirmed. Next, we generated Cm iPSCs and converted them to a naive state. Transcriptomic comparison of PSCs with early Cm embryos elucidated the partial achievement (termed naive-like) of their conversion. When these were subjected to in vitro neural differentiation, enhanced differentiating capacities were observed after naive-like conversion, but some lines exhibited heterogeneity. The difficulty of achieving contribution to chimeric mouse embryos was also demonstrated. These results suggest that Cm PSCs could ameliorate their in vitro neural differentiation potential even though they could not display true naive characteristics.",,"['Honda, Arata', 'Kawano, Yoshihiro', 'Izu, Haruna', 'Choijookhuu, Narantsog', 'Honsho, Kimiko', 'Nakamura, Tomonori', 'Yabuta, Yukihiro', 'Yamamoto, Takuya', 'Takashima, Yasuhiro', 'Hirose, Michiko', 'Sankai, Tadashi', 'Hishikawa, Yoshitaka', 'Ogura, Atsuo', 'Saitou, Mitinori']","['Honda A', 'Kawano Y', 'Izu H', 'Choijookhuu N', 'Honsho K', 'Nakamura T', 'Yabuta Y', 'Yamamoto T', 'Takashima Y', 'Hirose M', 'Sankai T', 'Hishikawa Y', 'Ogura A', 'Saitou M']","['Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, 5200, Kibara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'RIKEN BioResource Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.', 'Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, 5200, Kibara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, 5200, Kibara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Histochemistry and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Organization for Promotion of Tenure Track, University of Miyazaki, 5200, Kibara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'JST, ERATO, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'JST, ERATO, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Ushinomiya-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'AMED-CREST, AMED, 1-7-1 Otemachi, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100-0004, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'RIKEN BioResource Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.', 'Tsukuba Primate Research Center, National Institute of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0843, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy, Histochemistry and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'RIKEN BioResource Center, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0074, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'JST, ERATO, Yoshida-Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.', 'Center for iPS Cell Research and Application, Kyoto University, 53 Kawahara-cho, Shogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Ushinomiya-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Macaca fascicularis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptome/drug effects']",,,2017/03/30 06:00,2018/11/14 06:00,['2017/03/29 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['srep45285 [pii]', '10.1038/srep45285 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Mar 28;7:45285. doi: 10.1038/srep45285.,,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)']",PMC5368663,,20170328,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine whether overexpression also extends to other leukemic subtypes than the ones karyotypically involving AML1. We use quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction methodology to investigate gene expression in 100 children with acute leukemias and compare them to those of healthy controls. We show that in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, AML1 gene overexpression is associated with a variety of leukemic subtypes, both immunophenotypically and cytogenetically. Statistically significantly higher transcripts of the gene were detected in the acute lymphoblastic leukemia group as compared to the acute myeloid leukemia group, where AML1 overexpression appeared to associate with cytogenetic abnormalities additional to those that engage the AML1 gene, or that are reported as showing a ""normal"" karyotype.

This is the first study assessing the expression of SMAD-1/8, SMAD-2/3, SMAD-4, and SMAD-7 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells with regard to their clinical significance and potential prognostic value. Overexpression of SMAD-1/8 was observed in 160 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients compared to 42 healthy volunteers (p = 0.023) and was associated with a more progressive course of the disease (p = 0.016). Moreover, the high expression of SMAD-1/8 correlated with other, well-established prognostic factors, including clinical stage (p = 0.010) and lymphocyte doubling time (p = 0.021). The expression of SMAD-4 was lower in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients compared with the control group (p = 0.003). Importantly, lower SMAD-4 levels correlated with longer progression-free survival (p = 0.009), progressive course of the disease (p = 0.002), advanced clinical stage (p = 0.0004), elevated beta-2-microglobulin and lactate dehydrogenase levels (p < 0.05), shorter lymphocyte doubling time (p = 0.009), and CD38 antigen expression (p = 0.039). In addition, lower SMAD-4 expression correlated with lower apoptotic index (p = 0.0007) and lower expression of receptors for vascular endothelial growth factors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. A significant association was found between the low expression of inhibitory protein SMAD-7 and both zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70-negative cells (p = 0.04) and lower apoptotic index (p = 0.004). No differences were observed in SMAD-2/3 expression. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a significant correlation between greater SMAD-1/8 and lower SMAD-4 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, as well as more progressive outcome and poor prognosis.

Low activity phenotypes are correlated with polymorphism in the TPMT gene. Patients with low or undetectable TMPT activity could develop severe myelosuppression when they are treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. Since ethnic differences in the TPMT gene polymorphism have been demonstrated worldwide, assessing it in the Libyan population is worthwhile. Methods We investigated TPMT gene polymorphism in a total of 246 Libyan healthy adult blood donors from three different Libyan regions (Tripoli, Yefren, and Tawargha) and 50 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We used polymerase chain reaction restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allele-specific PCR-based assays to analyse the TPMT gene for the variants *2 c.238 G>C, 3A (c.460 G>A and c.719 A>G), *3B (c.460 G>A), and *3C (c.719 A>G). Results Our results show that the TPMT variants associated with low enzymatic activity were detected in 3.25% (8 in 246) of adult Libyan individuals and the frequency of total mutant alleles was 1.63%. Heterozygous genotypes were TPMT*3A in three subjects (0.61%) and TPMT*3C in five subjects (1.02%). No TPMT*2 and TPMT*3B allelic variants and no homozygous or compound heterozygous mutant alleles were detected. The normal allele (wild-type) was found in 98.4% of the adult individuals studied. No mutant alleles were detected among the 50 children who had ALL. Conclusions We report on the presence of the TPMT*3C and *3A mutant alleles in the Libyan population. Therefore, monitoring the patients to be treated with doses of thiopurine drugs for TPMT variants is worthwhile to avoid the development of severe myelosuppression.",,"['Zeglam, Hamza Ben', 'Benhamer, Abdrazak', 'Aboud, Adel', 'Rtemi, Haitem', 'Mattardi, Meftah', 'Saleh, Saleh Suleiman', 'Bashein, Abdullah', 'Enattah, Nabil']","['Zeglam HB', 'Benhamer A', 'Aboud A', 'Rtemi H', 'Mattardi M', 'Saleh SS', 'Bashein A', 'Enattah N']","['a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.', 'a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.', 'a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.', 'a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.', 'a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.', 'a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.', 'b Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Medicine, University of Tripoli, Tripoli , Libya.', 'a Department of Genetic Engineering Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli , Libya.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Libyan J Med,The Libyan journal of medicine,101299403,,,['NOTNLM'],"['TPMT gene', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'polymorphisms', 'thiopurine drugs']",2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2017/03/29 06:00'],"['2017/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3402/ljm.v10.27053 [doi]'],ppublish,Libyan J Med. 2015 Jan;10(1):27053. doi: 10.3402/ljm.v10.27053.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the seminal progresses realized to date with the use of novel agents, leave many practical questions unanswered. Areas covered: This review focuses on the recent data of the literature of small-kinase inhibitor (KI) molecules and how results of KI clinical trials may translate into current clinical practice. Several questions such as the advantage of combining small-KI molecules with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or with chemo-immunotherapy in comparison to targeted agents alone are discussed. Expert commentary: Nowadays the challenge is to apply the principles of chemotherapy to combine different targeted agents with nonoverlapping toxicities.

The focus of our analysis is the better understanding of this time-dependency. METHODS: In paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy (AIEOP-BFM ALL 2009), two administrations of Oncaspar((R)) (2500 U/m(2) intravenously) in induction phase (14-day interval) and one single administration in reinduction were followed by weekly monitoring of asparaginase activity. Non-linear mixed-effects modeling techniques (NONMEM) were used. Samples indicating immunological inactivation were excluded to describe the pharmacokinetics under standard conditions. Models with time-constant or time-varying clearance (CL) as well as transit compartment models with an increase in CL over a chain of compartments were investigated. RESULTS: Models with time-constant elimination could not adequately describe 6107 asparaginase activities from 1342 patients. Implementing a time-varying CL improved the fit. Modeling an increase of CL over time after dose (Emax- and Weibull-functions) were superior to models with an increase of CL over time after the first administration. However, a transit compartment model came out to be the best structural model. CONCLUSION: The increase in elimination of PEGylated asparaginase appears to be driven by physicochemical processes that are drug-related. The observed hydrolytically in vitro instability of the drug leads to the hypothesis that this increase in CL might be due to an in vivo hydrolysis of the instable ester bond between PEG and the enzyme combined with an increased elimination of the partly de-PEGylated enzyme (Trial registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov , NCT0111744).",,"['Wurthwein, Gudrun', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky, Claudia', 'Hempel, Georg', 'Gastine, Silke', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Karlsson, Mats O', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Wurthwein G', 'Lanvers-Kaminsky C', 'Hempel G', 'Gastine S', 'Moricke A', 'Schrappe M', 'Karlsson MO', 'Boos J']","['Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, Building A1, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medical Chemistry-Clinical Pharmacy, Corrensstrasse 48, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Medical Chemistry-Clinical Pharmacy, Corrensstrasse 48, 48149, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Schwanenweg 20, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel and University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Schwanenweg 20, 24105, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biosciences, Uppsala University, P.O.

The Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib and other second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as dasatinib and nilotinib have remarkable efficacy in CML treatment. However, gene mutation-mediated drug resistance remains a critical problem. Among point mutations, the Bcr-Abl T315I mutation confers resistance to these Bcr-Abl inhibitors. Previously, we have synthesized the compound (1-methyl-1H-indol-5-yl)-(3,4,5-trimethoxy-phenyl)-methanone (MPT0B002) as a novel microtubule inhibitor. In this study, we evaluated its effects on the proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of K562 CML cells and BaF3 cells expressing either wild-type Bcr-Abl (BaF3/p210) or T315I-mutated Bcr-Abl (BaF3/T315I). MPT0B002 inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in these cells but did not affect the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. It disrupted tubulin polymerization and arrested cell cycle at the G2/M phase. Treatment with MPT0B002 induced apoptosis, and this induction was associated with increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP. Furthermore, MPT0B002 can downregulate both Bcr-Abl and Bcr-Abl-T315I mRNA expressions and protein levels and the downstream signaling pathways.

Rhodococcus equi is responsible for the majority of reported cases, but Rhodococcus erythropolis, Rhodococcusgordoniae and Rhodococcusruber infections have been described. There are no prior reports of human infection with Rhodococcus fascians. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the unexpected finding of R. fascians in liver lesions incidentally noted at autopsy in an immunosuppressed patient status after bone-marrow transplant for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who died of unrelated causes (septic shock due to Clostridium difficile colitis). At autopsy, an otherwise unremarkable liver contained several dozen well-demarcated sclerotic-appearing lesions measuring 0.1-0.3 cm in size. The absence of other bacterial or fungal DNA in the setting of histologically visible organisms argues against its presence as a contaminant and raises the consideration that R. fascians represents a human pathogen for the immunocompromised. CONCLUSION: Whether it represents the sole infectious agent responsible for the miliary lesions or a partially treated co-infection is impossible to determine, but our finding continues to reinforce the importance of molecular techniques in associating organisms with sites of infection and optimizing treatment of infectious diseases.",,"['Austin, Melissa C', 'Hallstrand, Teal S', 'Hoogestraat, Daniel R', 'Balmforth, Gregory', 'Stephens, Karen', 'Butler-Wu, Susan', 'Yeung, Cecilia C S']","['Austin MC', 'Hallstrand TS', 'Hoogestraat DR', 'Balmforth G', 'Stephens K', 'Butler-Wu S', 'Yeung CC']","['Department of Pathology, Walter Reed National Military Medical Center , 8901 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20889 , USA.', 'Departments of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Washington , 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98105 , USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington , 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98105 , USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Swedish Medical Center , 5300 Tallman Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98107 , USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington , 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98105 , USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington , 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98105 , USA.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, University of Washington, 1959 NE Pacific St, Seattle, WA 98105, USA; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview ave N, Mailstop G7-910, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",,['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,JMM Case Rep,JMM case reports,101639133,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunocompromised hosts', 'Rhodococcus fascians', 'opportunistic infection', 'post-transplant complication']",2017/03/30 06:00,2017/03/30 06:01,['2017/03/29 06:00'],"['2015/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1099/jmmcr.0.005025 [doi]', 'jmmcr005025 [pii]']",epublish,JMM Case Rep. 2016 Mar 3;3(2):e005025. doi: 10.1099/jmmcr.0.005025. eCollection 2016 Mar.,,,PMC5330220,,20160303,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to a cell-intrinsic role of WNT activation in leukemia stem cells, WNT activation in the BM niche is also thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. We previously showed that the Apc-haploinsufficient mice (Apc(del/+) ) model MDS induced by an aberrant BM microenvironment. We sought to determine whether Apc, a multifunctional protein and key negative regulator of the canonical beta-catenin (Ctnnb1)/WNT-signaling pathway, mediates this disease through modulating WNT signaling, and whether inhibition of WNT signaling prevents the development of MDS in Apc(del/+) mice. Here, we demonstrate that loss of 1 copy of Ctnnb1 is sufficient to prevent the development of MDS in Apc(del/+) mice and that altered canonical WNT signaling in the microenvironment is responsible for the disease. Furthermore, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug pyrvinium delays and/or inhibits disease in Apc(del/+) mice, even when it is administered after the presentation of anemia. Other groups have observed increased nuclear CTNNB1 in stromal cells from a high frequency of MDS/AML patients, a finding that together with our results highlights a potential new strategy for treating some myeloid disorders.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Stoddart, Angela', 'Wang, Jianghong', 'Hu, Chunmei', 'Fernald, Anthony A', 'Davis, Elizabeth M', 'Cheng, Jason X', 'Le Beau, Michelle M']","['Stoddart A', 'Wang J', 'Hu C', 'Fernald AA', 'Davis EM', 'Cheng JX', 'Le Beau MM']","['Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; and.', 'University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'University of Chicago Medicine Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9776-2228', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7252-7221', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8749-2655']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Genes, APC', 'Haploinsufficiency', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, 129 Strain', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Pyrvinium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Niche/*genetics', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'beta Catenin/genetics']",,,2017/03/30 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2017/03/29 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33336-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-08-736454 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Jun 1;129(22):2959-2970. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-08-736454.

It is widely used in the culture of mouse embryonic stem cells and is implicated in the implantation of mouse model and possibly in humans. Great efforts have been made on the efficient generation of LIF to meet the requirement of this cytokine in biomedical research. However, because of the low expression level in the eukaryotic system and poor purification yields, recombinant human LIF has usually been expressed either as inclusion body or as fusion protein in E. coli (Escherichia coli). Here we introduce a simple method to express hLIF in a soluble form in E. coli and a subsequent purification method. The expression of hLIF was induced at a low temperature (16 degrees C) and most of the expressed hLIF was observed to be in a soluble form. Then by using three steps of chromatography, which could be easily scaled-up for industrial purposes, active untagged hLIF was purified with similar bioactivity compared to that of the commercial product. The endotoxin level of purified hLIF protein in our method was determined to be lower than 1EU/mug, which was also comparable to the commercial products. Furthermore, as hLIF was expressed in a soluble form, there was no need to develop the denaturation and renaturation methods. The yield of hLIF protein was evaluated to be approximately 0.7 mg hLIF from 1 g wet weight of E.coli in our method.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We previously reported the cDNA sequence of the antimicrobial peptide ABP-dHC-Cecropin A precursor cloned from drury (Hyphantria cunea) (dHC). In the present study, we synthesized and structurally characterized ABP-dHC-Cecropin A and its analog, ABP-dHC-Cecropin A-K(24). Circular dichroism spectroscopy showed that ABP-dHC-Cecropin A and its analog adopt a well-defined alpha-helical structure in a 50% trifluorethanol solution. The cytotoxicity and cell selectivity of these peptides were further examined in three leukemia cell lines and two non-cancerous cell lines. The MTT assay indicated both of these peptides have a concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect in leukemia cells, although the observed cytotoxicity was greater with ABP-dHC-Cecropin A-K(24) treatment, whereas they were not cytotoxic towards the non-cancerous cell lines. Moreover, ABP-dHC-Cecropin A and its analog had a lower hemolytic effect in human red blood cells. Together, these results suggest the peptides are selectively cytotoxic towards leukemia cells. Confocal laser scanning microscopy determined that the peptides were concentrated at the surface of the leukemia cells, and changes in the cell membrane were determined with a permeability assay, which suggested that the anticancer activity of ABP-dHC-Cecropin A and its analog is a result of its presence at the leukemia cell membrane. ABP-dHC-Cecropin A and its analog may represent a novel anticancer agent for leukemia therapy, considering its cancer cell selectivity and relatively low cytotoxicity in normal cells.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that the chlamydial deubiquitinating enzyme (Cdu) 1 localizes in the inclusion membrane and faces the cytosol with the active deubiquitinating enzyme domain. The structure of this domain revealed high similarity to mammalian deubiquitinases with a unique alpha-helix close to the substrate-binding pocket. We identified the apoptosis regulator Mcl-1 as a target that interacts with Cdu1 and is stabilized by deubiquitination at the chlamydial inclusion. A chlamydial transposon insertion mutant in the Cdu1-encoding gene exhibited increased Mcl-1 and inclusion ubiquitination and reduced Mcl-1 stabilization. Additionally, inactivation of Cdu1 led to increased sensitivity of C. trachomatis for IFNgamma and impaired infection in mice.

There is compelling evidence suggesting important roles for 4-1BB in the immune response, including cell activation and proliferation and also cytokine induction. Because of encouraging results of different agonistic monoclonal antibodies against 4-1BB in the treatment of cancer, infectious, and autoimmune diseases, 4-1BB has been suggested as an attractive target for immunotherapy. In this study, single chain variable fragment phage display libraries, Tomlinson I+J, were screened against specific synthetic oligopeptides (peptides I and II) designed from 4-1BB extracellular domain. Five rounds of panning led to selection of four 4-1BB specific single chain variable fragments (PI.12, PI.42, PII.16, and PII.29) which showed specific reaction to relevant peptides in phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The selected clones were successfully expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami 2, and their expression was confirmed by western blot analysis. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments indicated that these antibodies were able to specifically recognize 4-1BB without any cross-reactivity with other antigens. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated an acceptable specific binding of the single chain variable fragments to 4-1BB expressed on CCRF-CEM cells, while no binding was observed with an irrelevant antibody. Anti-4-1BB single chain variable fragments enhanced surface CD69 expression and interleukin-2 production in stimulated CCRF-CEM cells which confirmed the agonistic effect of the selected single chain variable fragments.

A great deal of evidence shows that p300 is involved in several diseases, including leukemia, tumors, and viral infection. Its involvement in pleiotropic biological roles and connections to diseases provide the rationale to determine how its modulation could represent an amenable drug target. Several p300 inhibitors (i.e., histone acetyltransferase inhibitors, HATis) have been described so far, but they all suffer from low potency, lack of specificity, or low cell permeability, which thus highlights the need to find more effective inhibitors. Our cinnamoyl derivative, 2,6-bis(3-bromo-4-hydroxybenzylidene)cyclohexanone (RC56), was identified as an active and selective p300 inhibitor and was proven to be a good hit candidate to investigate the structure-activity relationship toward p300. Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of new HATis structurally related to our hit; moreover, we investigate the interactions between p300 and the best-emerged hits by means of induced-fit docking and molecular-dynamics simulations, which provided insight into the peculiar chemical features that influence their activity toward the targeted enzyme.","['(c) 2017 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The objective of the current study was to investigate the impact of the Bim deletion polymorphism among patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive or ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS1)-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib. METHODS: A total of 55 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC and 14 patients with ROS1-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib were enrolled into the current study. The Bim deletion polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of the Bim deletion polymorphism and its impact on the effect of crizotinib were investigated. RESULTS: The Bim deletion polymorphism was present in 9 of 69 patients with ALK-positive or ROS1-positive NSCLC (13.0%). There were no differences noted with regard to clinicopathological features between patients with and without the Bim deletion polymorphism. Patients with the Bim deletion polymorphism had a significantly shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and lower objective response rate compared with those without (median PFS, 182 days vs 377 days [P = .008]) (objective response rate, 44.4% vs 81.7% [P =.041]) in all populations. The significant difference in PFS was observed in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC (83 days vs 305 days [P =.0304]) compared with those with ROS1-positive NSCLC (218 days vs not reached [P =.082]). Multivariate analysis indicated that the Bim deletion polymorphism was an independent predictive factor for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were treated with crizotinib (hazard ratio, 4.786 [P =.006]). CONCLUSIONS: The Bim deletion polymorphism was found to be associated with poor clinical response to crizotinib in patients with ALK fusion-positive NSCLC. Cancer 2017;123:2927-35.

These methods, although widely used, rely on the presence of known chromosomal translocations, which is a limiting factor. There is therefore a need for robust, sensitive, and specific molecular biomarkers unaffected by such limitations that would allow better risk stratification and consequently better clinical outcome. In this study we performed a transcriptome analysis of 56 pre-B cALL patients to identify expression signatures in different subtypes. In both protein-coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA), we identified subtype-specific gene signatures distinguishing pre-B cALL subtypes, particularly in t(12;21) and hyperdiploid cases. The genes up-regulated in pre-B cALL subtypes were enriched in bivalent chromatin marks in their promoters. LncRNAs is a new and under-studied class of transcripts.

However, how this virus contributes to lymphomagenesis in T or NK cells remains largely unknown. Here, we examined NF-kappaB activation in EBV-positive T or NK cell lines, SNT8, SNT15, SNT16, SNK6, and primary EBV-positive and clonally proliferating T/NK cells obtained from the peripheral blood of patients with CAEBV. Western blotting, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and immunofluorescent staining revealed persistent NF-kappaB activation in EBV-infected cell lines and primary cells from patients. Furthermore, we investigated the role of EBV in infected T cells. We performed an in vitro infection assay using MOLT4 cells infected with EBV. The infection directly induced NF-kappaB activation, promoted survival, and inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis in MOLT4 cells. The luciferase assay suggested that LMP1 mediated NF-kappaB activation in MOLT4 cells. IMD-0354, a specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB that suppresses NF-kappaB activation in cell lines, inhibited cell survival and induced apoptosis.

SGS is caused by de novo germline mutations clustering to a 12bp hotspot in exon 4 of SETBP1. Mutations in this hotspot disrupt a degron, a signal for the regulation of protein degradation, and lead to the accumulation of SETBP1 protein. Overlapping SETBP1 hotspot mutations have been observed recurrently as somatic events in leukemia. We collected clinical information of 47 SGS patients (including 26 novel cases) with germline SETBP1 mutations and of four individuals with a milder phenotype caused by de novo germline mutations adjacent to the SETBP1 hotspot. Different mutations within and around the SETBP1 hotspot have varying effects on SETBP1 stability and protein levels in vitro and in in silico modeling. Substitutions in SETBP1 residue I871 result in a weak increase in protein levels and mutations affecting this residue are significantly more frequent in SGS than in leukemia. On the other hand, substitutions in residue D868 lead to the largest increase in protein levels. Individuals with germline mutations affecting D868 have enhanced cell proliferation in vitro and higher incidence of cancer compared to patients with other germline SETBP1 mutations. Our findings substantiate that, despite their overlap, somatic SETBP1 mutations driving malignancy are more disruptive to the degron than germline SETBP1 mutations causing SGS. Additionally, this suggests that the functional threshold for the development of cancer driven by the disruption of the SETBP1 degron is higher than for the alteration in prenatal development in SGS. Drawing on previous studies of somatic SETBP1 mutations in leukemia, our results reveal a genotype-phenotype correlation in germline SETBP1 mutations spanning a molecular, cellular and clinical phenotype.",,"['Acuna-Hidalgo, Rocio', 'Deriziotis, Pelagia', 'Steehouwer, Marloes', 'Gilissen, Christian', 'Graham, Sarah A', 'van Dam, Sipko', 'Hoover-Fong, Julie', 'Telegrafi, Aida B', 'Destree,

Poor response to L-asparaginase is associated with increased risk of therapeutic failure in ALL. However, both the metabolic perturbation and molecular context of L-asparaginase-treated ALL cells has not been fully elucidated. Here we identify that treatment with L-asparaginase results in metabolic shutdown via the reduction of both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, accompanied by mitochondrial damage and activation of autophagy. The autophagy is involved in reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) level by eliminating injured mitochondria. Inhibition of autophagy enhances L-asparaginase-induced cytotoxicity and overcomes the acquired resistance to L-asparaginase in ALL cells. The ROS-p53-positive feedback loop is an essential mechanism of this synergistic cytotoxicity. Thus, our findings provide the rationale for the future development of combined treatment of L-asparaginase and anti-autophagy drug in ALL patients.",,"['Takahashi, H', 'Inoue, J', 'Sakaguchi, K', 'Takagi, M', 'Mizutani, S', 'Inazawa, J']","['Takahashi H', 'Inoue J', 'Sakaguchi K', 'Takagi M', 'Mizutani S', 'Inazawa J']","['Department of Molecular Cytogenetics, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Bioresource Research Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Cytogenetics, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Bioresource Research Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Shizuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Cytogenetics, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.', 'Bioresource Research Center, Tokyo Medical and Dental University (TMDU), Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stress, Physiological/*drug effects']",,,2017/03/28 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2017/03/28 06:00'],"['2016/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc201759 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2017.59 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jul 27;36(30):4267-4276. doi: 10.1038/onc.2017.59.

We analyze outcomes of patients who underwent myeloablative umbilical cord blood or haploidentical hemopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in Spain. Fifty-one patients underwent single umbilical cord blood transplantation supported by a third party donor (Haplo-Cord) between 1999 and 2012, and 36 patients received an haploidentical HSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY-haplo) between 2012 and 2014 in GETH centers. The Haplo-Cord cohort included a higher proportion of patients with high disease risk index and use of TBI in the conditioning regimen, and hematopoietic cell transplantation-age Comorbidity Age Index was higher in PTCY-haplo patients. Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 97% in the Haplo-Cord and 100% in the PTCY-haplo group, achieved in a median of 12 and 17 days, respectively (P=0.01). Grade II-IV acute GvHD rate was significantly higher in the PTCY-haplo group (9.8% vs 29%, P=0.02) as well as chronic GvHD rates (20% vs 38%, P=0.03). With a median follow-up of 61 months for the Haplo-Cord group and 26 months for the PTCY-haplo cohort, overall survival at 2 years was 55% and 59% (P=0.66), event-free survival was 45% vs 56% (P=0.46), relapse rate was 27% vs 21% (P=0.79), and non-relapse mortality was 17% vs 23% (P=0.54), respectively. In this multicenter experience, Haplo-Cord and PTCY-haplo HSCT offer valid alternatives for patients with AML.

In order to assess its validity and relation to other common metrics, we analyzed the relationship between 5-year survival, incidence and mortality using publicly available cancer registry data from England and Wales. Methods: Five-year survival, incidence and mortality data were obtained from the online database of a registered charity, Cancer Research UK. We extracted sex-specific age-standardized mortality, incidence, and 5-year survivalfor16 types of cancer over the period from 1976 to 1995. The relationships between 5-year survival, incidence and mortality were estimated using both Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. Results: All 16cancer types showed an increase in 5-year survival for both genders from 1976 to 1995, ranging from 0.2% (pancreas and lung cancer) to 16.6% (prostate cancer) for males and 0.2% (pancreas cancer) to 16.6% (leukemia) for females. From 1976 to 1995, there was no significant correlation between changes in 5-year survival and cancer mortality for either sex (males, Pearson r=0.16, Spearman r=-0.06; females, Pearson r=-0.33, Spearman r=-0.43). A positive relationship between 5-year survival and incidence was noted among males, but not among females (males, Pearson r=0.61, Spearman r=0.53; females, Pearson r=0.03, Spearman r=0.11). However, after excluding breast and prostate cancer, the positive association became weaker and became statistically non-significant for males (Pearson r=0.47; Spearman r=0.41). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there are no reliable relationships between changes in 5-year survival and cancer incidence or mortality. Increases in 5-year survival might therefore represent poor indicators of progress in cancer control at the population level. In the absence of over-diagnosis, 5-year survival might only indicate improved diagnosis and treatment in clinical practice.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Li, Si Qi', 'Pan, Xiong Fei', 'Kashaf, Michael Saheb', 'Xue, Qing Ping', 'Luo, Hui Jing', 'Wang, Yan Yan', 'Wen, Ying', 'Yang, Chun Xia']","['Li SQ', 'Pan XF', 'Kashaf MS', 'Xue QP', 'Luo HJ', 'Wang YY', 'Wen Y', 'Yang ChX']","['Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University, RenminNanlu 3-17, Chengdu 610041, China|Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Chenghua District, NO.6 Xinhong Road, Chengdu 610051, China.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 103 survivors of ALL aged 13.5 +/- 0.45 who completed their treatment at least one year earlier were enrolled. Among these, 49.5% and 51.5% received chemotherapy alone and chemotherapy plus cranial radiotherapy, respectively. Bone mineral content, BMD, and bone mineral apparent density in the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN) and forearm were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). BMD Z-scores were classified according to International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) criteria. Results: The mean BMD Z-scores +/- SD forLS, FN and forearm were -1.60 +/- 0.12, -1.21 +/- 0.9 and -2.43 +/- 0.14 respectively with significant differences (P<0.001). Considering the lowest BMD Z-score in LS and FN areas (at any site) and according to the ISCD classification, 62.1%, 33% and 4.9% of the patients had normal BMD, low BMD and osteoporosis, respectively. Also, 8.7% of patients had developed fractures after completion of the treatment period, 4.9% having BMD Z-Scores <-2 SD at any site. A direct relationship was apparent between BMD Z-scores at LS and FN at any sites and risk of fracture (P<0.001). Conclusions: ALL patients are at risk for low BMD and fracture.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of a self-encouragement program on stress of mothers of children with cancer referred to Imam Ali Hospital of Zahedan in 2015. Materials and Methods: This case-control study was performed on 44 mothers with children suffering from cancer, referred to the hospital during October and November of 2015. Convenience sampling was used, and the mothers were randomly allocated into two 22-member groups. The Impact of Event Scale - Revised (IES-R) was the data collection instrument. Educational classes were held in the hospital. Confidentiality and mutual respect were observed by each and every member of the group. Data obtained before and after the intervention were analyzed using the independent t-test, paired t-test and ANOVA. The significance level was set at 0.05. Findings: The most frequent diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (47%) and brain tumors (16%). The results indicated that the mean score of stress in the control group did not significantly between the two time points (P=0.106). In the intervention group, however, there was a significant difference in stress mean scores before (54.3+/-2.0) and after (37.1+/-1.8) the intervention (P<0.001).

Methods We retrospectively evaluated 111 patients with acute myeloid leukemia who had been treated with decitabine and compared the development of toxicities during cycle 1 in those with normal renal function (creatinine clearance greater than or equal to 60 mL/min) to those with renal dysfunction (creatinine clearance less than 60 mL/min). Results Notable differences in the incidence of grade >/=3 cardiotoxicity (33% of renal dysfunction patients vs. 16% of normal renal function patients, p = 0.042) and respiratory toxicity (40% of renal dysfunction patients vs. 14% of normal renal function patients, p = 0.0037) were observed. The majority of heart failure, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation cases occurred in the renal dysfunction group. The odds of developing grade >/=3 cardiotoxicity did not differ significantly between patients with and without baseline cardiac comorbidities (OR 1.43, p = 0.43). Conclusions This study noted a higher incidence of grade >/=3 cardiac and respiratory toxicities in decitabine-treated acute myeloid leukemia patients with renal dysfunction compared to normal renal function.

Despite the appropriate use of radiotherapy, radioresistance is a biological behavior of cancer cells that limits the efficacy of this treatment. Deregulation of microRNAs contributes to the molecular mechanism underlying resistance to radiotherapy in cancer cells. Although the functional roles of microRNAs have been well described in lung cancer, their functional roles in radioresistance are largely unclear. In this study, we established a non-small cell lung carcinoma Calu-1 radioresistant cell line by continuous exposure to therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation as a model to investigate radioresistance-associated microRNAs. Our data show that 50 microRNAs were differentially expressed in Calu-1 radioresistant cells (16 upregulated and 34 downregulated); furthermore, well-known and novel microRNAs associated with resistance to radiotherapy were identified. Gene ontology and enrichment analysis indicated that modulated microRNAs might regulate signal transduction, cell survival, and apoptosis. Accordingly, Calu-1 radioresistant cells were refractory to radiation by increasing cell survival and reducing the apoptotic response. Among deregulated microRNAs, miR-29c was significantly suppressed. Reestablishment of miR-29c expression in Calu-1 radioresistant cells overcomes the radioresistance through the activation of apoptosis and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 target genes. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that miR-29c is also suppressed in tumor samples of non-small cell lung carcinoma patients. Notably, we found that low miR-29c levels correlated with shorter relapse-free survival of non-small cell lung carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy.

WT1-targeted immunotherapy has been extensively explored in multiple human trials in various cancers. However, clinical investigations using WT1 epitopes have generally focused on two peptides, HLA-restricted to HLA-A*02:01 or HLA-A*24:02. The goal of this study was to identify new epitopes derived from WT1, to expand the potential use of WT1 as a target of immunotherapy. Using computer-based MHC-binding algorithms and in vitro validation of the T cell responses specific for the identified peptides, we found that a recently identified HLA-A*24:02-binding epitope (239-247), NQMNLGATL (NQM), was also a strong CD8(+) T cell epitope for HLA-A*02:01 molecule. A peptide second position Q240L substitution (NLM) or Q240Y substitution (NYM), further enhanced the T cell responses in both HLA-A*02:01 positive and HLA-A*24:02 positive healthy donors. Importantly, T cells stimulated with the new analog peptides displayed heteroclitic cross-reactivity with the native NQM sequence and were able to kill HLA-matched WT1-positive tumor cell lines and primary leukemia blasts. In addition, longer native and heteroclitic HLA-DR.B1-binding peptides, comprising the nine amino acid NQM or NLM sequences, could induce T cell response that recognized the CD8(+) epitope NQM, suggesting the processing and the presentation by HLA-A*02:01 molecules of the CD8(+) T cell epitope embedded within it. Our studies suggest that the analog peptides NLM and NYM could be potential candidates for future immunotherapy targeting WT1 positive cancers in the context of HLA-A*02:01 and A*24:02 positive populations.",,"['Dao, Tao', 'Korontsvit, Tatyana', 'Zakhaleva, Victoria', 'Jarvis, Casey', 'Mondello, Patrizia', 'Oh, Claire', 'Scheinberg, David A']","['Dao T', 'Korontsvit T', 'Zakhaleva V', 'Jarvis C', 'Mondello P', 'Oh C', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute , New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute , New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute , New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute , New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Molecular Pharmacology Program, Sloan Kettering Institute, New York, NY, USA; Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA; Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*Analog peptides', '*CTL response', '*WT1', '*cancer vaccines', '*immunotherapy']",2017/03/28 06:00,2017/03/28 06:01,['2017/03/28 06:00'],"['2016/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/10/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2016.1252895 [doi]', '1252895 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2016 Dec 7;6(2):e1252895. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2016.1252895. eCollection 2017.,"['P01 CA023766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA062948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,PMC5353933,,20161207,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, we tested the hypothesis that infusion of ZOL in patients receiving this type of graft may enhance gammadelta T-cell cytotoxic activity against leukemia cells. ZOL was infused every 28 d in 43 patients; most were treated at least twice. gammadelta T cells before and after ZOL treatments were studied in 33 of these 43 patients, till at least 7 mo after HSCT by high-resolution mass spectrometry, flow-cytometry, and degranulation assay. An induction of Vdelta2-cell differentiation, paralleled by increased cytotoxicity of both Vdelta1 and Vdelta2 cells against primary leukemia blasts was associated with ZOL treatment. Cytotoxic activity was further increased in Vdelta2 cells, but not in Vdelta1 lymphocytes in those patients given more than one treatment. Proteomic analysis of gammadelta T cells purified from patients showed upregulation of proteins involved in activation processes and immune response, paralleled by downregulation of proteins involved in proliferation. Moreover, a proteomic signature was identified for each ZOL treatment. Patients given three or more ZOL infusions had a better probability of survival in comparison to those given one or two treatments (86% vs. 54%, respectively, p = 0.008).

Repurposing of established drugs is a promising approach for overcoming this problem. An example of such drugs is niclosamide, a known anthelmintic that is now known to be cytotoxic and cytostatic against cancer cells. In this study, niclosamide showed varying activity against different cancer cell lines. It revealed better activity against hematological cancer cell lines CCRF-CEM, CEM/ADR5000, and RPMI-8226 compared to the solid tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231, A549, and HT-29. The multidrug resistant CEM/ADR5000 cells were similar sensitive as their sensitive counterpart CCRF-CEM (resistance ration: 1.24). Furthermore, niclosamide caused elevations in reactive oxygen species and glutathione (GSH) levels in leukemia cells. GSH synthetase (GS) was predicted as a target of niclosamide. Molecular docking showed that niclosamide probably binds to the ATP-binding site of GS with a binding energy of -9.40 kcal/mol. Using microscale thermophoresis, the binding affinity between niclosamide and recombinant human GS was measured (binding constant: 5.64 muM). COMPARE analyses of the NCI microarray database for 60 cell lines showed that several genes, including those involved in lipid metabolism, correlated with cellular responsiveness to niclosamide. Hierarchical cluster analysis showed five major branches with significant differences between sensitive and resistant cell lines (p = 8.66 x 10(5)). Niclosamide significantly decreased nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) activity as predicted by promoter binding motif analysis. In conclusion, niclosamide was more active against hematological malignancies compared to solid tumors. The drug was particularly active against the multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells. Inhibition of GSH synthesis and NFAT signaling were identified as relevant mechanisms for the anticancer activity of niclosamide.

This suggests that DPP4 T-molecules have modified binding and functions compared with their FL counterparts and may serve regulatory roles in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.",,"[""O'Leary, H A"", 'Capitano, M', 'Cooper, S', 'Mantel, C', 'Boswell, H S', 'Kapur, R', 'Ramdas, B', 'Chan, R', 'Deng, L', 'Qu, C-K', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","[""O'Leary HA"", 'Capitano M', 'Cooper S', 'Mantel C', 'Boswell HS', 'Kapur R', 'Ramdas B', 'Chan R', 'Deng L', 'Qu CK', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA."", 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism']",,,2017/03/28 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/03/28 06:00'],"['2016/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201798 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.98 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2468-2478. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.98.

In multiple myeloma (MM), interactions between MM cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment, including the BM ECM, are critical to the pathogenesis of the disease and the development of drug resistance. Nevertheless, composition of the ECM in MM and its role in supporting MM pathogenesis has not been reported. We have applied a novel proteomic-based strategy and defined the BM ECM composition in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), newly diagnosed and relapsed MM compared with healthy donor-derived BM ECM. In this study, we show that the tumor ECM is remodeled at the mRNA and protein levels in MGUS and MM to allow development of a permissive microenvironment. We further demonstrate that two ECM-affiliated proteins, ANXA2 and LGALS1, are more abundant in MM and high expression is associated with a decreased overall survival. This study points to the importance of ECM remodeling in MM and provides a novel proteomic pipeline for interrogating the role of the ECM in cancers with BM tropism.",,"['Glavey, S V', 'Naba, A', 'Manier, S', 'Clauser, K', 'Tahri, S', 'Park, J', 'Reagan, M R', 'Moschetta, M', 'Mishima, Y', 'Gambella, M', 'Rocci, A', 'Sacco, A', ""O'Dwyer, M E"", 'Asara, J M', 'Palumbo, A', 'Roccaro, A M', 'Hynes, R O', 'Ghobrial, I M']","['Glavey SV', 'Naba A', 'Manier S', 'Clauser K', 'Tahri S', 'Park J', 'Reagan MR', 'Moschetta M', 'Mishima Y', 'Gambella M', 'Rocci A', 'Sacco A', ""O'Dwyer ME"", 'Asara JM', 'Palumbo A', 'Roccaro AM', 'Hynes RO', 'Ghobrial IM']","['Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Protemics Platform, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Manchester Royal Infirmary and Central Manchester University Hospital NHS Foundation, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'SST Spedali Civili, Department Medical Oncology, CREA Laboratory, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, National University of Ireland, Galway, Ireland.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'University of Torino, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Citta della Salute e della Scienza di Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'SST Spedali Civili, Department Medical Oncology, CREA Laboratory, Brescia, Italy.', 'Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1763-6609'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Annexin A2/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Extracellular Matrix/*metabolism', 'Galectin 1/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Proteome', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,,2017/03/28 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/03/28 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2017102 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.102 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2426-2434. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.102.

Donor-derived allo-immune responses eliminate the residual host hematopoiesis and thereby mediate the conversion to complete donor chimerism. Recently, cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation was described to enhance overall T cell reconstitution, to increase graft-versus-host disease incidence, and to reduce the leukemia relapse risk. However, the link between CMV and allo-immune responses is still unclear. Here, we studied the relationship between CMV-specific immunity, overall T cell reconstitution, and residual host chimerism in 106 CMV-seropositive patients transplanted after reduced-intensity conditioning including antithymocyte globulin. In accordance with previous reports, the recovery of CMV-specific cytotoxic T cells (CMV-CTLs) was more frequent in CMV-seropositive recipients (R) transplanted from CMV-seropositive than from seronegative donors (D). However, once CMV-CTLs were detectable, the reconstitution of CMV-specific CTLs was comparable in CMV R+/D- and R+/D+ patients. CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cell reconstitution was significantly faster in patients with CMV-CTLs than in patients without CMV-CTLs both in the CMV R+/D- and R+/D+ setting. Moreover, CMV-CTL numbers correlated with CD3(+) and CD8(+) T cell numbers in both settings. Finally, presence of CMV-CTLs was associated with low host chimerism levels 3 months after allo-SCT. In conclusion, our data provide a first indication that CMV-CTLs in CMV-seropositive patients might trigger the reconstitution of T cells and allo-immune responses reflected by the conversion to complete donor chimerism.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of the Dana Farber Consortium Protocol (DFCP) in Saudi young adults diagnosed with de novo acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study we included 38 patients with de novo ALL who presented to King Abdulla Medical City in the period from June 2010 to March 2015 and received the DFCP (Princess Margret modified version). RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included with a median age of 19 years. Two patients died during induction treatment, and 35 of 38 patients achieved complete remission (92.1%). With a median follow-up period of 22 months, at 1 and 3 years, leukemia-free survival was 80% and 68%, respectively, and overall survival was 88% and 72%, respectively. Age younger than 21 years showed a significant association with longer survival. Toxicities included febrile neutropenia in all patients during induction, typhilitis in 8/38 (21%), pneumonia in 10/38 (26%), and pancreatitis in 5/38 patients (13%), 3/38 (7.8%) during induction and 2/38 (5.2%) during intensification. Osteonecrosis affected 3/38 patients (7.8%), and was detected during screening in 2/38 (5.2%) of these patients. There were no fractures or surgical interventions, and no venous thromboembolism was recorded. CONCLUSION: Although it might be feasible to use pediatric-inspired protocols in this age group, toxicity cannot be overlooked, and the application of these protocols might require modification of drug doses or schedules relative to those used for younger children. Moreover, additional surveillance and supportive measures should be implemented to maximize benefits while minimizing toxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Both drugs also reduced TNF mRNA, but later, and moreover increased IL-1beta mRNA. The effect on procoagulant activity of cells and microparticles, as measured with calibrated automated thrombography, was delayed and only partial at 24 h.

Its pathophysiology is unknown. MMA can be the sole manifestation of the disease (moyamoya disease) or be associated with various conditions (moyamoya syndrome) including some Mendelian diseases. We aimed to investigate the genetic basis of moyamoya using a whole exome sequencing (WES) approach conducted in sporadic cases without any overt symptom suggestive of a known Mendelian moyamoya syndrome. METHODS: A WES was performed in four unrelated early-onset moyamoya sporadic cases and their parents (trios). Exome data were analysed under dominant de novo, autosomal recessive and X-linked hypotheses. A panel of 17 additional sporadic cases with early-onset moyamoya was available for mutation recurrence analysis. RESULTS: We identified two germline de novo mutations in CBL in two out of the four trio probands, two girls presenting with an infancy-onset severe MMA. Both mutations were predicted to alter the ubiquitin ligase activity of the CBL protein that acts as a negative regulator of the RAS pathway. These two germline CBL mutations have previously been described in association with a developmental Noonan-like syndrome and susceptibility to juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML). Notably, the two mutated girls never developed JMML and presented only subtle signs of RASopathy that did not lead to evoke this diagnosis during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that CBL gene screening should be considered in early-onset moyamoya, even in the absence of obvious signs of RASopathy.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

Some viruses have evolved to exploit the host SUMOylation machinery to modify their own protein. Retroviral Gag protein plays critical roles in the viral life cycle. The HIV-1 p6 and the Moloney murine leukemia virus CA have been reported to be conjugated with SUMO. In this study, we report for the first time, to our knowledge, the covalent conjugation of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) Gag with SUMO. The C-terminal p9 domain of Gag is a main target for SUMOylation and SUMO is attached to multiple sites of p9, including K30 whose mutation abolished p9 SUMOylation completely. The SUMOylation of p9, but not the p9-K30 mutant, was also detected in equine fibroblastic cells ATCC((R)) CCL-57. Ubc9 and its C93 residue are indispensable for the SUMOylation of p9. Using confocal microscopy, it is found that EIAV Gag localizes primarily, if not exclusively, in the cytoplasm of the cell and the co-localization of EIAV Gag with Ubc9 was observed. Our findings that EIAV Gag is SUMOylated at p9-K30, together with previous findings on the defects of p9-K30 mutant in viral DNA translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus, suggests that SUMOylation of Gag may be involved in such functions.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This pathway also plays a critical role in maintaining normal cellular processes. Given the importance of leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in the development of minimal residual disease, it is critical to use therapeutic interventions that target the LSC population to prevent disease relapse. The mTORC1-S6K1 pathway has been identified as an important regulator of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and LSC functions. Both HSC and LSC functions require regulation of key cellular processes including proliferation, metabolism, and autophagy, which are regulated by mTORC1 pathway. Despite the mTORC1-S6K1 pathway being a critical regulator of AML initiation and progression, inhibitors of this pathway alone have yielded mixed results in clinical studies. Recent studies have identified strategies to develop new mTORC1-S6K1 inhibitors such as RapaLink-1, which could circumvent the drug resistance observed in AML cells and in LSCs.

The most commonly associated malignancy is chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy is a rare condition with a wide variety of clinical presentations, ranging from papules, erythematous nodules, or blisters that simulate arthropod bites, to the formation of true plaques of differing sizes. Histology reveals the presence of abundant eosinophils. We present 4 new cases seen in Hospital Arnau de Vilanova, Valencia, during the past 7 years. Three of these cases were associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 1 with mycosis fungoides. It is important to recognize this dermatosis as it can indicate progression of the underlying disease, as was the case in 3 of our patients.","['Copyright (c) 2017 AEDV.

Questions arise, however, about the impact of even lower doses and dose rates where classical epidemiological studies have limited power but where subsets within the large cohorts are expected to have an increased risk. Further progress requires integration of biomarkers or bioassays of individual exposure, effects and susceptibility to IR. The European DoReMi (Low Dose Research towards Multidisciplinary Integration) consortium previously reviewed biomarkers for potential use in IR epidemiological studies. Given the increased mechanistic understanding of responses to low dose radiation the current review provides an update covering technical advances and recent studies. A key issue identified is deciding which biomarkers to progress. A roadmap is provided for biomarker development from discovery to implementation and used to summarise the current status of proposed biomarkers for epidemiological studies. Most potential biomarkers remain at the discovery stage and for some there is sufficient evidence that further development is not warranted. One biomarker identified in the final stages of development and as a priority for further research is radiation specific mRNA transcript profiles.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2017.

Obinutuzumab in combination with chlorambucil (GClb) is a new therapeutic option for previously untreated CLL patients who are unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy. This combination delays disease progression but incurs additional costs; thus, an assessment of its value for money is relevant. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-utility ratio of GClb in comparison with (i) rituximab in combination with chlorambucil (RClb), and (ii) chlorambucil alone (Clb) from the perspective of the Portuguese National Health Service (NHS). METHODS: A Markov model was used to predict disease progression. Pre-progression clinical data were based on the latest CLL11 trial data, and post-progression clinical data were obtained from CLL5 trial data. Utility values are from Kosmas et al. (Leuk Lymphoma 56:1320-1326, 14). Only direct medical costs were included. The resource consumption was estimated by a panel of Portuguese experts, and the unit costs were obtained from official sources. A discount rate of 5% was applied to costs and consequences. RESULTS: GClb and RClb were associated with an increase of 1.06 and 0.39 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) at an additional cost of euro21,720 and euro9836 when compared to Clb, respectively. The cost-utility ratio of GClb versus Clb was euro20,397/QALY, while RClb was extendedly dominated. CONCLUSIONS: The use of GClb for previously untreated CLL patients who are unsuitable for full-dose fludarabine-based therapy incurs an incremental cost per QALY that is generally accepted in Portugal. Therefore, although there is some uncertainty, obinutuzumab is probably a cost-effective therapy in the Portuguese setting.",,"['Paquete, Ana Teresa', 'Miguel, Luis Silva', 'Becker, Ursula', 'Pereira, Catarina', 'Pinto, Carlos Gouveia']","['Paquete AT', 'Miguel LS', 'Becker U', 'Pereira C', 'Pinto CG']","['CISEP - Research Centre on the Portuguese Economy, ISEG, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal. ana.paquete@medicina.ulisboa.pt.', 'CISEP - Research Centre on the Portuguese Economy, ISEG, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'F.

Ibrutinib is a BTK inhibitor that has shown excellent efficacy in treatment-naive, heavily pre-treated, and high-risk CLL/SLL. With remarkable efficacy, good oral bioavailability, and modest adverse events profile, ibrutinib use is likely to continue to increase. As data with ibrutinib use in CLL matures, concerns regarding adverse events and drug resistance have emerged. New insights into mechanisms of ibrutinib resistance in CLL have uncovered potential therapeutic targets. Several promising novel agents are currently in early phases of development for overcoming ibrutinib resistance in CLL/SLL.

We report efficacy and safety outcomes in a Japanese population from the final, 5-year follow-up of DASISION. At the end of the study, 77% (20/26) of dasatinib-treated and 61% (14/23) of imatinib-treated patients remained on initial therapy. Improved responses were observed in Japanese patients who received dasatinib versus imatinib (complete cytogenetic response: 96 vs 87%; major molecular response: 88 vs 74%; BCR-ABL1 </=0.0032% International Scale [MR(4.5)]: 58 vs 52%). In patients who achieved BCR-ABL1 </=10% at 3 months, 5-year progression-free survival and overall survival rates were high with dasatinib (96 and 96%) and imatinib (88 and 100%).

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association of interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) gene variants rs1884444, rs10889677 and rs11209026 with development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: The IL23R variants were studied in 164 ALL patients and compared to 175 healthy controls by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The relationship between these variants and clinical and laboratory features of the patients and response to therapy were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant differences in genotype and allele frequencies existed between patients and controls. The rs1884444TG genotype was significantly lower in patients who relapsed (24.2%) compared to those without relapse (55.9%, p=0.006). Fewer patients who relapsed had evidence of the G allele (p=0.034). The TG genotype was associated with a longer complete remission at 1804+/-116 days compared to other genotypes (<1217 days, p=0.028), however, this result was not significant in multivariate analysis. The rs10889677 AA genotype and A allele were associated with age (p<0.041) and platelet number (p=0.03) in precursor-B cell ALL (B-ALL) patients. Both occurred more frequently in patients aged 2-10 years (63.6% and 66%, respectively) and in those with platelets >100x10^3 muL (68.4% and 52.4%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our findings showed a lack of association of the studied polymorphisms with the risk of ALL. The influence of the rs1884444 polymorphism on relapse rate and association of rs10889677 AA genotype with favorable prognostic factors suggest the effect of the studied polymorphisms on ALL response to therapy and prognosis.",,"['Zareinejad, Mohammadrasul', 'Samiei, Afshin', 'Valibeigi, Behnaz', 'Gholami, Tahereh', 'Zareifar, Soheila', 'Amirghofran, Zahra']","['Zareinejad M', 'Samiei A', 'Valibeigi B', 'Gholami T', 'Zareifar S', 'Amirghofran Z']","['Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics']",,,2017/03/28 06:00,2017/04/22 06:00,['2017/03/26 06:00'],"['2017/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['06 [pii]', 'IJIv14i1A6 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2017 Mar;14(1):59-72. doi: IJIv14i1A6.,,"['0 (IL23R protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TNF-alpha is the most common cytokine used for activating DCs and generating mature MDDC either alone or in combination with other cytokines. OBJECTIVE: To compare effects of traditional cytokine cocktail (TNF-alpha + IL-1beta) versus TLR4-agonist monophosphoryl lipid A on the viability, phenotype, cytokine profile and functionality of MDDC. METHODS: The study included 32 individuals; twenty Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) cases in complete remission and 12 healthy volunteers. They were divided into 3 groups: Group 1: control group: 12 subjects to measure the baseline levels of all markers in the monocytic preparation. Group 2: cytokine cocktail (TNF-alpha) group, which included 10 AML subjects. Group 3: MPLA group which included 10 AML subjects. RESULTS: TNF-alpha group showed higher expression of CD83 than MPLA group indicating higher capacity to induce DC maturation but both were similar in CD86, CCR7 and IL-10 expression.

The interplay between different chaperones regulating the supply of histone variants to distinct chromatin domains remains largely undeciphered. We report a role of promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein in the routing of histone variant H3.3 to chromatin and in the organization of megabase-size heterochromatic PML-associated domains that we call PADs. Loss of PML alters the heterochromatic state of PADs by shifting the histone H3 methylation balance from K9me3 to K27me3. Loss of PML impairs deposition of H3.3 by ATRX and DAXX in PADs but preserves the H3.3 loading function of HIRA in these regions. Our results unveil an unappreciated role of PML in the large-scale organization of chromatin and demonstrate a PML-dependent role of ATRX/DAXX in the deposition of H3.3 in PADs. Our data suggest that H3.3 loading by HIRA and ATRX-dependent H3K27 trimethylation constitute mechanisms ensuring maintenance of heterochromatin when the integrity of these domains is compromised.,['(c) 2017 Delbarre et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Delbarre, Erwan', 'Ivanauskiene, Kristina', 'Spirkoski, Jane', 'Shah, Akshay', 'Vekterud, Kristin', 'Moskaug, Jan Oivind', 'Boe, Stig Ove', 'Wong, Lee H', 'Kuntziger, Thomas', 'Collas, Philippe']","['Delbarre E', 'Ivanauskiene K', 'Spirkoski J', 'Shah A', 'Vekterud K', 'Moskaug JO', 'Boe SO', 'Wong LH', 'Kuntziger T', 'Collas P']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital, 0027 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Science, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.', 'Department of Oral Biology, University of Oslo, 0316 Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway.', 'Norwegian Center for Stem Cell Research, Oslo University Hospital, 0027 Oslo, Norway.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heterochromatin/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Histones/*genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/03/28 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/03/26 06:00'],"['2016/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.215830.116 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.215830.116 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2017 Jun;27(6):913-921. doi: 10.1101/gr.215830.116.

It was regarded as a stem cell marker in several non-hematopoietic systems. While the prototypic homeobox genes such as the HOX family have been well characterized in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the clinical and biological implications of HOPX in the disease remain unknown. Thus we analyzed HOPX and global gene expression patterns in 347 newly diagnosed de novo AML patients in our institute. We found that higher HOPX expression was closely associated with older age, higher platelet counts, lower white blood cell counts, lower lactate dehydrogenase levels, and mutations in RUNX1, IDH2, ASXL1, and DNMT3A, but negatively associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, favorable karyotypes, CEBPA double mutations and NPM1 mutation. Patients with higher HOPX expression had a lower complete remission rate and shorter survival. The finding was validated in two independent cohorts. Multivariate analysis revealed that higher HOPX expression was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor irrespective of other known prognostic parameters and gene signatures derived from multiple cohorts. Gene set enrichment analysis showed higher HOPX expression was associated with both hematopoietic and leukemia stem cell signatures. While HOPX and HOX family genes showed concordant expression patterns in normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, their expression patterns and associated clinical and biological features were distinctive in AML settings, demonstrating HOPX to be a unique homeobox gene. Therefore, HOPX is a distinctive homeobox gene with characteristic clinical and biological implications and its expression is a powerful predictor of prognosis in AML patients.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Hsu, Yueh-Chwen', 'Li, Yi-Hung', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Lan, Keng-Hsueh', 'Chen, Tsung-Chih', 'Tzeng, Yi-Shiuan', 'Kuo, Yi-Yi', 'Kao, Chein-Jun', 'Chuang, Po-Han', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Chiu, Yu-Chiao', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Lin CC', 'Hsu YC', 'Li YH', 'Kuo YY', 'Hou HA', 'Lan KH', 'Chen TC', 'Tzeng YS', 'Kuo YY', 'Kao CJ', 'Chuang PH', 'Tseng MH', 'Chiu YC', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Radiation Oncology and Department of Oncology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Oncology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Biomedical Electronics and Bioinformatics, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan wchou@ntu.edu.tw f99945006@ntu.edu.tw hftien@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan wchou@ntu.edu.tw f99945006@ntu.edu.tw hftien@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan wchou@ntu.edu.tw f99945006@ntu.edu.tw hftien@ntu.edu.tw.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/analysis/*metabolism']",,,2017/03/28 06:00,2018/03/15 06:00,['2017/03/26 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.161257 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.161257 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2017 Jun;102(6):1044-1053. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.161257.

Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation after chemotherapy is a recommended treatment option for patients with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma, there is no consensus about indications for allogeneic stem cell transplantation because there is no established risk stratification system for transplant eligible patients. We conducted a nationwide survey of patients with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma in order to construct a new, large database that includes 1,792 patients aged 70 years or younger with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma who were diagnosed between 2000 and 2013 and received intensive first-line chemotherapy. We randomly divided patients into two groups (training and validation sets). Acute type, poor performance status, high soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels (> 5,000 U/mL), high adjusted calcium levels (>/= 12 mg/dL), and high C-reactive protein levels (>/= 2.5 mg/dL) were independent adverse prognostic factors used in the training set. We used these five variables to divide patients into three risk groups. In the validation set, median overall survival for the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups was 626 days, 322 days, and 197 days, respectively. In the intermediate- and high-risk groups, transplanted recipients had significantly better overall survival than non-transplanted patients. We developed a promising new risk stratification system to identify patients aged 70 years or younger with aggressive adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma who may benefit from upfront allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

Higher levels of minimal residual disease are associated with inferior results even with intensification of therapy, thus suggesting that identification and targeting of minimal residual disease cells could be a therapeutic strategy. Here we identify high expression of 5T4 in subclonal populations of patient-derived xenografts from patients with high, post-induction levels of minimal residual disease. 5T4-positive cells showed preferential ability to overcome the NOD-scidIL2Rgamma(null) mouse xenograft barrier, migrated in vitro on a CXCL12 gradient, preferentially localized to bone marrow in vivo and displayed the ability to reconstitute the original clonal composition on limited dilution engraftment. Treatment with A1mcMMAF (a 5T4-antibody drug conjugate) significantly improved survival without overt toxicity in mice engrafted with a 5T4-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. Mice engrafted with 5T4-positive patient-derived xenograft cells were treated with combination chemotherapy or dexamethasone alone and then given A1mcMMAF in the minimal residual disease setting. Combination chemotherapy was toxic to NOD-scidIL2Rgamma(null) mice. While dexamethasone or A1mcMMAF alone improved outcomes, the sequential administration of dexamethasone and A1mcMMAF significantly improved survival (P=0.0006) over either monotherapy.

Nevertheless, guidelines might not be commonly followed in developing countries due to economic factors. The primary objectives were to evaluate the implementation rate of PAP in acute leukemia patients in China and to compare the prognosis of IFD with and without PAP. The secondary objectives were to investigate the safety of PAP, clinical characteristics of IFDs and risk factors of breakthrough. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational single-center study, including non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients receiving uniform induction or salvage chemotherapy between 2012 and 2016. RESULTS: There were 29.4% of patients without PAP among a total of 248 cases. The incidence of breakthrough proven/probable/possible IFDs was 24.7%, 6.5%, 5.5%, 5.4% and 5.3% in control (no prophylaxis), fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole and posaconazole group respectively (P = 0.007), while the percentage of patients requiring empirical or pre-emptive therapy was 54.8%, 45.7%, 23.3%, 18.9%, 10.5% respectively (P < 0.001). PAP could also significantly improve IFD-free survival (P < 0.001) and reduce 90-day overall mortality in patients on AML salvage regimen (P = 0.021). There were no statistical differences in PAP-related adverse events. Past history of IFD (OR 9.5, P = 0.006) was confirmed to be independent risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: There are a considerable number of acute leukemia patients without PAP in China, who have higher IFD incidence, increased empiric/pre-emptive antifungal drug use and worse IFD-free survival.","['Copyright (c) 2017 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association', 'for Infectious Diseases.

METHODS: We performed a bioinformatics study of the p53 pathway function at the gene expression level on our collection of 1153 p53-pathway related genes. Publically available Affymetrix data of 607 de-novo AML patients at diagnosis were analyzed according to the patients cytogenetic, FAB and molecular mutations subtypes. We further investigated the functional status of the p53 pathway in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) and Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) patients using bioinformatics, Real-Time PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We revealed significant and differential alterations of p53 pathway-related gene expression in most of the AML subtypes. We found that p53 pathway-related gene expression was not correlated with the accepted grouping of AML subtypes such as by cytogenetically-based prognosis, morphological stage or by the type of molecular mutation. Our bioinformatic analysis revealed that p53 is not functional in CN-AML and APL blasts at inducing its most important functional outcomes: cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair and oxidative stress defense. We revealed transcriptional downregulation of important p53 acetyltransferases in both CN-AML and APL, accompanied by increased Mdmx protein expression and inadequate Chk2 protein activation. CONCLUSIONS: Our bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that p53 pathway is differentially inactivated in different AML subtypes. Focused gene and protein analysis of p53 pathway in CN-AML and APL patients imply that functional inactivation of p53 protein can be attributed to its impaired acetylation. Our analysis indicates the need in further accurate evaluation of p53 pathway functioning and regulation in distinct subtypes of AML.",,"['Abramowitz, Julia', 'Neuman, Tzahi', 'Perlman, Riki', 'Ben-Yehuda, Dina']","['Abramowitz J', 'Neuman T', 'Perlman R', 'Ben-Yehuda D']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, P.O.

CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old man with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), previously treated with chlorambucil, was referred in October 2013 for extraction of a single chamber ICD due to a suspected device-related infection in the pulse generator area (left-hand side of Fig. 1). The ICD system (Current VR, St. Jude Medical, USA) had been implanted in November 2009. The patient complained of painless erythema with pruritus in the pocket area. Inflammatory blood parameters were C-reactive protein 17.3 mg/L and leucocytes 29.0 x 10(9)/L. Due to the atypical appearance of the pocket area we did not extract the device. Instead, we created an exploratory excision in the skin induration, which had been present for approximately 6 weeks, and conducted a microbiological and histological examination. All cultivation examinations were negative. However, we did histologically show skin infiltration by CD-5 positive low-grade B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (B-CLL/SLL). Re-initiation of chemotherapy was not necessary and the skin induration completely disappeared within 2 months (right-hand side of Fig. 1). CONCLUSIONS: Complete removal of an ICD system carries considerable risk. In patients with a history of hematological disease, it is crucial to exclude cutaneous manifestations of the disease prior to device removal.",,"['Snorek, M', 'Bulava, A', 'Vonke, I']","['Snorek M', 'Bulava A', 'Vonke I']","['Department of Cardiology, Ceske Budejovice Hospital, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cardiology, Ceske Budejovice Hospital, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. alanbulava@seznam.cz.', 'Faculty of Health and Social Sciences, University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic. alanbulava@seznam.cz.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic. alanbulava@seznam.cz.', 'Department of Hematology, Ceske Budejovice Hospital, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cardiovasc Disord,BMC cardiovascular disorders,100968539,IM,"['Aged', 'Biopsy', '*Defibrillators, Implantable', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Electric Countershock/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prosthesis Implantation/adverse effects/*instrumentation', 'Prosthesis-Related Infections/*diagnosis', 'Skin/*pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator', '*Pocket infection']",2017/03/28 06:00,2017/10/04 06:00,['2017/03/26 06:00'],"['2017/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12872-017-0522-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12872-017-0522-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cardiovasc Disord. 2017 Mar 24;17(1):89. doi: 10.1186/s12872-017-0522-5.,,,PMC5364587,,20170324,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the effect of RF exposure was examined on 8-hydroxy-2'-dexoyguanosine (8-OHdG) which is a biomarker for oxidative damage and on the mitochondrial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is the energy required for cellular functions. The results indicated a significant increase in ROS and significant decreases in mitochondrial transcription factor A, mtDNA polymerase gamma, mtDNA transcripts and mtDNA copy number in RF-exposed cells compared with those in sham-exposed control cells. In addition, there was a significant increase in 8-OHdG and a significant decrease in ATP in RF-exposed cells. The response in positive control cells exposed to gamma radiation (GR, which is also known to induce ROS) was similar to those in RF-exposed cells. Thus, the overall data indicated that RF exposure was capable of inducing mtDNA damage mediated through ROS pathway which also induced oxidative damage.

KIAA1524 (also termed CIP2A), an oncoprotein inhibiting PP2A, is associated with disease progression in chronic myeloid leukaemia and may be prognostic in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia. Here we demonstrated that the selective proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, induced apoptosis in sensitive primary leukaemia cells and in sensitive leukaemia cell lines, associated with KIAA1524 protein downregulation, increased PP2A activity and decreased p-Akt, but not with the proteasome inhibition effect of carfilzomib. Ectopic expression of KIAA1524, or pretreatment with the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid, suppressed carfilzomib-induced apoptosis and KIAA1524 downregulation in sensitive cells, whereas co-treatment with the PP2A agonist, forskolin, enhanced carfilzomib-induced apoptosis in resistant cells.

Rare cases of otherwise typical B-ALL express myeloperoxidase (MPO) detectable by flow cytometry with an absence of other myeloid markers, but the clinical significance of this finding is not well studied. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of flow cytometry and clinical data was performed to investigate the clinical outcome of this specific group of patients. Results: Twenty-nine cases of otherwise typical B-ALL that expressed MPO by flow cytometry (B-ALL-isoMPO) without expression of other myeloid markers were identified. The B-ALL-isoMPO group had a significantly increased incidence of relapse (univariate log rank P = .0083; multivariate hazard ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-5.85; P = .034) and significantly worse event-free survival by univariate analysis (log rank P = .0066) compared with a reference group of patients with B-ALL from the same time period (n = 264). Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report to document the clinical outcomes in a group of pediatric patients with B-ALL that expresses MPO in the absence of other myeloid markers. This group had an increased rate of relapse and a worse event-free survival than the patients with B-ALL who did not express MPO.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

We analyzed CRLF2 expression and studied its correlation with CRLF2 rearrangement in adult patients with B-ALL. Methods: Multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) was performed consecutively in 126 patients. Results: CRLF2 overexpression was detected in 30 (27%) patients, 28 (41%) of 69 patients with B-ALL not otherwise specified, 14 (21%) of 67 untreated patients, and 16 (27%) of 59 patients with relapsed B-ALL, with the highest among Hispanic patients (25/55, 45%). Of CRLF2+ cases, 21 (100%) of 21 cases showed CRLF2 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization, preferentially involving IGH@CRLF2 (15/15). The entire coding region of JAK2 was sequenced in 14 patients with CRLF2+ B-ALL, and nine (64%) were positive for JAK2 mutations. Conclusions: MFC allows a rapid, inexpensive, and reliable detection of B-ALL with CRLF2 rearrangement that would further facilitate testing for JAK2 mutations for targetable therapy.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Given its function in lineage specification, we sought to evaluate the immunohistochemical profile of GATA1 in normal marrow and acute leukemia and assess the use of GATA1 as a specific erythromegakaryocytic immunohistochemical marker. Methods: Immunohistochemical studies for GATA1 expression were performed on bone marrow biopsy specimens to define its role in the evaluation of acute leukemia and other hematologic disorders. Results: In normal marrows, intense nuclear reactivity is seen in immature erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes. Weak to moderate nuclear positivity is seen in eosinophils and mast cells. In marrows involved by acute leukemia, blasts of pure erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia exhibit intense nuclear GATA1 positivity, while blasts of acute myeloid leukemia of other categories are negative. GATA1 is also absent in the blasts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and in the neoplastic cells of metastatic carcinoma and plasma cell neoplasms. Conclusions: Intense GATA1 nuclear expression is a sensitive and specific marker for cells of erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages and is an excellent marker for neoplastic cells of pure erythroleukemia and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2017.

Nephrotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents remains a significant complication limiting the efficacy of the treatment. A variety of renal disease and electrolyte disorders can result from the drugs that are used to treat malignant disease. The kidneys are a major elimination pathway for many antineoplastic drugs and their metabolites. Tumour lysis syndrome, an emergency in haematooncology, occurs most often after the initiation of cytotoxic therapy in patients with high-grade lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Chemotherapeutic agents can affect the glomerulus, tubules, interstitium and renal microvasculature, with clinical manifestations that range from asymptomatic elevation of serum creatinine to acute renal failure requiring dialysis. Some factors such as intravascular volume depletion, as well as concomitant use of other drugs or radiographic ionic contrast media, can potentiate or contribute to the nephrotoxicity. Cytotoxic agents can cause nephrotoxicity by a variety of mechanisms. The most nephrotoxic chemotherapeutic drug is cisplatin, which is often associated with acute kidney injury. Many other drugs such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibitors and epidermal growth factor receptor pathway inhibitors may have toxic effects on the kidneys. The aim of this review is to discuss the issue of nephrotoxicity associated with chemotherapy. In routine clinical practice, monitoring of kidney function is mandatory in order to identify nephrotoxicity early, allowing dosage adjustments or withdrawal of the offending drug.","['(c) The Author 2016.

This study examines the association between 6-MP ingestion habits and 6-MP adherence, red cell thioguanine nucleotide (TGN) levels, and risk of relapse in children with TMPT wild-type genotype. Methods Participants included 441 children with ALL receiving oral 6-MP for maintenance. Adherence was monitored over 48,086 patient-days using the Medication Event Monitoring System; nonadherence was defined as adherence rate < 95%. 6-MP ingestion habits examined included: takes 6-MP with versus never with food, takes 6-MP with versus never with dairy, and takes 6-MP in the evening versus morning versus varying times. Results Median age at study was 6 years (range, 2 to 20 years); 43.8% were nonadherent. Certain 6-MP ingestion habits were associated with nonadherence (taking 6-MP with dairy [odds ratio (OR), 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.9; P = .003] and at varying times [OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.8 to 6.3; P = .0001]). After adjusting for adherence and other prognosticators, there was no association between 6-MP ingestion habits and relapse risk (6-MP with food: hazard ratio [HR], 0.7; 95% CI, 0.3 to 1.9; P = .5; with dairy: HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.07 to 1.5; P = .2; taken in evening/night: HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.2 to 7.8; P = .9; at varying times: HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.04 to 2.7; P = .3). Among adherent patients, there was no association between red cell TGN levels and taking 6-MP with food versus without (206.1 +/- 107.1 v 220.6 +/- 121.6; P = .5), with dairy versus without (220.1 +/- 87.8 v 216.3 +/- 121.3; P =.7), or in the evening/night versus morning/midday versus varying times (218.8 +/- 119.7 v 195.5 +/- 82.3 v 174.8 +/- 93.4; P = .6). Conclusion Commonly practiced restrictions surrounding 6-MP ingestion might not influence outcome but may hinder adherence. Future recommendations regarding 6-MP intake during maintenance therapy for childhood ALL should aim to simplify administration.",,"['Landier, Wendy', 'Hageman, Lindsey', 'Chen, Yanjun', 'Kornegay, Nancy', 'Evans, William E', 'Bostrom, Bruce C', 'Casillas, Jacqueline', 'Dickens, David S', 'Angiolillo, Anne L', 'Lew, Glen', 'Maloney, Kelly W', 'Mascarenhas, Leo', 'Ritchey, A Kim', 'Termuhlen, Amanda M', 'Carroll, William L', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Wong, F Lennie', 'Bhatia, Smita']","['Landier W', 'Hageman L', 'Chen Y', 'Kornegay N', 'Evans WE', 'Bostrom BC', 'Casillas J', 'Dickens DS', 'Angiolillo AL', 'Lew G', 'Maloney KW', 'Mascarenhas L', 'Ritchey AK', 'Termuhlen AM', 'Carroll WL', 'Relling MV', 'Wong FL', 'Bhatia S']","[""Wendy Landier, Lindsey Hageman, Yanjun Chen, and Smita Bhatia, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL; Nancy Kornegay, William E.

Recently, heterobifunctional small-molecule BET degraders have been designed based upon the proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) concept to induce BET protein degradation. Herein, we present our design, synthesis, and evaluation of a new class of PROTAC BET degraders. One of the most promising compounds, 23, effectively degrades BRD4 protein at concentrations as low as 30 pM in the RS4;11 leukemia cell line, achieves an IC50 value of 51 pM in inhibition of RS4;11 cell growth and induces rapid tumor regression in vivo against RS4;11 xenograft tumors.

Relationship between variations of pollutant concentrations and cancers in lung and blood was investigated using statistical software R and MiniTab to perform time series analysis. Results of the present study revealed that the mortality rate of leukemia had a direct significant correlation with concentrations of nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide in the air (P<0.05).

By inhibiting autophagy, HCQ enhances the anti-CML efficiency of chemotherapy. In the present study, we demonstrated that HCQ sensitized CML cells to Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell-mediated lysis. HCQ inhibited autophagy in CML cells, but the sensitizing effects of HCQ were autophagy-independent. Since the sensitization was not mimicked by ATG7 knockdown and even occurred in the absence of ATG7. We revealed that in a time-dependent manner HCQ induced the expression of NKG2D ligand ULBP4 on the surface of CML cells. This marks the leukemia cell for recognition by Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. Blocking the interaction of NKG2D with its ligands deleted the sensitizing effects of HCQ. In addition, we showed that HCQ did not affect the synthesis or degradation of ULBP4, but induced the translocation of ULBP4 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Our results uncovered a previously unknown mechanism for HCQ in CML treatment that underlines the ability of HCQ to modulate the immune visibility of CML cells, and pave the way to the development of new combination treatments with HCQ and Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells.",,"['Han, Biqing', 'Zhao, Yanmin', 'Lin, Yu', 'Fu, Shan', 'Wang, Limengmeng', 'Zhang, Mingming', 'Tie, Ruxiu', 'Wang, Binsheng', 'Luo, Yi', 'Liu, Lizhen', 'Yu, Jian', 'Huang, He']","['Han B', 'Zhao Y', 'Lin Y', 'Fu S', 'Wang L', 'Zhang M', 'Tie R', 'Wang B', 'Luo Y', 'Liu L', 'Yu J', 'Huang H']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310003, P.R.

The significance of 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangement has been well recognized in acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myeloid leukemia. However, the clinical importance of 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangement in classical Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms is unknown. Here we reported 15 patients with classical Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms showing 3q26.2 rearrangement, including inv(3)(q21q26.2) (n=6), t(3;21)(q26.2;q22)(n=4), t(3;3)(q21;q26.2)(n=3), inv(3)(q13.3q26.2)(n=1), and t(3;12)(q26.2;p13)(n=1). In addition to 3q26.2 rearrangement, 9 of 15 cases had other concurrent karyotypical abnormalities, including -7/7q- and -5/5q-. There were 8 men and 7 women with a median age of 59 years (range, 35-79 years) at initial diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms: 8 patients had primary myelofibrosis, 4 had polycythemia vera, and 3 had essential thrombocythemia. JAK2 V617F mutation was detected in 8/14 patients, including 4/4 with polycythemia vera. The median interval from the initial diagnosis of myeloproliferative neoplasms to the detection of 3q26.2 rearrangement was 44 months (range, 1-219 months). At time of emergence of 3q26.2 rearrangement, 11 patients were in blast phase and 2 patients had increased blasts (6-19%). Dyspoiesis, predominantly in megakaryocytes, were detected in all patients with adequate specimens at time of 3q26.2 rearrangement. Following 3q26.2 rearrangement, 12 patients received chemotherapy, but none of them achieved complete remission. Of 14 patients with follow-up information, all died with a median overall survival time of only 3 months (range 0-14 months) after the emergence of 3q26.2 rearrangement.

We found that a 10 Bq/m(3) increase in indoor radon concentration was associated with a 1% increase in the incidence of lung cancer in male and a 7% increase in NHL in female children and adolescents in Korea aged less than 20 years. Leukemia was not associated with indoor radon concentration. The increase in NHL risk among young women requires confirmation in future studies, and the radon control program should consider children and adolescents.",,"['Ha, Mina', 'Hwang, Seung-Sik', 'Kang, Sungchan', 'Park, No-Wook', 'Chang, Byung-Uck', 'Kim, Yongjae']","['Ha M', 'Hwang SS', 'Kang S', 'Park NW', 'Chang BU', 'Kim Y']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Dankook University College of Medicine, 119 Dandae-ro, Dongnam-gu, Cheonan, Chungnam 31116, Korea. minaha@dku.edu.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Korea. cyberdoc@snu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences, Graduate School of Public Health, Seoul National University, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Korea. rjmcmc@gmail.com.', 'Department of Geoinformatic Engineering, Inha University, 100 Inha-ro, Nam-gu, Incheon 22212, Korea. nwpark@inha.ac.kr.', 'Department of Natural Radiation Safety, Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety, 62 Gwahak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34142, Korea. k384cbu@kins.re.kr.', 'Department of Natural Radiation Safety, Korea Institute of Nuclear Safety, 62 Gwahak-ro, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 34142, Korea. k337kyj@kins.re.kr.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Radioactive/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Child', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Radon/*adverse effects/chemistry', 'Republic of Korea/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking', 'Spatial Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*child', '*indoor radon', '*leukemia', '*lung neoplasm', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*spatial regression']",2017/03/25 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2017/03/25 06:00'],"['2017/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph14040344 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph14040344 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2017 Mar 24;14(4). pii: ijerph14040344. doi: 10.3390/ijerph14040344.,,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Radioactive)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",PMC5409545,,20170324,,,,,,,,,,,

With an aim to develop natural Bcr-Abl inhibitors, we performed virtual screening (VS) of ZINC natural compound database by docking with Abl kinase using Glide software. Two natural inhibitors ZINC08764498 (hit1) and ZINC12891610 (hit2) were selected by considering their high Glide docking score and critical interaction with the hinge region residue Met-318 of Abl kinase. The reactivity of the two molecules was assessed computationally by density functional theory calculations. Further, the conformational transition, hydrogen bond interactions, and the binding energies were investigated during 10-ns molecular dynamics simulation of the Abl-hit complex. When tested in vitro, hit1 compared to hit2 showed selective inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in Bcr-Abl-positive K-562 leukemia cells.

The I-branching beta-1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, converting the straight i to branched I histo-blood group antigens, reportedly could influence the migration, invasion, and metastasis of solid tumors. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We first chose the highly cytotoxic natural killer (NK)-92MI cells as effector against leukemia for this cell line has been used in several clinical trials. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting and nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay were performed to reexamine the role of NK-activating receptors, their corresponding ligands, and the tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens in this NK-92MI-leukemia in vitro system. The I role on cytotoxic mechanism was further studied especially on the effector-target interactions by cytotoxic analysis and conjugate formation assay. RESULTS: We showed that expression levels of leukemia surface ligands for NK-activating receptors did not positively reflect susceptibility to NK-92MI. Instead, the expression of I antigen on the leukemia cells was found important in mediating the susceptibility to NK targeting by affecting the interaction with effector cells. Furthermore, susceptibility was shown to dramatically increase while overexpressing branched I antigens on the I- cells. By both conjugate and cytotoxicity assay, we revealed that the presence of I antigen on leukemia cells enhanced the interaction with NK-92MI cells, increasing susceptibility to cell-mediated lysis. CONCLUSION: In our system, branched I antigens on the leukemia were involved in the immunosurveillance mediated by NK cells specifically through affecting the effector-target interaction.",['(c) 2016 AABB.'],"['Lee, Yen-Hua', 'Liao, Yi-Jen', 'Huang, Chin-Han', 'Chang, Fu-Ling', 'Fan, Ting-Hsi', 'Twu, Yuh-Ching']","['Lee YH', 'Liao YJ', 'Huang CH', 'Chang FL', 'Fan TH', 'Twu YC']","['Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, New Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'School of Medical Laboratory Science and Biotechnology, College of Medical Science and Technology.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'The Center of Translational Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Biotechnology and Laboratory Science in Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'I Blood-Group System/*immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology']",,,2017/03/25 06:00,2017/06/22 06:00,['2017/03/25 06:00'],"['2016/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.13982 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2017 Apr;57(4):1040-1051. doi: 10.1111/trf.13982.

Combination of UMI-77 and TRAIL in glioma cells led to the activation of caspase-8 and Bid, cleavage of caspase-3 and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), accumulation of tBid in the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. UMI-77 alone or in combination with TRAIL untethered pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bim and Bak from the sequestration of Mcl-1 and promoted the conformational activation of Bak. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) of Bid attenuated the cleavage of caspase-8, Bid, caspase-3 and PARP, and reduced the cytotoxicity of UMI-77 plus TRAIL as compared with control shRNA cells, indicating this synergy entails the crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic signaling. Taken together, UMI-77 enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by unsequestering Bim and Bak, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gliomas.",,"['Liu, Ji-Wei', 'Zhu, Zhi-Chuan', 'Li, Kui', 'Wang, Hong-Tao', 'Xiong, Zhi-Qi', 'Zheng, Jing']","['Liu JW', 'Zhu ZC', 'Li K', 'Wang HT', 'Xiong ZQ', 'Zheng J']","[""Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China."", ""Institute of Neuroscience, State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, People's Republic of China. dontyousee@163.com."", ""Institute of Neuroscience, State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, CAS Center for Excellence in Brain Science, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, 200031, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Life Science and Technology, Xinxiang Medical University, Henan, 453003, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China."", ""Shanghai Key Laboratory of New Drug Design, School of Pharmacy, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, People's Republic of China. zhengjing@ecust.edu.cn.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*metabolism', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Thioglycolates/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['Malignant glioma', 'Mcl-1', 'TRAIL', 'UMI-77']",2017/03/25 06:00,2017/12/22 06:00,['2017/03/25 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/22 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11010-017-2997-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11010-017-2997-x [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2017 Aug;432(1-2):55-65. doi: 10.1007/s11010-017-2997-x.

Results from these studies are inconclusive. Therefore, in the present study 25 years of German childhood cancer data were analyzed using interpolated background annual gamma dose rate per community in an ecological study. The main question was leukaemia; as exploratory questions we investigate central nervous system (CNS) tumours, thyroid carcinomas and diagnoses less likely to be related to radiation. A Poisson regression model was applied and a fractional polynomial model building procedure. As the main sensitivity analysis a community deprivation index was included as a potential confounder. It was found that outdoor background gamma annual dose rates in Germany range roughly from 0.5-1.5 mSv/a with an average of 0.817 mSv/a. No association of annual ambient gamma dose rates with leukaemia incidence was found. Amongst the exploratory analyses, a strong association was found with CNS tumour incidence [rate ratio for 1.5 vs 0.5 mSv/a: 1.35; 95% confidence interval (1.17, 1.57)]. The community level deprivation index was not a confounder. It is concluded that the present study did not confirm an association of annual outdoor ambient gamma dose rate and childhood leukaemia, corresponding to some studies and contrasting others. An association with CNS incidence was found in the exploratory analyses.

In this project, we studied TKI-induced changes in B cell-mediated immunity. METHODS: We collected peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) samples from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients before and during first-line imatinib (n = 20), dasatinib (n = 16), nilotinib (n = 8), and bosutinib (n = 12) treatment. Plasma immunoglobulin levels were measured, and different B cell populations in PB and BM were analyzed with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Imatinib treatment decreased plasma IgA and IgG levels, while dasatinib reduced IgM levels. At diagnosis, the proportion of patients with IgA, IgG, and IgM levels below the lower limit of normal (LLN) was 0, 11, and 6% of all CML patients, respectively, whereas at 12 months timepoint the proportions were 6% (p = 0.13), 31% (p = 0.042) and 28% (p = 0.0078). Lower initial Ig levels predisposed to the development of hypogammaglobulinemia during TKI therapy. Decreased Ig levels in imatinib-treated patients were associated with higher percentages of immature BM B cells. The patients, who had low Ig levels during the TKI therapy, had significantly more frequent minor infections during the follow-up compared with the patients with normal Ig values (33% vs. 3%, p = 0.0016). No severe infections were reported, except recurrent upper respiratory tract infections in one imatinib-treated patient, who developed severe hypogammaglobulinemia.

Conventional frontline therapy in fit patients is fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR). The trial hypothesized that including mitoxantrone with low-dose rituximab (FCM-miniR) would be non-inferior to FCR. A total of 200 patients were recruited to assess the primary end point of complete remission (CR) rates according to IWCLL criteria. Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate, minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity, safety and cost-effectiveness. The trial closed following a pre-planned interim analysis. At final analysis, CR rates were 76 FCR vs 55% FCM-miniR (adjusted odds ratio: 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.73). MRD-negativity rates were 54 FCR vs 44% FCM-miniR. More participants experienced serious adverse reactions with FCM-miniR (49%) compared to FCR (41%). There are no significant differences between the treatment groups for PFS and OS. FCM-miniR is not expected to be cost-effective over a lifetime horizon. In summary, FCM-miniR is less well tolerated than FCR with an inferior response and MRD-negativity rate and increased toxicity, and will not be taken forward into a confirmatory trial.

PI3Kalpha inhibitors, now in late-stage clinical development, elicit a robust compensatory increase in ER-dependent transcription that limits therapeutic efficacy. We investigated the chromatin-based mechanisms leading to the activation of ER upon PI3Kalpha inhibition. We found that PI3Kalpha inhibition mediates an open chromatin state at the ER target loci in breast cancer models and clinical samples. KMT2D, a histone H3 lysine 4 methyltransferase, is required for FOXA1, PBX1, and ER recruitment and activation. AKT binds and phosphorylates KMT2D, attenuating methyltransferase activity and ER function, whereas PI3Kalpha inhibition enhances KMT2D activity. These findings uncover a mechanism that controls the activation of ER by the posttranslational modification of epigenetic regulators, providing a rationale for epigenetic therapy in ER-positive breast cancer.","['Copyright (c) 2017, American Association for the Advancement of Science.']","['Toska, Eneda', 'Osmanbeyoglu, Hatice U', 'Castel, Pau', 'Chan, Carmen', 'Hendrickson, Ronald C', 'Elkabets,

A phase 1 dose-escalation study was initiated to examine the safety and efficacy of selinexor in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. Ninety-five patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were enrolled between January 2013 and June 2014 to receive 4, 8, or 10 doses of selinexor in a 21- or 28-day cycle. The most frequently reported adverse events (AEs) in patients with AML were grade 1 or 2 constitutional and gastrointestinal toxicities, which were generally manageable with supportive care. The only nonhematological grade 3/4 AE, occurring in >5% of the patient population, was fatigue (14%). There were no reported dose-limiting toxicities or evidence of cumulative toxicity. The recommended phase 2 dose was established at 60 mg ( approximately 35 mg/m(2)) given twice weekly in a 4-week cycle based on the totality of safety and efficacy data. Overall, 14% of the 81 evaluable patients achieved an objective response (OR) and 31% percent showed >/=50% decrease in bone marrow blasts from baseline. Patients achieving an OR had a significant improvement in median progression-free survival (PFS) (5.1 vs 1.3 months; P = .008; hazard ratio [HR], 3.1) and overall survival (9.7 vs 2.7 months; P = .01; HR, 3.1) compared with nonresponders. These findings suggest that selinexor is safe as a monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and have informed subsequent phase 2 clinical development.

The proportion of MDS patients referred for transplantation evaluation, those undergoing transplantation, and the reasons for not undergoing transplantation are unknown. In this retrospective analysis, predefined HCT eligibility and indications criteria were applied to 362 unselected patients with newly diagnosed MDS seen by leukemia faculty between 2008 and 2015 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Two hundred ninety-four patients (81%) were deemed eligible for transplantation and among these, transplantation was considered indicated in 244 (83%). Of these, 158 of 244 (65%) were referred for transplantation evaluation at a median of 3.9 months from diagnosis. Overall 120 of 362 (33%) underwent transplantation at a median of 7.7 months from diagnosis. Metastatic solid-organ malignancy was the major reason for transplantation ineligibility (54%), and death due to MDS, which occurred in 41% of candidates who did not undergo transplantation, was the major reason for not undergoing transplantation. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of referral for transplantation evaluation included age >/=65 (P < .001), >/=2 comorbidities (P = .008), intermediate-1/low risk MDS (P < .001), <5% blasts at diagnosis (overall P < .001), having Medicare/Medicaid health insurance (P < .001), not being married (P = .017), and diagnosis between 2008 and 2011 (P = .035). On multivariate analysis adjusting for all of the previous factors, diagnosis between 2008 and 2011 (P < .001), age >/=65 (P = .001), and <5% blasts at diagnosis (overall P = .031) were associated with a lower likelihood of referral for transplantation evaluation. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of undergoing transplantation included age >/=65 (P < .001), >/=2 comorbidities (P = .003), intermediate-1/low risk MDS (P < .001), <5% blasts (overall P < .001), very low/low/intermediate risk International Prognostic Scoring System-revised karyotype (P = .018), and having Medicare/Medicaid health insurance (P < .001).

The zebrafish hematopoietic system shares strong similarities in functional populations, genetic regulators, and niche interactions with its mammalian counterparts. These evolutionarily conserved characteristics, together with emerging technologies in live imaging, compound screening, and genetic manipulation, have been employed to successfully identify and interrogate novel regulatory mechanisms and molecular pathways that guide hematopoiesis. Significantly, perturbations in many of the key developmental signals controlling hematopoiesis are associated with hematological disorders and disease, including anemia, bone marrow failure syndromes, and leukemia. Thus, understanding the regulatory pathways controlling HSPC production and function has important clinical implications. In this review, we describe how the blood system forms and is maintained in zebrafish, with particular focus on new insights into vertebrate hematological regulation gained using this model.

In this study, a LC-MS-based method was carried out to investigate the metabolic alteration of ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide in human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) after treatment with Ara-C to reveal its antitumor mechanism. The metabolic results revealed that four nucleotides (ATP, ADP, CDP, and dCTP) could be used as potential biomarkers indicating the benefit of high-dose Ara-C over lower dose Ara-C treatment. Combining metabolic perturbation and cell cycle analysis, we conjectured that, apart from the acknowledged mechanism of Ara-C on tumor inhibition, high-dose Ara-C could present a specific action pathway. It was suggested that the pronounced rise in AMP/ATP ratio induced by high-dose Ara-C can trigger AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and subsequently Forkhead Box, class O (FoxO), to promote cell cycle arrest. Moreover, the significant decrease in CDP pool induced by high-dose Ara-C might further accelerate the reduction of dCTP, which then aggravates DNA synthesis disturbance. As a result, all of these alterations led to heightened tumor inhibition. This study provides new insight in the investigation of potential mechanisms in the clinical benefits of high-dose Ara-C in therapy for AML.",,"['Li, Zheng', 'Guo, Jian-Ru', 'Chen, Qian-Qian', 'Wang, Cai-Yun', 'Zhang, Wei-Jia', 'Yao, Mei-Cun', 'Zhang, Wei']","['Li Z', 'Guo JR', 'Chen QQ', 'Wang CY', 'Zhang WJ', 'Yao MC', 'Zhang W']","['State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau, China. lizhengcpu@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau, China. guojianrumust@gmail.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau, China. qqchen@must.edu.mo.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau Institute for Applied Research in Medicine and Health, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau, China.

Genetic lesions such as JAK2 mutations and BCR-ABL translocation are often mutually exclusive in MPN patients and lead to essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, or myelofibrosis or chronic myeloid leukemia, respectively. Nevertheless, coexistence of these genetic aberrations in the same patient has been reported. Whether these aberrations occur in the same stem cell or a different cell is unclear, but an unstable genome in the HSCs seems to be the common antecedent. In an effort to characterize the underlying genetic events that might contribute to the appearance of more than one MPN in a patient, we studied neoplastic cells from patients with dual MPNs by next-generation sequencing. We observed that most patients with two MPNs harbored mutations in genes known to contribute to clonal hematopoiesis through altered epigenetic regulation such as TET2, ASXL1/2, SRSF2, and IDH2 at varying frequencies (1%-47%). In addition, we found that some patients also harbored oncogenic mutations in N/KRAS, TP53, BRAF, EZH2, and GNAS at low frequencies, which probably represent clonal evolution. These findings support the hypothesis that hematopoietic cells from MPN patients harbor multiple genetic aberrations, some of which can contribute to clonal dominance. Acquiring mutations in JAK2/CALR/MPL or the BCR-ABL translocation probably drive the oncogenic phenotype towards a specific MPN. Further, we propose that the acquisition of BCR-ABL in these patients is frequently a secondary event resulting from an unstable genome.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kandarpa, Malathi', 'Wu, Yi-Mi', 'Robinson, Dan', 'Burke, Patrick William', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M', 'Talpaz, Moshe']","['Kandarpa M', 'Wu YM', 'Robinson D', 'Burke PW', 'Chinnaiyan AM', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3361-3981'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Exome', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*complications/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', '*Transcriptome']",,,2017/03/24 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24728 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Jun;92(6):555-561. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24728.

As CAKUT is a genetically heterogeneous disorder and most cases are genetically unexplained, we aimed to identify new CAKUT causing genes. Using whole-exome sequencing and trio-based de novo analysis, we identified a novel heterozygous de novo frameshift variant in the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) gene causing instability of the mRNA in a patient presenting with bilateral CAKUT and requiring kidney transplantation at one year of age. LIFR encodes a transmembrane receptor utilized by IL-6 family cytokines, mainly by the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Mutational analysis of 121 further patients with severe CAKUT yielded two rare heterozygous LIFR missense variants predicted to be pathogenic in three unrelated patients. LIFR mutants showed decreased half-life and cell membrane localization resulting in reduced LIF-stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation. LIFR showed high expression in human fetal kidney and the human ureter, and was also expressed in the developing murine urogenital system. Lifr knockout mice displayed urinary tract malformations including hydronephrosis, hydroureter, ureter ectopia, and, consistently, reduced ureteral lumen and muscular hypertrophy, similar to the phenotypes observed in patients carrying LIFR variants. Additionally, a form of cryptorchidism was detected in all Lifr-/- mice and the patient carrying the LIFR frameshift mutation. Altogether, we demonstrate heterozygous novel or rare LIFR mutations in 3.3% of CAKUT patients, and provide evidence that Lifr deficiency and deactivating LIFR mutations cause highly similar anomalies of the urogenital tract in mice and humans.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Methods: This study comprised 6110 reported cases of patients aged 0-14 years who were diagnosed as having primary cancer between 1993 and 2009. We chose cancer registries of seven prefectures, according to the international cancer registry standard of fewer than 10% death certificate only cases among cancer registries in Japan. We analyzed population-based cancer registration data in the seven prefectures between 1993 and 2009. We calculated childhood cancer incidence, age-specific incidence, crude incidence rate, age-adjusted incidence rate, confidence intervals and annual change for each prefecture and classified the data into 12 diagnostic groups, according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer (ICCC). Results: According to sex-specific incidence, males accounted for slightly more cases than females. Children 0-3 years old accounted for 41.1% of patients. Leukemia accounted for 36.0% of cancers, followed by central nervous system tumors with 15.0%, according to the ICCC. The crude incidence rate did not change substantially, remaining at an average 8-11 per 100 000 population. In addition, the age-adjusted incidence rate remained constant with an average 2 per 100 000 population. Conclusions: Using population-based cancer registry data, age-specific incidence and 12 diagnostic groups according to the ICCC showed characteristics of childhood cancers. The incidence rate of childhood cancers has been nearly stable in Japan over the past 15 years.","['(c) The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

Here, we examine the consequences of POFUT1 loss on the oncogenic signaling associated with certain leukemia-associated mutations of human Notch1, report the structures of human POFUT1 in free and GDP-fucose bound states, and assess the effects of Dowling-Degos mutations on human POFUT1 function. CRISPR-mediated knockout of POFUT1 in U2OS cells suppresses both normal Notch1 signaling, and the ligand-independent signaling associated with leukemogenic mutations of Notch1. Normal and oncogenic signaling are rescued by wild-type POFUT1 but rescue is impaired by an active-site R240A mutation. The overall structure of the human enzyme closely resembles that of the Caenorhabditis elegans protein, with an overall backbone RMSD of 0.93 A, despite primary sequence identity of only 39% in the mature protein. GDP-fucose binding to the human enzyme induces limited backbone conformational movement, though the side chains of R43 and D244 reorient to make direct contact with the fucose moiety in the complex. The reported Dowling-Degos mutations of POFUT1, except for M262T, fail to rescue Notch1 signaling efficiently in the CRISPR-engineered POFUT1-/- background.

By comparing RNA-seq data of a given cell type before and after a specific perturbation, we can detect and quantify SNVs in the RNA and discover SNVs with altered frequencies between distinct cellular states. Such differential variants in RNA (DVRs) may reflect allele-specific changes in gene expression or RNA processing, as well as changes in RNA editing in response to cellular perturbations or stimuli. Results: We have developed rMATS-DVR, a convenient and user-friendly software program to streamline the discovery of DVRs between two RNA-seq sample groups with replicates. rMATS-DVR combines a stringent GATK-based pipeline for calling SNVs including SNPs and RNA editing events in RNA-seq reads, with our rigorous rMATS statistical model for identifying differential isoform ratios using RNA-seq sequence count data with replicates. We applied rMATS-DVR to RNA-seq data of the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 in response to shRNA knockdown of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. rMATS-DVR discovered 1372 significant DVRs between knockdown and control. These DVRs encompassed known SNPs and RNA editing sites as well as novel SNVs, with the majority of DVRs corresponding to known RNA editing sites repressed after ADAR1 knockdown.

Their enormous regenerative potential coupled with lifetime persistence in the body, in contrast with the Progenitors, demand tight control of HSCs genome stability. Indeed, failure to accurately repair DNA damage in HSCs is associated with bone marrow failure and accelerated leukemogenesis. Recent observations exposed remarkable differences in several DNA-damage response (DDR) aspects between HSCs and Progenitors, especially in their DNA-repair capacities and susceptibility to apoptosis. Human HSCs in comparison with Progenitors exhibit delayed DNA double-strand break rejoining, persistent DDR signaling activation, higher sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of ionizing radiation and attenuated expression of DNA-repair genes. Importantly, the distinct DDR of HSCs was also documented in mouse models. Nevertheless, physiological significance and the molecular basis of the HSCs-specific DDR features are only partially understood. Taking radiation-induced DDR as a paradigm, this review will focus on the current advances in understanding the role of cell-intrinsic DDR regulators and the cellular microenvironment in balancing stemness with genome stability. Pre-leukemia HSCs and clonal hematopoiesis evolvement will be discussed as an evolutionary compromise between the need for lifelong blood regeneration and DDR. Uniquely for this review, we outline the differences in HSCs-related DDR as highlighted by various experimental systems and attempt to provide their critical analysis.","['(c) The Author 2017.

In this study, we investigated the effects of FNC on mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and the underlying mechanisms. In in vitro experiments, cell viability was detected by the CCK8 assay, and cell cycle progression and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry, and the expression of relative apoptosis proteins were detected by Western Blot. The in vivo antitumor effect of FNC was investigated in a SCID xenograft model. Finally, the mechanisms of action of FNC were assessed using a whole human genome expression profile chip. The data showed that FNC inhibited cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and FNC could induce apoptosis by the death recepter pathways in JeKo-1 cells and arrest the cell cycle in the G1/S or G2/M phase. Notably, FNC showed in vivo efficacy in mice bearing JeKo-1 xenograft tumors. Gene expression profile analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were mainly focused on the immune system process, cellular process and death.

METHODS AND PATIENT: A 60-year-old woman with newly diagnosed Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, with no visual complaints was evaluated by the Ophthalmology service for a baseline ocular examination. RESULTS: At presentation, ocular examination revealed a visual acuity of 20/25 in each eye. Slit lamp examination showed mobile white emboli throughout the conjunctival vasculature of both eyes, which was captured on video. Dilated fundus examination revealed peripheral vascular occlusion along with extensive collateral formation in both eyes and as dilation of vessels at the posterior pole of the left eye. Mobile arterial and venous emboli were also observed in the retinal vasculature, which were captured with slit-lamp color and infrared reflectance video imaging. CONCLUSION: Hyperviscosity syndrome is a rare circulation sequelae that occurs when blood is thickened secondary to an increase in immunoglobulins or a hyperproliferation of blood components as in bone marrow dyscrasias. The increase in viscosity is plainly observable in the retinal circulation, and this syndrome is often diagnosed based on visual symptoms and fundus examination. We report a patient with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia who presented with multiple ocular manifestations of hyperviscosity syndrome despite the absence of visual complaints. Ophthalmologists should be aware that regardless of the lack of any subjective visual changes, ocular findings of hyperviscosity syndrome should prompt quick referral to a Hematology Oncologist for evaluation of other end-organ damage. We also for the first time, provide video documentation of mobile emboli in the conjunctival and retinal vasculature.",,"['Choi, Rene Y', 'Jacoby, Rachel', 'Shakoor, Akbar']","['Choi RY', 'Jacoby R', 'Shakoor A']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, John A.

LG41, isolated from the Chinese medicinal plant Xanthium sibiricum, was subjected to epigenetic modulation using an NAD(+)-dependent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, nicotinamide. Epigenetic stimulation of the endophyte led to enhanced production of two new decalin-containing compounds, eupenicinicols C and D (3 and 4), along with two biosynthetically related known compounds, eujavanicol A (1) and eupenicinicol A (2). The structures and stereochemistry of the new compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis using LC-HRMS, NMR, optical rotation, and ECD calculations, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Compounds 3 and 4 exist in chemical equilibrium with two and three cis/trans isomers, respectively, as revealed by LC-MS analysis. Compound 4 was active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC of 0.1 mug/mL and demonstrated marked cytotoxicity against the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1).

PROCEDURE: This population-based study included 315 children from the NOPHO-AML 2004 trial. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 73 (23%) patients had EML: 39 (12%) had myeloid sarcoma, 22 (7%) had central nervous system disease, and 12 (4%) had both. EML was associated with young age (median age: 2.6 years), a high white blood cell count (median: 40 x 10(9) /l), M5 morphology (40%), and 11q23/MLL (KMT2A) rearrangements (34%). No patient received involved field radiotherapy. Five-year event-free survival did not differ significantly between the EML and the non-EML patients (54% vs. 45%, P = 0.57), whereas 5-year overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in the EML group (64% vs. 73%, P = 0.04). The risk of induction death was significantly higher for EML patients (8% vs. 1%, P = 0.002). There was a trend toward a lower risk of relapse for EML patients (5-year cumulative incidence of relapse 33% vs. 49%, P = 0.16).

New-onset acute leukemia patients do not always have visible circulating blasts in the peripheral blood (PB) at diagnosis. While the role of bone marrow flow cytometry for the diagnosis of acute leukemia is well established, the utility of PB flow cytometry (PBFC) is unknown. We performed a single-institution retrospective analysis to compare PBFC versus BMA in establishing or excluding a diagnosis of childhood acute leukemia. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively identified 485 PBFC samples with concurrent BMA from 2008 to 2013. Results of four-color flow cytometry for immunophenotypic characterization of leukemic versus nonclonal disease were characterized. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated among patients without a known diagnosis or prior therapy. RESULTS: Among 485 samples eligible for analysis, 120 had negative PBFC and BMA, 359 had positive PBFC and BMA, 3 had negative PBFC and positive BMA, and 3 had positive PBFC and negative BMA. There were small but significant differences in sensitivity (100 vs. 93.8%; P = 0.002) and positive predictive value (100 vs. 93.8%; P = 0.002) favoring BMA over PBFC among those demonstrating absence of circulating morphologic blasts. CONCLUSION: PBFC has high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of childhood acute leukemia. The predictive value of PBFC remains high for patients without visible circulating blasts and may enhance the diagnostic process for determining the indications for marrow testing.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Metrock, Laura K', 'Summers, Ryan J', 'Park, Sunita', 'Gillespie, Scott', 'Castellino, Sharon', 'Lew, Glen', 'Keller, Frank G']","['Metrock LK', 'Summers RJ', 'Park S', 'Gillespie S', 'Castellino S', 'Lew G', 'Keller FG']","['Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia."", 'Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.', ""Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AML', 'flow cytometry', 'hematopathology', 'immunophenotyping', 'leukemia']",2017/03/24 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26526 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26526.

We sought to determine whether vincristine-associated toxicities are higher among children with ALL concurrently given fluconazole prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis. PROCEDURE: Using a retrospective cohort design, we reviewed records of pediatric patients treated for newly diagnosed ALL from 2003 to 2013. Patients were classified by fluconazole exposure during induction. The development of vincristine-associated toxicity and vincristine dose adjustment were the primary outcomes evaluated. The adjusted risk difference (RD) for vincristine-related toxicity associated with triazole exposure was determined. RESULTS: We identified 197 patients meeting inclusion criteria for evaluation, 160 (81%) of whom received fluconazole prophylaxis. Among patients receiving fluconazole, 36/160 (22%) developed vincristine toxicity compared to 7/37 (19%) among those not receiving prophylaxis (RD: 3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11 to 18%). Adjusting for patient age and race, no statistically significant increased risk for vincristine-associated toxicity with fluconazole exposure was observed (RD 5%, 95% CI -8 to 17%). An increased risk for vincristine-associated toxicity was independently associated with age 10 years or older (RD 19%, 95% CI 4-34%). CONCLUSION: Co-administration of fluconazole during induction therapy for pediatric ALL does not significantly increase the risk for vincristine-associated toxicities; however, patients 10 years or older are at an increased risk for toxicity independent of fluconazole exposure. Prophylaxis with fluconazole during induction therapy for pediatric ALL, if warranted, appears to be a safe clinical practice.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Smitherman, Andrew B', 'Faircloth, Cassidy B', 'Deal, Allison', 'Troy, Michael', 'Gold, Stuart H']","['Smitherman AB', 'Faircloth CB', 'Deal A', 'Troy M', 'Gold SH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pharmacy, UNC Hospitals, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'UNC School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Fluconazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*adverse effects/methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['fluconazole', 'leukemia', 'pediatrics', 'vincristine']",2017/03/24 06:00,2017/10/17 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26525 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Oct;64(10). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26525.

Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based study to determine the cancer risk in Korean patients with IBD. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance claims data, we collected data on patients diagnosed with IBD (5595 Crohn's disease [CD] and 10 049 ulcerative colitis [UC]) from 2011 to 2014. Standardized incidence ratios [SIRs] of overall and site-specific cancers in IBD patients in comparison with the general population were calculated. Results: The overall cancer risk was higher in CD patients [SIR, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.0 in men and 3.3; 2.4-4.5 in women] and UC patients [1.9; 1.6-2.3 in men and 1.9; 1.5-2.4 in women]. There were significantly increased risks for the following cancers: small bowel cancer [31.2; 3.8-112.8], colorectal cancer [CRC] [3.7; 1.6-7.2] and haematological cancer [4.0; 1.1-10.3] in men with CD; small bowel cancer [61.1; 7.4-220.6], CRC [4.7; 1.5-10.9], liver cancer [15.3; 5.6-33.2], pancreatic cancer [8.6; 1.0-31.0] and haematological cancer [11.0; 3.6-25.7] in women with CD; CRC [2.1; 1.3-3.3] and cancer of the prostate [3.5; 2.1-5.5], brain/central nervous system [6.1; 1.3-17.9] and thyroid [2.2; 1.1-3.9] in men with UC; and CRC [3.0; 1.5-5.3], cancer of the liver [4.4; 1.6-9.7] and cervix uteri [5.7; 2.4-11.1], and haematological cancer [3.5; 1.1-8.1] in women with UC. Women with CD had an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL] and leukaemia. Women with UC had an increased risk of NHL.

Methods: We analysed 338 episodes of UYS fungaemia prospectively collected from 27 hospitals (Paris, France; 1 October 2002-31 December 2014) and compared these with 1998 single episodes of C. albicans fungaemia using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: The proportion of UYS fungaemia was stable over time. Thirty-five different species were identified (27 ascomycetes, 8 basidiomycetes), 11 had caspofungin MIC 50 >0.25 mg/L and 15 fluconazole MIC 50 >4 mg/L. Haematological malignancies [OR=2.39 (95% CI 1.79-3.18)] and prior exposure to antifungal drugs [OR=1.87 (1.30-2.69)] were independent predisposing factors for UYS infections upon multivariate analysis. However, when considering the genus/species complex level, only infections due to Candida kefyr -related species [OR=4.01 (2.42-6.64)] and to Trichosporon spp. [OR=5.38 (1.72-16.81)] remained associated with haematological malignancies, those due to the GEOTRICHUM group with acute leukaemia [OR=61.29 (19.23-195.36)], and infections with Trichosporon spp. or the GEOTRICHUM group with prior exposure to caspofungin [OR=15.67 (3.62-67.80) and OR=13.17 (3.33-52.03), respectively] but not to fluconazole. The global mortality at day 30 for UYS was similar to that for C. albicans (35.4%, and 39.9%, respectively), but very divergent results were observed according to the specific UYS. Conclusions: UYS encompass a high diversity of species, each with its own behaviour and predisposing factors for human infections. This variety makes it important to rapidly identify an isolate to the species level in order to optimize antifungal treatment.","['(c) The Author 2017.

Gas6 has a critical role in the development of multiple types of cancers, including pancreatic, prostate, oral, ovarian and renal cancers. Acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML) is a Gas6-dependent cancer, and Gas6 expression predicts poor prognosis in AML. Interestingly, Gas6 also has a role in establishing tumour dormancy in the bone marrow microenvironment and in suppressing intestinal tumorigenesis. Numerous studies regarding cancer therapy have targeted Gas6 and TAM receptors with good results. However, some findings have suggested that Gas6 is associated with the development of resistance to cancer therapies. Concerning these significant effects of Gas6 in numerous cancers, we discuss the roles of Gas6 in cancer development in this review. First, we introduce basic knowledge on Gas6 and TAM receptors. Next, we describe and discuss the involvement of Gas6 and TAM receptors in cancers from different organ systems. Finally, we highlight the progress in therapies targeting Gas6 and TAM receptors. This review presents the significant roles of Gas6 in cancers from different systems and may contribute to the continued promotion of Gas6 as a therapeutic target.",,"['Wu, Guiling', 'Ma, Zhiqiang', 'Hu, Wei', 'Wang, Dongjin', 'Gong, Bing', 'Fan, Chongxi', 'Jiang, Shuai', 'Li, Tian', 'Gao, Jianyuan', 'Yang, Yang']","['Wu G', 'Ma Z', 'Hu W', 'Wang D', 'Gong B', 'Fan C', 'Jiang S', 'Li T', 'Gao J', 'Yang Y']","['Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', ""Department of Geriatrics, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, 127 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Fourth Military Medical University, 169 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", ""Department of Thoracic Surgery, Tangdu Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, 1 Xinsi Road, Xi'an 710038, China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Fourth Military Medical University, 169 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Fourth Military Medical University, 169 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", ""Department of Aerospace Medicine, The Fourth Military Medical University, 169 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Fourth Military Medical University, 169 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", ""Department of Geriatrics, Xijing Hospital, The Fourth Military Medical University, 127 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China."", 'Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhongshan Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu 210008, China.', ""Department of Biomedical Engineering, The Fourth Military Medical University, 169 Changle West Road, Xi'an 710032, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism']",,,2017/03/24 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2017113 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2017.113 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2017 Mar 23;8(3):e2700. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2017.113.,,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",PMC5386520,,20170323,,,,,,,,,,,

This analysis examined the response of patients with lymphoproliferative disorders experiencing chemotherapy-induced anaemia to 4- or 8-week treatment with the biosimilar epoetin alpha. Treatment was initiated at first occurrence of haemoglobin (Hb) < 10 g/dL during chemotherapy and was stopped when Hb was >11 g/dL, when chemotherapy was completed, or in case of transfusion dependency. Response to epoetin alpha was defined as an increase in Hb of >1 g/dL or as an Hb > 11 g/dL. Stability was defined as change in Hb of +/-1 g/dL, and no response was indicated by a decrease in Hb of >1 g/dL or acquired transfusion dependence. Overall, 65 patients were enrolled (median age 69 years; 47.7% >/= 70 years old). Mean Hb levels at the initiation of epoetin alpha was 9.3 +/- 0.5 g/dL.

PML NBs coordinate chromosomal regions via modification of nuclear proteins that in turn may regulate genes in the vicinity of these bodies. However, few PML NB-associated genes have been identified. PML and PML NBs can also regulate mTOR and cell fate decisions in response to cellular stresses. We now demonstrate that PML depletion in U2OS cells or TERT-immortalized normal human diploid fibroblasts results in decreased expression of the mTOR inhibitor DDIT4 (REDD1). DNA and RNA immuno-FISH reveal that PML NBs are closely associated with actively transcribed DDIT4 loci, implicating these bodies in regulation of basal DDIT4 expression. Although PML silencing did reduce the sensitivity of U2OS cells to metabolic stress induced by metformin, PML loss did not inhibit the upregulation of DDIT4 in response to metformin, hypoxia-like (CoCl2) or genotoxic stress. Analysis of publicly available cancer data also revealed a significant correlation between PML and DDIT4 expression in several cancer types (e.g. lung, breast, prostate). Thus, these findings uncover a novel mechanism by which PML loss may contribute to mTOR activation and cancer progression via dysregulation of basal DDIT4 gene expression.",,"['Salsman, Jayme', 'Stathakis, Alex', 'Parker, Ellen', 'Chung, Dudley', 'Anthes, Livia E', 'Koskowich, Kara L', 'Lahsaee, Sara', 'Gaston, Daniel', 'Kukurba, Kimberly R', 'Smith, Kevin S', 'Chute, Ian C', 'Leger, Daniel', 'Frost, Laura D', 'Montgomery, Stephen B', 'Lewis, Stephen M', 'Eskiw, Christopher', 'Dellaire, Graham']","['Salsman J', 'Stathakis A', 'Parker E', 'Chung D', 'Anthes LE', 'Koskowich KL', 'Lahsaee S', 'Gaston D', 'Kukurba KR', 'Smith KS', 'Chute IC', 'Leger D', 'Frost LD', 'Montgomery SB', 'Lewis SM', 'Eskiw C', 'Dellaire G']","['Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nova Scotia Health Authority, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 1V8, Canada.', 'Departments of Genetics and Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, USA.', 'Departments of Genetics and Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, USA.', 'Atlantic Cancer Research Institute, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 8X3, Canada.', 'Atlantic Cancer Research Institute, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 8X3, Canada.', 'Atlantic Cancer Research Institute, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 8X3, Canada.', 'Departments of Genetics and Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, USA.', 'Atlantic Cancer Research Institute, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1C 8X3, Canada.', 'Department of Microbiology &Immunology, Dalhousie University, Halifax Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry &Biochemistry, Universite de Moncton, Moncton, New Brunswick, E1A 3E9, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, University of New Brunswick, Saint John, New Brunswick, E2L 4L5, Canada.', 'Department of Department of Food and Bioproduct Sciences, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, S7N5A8, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry &Molecular Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.', 'Beatrice Hunter Cancer Research Institute, Halifax, Nova Scotia, B3H 4R2, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",,,2017/03/24 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]']","['srep45038 [pii]', '10.1038/srep45038 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Mar 23;7:45038. doi: 10.1038/srep45038.,"['R01 HG008150/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH101814/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HG007436/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'MOP-84260/CIHR/Canada']","['0 (DDIT4 protein, human)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EVS87XF13W (cobaltous chloride)']",PMC5362932,,20170323,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the clinical and prognostic impact of the most common TERT A1062T variant in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia intensively treated within two prospective multicenter trials. Four hundred and twenty patients (age 17-60 years) were analyzed for the TERT A1062T variant by direct sequencing. Fifteen patients (3.6%) carried the TERT A1062T variant. Patients with the TERT A1062T variant had a trend towards less favorable and more intermediate 2/adverse karyotypes/genotypes according to the European Leukemia Net classification. In univariate and multivariate analysis, patients with the TERT A1062T variant had a significantly inferior overall survival compared to wild-type patients (6-year overall survival 20 vs. 41%, p = 0.005). Patients with the TERT A1062T variant showed a high rate of treatment-related mortality: 5/15 (33%) died during induction therapy or in complete remission as compared to 62/405 (15%) of the wild-type patients. In patients with the TERT variant, 14/15 (93%) suffered from non-hematological/non-infectious grade 3/4 adverse events (mostly hepatic and/or mucosal) as compared to 216/405 (53%) wild-type patients (p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, the TERT A1062T variant was an independent risk factor predicting for adverse events during induction chemotherapy.

Because lipids are now known to play an important role in cell signaling and regulation of homeostasis, and are often perturbed in malignancies, we undertook a comprehensive lipidomic survey of plasma from AML patients at time of diagnosis and also healthy blood donors. METHODS: Plasma lipid profiles were measured using three mass spectrometry platforms in 20 AML patients and 20 healthy blood donors. Data were collected on total cholesterol and fatty acids, fatty acid amides, glycerolipids, phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol esters, coenzyme Q10 and eicosanoids. RESULTS: We observed a depletion of plasma total fatty acids and cholesterol, but an increase in certain free fatty acids with the observed decline in sphingolipids, phosphocholines, triglycerides and cholesterol esters probably driven by enhanced fatty acid oxidation in AML cells. Arachidonic acid and precursors were elevated in AML, particularly in patients with high bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blasts and unfavorable prognostic risk. PGF2alpha was also elevated, in patients with low BM or peripheral blasts and with a favorable prognostic risk. A broad panoply of lipid classes is altered in AML plasma, pointing to disturbances of several lipid metabolic interconversions, in particular in relation to blast cell counts and prognostic risk. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate potential roles played by lipids in AML heterogeneity and disease outcome. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Enhanced catabolism of several lipid classes increases prognostic risk while plasma PGF2alpha may be a marker for reduced prognostic risk in AML.",,"['Pabst, Thomas', 'Kortz, Linda', 'Fiedler, Georg M', 'Ceglarek, Uta', 'Idle, Jeffrey R', 'Beyoglu, Diren']","['Pabst T', 'Kortz L', 'Fiedler GM', 'Ceglarek U', 'Idle JR', 'Beyoglu D']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Inselspital Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry, Inselspital Bern, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Chemistry and Molecular Diagnostics, University Hospital Leipzig, Germany.', 'Hepatology Research Group, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Hepatology Research Group, Department of Clinical Research, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,BBA Clin,BBA clinical,101633879,,,['NOTNLM'],"['12-HEPE, 12-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z,17Z-eicosapentaenoic acid', '12-LOX, 12-lipoxygenase', '2HG, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate', '2OG, 2-oxoglutarate', '8,9-DHET, 8,9-dihydroxy-5Z,11Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid', 'AA, arachidonic acid', 'ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Blast cell number', 'CE, cholesterol ester', 'CML, chronic myelogenous leukemia', 'CPT1a, carnitine palmitate transferase 1a', 'Cer, ceramide', 'CoQ10, coenzyme Q10', 'DG, diacylglycerol', 'DGLA, dihomo-gamma-linoleic acid', 'DIC, disseminated intravascular coagulation', 'EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5;5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)', 'ESI-, electrospray ionization negative mode', 'ESI +, electrospray ionization positive mode', 'Eicosanoids', 'FAA, fatty acid amide', 'FAB, French-American-British classification', 'FAME, fatty acid methyl ester', 'FAO, fatty acid oxidation', 'FLC-QqLIT-MS, fast liquid chromatography-quadrupole linear ion-trap mass', 'spectrometry', 'Fatty acids', 'GCMS, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry', 'LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine', 'LPE, lysophosphatidylethanolamine', 'Lipidomics', 'MG, monoacylglycerol', 'MRM, multiple reactions monitoring', 'MUFA, monounsaturated fatty acid', 'OPLS-DA, orthogonal PLS-DA', 'PC, phosphatidylcholine', 'PCA, principal components analysis', 'PE, phosphatidylethanolamine', 'PGE2, prostaglandin E2', 'PGF1alpha, prostaglandin 1alpha', 'PGF2alpha, prostaglandin F2alpha', 'PGH2, prostaglandin H2', 'PLS-DA, projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis', 'POEA, palmitoleoyl ethanolamide', 'PUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acid', 'Prognostic risk', 'SCD1, stearoyl CoA desaturase 1', 'SM, sphingomyelin', 'TG, triacylglycerol (triglyceride)', 'TxA2, thromboxane A2', 'TxB2, thromboxane B2', 'UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS, ultraperformance liquid chromatography-electrospray', 'ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry', 'mPGES-1, microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1']",2017/03/24 06:00,2017/03/24 06:01,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2017/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.bbacli.2017.03.002 [doi]', 'S2214-6474(17)30003-X [pii]']",epublish,BBA Clin. 2017 Mar 8;7:105-114. doi: 10.1016/j.bbacli.2017.03.002. eCollection 2017 Jun.,,,PMC5357680,,20170308,,,,,,,,,,,

Generating potent CAR T cells is of increasing importance in the field. Studies have demonstrated the importance of the Akt pathway in the regulation of T cell differentiation and memory formation. We now investigate whether inhibition of Akt signaling during ex vivo expansion of CAR T cells can promote the generation of CAR T cells with enhanced antitumor activity following adoptive therapy in a murine leukemia xenograft model. METHODS: Various T cell subsets including CD8+ T cells, bulk T cells, central memory T cells and naive/memory T cells were isolated from PBMC of healthy donors, activated with CD3/CD28 beads, and transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a second-generation CD19CAR containing a CD28 co-stimulatory domain. The transduced CD19CAR T cells were expanded in the presence of IL-2 (50U/mL) and Akt inhibitor (Akti) (1 muM) that were supplemented every other day. Proliferative/expansion potential, phenotypical characteristics and functionality of the propagated CD19CAR T cells were analyzed in vitro and in vivo after 17-21 day ex vivo expansion. Anti-tumor activity was evaluated after adoptive transfer of the CD19CAR T cells into CD19+ tumor-bearing immunodeficient mice. Tumor signals were monitored with biophotonic imaging, and survival rates were analyzed by the end of the experiments. RESULTS: We found that Akt inhibition did not compromise CD19CAR T cell proliferation and expansion in vitro, independent of the T cell subsets, as comparable CD19CAR T cell expansion was observed after culturing in the presence or absence of Akt inhibitor. Functionally, Akt inhibition did not dampen cell-mediated effector function, while Th1 cytokine production increased. With respect to phenotype, Akti-treated CD19CAR T cells expressed higher levels of CD62L and CD28 as compared to untreated CD19CAR T cells. Once adoptively transferred into CD19+ tumor-bearing mice, Akti treated CD19CAR T cells exhibited more antitumor activity than did untreated CD19CAR T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of Akt signaling during ex vivo priming and expansion gives rise to CD19CAR T cell populations that display comparatively higher antitumor activity.",,"['Urak, Ryan', 'Walter, Miriam', 'Lim, Laura', 'Wong, ChingLam W', 'Budde, Lihua E', 'Thomas, Sandra', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Wang, Xiuli']","['Urak R', 'Walter M', 'Lim L', 'Wong CW', 'Budde LE', 'Thomas S', 'Forman SJ', 'Wang X']","['T cell Therapeutics Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology & Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

BACKGROUND: Gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) is the most common type of stomach cancer. There is no efficient diagnostic molecular method for GA. METHOD: Applying Cytoscape software 3.4.0 and String Database, the PPI network was constructed for 200 genes. Based on centrality parameters, the critical nodes were screened. Gene ontology of the key proteins for pathway analysis and molecular function processing were done and the highlighted pathways and activities were discussed. RESULTS: Among 200 initial genes, 141 genes were included in a main connected network. Seven crucial proteins, including tumor protein p53, epidermal growth factor receptor, albumin, v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2, neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian), v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1, v-src sarcoma (Schmidt-Ruppin A-2) viral oncogene homolog (avian) and catenin (cadherin-associated protein), beta 1, 88kDa, and Myogenic differentiation 1, were introduced as key nodes of the network.

Although the reasons for this are likely manyfold, the agents utilized and the increased intensity of pediatric treatments compared to adult treatments are likely significant contributing factors. Asparaginase, an enzyme that converts asparagine to aspartic acid, forms the backbone of almost all pediatric regimens and works by depleting extracellular asparagine, which ALL cells are unable to synthesize. Asparaginase toxicities, which include hypersensitivity reactions, pancreatitis, liver dysfunction, and thrombosis, have hindered its widespread use in the adult population. Here, we review the toxicity and efficacy of asparaginase in adult patients with ALL. With the proper precautions, it is a safe and effective agent in the treatment of younger adults with ALL with response rates in the frontline setting ranging from 78% to 96%, compared to most trials showing a 4-year overall survival of 50% or better. The age cutoff for consideration of treatment with pediatric-inspired regimens is not clear, but recent studies show promise particularly in the adolescent and young adult population.

Their exceptional physicochemical properties, possibility of humanization, and unique antigen recognition properties make them excellent candidates for targeted delivery of biologically active components, including immunotoxins. In our previous efforts, we have successfully generated the monovalent and bivalent CD7 nanobody-based immunotoxins, which can effectively trigger the apoptosis of CD7-positive malignant cells. To pursue the possibility of translating those immunotoxins into clinics, we humanized the nanobody sequences (designated as dhuVHH6) as well as further truncated the Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE)-derived PE38 toxin to produce a more protease-resistant form, which is named as PE-LR, by deleting majority of PE domain II. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three new types of immunotoxins, dhuVHH6-PE38, dVHH6-PE-LR, and dhuVHH6-PE-LR, were successfully constructed. These recombinant immunotoxins were expressed in Escherichia coli and showed that nanobody immunotoxins have the benefits of easy soluble expression in a prokaryotic expression system. Flow cytometry results revealed that all immunotoxins still maintained the ability to bind specifically to CD7-positive T lymphocyte strains without binding to CD7-negative control cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that these proteins can be endocytosed into the cytoplasm after binding with CD7-positive cells and that this phenomenon was not observed in CD7-negative cells. WST-8 experiments showed that all immunotoxins retained the highly effective and specific growth inhibition activity in CD7-positive cell lines and primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. Further in vivo animal model experiments showed that humanized dhuVHH6-PE38 immunotoxin can tolerate higher doses and extend the survival of NOD-Prkdc(em26)Il2rg(em26)Nju (NCG) mice transplanted with CEM cells without any obvious decrease in body weight. Further studies on NCG mice model with patient-derived T-ALL cells, dhuVHH6-PE38 treatment, significantly prolonged mice survival with ~40% survival improvement. However, it was also noticed that although dhuVHH6-PE-LR showed strong antitumor effect in vitro, its in vivo antitumor efficacy was disappointing.

Venetoclax (Venclexta, formerly ABT-199, GDC-0199) is a highly selective BCL-2 inhibitor, which mimics its BCL-2 homology 3-domain to induce apoptosis. It was approved for treatment of previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients with 17p deletion early in 2016. It has also been in clinical trials for other B-cell lymphoid malignancies. Unlike the other recently approved targeted agents idelalisib and ibrutinib, so far there has been no relapse reported in some patients. Also, unlike the other targeted agents, it is effective against tumor cells that reside in the blood marrow. Despite its promising outcome in CLL, preclinical data have already uncovered mechanistic insights underlying venetoclax resistance, such as upregulation of MCL-1 or BCL-xL expression and protective signaling from the microenvironment. In this review, we describe the role of the BCL-2 family in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, the development of venetoclax, and its current clinical outcome in CLL and other B-cell malignancies.

The HDAC inhibitor givinostat/ITF2357 has been shown to exert anti-neoplastic activity against both systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis and myeloproliferative neoplasms through inhibition of the JAK/STAT pathway. These findings led us to hypothesize that givinostat might also act against CRLF2-rearranged BCP-ALL, which lack effective therapies. Here, we found that givinostat inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of BCP-ALL CRLF2-rearranged cell lines, positive for exon 16 JAK2 mutations. Likewise, givinostat killed primary cells, but not their normal hematopoietic counterparts, from patients carrying CRLF2 rearrangements. At low doses, givinostat downregulated the expression of genes belonging to the JAK/STAT pathway and inhibited STAT5 phosphorylation. In vivo, givinostat significantly reduced engraftment of human blasts in patient-derived xenograft models of CRLF2-positive BCP-ALL. Importantly, givinostat killed ruxolitinib-resistant cells and potentiated the effect of current chemotherapy. Thus, givinostat in combination with conventional chemotherapy may represent an effective therapeutic option for these difficult-to-treat subsets of ALL. Lastly, the selective killing of cancer cells by givinostat may allow the design of reduced intensity regimens in CRLF2-rearranged Down syndrome-associated BCP-ALL patients with an overall benefit in terms of both toxicity and related complications.",,"['Savino, A M', 'Sarno, J', 'Trentin, L', 'Vieri, M', 'Fazio, G', 'Bardini, M', 'Bugarin, C', 'Fossati, G', 'Davis, K L', 'Gaipa, G', 'Izraeli, S', 'Meyer, L H', 'Nolan, G P', 'Biondi, A', 'Te Kronnie, G', 'Palmi, C', 'Cazzaniga, G']","['Savino AM', 'Sarno J', 'Trentin L', 'Vieri M', 'Fazio G', 'Bardini M', 'Bugarin C', 'Fossati G', 'Davis KL', 'Gaipa G', 'Izraeli S', 'Meyer LH', 'Nolan GP', 'Biondi A', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Palmi C', 'Cazzaniga G']","['Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leukemia Research Section, Edmond and Lily Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel."", 'Department of Molecular Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Preclinical R&D Department, Italfarmaco S.p.A., Cinisello Balsamo, Milan, Italy.', 'Baxter Laboratory in Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Leukemia Research Section, Edmond and Lily Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel."", 'Department of Molecular Human Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Baxter Laboratory in Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.', 'Tettamanti Research Center, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano Bicocca, Fondazione MBBM, Monza, Italy.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7077-8422'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Carbamates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitriles', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2017/03/24 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/05 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201793 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.93 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2365-2375. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.93.

We retrospectively analyzed nine aggressive-type ATL patients who underwent allo-HSCT at a single institution in Miyazaki from 2006.1.1 to 2015.7.31. Among nine ATL patients, three had used mogamulizumab before treatment with allo-HSCT because of the poor control of refractory ATL. All three patients were treated with four to eight cycles of mogamulizumab. The interval from last administration of mogamulizumab to allo-HSCT was two to five months. All three patients with prior mogamulizumab treatment developed mild-moderate acute GVHD (grade 2) 28, 34, or 40 days after allo-HSCT. Acute GVHD was controlled by prednisolone treatment. Two patients in complete remission before allo-HSCT exhibited relatively prolonged survival (survival rate, 66%). Moreover, one patient developed human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy-mimicking myelitis at five months after allo-HSCT. In contrast, two of six ATL patients without a history of mogamulizumab use survived (survival rate 33%). Thus, in cases of mogamulizumab use before treatment with allo-HSCT for refractory ATL, an appropriately long interval from the last administration of mogamulizumab to allo-HSCT may be one of factors to reduce TRM by acute GVHD, and to subsequently enhance graft-versus-tumor effects in ATL cases. Furthermore, caution is needed when administering mogamulizumab before allo-HSCT for severe GVHD and TRM.",,"['Kawano, Noriaki', 'Kuriyama, Takuro', 'Yoshida, Shuro', 'Kawano, Sayaka', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Marutsuka, Kousuke', 'Minato, Seiichirou', 'Yamashita, Kiyoshi', 'Ochiai, Hidenobu', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Ishikawa, Fumihiko', 'Kikuchi, Ikuo']","['Kawano N', 'Kuriyama T', 'Yoshida S', 'Kawano S', 'Yamano Y', 'Marutsuka K', 'Minato S', 'Yamashita K', 'Ochiai H', 'Shimoda K', 'Ishikawa F', 'Kikuchi I']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Miyazaki Prefectural Miyazaki Hospital.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Clin Exp Hematop,Journal of clinical and experimental hematopathology : JCEH,101141257,IM,"['Adult', 'Allografts', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*chemically induced', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,,2017/03/24 06:00,2017/04/11 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3960/jslrt.56.135 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Hematop. 2017;56(3):135-144. doi: 10.3960/jslrt.56.135.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",PMC6144179,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparing the results with standard MRD monitoring based on immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor (Ig/TCR) gene rearrangements and with quantification of IKZF1 deletion, we observed very good correlation for the methods in a majority of patients; however, >20% of children (25% [8/32] with minor and 12.5% [1/8] with major-BCR-ABL1 variants in the consecutive cohorts) had significantly (>1 log) higher levels of BCR-ABL1 fusion than Ig/TCR rearrangements and/or IKZF1 deletion.

Previous studies have failed to investigate the role of natural regulatory T cells (nTregs) on the mitigation of GvHD by AzaC, instead focusing on the generation of suppressive Tregs (CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+)) through the in vivo conversion of alloreactive donor T effectors (Teffs; CD4(+)CD25(-)FOXP3(-)) and the direct antiproliferative effects of AzaC on allogeneic T cells. Using B6.Foxp3(DTR/GFP) mice in which Tregs can be specifically ablated through administration of diphtheria toxin, we demonstrate that natural Tregs are required in the donor graft for AzaC to optimally protect against GvHD and that nTregs, unlike Teffs (CD3(+)FOXP3(-)), are resistant to the antiproliferative effects of AzaC. Gene expression analysis identified the potent cell cycle inhibitor, p21, was significantly upregulated in Teffs but not nTregs after treatment with AzaC. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Teffs deficient in p21 are less sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of AzaC. These results demonstrate that nTregs are essential for AzaC to fully protect against GvHD and have important clinical implications for future clinical trials testing AzaC as a novel method of GvHD prophylaxis in man.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Cooper, Matthew L', 'Choi, Jaebok', 'Karpova, Darja', 'Vij, Kiran', 'Ritchey, Julie', 'Schroeder, Mark A', 'DiPersio, John F']","['Cooper ML', 'Choi J', 'Karpova D', 'Vij K', 'Ritchey J', 'Schroeder MA', 'DiPersio JF']","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110.', 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110 jdipersi@wustl.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5590-087X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4924-8990']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/*metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Postoperative Complications/*prevention & control', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*drug effects/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*drug effects/immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2017/03/24 06:00,2017/05/02 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2015/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1502399 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1502399 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2017 May 1;198(9):3746-3754. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1502399.

Aim of this study was to assess the influence of polymorphisms in MDR1 and CYP3A5 genes on imatinib trough levels, cytogenetic and molecular response in patients with CML. Newly diagnosed patients with chronic-phase CML started on imatinib therapy were enrolled and followed up prospectively for 24 months. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were genotyped; C1236T, C3435T, G2677T/A in MDR1 gene and A6986G in CYP3A5 gene. Genotyping was done using PCR-RFLP method and validated by direct gene sequencing. Trough levels of imatinib were measured using LC-MS/MS. Cytogenetic response was assessed by conventional bone-marrow cytogenetics. Molecular response was assessed by qRTPCR using international scale. A total of 173 patients were included, out of which 71 patients were imatinib responders, while 102 were non-responders. Marked inter-individual variability in trough levels of imatinib was seen. Patients with GG genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G (P=0.016) and TT genotype for MDR1-C3435T (P=0.013) polymorphisms had significantly higher trough levels of imatinib. Patients with AA genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G [RR=1.448, 95% CI (1.126, 1.860), P=0.029] and CC genotype for MDR1-C1236T [RR=1.397, 95% CI (1.066, 1.831), P=0.06] &MDR1-C3435T [RR=1.508, 95% CI (1.186, 1.917), P=0.018] polymorphisms were at high risk for failure of imatinib therapy. Patients with CGC haplotype for MDR1 polymorphisms had significantly lower imatinib trough levels and were at a higher risk of imatinib failure [RR=1.547, 95% CI (1.324, 1.808), P<0.001]. GG vs. non-GG genotype for CYP3A5-A6986G [adjusted OR: 0.246; 95% CI (0.116, 0.519); P<0.001] and TT vs. non-TT genotype for MDR1-C1236T [adjusted OR: 0.270; 95% CI (0.110, 0.659); P=0.004] &MDR1-C3435T [adjusted OR: 0.289; 95% CI (0.135, 0.615); P=0.001] polymorphisms were independent factors predicting imatinib response in multivariate analysis. To conclude, MDR1 and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms significantly influence plasma trough levels and therapeutic response of imatinib in patients with CML.

We show that embryonic stem cells (ESCs) mainly express DIDO3 and that their differentiation after leukemia inhibitory factor withdrawal requires DIDO1 expression. C-terminal truncation of DIDO3 (Dido3DeltaCT) impedes ESC differentiation while retaining self-renewal; small hairpin RNA-Dido1 ESCs have the same phenotype. Dido3DeltaCT ESC differentiation is rescued by ectopic expression of DIDO3, which binds the Dido locus via H3K4me3 and RNA POL II and induces DIDO1 expression. DIDO1, which is exported to cytoplasm, associates with, and is N-terminally phosphorylated by PKCiota. It binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase WWP2, which contributes to cell fate by OCT4 degradation, to allow expression of primitive endoderm (PE) markers. PE formation also depends on phosphorylated DIDO3 localization to centrosomes, which ensures their correct positioning for PE cell polarization. We propose that DIDO isoforms act as a switchboard that regulates genetic programs for ESC transition from pluripotency maintenance to promotion of differentiation.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors.

However, ATG can also cause delayed immune reconstitution of T cells, negatively affecting survival. We studied the relation between exposure to ATG and clinical outcomes in adult patients with acute leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. METHODS: We did a retrospective, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of data from patients with acute lymphoid leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome receiving their first T-cell repleted allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell HCT with ATG (thymoglobulin) as part of non-myeloablative conditioning from March 1, 2004, to June 1, 2015. Patients received a cumulative intravenous dose of 8 mg/kg divided over 4 days, starting on day -8 before HCT. Active ATG concentrations were measured using a validated bioassay and pharmacokinetic exposure measures (maximum concentration, concentration at time of infusion of the graft, time to reach a concentration of 1 arbitary unit [AU] per day/mL, area under the curve [AUC], and the AUC before and after HCT) were calculated with a validated population pharmacokinetic model. The main outcome of interest was 5-year overall survival, defined as days to death from any cause or last follow-up. Other outcomes were relapse-related mortality, non-relapse mortality, event-free survival, acute and chronic GvHD, and assessment of current and optimum dosing. We used Cox proportional hazard models and Fine-Gray competing risk models for the analyses. FINDINGS: 146 patients were included. ATG exposure after HCT was shown to be the best predictor for 5-year overall survival. Optimum exposure after transplantation was determined to be 60-95 AU per day/mL. Estimated 5-year overall survival in the group who had optimum exposure (69%, 95% CI 55-86) was significantly higher than in the group who had below optimum exposure (32%, 20-51, p=0.00037; hazard ratio [HR] 2.41, 95% CI 1.15-5.06, p=0.020) and above optimum exposure (48%, 37-62, p=0.030; HR 2.11, 95% CI 1.04-4.27, p=0.038). Patients in the optimum exposure group had a greater chance of event-free survival than those in the below optimum exposure group (HR 2.54, 95% CI 1.29-5.00, p=0.007; HR for the above optimum group: 1.83, 0.97-3.47, p=0.063). Above-optimum exposure led to higher relapse-related mortality compared with optimum exposure (HR 2.66, 95% CI 1.12-6.31; p=0.027). Below optimum exposure increased non-relapse mortality compared with optimum exposure (HR 4.36, 95% CI 1.60-11.88; p=0.0040), grade 3-4 acute GvHD (3.09, 1.12-8.53; p=0.029), but not chronic GvHD (2.38, 0.93-6.08; p=0.070). Modelled dosing based on absolute lymphocyte counts led to higher optimum target attainment than did weight-based dosing. INTERPRETATION: Exposure to ATG affects survival after HCT in adults, stressing the importance of optimum ATG dosing. Individualised dosing of ATG, based on lymphocyte counts rather than bodyweight, might improve survival chances after HCT.

The research studies on QOL of FCs for leukemia patients are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the QOL of FCs for leukemia patients in Heilongjiang province, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was undertaken with 309 FCs for leukemia patients recruited from three hospitals in Heilongjiang province. The QOL of the participants was assessed using the Chinese version of WHOQOL-BREF. Multivariate regression models were established to determine the predictors of the QOL of FCs, including the socio-economic characteristics of patients and FCs, and the emotional distress, social support and family functions of FCs. RESULTS: The FCs had low QOL scores in all four domains: 12.7 +/- 2.8 for physical, 12.2 +/- 2.5 for psychological, 13.2 +/- 2.9 for social and 11.3 +/- 2.5 for environment. Social support is a major predictor of the QOL of FCs, with a standardized beta coefficient of ""high support"" ranging from 0.41 to 0.58 for the four domains, followed by family function (beta = 0.37 ~ 0.44 for psychological, social and environmental domains). The FCs who were older, highly educated, had no religious belief, suffered from a higher level of emotional distress, and provided care to younger patients and the patients without insurance coverage had lower QOL than the others. CONCLUSION: The study provides some important insights into the QOL of FCs for leukemia patients. The QOL of FCs for leukemia patients is low and low levels of support to FCs are a major predictor of low QOL of FCs.",,"['Yu, Hongjuan', 'Li, Limin', 'Liu, Chaojie', 'Huang, Weidong', 'Zhou, Jin', 'Fu, Wenqi', 'Ma, Yi', 'Li, Si', 'Chang, Yuying', 'Liu, Guoxiang', 'Wu, Qunhong']","['Yu H', 'Li L', 'Liu C', 'Huang W', 'Zhou J', 'Fu W', 'Ma Y', 'Li S', 'Chang Y', 'Liu G', 'Wu Q']","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150001, China.', 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Melbourne, VIC, 3086, Australia.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin, 150086, China. weidong218@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150001, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin, 150086, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the First Hospital of Harbin, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 100730, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, 150081, China.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin, 150086, China. lgx6301@163.com.', 'School of Health Management, Harbin Medical University, 157 Baojian Road, Nangang District, Harbin, 150086, China. wuqunhong@163.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Health Qual Life Outcomes,Health and quality of life outcomes,101153626,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'China', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Home Nursing/*psychology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['China', 'Family caregiver', 'Leukemia', 'Quality of life']",2017/03/24 06:00,2017/04/25 06:00,['2017/03/24 06:00'],"['2016/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12955-017-0628-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12955-017-0628-6 [pii]']",epublish,Health Qual Life Outcomes. 2017 Mar 23;15(1):55. doi: 10.1186/s12955-017-0628-6.,,,PMC5363014,,20170323,,,,,,,,,,,

L-Asparaginase helps in removing acrylamide found in fried and baked foods that is carcinogenic in nature. L-Asparaginase is present in plants, animals and microbes. Various microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast and fungi are generally used for the production of L-asparaginase as it is difficult to obtain the same from plants and animals. L-Asparaginase from bacteria causes anaphylaxis and other abnormal sensitive reactions due to low specificity to asparagine. Toxicity and repression caused by bacterial L-asparaginase shifted focus to eukaryotic microorganisms such as fungi to improve the efficacy of L-asparaginase. Clinically available L-asparaginase has glutaminase and urease that may lead to side effects during treatment of ALL. Current work tested 45 fungal strains isolated from soil and agricultural residues. Isolated fungi were tested using conventional plate assay method with two indicator dyes, phenol red and bromothymol blue (BTB), and results were compared. L-Asparaginase activity was measured by cultivating in modified Czapek-Dox medium. Four strains have shown positive result for L-asparaginase production with no urease or glutaminase activity, among these C7 has high enzyme index of 1.57 and L-asparaginase activity of 33.59 U/mL. L-Asparaginase production by C7 was higher with glucose as carbon source and asparagine as nitrogen source. This is the first report focussing on fungi that can synthesize L-asparaginase of the desired specificity.

The proliferation of hematopoietic cells are regulated by some of the growth factors like interleukin 3 (IL-3), IL-6, erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, etc. In this study IL-6 pathways have been taken into consideration which induces JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways to decipher the CML progression stages.

Those factors, called longevities proteins, are a group of histone deacetylases, depend on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). Particularly noteworthy is the protein sirtuin 1, which further deacetylates numerous transcription factors, receptors and enzymes. Through its action reduces the activity of glucocorticoid receptors in the body. Products of gene SIRT1 expression is responsible for apoptosis, differentiation, senescence cells, also affect the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Cardioprotective and hypotensive impact is also very important. SIRT1 reduces the accumulation of fat and decreases the risk of visceral obesity. Low gene expression of SIRT1 therefore predispose to the development of metabolic syndrome. Homeostasis sirtuin 1 disorders can also be observed in certain neoplastic diseases, primarily hormone-dependent breast, ovarian and prostate cancer, as well as it can cause leukemias and lymphomas.

ABL1 kinase inhibitors have improved the clinical outcomes for patients with CML, with over 80% of patients treated with imatinib surviving for more than 10 years. Second-generation ABL1 kinase inhibitors induce more potent molecular responses in both previously untreated and imatinib-resistant patients with CML. Studies in patients with chronic-phase CML have shown that around 50% of patients who achieve and maintain undetectable BCR-ABL1 transcript levels for at least 2 years remain disease-free after the withdrawal of treatment. Here we characterize ABL001 (asciminib), a potent and selective allosteric ABL1 inhibitor that is undergoing clinical development testing in patients with CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In contrast to catalytic-site ABL1 kinase inhibitors, ABL001 binds to the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 and induces the formation of an inactive kinase conformation. ABL001 and second-generation catalytic inhibitors have similar cellular potencies but distinct patterns of resistance mutations, with genetic barcoding studies revealing pre-existing clonal populations with no shared resistance between ABL001 and the catalytic inhibitor nilotinib.

However, post-HCT relapse and regimen-related toxicity remain significant barriers to long-term survival. In recent years, new conditioning regimens have been explored to improve transplantation outcomes in patients with AML. Treosulfan combines a potent immunosuppressive and antileukemic effect with a low toxicity profile. METHODS: To investigate the role of treosulfan-based conditioning, the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation Acute Leukemia Working Party performed a registry analysis of 520 adult patients with AML who received treosulfan-based conditioning and underwent HCT between 2000 and 2012, including 225 patients in first complete remission, 107 in second or later complete remission, and 188 with active/advanced disease 188 (88 with primary refractory disease). The median patient age was 57 years (range, 20-73 years). Donors were human leukocyte antigen-identical siblings (n = 187), unrelated donors (n = 235), or mismatched related donors (n = 98). Conditioning regimens included treosulfan (42 g/m(2) [n = 396], 36 g/m(2) [n = 109], or 30 g/ m(2) [n = 15]) with fludarabine or alkylating agents followed by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells (bone marrow, n = 52; peripheral blood, n = 468). RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5-year overall survival, leukemia-free survival, relapse incidence, and nonrelapse mortality rates were 38%, 33%, 42%, and 25%, respectively. The incidence of grade II-IV acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease was 24% (grade III-V, 11%) and 38%, respectively. Only 11 patients (2%) developed veno-occlusive disease, with two deaths (0.4%) from veno-occlusive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Treosulfan-based conditioning regimens provide an acceptable long-term survival with favorable nonrelapse mortality and a very low risk of veno-occlusive disease. Further studies are needed to optimize the treosulfan-based conditioning regimen for patients with AML. Cancer 2017;123:2671-79.

ROR1 has recently been shown to be expressed in various types of cancer cells but not normal cells. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of single-chain Fragment variable (scFv) antibodies provide potential therapeutic advantages over whole antibody molecules. In the present study, scFvs against a specific peptide from the extracellular domain of ROR1 were selected using phage display technology. The selected scFvs were further characterized using polyclonal and monoclonal phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), soluble monoclonal ELISA, colony PCR, and sequencing. Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of selected scFv antibodies were also evaluated in lymphoma and myeloma cancer cell lines using MTT and annexin V/PI assays. The results of ELISA indicated specific reactions of the isolated scFvs against the ROR1 peptide. Colony PCR confirmed the presence of full-length VH and Vkappa inserts. The percentages of cell growth after 24 h of treatment of cells with individual scFv revealed that the scFv significantly inhibited the growth of the RPMI8226 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells in comparison with the untreated cells ( p < 0.05). Interestingly, 24-h treatment with specific scFv induced apoptosis cell death in the RPMI8226 and CLL cells.

We sought to determine the seroprevalence of selected zoonotic pathogens among patients diagnosed with haematologic malignancies and undergoing chemotherapeutic treatments in Romania, where much of the general population lives and/or works in contact with livestock. A convenience sample of 51 patients with haematologic cancer undergoing chemotherapy at a referral clinic in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, was surveyed regarding animal exposures. Blood samples were obtained and tested for evidence of infection with Bartonella species, Coxiella burnetii and Toxoplasma gondii, which are important opportunistic zoonotic agents in immunocompromised individuals. 58.8% of participants reported living or working on a farm, and living or working on a farm was associated with contact with livestock and other animals. 37.5% of participants were IgG seroreactive against one or more of five Bartonella antigens, and seroreactivity was statistically associated with living on farms. Farm dwellers were 3.6 times more likely to test IgG seroreactive to Bartonella antibodies than non-farm dwellers. 47.1% of the participants tested T. gondii IgG positive and 13.7% tested C. burnetii IgG positive, indicating past or latent infection. C. burnetii IgM antibodies were detected in four participants (7.8%), indicating possible recent infection. These results indicate that a large proportion of patients with haematologic cancer in Romania may be at risk for zoonotic infections or for reactivation of latent zoonotic infections, particularly with respect to Bartonella species.

The AYA population, generally regarded as patients aged 15 to 39 years, currently draws a good deal of attention, particularly in the area of therapy selection. The current trend is to treat this group of patients with leukemia regimens based on pediatric protocols, and results comparing pediatric approaches versus adult approaches to treatment are maturing. Results are pending from a large US trial in which pediatric-based treatment is given to AYA patients with ALL. In tandem with these new clinical trials, researchers have reported disease features in the AYA group that may explain some of the differences in response to treatment observed in the AYA population compared with the pediatric population. In addition, unique social factors in this age group add to the complexity of ALL therapy in the AYA population. AYA patients are developing independence and separating from their parents. They tend to be noncompliant. Young adults suffer from a lack of health care insurance and poor access to clinical trials, and have specific concerns regarding toxicities, in particular fertility.

METHODS: We examined the effects of four BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib, dasatinib, AVL-292, and CNX-774) on IgE-dependent activation and histamine release in blood basophils obtained from allergic patients (n=11) and nonallergic donors (n=5). In addition, we examined the effects of these drugs on the growth of the human basophil cell line KU812 and the human mast cell line HMC-1. RESULTS: All four BTK blockers were found to inhibit anti-IgE-induced histamine release from basophils in nonallergic subjects and allergen-induced histamine liberation from basophils in allergic donors. Drug effects on allergen-induced histamine release were dose dependent, with IC50 values ranging between 0.001 and 0.5 mumol/L, and the following rank order of potency: ibrutinib>AVL-292>dasatinib>CNX-774. The basophil-targeting effect of ibrutinib was confirmed by demonstrating that IgE-dependent histamine release in ex vivo blood basophils is largely suppressed in a leukemia patient treated with ibrutinib. Dasatinib and ibrutinib were also found to counteract anti-IgE-induced and allergen-induced upregulation of CD13, CD63, CD164, and CD203c on basophils, whereas AVL-292 and CNX-774 showed no significant effects. Whereas dasatinib and CNX-774 were found to inhibit the growth of HMC-1 cells and KU812 cells, no substantial effects were seen with ibrutinib or AVL-292. CONCLUSIONS: BTK-targeting drugs are potent inhibitors of IgE-dependent histamine release in human basophils. The clinical value of BTK inhibition in the context of allergic diseases remains to be determined.",['(c) 2017 The Authors.

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-allergic rhinitis activity of Shenqi and explore its underlying molecular mechanism. Ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis rat model was used to evaluate the anti-allergic rhinitis effect of Shenqi. The effect of Shenqi on IgE-mediated degranulation was measured using rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. Primary spleen lymphocytes were isolated to investigate the anti-allergic mechanism of Shenqi by detecting the expression of transcription factors via Western blot and the level of cytokines (IL-4 and IFN-gamma) via ELISA. In OVA-induced AR rat models, Shenqi relieved the allergic rhinitis symptoms, inhibited the histopathological changes of nasal mucosa, and reduced the levels of IL-4 and IgE. The results from the in vitro study certified that Shenqi inhibited mast cell degranulation. Furthermore, the results of GATA3, T-bet, p-STAT6, and SOCS1 expression and production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 demonstrated that Shenqi balanced the ratio of Th1/Th2 (IFN-gamma/IL-4) in OVA-stimulated spleen lymphocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that Shenqi exhibits an obvious anti-allergic effect by suppressing the mast cell-mediated allergic response and by improving the imbalance of Th1/Th2 ratio in allergic rhinitis.",,"['Shao, Yang-Yang', 'Zhou, Yi-Ming', 'Hu, Min', 'Li, Jin-Ze', 'Chen, Cheng-Juan', 'Wang, Yong-Jiang', 'Shi, Xiao-Yun', 'Wang, Wen-Jie', 'Zhang, Tian-Tai']","['Shao YY', 'Zhou YM', 'Hu M', 'Li JZ', 'Chen CJ', 'Wang YJ', 'Shi XY', 'Wang WJ', 'Zhang TT']","['State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. shaoyangyang@imm.ac.cn.', 'Department of Liver disease, Army General Hospital of PLA, Beijing 100700, China. zhzhym2006@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. humin@imm.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. lijz@imm.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. cchengjuan@imm.ac.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Changji Vocational and Technical College, Changji 831100, China. 13899670598@163.com.', 'Xinjiang Jinshikang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Urumchi 830000, China. w13909918288@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. wwenj@imm.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functions of Natural Medicines, Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100050, China. ttzhang@imm.ac.cn.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Nasal Mucosa/drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rhinitis, Allergic/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', '*Th1-Th2 Balance']",['NOTNLM'],"['Shenqi', 'Th1/Th2 balance', 'allergic rhinitis', 'anti-allergic activity', 'degranulation']",2017/03/23 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2017/03/23 06:00'],"['2017/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules22030504 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules22030504 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2017 Mar 22;22(3). pii: molecules22030504. doi: 10.3390/molecules22030504.,,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (shenqi)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",PMC6155389,,20170322,,,,,,,,,,,

The inclusion of nilotinib and dasatinib as first-line options in CML raised a debate on treatment selection. The aim of our study was to analyze predictive parameters for imatinib response as the first-line treatment of CML patients. METHODS: The study included 168 consecutive patients with chronic phase Philadelphia-positive CML who were diagnosed and treated with Imatinib 400 mg once daily at a single university hospital. Numerous parameters were analyzed in terms of imatinib response including comorbidities as well as occurrence of second malignancies. RESULTS: After the median follow-up of 87 months in 61 patients (36.3%), the imatinib failure was verified. Cox regression analysis identified hepatomegaly (p = 0.001), leukocytosis >/= 100 x 109/l (p = 0.001), blood blasts >/= 1% (p = 0.002), and the presence of additional cytogenetic aberrations (p = 0.002) as predictors of Imatinib failure. Based on these findings, a new prognostic model was developed according to which imatinib failure had 17% (8/47) of patients in low risk, 34.9% (30/86) of patients in intermediate risk, and 76.7% (23/30) of patients in high-risk group (HR = 3.973, 95% CI for HR 2.237-7.053, p < 0.001).

In various adult neoplasms OPN was shown to correlate with cancer progression, invasiveness and metastasis. AIM: to define the role of OPN in malignancies of children and young adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS: a structured PubMed and Google Scholar literature analysis based on reports published in English between I'1995 and XII'2015. RESULTS: 14 studies (four on hematological malignancies, four on bone tumors, three on CNS tumors, two on dendritic proliferative diseases and one on renal tumors) were identified. Higher levels of serum and cerebro-spinal fluid OPN protein, and high expressions of OPN mRNA and SPP1 gene were present in more aggressive and advanced childhood malignancies. In children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with CNS involvement and with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) and medulloblastoma, the serum and CSF OPN levels reflected tumor bulk and response to therapy, while in children with AT/RT and multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis with high-risk organs involvement, high OPN serum levels correlated with poorer survival. To the contrary, in osteosarcoma, high OPN mRNA and SPP1 gene expressions correlated with better survival and good response to chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The literature review suggests that OPN may play important roles in the development and progression of selected cancers of children and young adults, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, malignant gliomas, AT/RT and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. However, limited number of published studies prevents from definite concluding on the clinical utility of OPN as a marker of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment monitoring in these pediatric cancers.

A 14-Year, Single-Center Experience.",976-985,10.1513/AnnalsATS.201610-785OC [doi],"RATIONALE: Placement of an indwelling pleural catheter is an established modality for symptom relief and pleurodesis in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion. Concerns remain regarding possible infectious complications, risk of hemorrhage, and the rate of pleurodesis with the use of pleural catheters in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. OBJECTIVES: The goals of our study were: (1) to evaluate the safety and cumulative incidence of pleurodesis with indwelling pleural catheters for patients with hematologic malignancies, and (2) to evaluate overall survival of this cohort of patients with pleural effusions. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 172 patients with a hematologic malignancy who underwent placement of an indwelling pleural catheter between September 1997 and August 2011 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. A competing risk model analysis was used for complications and pleurodesis. Analysis was based on each patient's first intrapleural catheter. RESULTS: There were 172 patients with lymphoma (58%), acute (16%) or chronic leukemia (16%), or multiple myeloma (10%). The effusions were characterized as malignant (85.5%), infectious (4.1%), volume overload (4.7%), or therapy-related (4.7%). Chylothorax was found in 20.1%. Pleural biopsies were obtained from 13 patients. The cumulative incidence of all complications was 13.6%, and the cumulative incidence of all significant catheter-related complications was 9.5%. The incidence of empyema was 2.9%, and major bleeding (requiring transfusion or intervention) was 1.7%. Thirty-day procedure-associated mortality was 0.6%.

Ten months exposure to OTA at 300 microg/kg b.w. was sufficient to cause high incidence of tumours which became apparent clinically after a latency of up to a year. As a putative model for human kidney cancer, the study shows a silent organ-specific carcinogenic effect through protracted exposure up to middle age and focused probably on very few nephrons. So far, tumourigenesis has not been recognised until in the last quarter of natural rat life, but for OTA, rat renal carcinogenesis requires both long exposure and only during the first year of normal longevity. The present findings offer an experimental framework within which systematic histopathology during tumourigenesis might show whether findings of mechanistic studies in key focal neoplasms can reasonably be applied to OTA as a putative renal carcinogen for idiopathic kidney cancer in humans. Already, the rat tumours mimic those occurring spontaneously in the Eker rat, and there is disparity between the large necessary OTA exposure in the rat and the trace amounts of OTA consumed by humans.

They deliver bioactive macromolecules such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, allowing intercellular communication in multicellular organisms. EVs are secreted by all cell types, including immune cells such as natural killer cells (NK), and they may play important roles in the immune system. Currently, a large-scale procedure to obtain functional NK EVs is lacking, limiting their use clinically. In this report, we present a simple, robust, and cost-effective method to isolate a large quantity of NK EVs. After propagating and activating NK cells ex vivo and then incubating them in exosome-free medium for 48 h, EVs were isolated using a polymer precipitation method. The isolated vesicles contain the tetraspanin CD63, an EV marker, and associated proteins (fibronectin), but are devoid of cytochrome C, a cytoplasmic marker. Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed a size distribution between 100 and 200 nm while transmission electron microscopy imaging displayed vesicles with an oval shape and comparable sizes, fulfilling the definition of EV. Importantly, isolated EV fractions were cytotoxic against cancer cells. Furthermore, our results demonstrate for the first time that isolated activated NK (aNK) cell EVs contain the cytotoxic proteins perforin, granulysin, and granzymes A and B, incorporated from the aNK cells. Activation of caspase -3, -7 and -9 was detected in cancer cells incubated with aNK EVs, and caspase inhibitors blocked aNK EV-induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that aNK EVs activate caspase pathways in target cells. The ability to isolate functional aNK EVs on a large scale may lead to new clinical applications.

Furthermore, many AML models are based on reciprocal chromosomal translocations that only reflect the minority of AML patients, whereas more than 50% of patients have a normal karyotype. The majority of AML, however, is driven by somatic mutations. Thus, identification as well as a detailed molecular and functional characterization of the role of these driver mutations via improved AML models is required for better approaches toward novel targeted therapies. Using the IDH2 R140Q mutation as a model, we present a new effective methodology here using the RNA-guided clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to reproduce or remove AML-associated mutations in or from human leukemic cells, respectively, via introduction of a DNA template at the endogenous gene locus via homologous recombination.

Recent studies suggest that cellular homeostasis plays an essential role in maintaining the function of HSCs because dysregulation of cellular homeostasis is one of the major factors underlying the malignant transformation of HSCs. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and autophagy, key factors regulating cellular homeostasis, are commonly observed in the human body. Autophagy can be induced by ROS through a variety of signaling pathways, and conversely inhibits ROS-induced damage to cells and tissues. ROS and autophagy coordinate to maintain cellular homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that both of ROS and autophagy play important roles in the development of leukemia and are closely involved in drug resistance in leukemia. Interference with cellular homeostasis by promoting programmed leukemia cell death via ROS and autophagy has been verified to be an efficient technique in the treatment of leukemia. However, the critical roles of ROS and autophagy in the development of leukemia are largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the roles of ROS and autophagy in the pathogenesis of leukemia, which may allow the identification of novel targets and drugs for the treatment of leukemia based on the regulation of HSCs homeostasis through ROS and autophagy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

RESULTS: The 3-year incidence of progression, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and overall survival (OS) were 26% (95% confidence interval [CI], 18%-37%), 35% (95% CI, 26%-47%), and 41% (95% CI, 30%-52%), respectively. MKpos was the only prognostic factor that increased the risk of disease progression compared with good-risk cytogenetics (hazard ratio [HR] = 9.5, P = .003) as well as MKneg (HR = 3.3, P = .01). For TRM, HCT-CI >/= 3, but not age >65 years, was associated with worse outcomes (HR = 3.1, P = .007). Cytogenetics and HCT-CI enabled us to identify prognostic groups for OS. MKpos patients had the worst 3-year OS (17%), whereas patients with good-risk cytogenetics and HCT-CI < 3 had the best OS (92%). CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that allo-HSCT can provide long-term survival in older MDS patients. Cytogenetics and HCT-CI identify prognostic risk groups and guide selection of older MDS patients who are candidates for allo-HSCT. Cancer 2017;123:2661-70.

RECENT FINDINGS: B cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL) diagnosis remains challenging in the absence of clear immunophenotypic or cytogenetic signature and overlap with mantle cell lymphoma. New molecular defects have been identified in T cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), especially in the JAK STAT pathway. Like in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), B-PLL treatment depends on the presence of TP53 dysfunction. In T-PLL, alemtuzumab still remains the standard of care. Allogeneic transplantation is the only curable option. Thanks to reduced intensity conditioning regimens, it has become accessible to a larger number of patients. PLL prognosis remains poor with conventional therapies.

Achievement of a negative MRD state assessed by multicolor flowcytometry (MFC) is an important predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in ALL patients. We sought to determine whether panels of antibodies combination are more suitable for detection of MRD in Childhood ALL. Eighty-four (84) patients with ALL (B-lineage subtype) were enrolled in this study. Normal template for B cell precursors was established in 15 control participants using 4-four panels of monoclonal Antibodies (Mo Abs),{CD22, CD45, CD58 and CD97 in combination with CD10, CD19, CD34}. At diagnosis, CD22 exhibited the lowest incidence of expression in only 50% of all patients, while CD45, CD58, and CD97 were expressed in 80.9, 59.5 and 92.8%, respectively. Analysis of MRD was performed for each Mo Abs combination at day 0 and day 14 post-induction of chemotherapy by 4-color (FCM). The incidence of MRD was 61.9, 70.6, 60.0 and 55.1% for CD22, CD45, CD58 and CD97, respectively. In B-ALL patients, (CD10/CD19/CD34/CD45) + (CD10/CD19/CD34/CD97) represented the highest incidence of expression of leukemic cells markers with a significant correlation with blasts count, suggesting that these are more specific for MRD detection. Also FCM is relatively cost effective for detection of MRD in ALL patients and its applicability in routine leukemia lab is valuable. MRD evaluation at the end of the induction therapy (i.e. day 35 or 42 according to the different schedules) is advised. Also, Ig/T cell receptor gene rearrangements and gene fusions analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are preferred.",,"['Baraka, Ahmad', 'Sherief, Laila M', 'Kamal, Naglaa M', 'Shorbagy, Shereen El']","['Baraka A', 'Sherief LM', 'Kamal NM', 'Shorbagy SE']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt. barakalab@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Department of Pediatric, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9949-4124'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['4-color flow cytometry', 'B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Minimal residual disease (MRD)']",2017/03/23 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-017-2206-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-017-2206-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2017 Jun;105(6):784-791. doi: 10.1007/s12185-017-2206-4.

This activity positions the pathway as a regulator of the severity of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations. Because many genetic diseases result from nonsense alleles, therapeutics inducing readthrough of premature termination codons and/or inhibition of NMD have been of great interest. Several means of enhancing translational readthrough have been reported to concomitantly inhibit NMD efficiency, but tools for systematic analysis of mammalian NMD inhibition by translational readthrough are lacking. Here, we introduce a system that allows concurrent analysis of translational readthrough and mRNA decay. We use this system to show that diverse readthrough-promoting RNA elements have similar capacities to inhibit NMD. Further, we provide evidence that the level of translational readthrough required for protection from NMD depends on the distance of the suppressed termination codon from the end of the mRNA.",,"['Baker, Stacey L', 'Hogg, J Robert']","['Baker SL', 'Hogg JR']","['Biochemistry and Biophysics Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Biochemistry and Biophysics Center, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5729-5135'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Codon, Nonsense/*genetics', 'Colorado tick fever virus/genetics', 'Epidermolysis Bullosa/genetics', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Inverted Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nonsense Mediated mRNA Decay/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA Stability/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism']",,,2017/03/23 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0173980 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-31691 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 21;12(3):e0173980. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173980. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Codon, Nonsense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",PMC5360307,,20170321,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the rate of methylation appears massively variable across the genome, it is mainly observed in histone modification, chromatin organization, DNA accessibility, or promoter sequence. Methylation of promoter sequence occurs mostly to cytosine nucleotides, which can affect transcription factors' binding affinities. In this study, we demonstrated that cytosine repeats (C types density), consisting of CC, CCC, CCCC, CCCCC, CCCCCC, CCCCCCC motifs and CpG islands density in 25 proto-oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and control genes may play a role in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia. The promoter sequences were divided into a 100 nucleotide window from -500 to +100 nucleotides and 20 nucleotide window from -100 to +100. Each window is analyzed to find the higher C type and CpG islands density, which may cause the increased methylation in the promoter sequence. Our novel findings show that promoter sequence cytosine repeats and CpG density increase closer to transcription sites, especially just before and after the transcription start site (TSS). The results demonstrate that cytosine density increases while proto-oncogenes and TSG promoter sequences are closer to TSS 50.8% and 41.0% respectively, if (-500 to -200) and (-100 to +100) windows of the nucleotide sequences are compared. This proves that around TSS location has special nucleotide motifs and could be an important implication for our understanding of potential methylating locations in promoters.",,"['Dogan, Senol', 'Cilic, Anis', 'Marjanovic, Damir', 'Kurtovic-Kozaric, Amina']","['Dogan S', 'Cilic A', 'Marjanovic D', 'Kurtovic-Kozaric A']","['a Department of Genetics and Bioengineering , International Burch University , Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'a Department of Genetics and Bioengineering , International Burch University , Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'a Department of Genetics and Bioengineering , International Burch University , Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina.', 'a Department of Genetics and Bioengineering , International Burch University , Sarajevo , Bosnia and Herzegovina.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', 'Cytosine/*metabolism', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CpG island', 'Cytosine density', 'methylation of cytosine locations', 'nucleic acid structures of promoter sequences']",2017/03/23 06:00,2017/11/14 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15257770.2017.1279738 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2017 Apr 3;36(4):302-316. doi: 10.1080/15257770.2017.1279738.

METHODS: We conducted a literature review to identify preventable environmental hazards associated with childhood cancer. We combined risk estimates with California-specific exposure prevalence estimates to calculate hazard-specific environmental attributable fractions (EAFs). We combined hazard-specific EAFs to estimate EAFs for each cancer and calculated an overall EAF. Estimated economic costs included annual (indirect and direct medical) and lifetime costs. RESULTS: Hazards associated with childhood cancer risks included tobacco smoke, residential exposures, and parental occupational exposures. Estimated EAFs for leukemia, lymphoma, and brain or central nervous system cancer were 21.3% (range = 11.7%-30.9%), 16.1% (range = 15.0%-17.2%), and 2.0% (range = 1.7%-2.2%), respectively. The combined EAF was 15.1% (range = 9.4%-20.7%), representing $18.6 million (range = $11.6 to $25.5 million) in annual costs and $31 million in lifetime costs.

(CCL), commonly called artichoke. Cultivated and/or spontaneous forms of CC studies have demonstrated that methanol extract of CCL flower and/or cynaropicrin showed remarkable anti-proliferative activity in vitro models of leukocyte cancer cell. AIM OF THE STUDY: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with a reciprocal translocation of the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 generating the BCR/ABL fusion gene, translated in the p210(BCR/ABL) oncoprotein kinase. This chimeric protein is the target of a kinase inhibitor, imatinib, but the development of mutations in the ABL kinase domain resulting in drug resistance and several approaches to overcoming resistance have been study. In this concern, we investigated the effect of CCL extract on human K562 CML and K562 imatinib resistant (IMAR) cell proliferation and on p210(BCR/ABL) expression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical characterization of the CCL extracts was performed by GC/MS analysis and semipreparative RP-HPLC chromatography. Structural characterization of compounds was assessed by (1)H-(13)C NMR and LC/MS analysis. The effects of CCL extracts on the proliferation of K562 CML human cell line and K562 IMAR were screened by MTT assay. The p210(BCR/ABL) mRNA and protein expressions were analyzed by qRT-PCR and Western blot techniques respectively. RESULTS: We demonstrate that CCL extract affect cell viability of both K562 CML human cell line and K562 IMAR. The biocomponents of CCL were chemical characterized and we identify cynaropicrin and its deacyl derivative having the capability to down-regulate the p210(BCR/ABL) oncoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the use of those molecules could represent a novel and promising strategy to potentiate the ability of imatinib or of its analogues to induce cancer growth arrest in CML and to delay or overcome the resistance of CML to chemotherapy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This translocation places RUNX1T1 under control of the RUNX1 promoter leading to a pronounced upregulation of RUNX1T1 transcripts in t(8;21) AML, compared to normal hematopoietic cells. We investigated the role of highly-upregulated RUNX1T1 under the hypothesis that it acts as competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) titrating microRNAs (miRNAs) away from their target transcripts and thus contributes to AML formation. Using publicly available t(8;21) AML RNA-Seq and miRNA-Seq data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we obtained a network consisting of 605 genes that may act as ceRNAs competing for miRNAs with the suggested RUNX1T1 miRNA sponge. Among the 605 ceRNA candidates, 121 have previously been implied in cancer development. Players in the integrin, cadherin, and Wnt signaling pathways affected by the RUNX1T1 sponge were overrepresented. Finally, among a set of 21 high interest RUNX1T1 ceRNAs we found multiple genes that have previously been linked to AML formation. In conclusion, our study offers a novel look at the role of the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 fusion transcript in t(8;21) AML beyond previously investigated genetic and epigenetic aberrations.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effects of radotinib in the subpopulation of c-KIT-positive AML cells were unclear. We observed that low-concentration radotinib had more potent cytotoxicity in c-KIT-positive cells than c-KIT-negative cells from AML patients. To address this issue, cell lines with high c-KIT expression, HEL92.1.7, and moderate c-KIT expression, H209, were selected. HEL92.1.7 cells were grouped into intermediate and high c-KIT expression populations. The cytotoxicity of radotinib against the HEL92.1.7 cell population with intermediate c-KIT expression was not different from that of the population with high c-KIT expression. When H209 cells were grouped into c-KIT expression-negative and c-KIT expression-positive populations, radotinib induced cytotoxicity in the c-KIT-positive population, but not the c-KIT-negative population. Thus, radotinib induces cytotoxicity in c-KIT-positive cells, regardless of the c-KIT expression intensity.

Therefore, it's urgent to find new drugs for treatment. Some experiments have shown that curcumin might have great potential in treating multiple myeloma, while the mechanism is still unknown. EZH2 and SUZ12 are the core proteins in PRC2 and their expressions are increased in various human cancers, including the poor prognostic multiple myeloma. Meanwhile, the regulation of miRNAs and EZH2 has been demonstrated in other cancer researches, like lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, leukemia and so on. OBJECTIVE: To reveal the mechanism behind the anti-tumor effect of cucurmin in multiple myeloma. METHOD: The effect of curcumin on the growth of MM cells was studied by MTT assay in the MM cell lines RPMI8226 and U266. Apoptosis was measured by Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining method. Western blotting, RT-PCR and luciferase activity assay were used to assess the expression of EZH2, SUZ12, miR-101 and downstream proteins such as E-cadherin, MMP9, c-Myc, cyclin D3, CDK4 and CDK6. RESULTS: Curcumin could significantly inhibite the proliferation of MM cells in a time- and concentrationdependent manner. Curcumin induced apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of EZH2, and the apoptosis rates were 16.42% and 25.62% when the RPMI8226 cells incubated with 5 and 10 micromol/L of curcumin. For U266 cells, the apoptosis rates were 15.25% and 21.28%. The up-regulation of miR-101 led to the lower expression of EZH2. In adverse, the expression of EZH2 induced lower expression of miR-101. The down-stream proteins of miR-101 were regulated by curcumin and EZH2 at the same time. CONCLUSION: Our experiments verified that the effect and mechanism of curcumin on multiple myeloma is via EZH2 - miR-101 regulatory feedback loop, which would lead us to a new way of investigating multiple myeloma and come up with new therapies in treating the disease.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Wu, Chuanqing', 'Ruan, Tuo', 'Liu, Weizhen', 'Zhu, Xiaojie', 'Pan, Juan', 'Lu, Wen', 'Yan, Chen', 'Tao, Kaixiong', 'Zhang, Weikang', 'Zhang, Chun']","['Wu C', 'Ruan T', 'Liu W', 'Zhu X', 'Pan J', 'Lu W', 'Yan C', 'Tao K', 'Zhang W', 'Zhang C']","['Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, 1277 Jiefang Avenue, Wuhan 430022, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United Arab Emirates,Curr Pharm Des,Current pharmaceutical design,9602487,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Curcumin', '*EZH2', '*PRC2', '*SUZ12', '*miR-101', '*multiple myeloma.']",2017/03/23 06:00,2019/09/20 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['CPD-EPUB-82377 [pii]', '10.2174/1381612823666170317164639 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Pharm Des. 2018;24(5):564-575. doi: 10.2174/1381612823666170317164639.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MIRN101 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared these methods and illustrated their use in a practical setting, including an assessment of the comparability of the current and the historical data. The motivating data set consists of randomised controlled trials for acute myeloid leukaemia. A simulation study was used to compare the methods in terms of bias, precision, power and type I error rate. Methods that estimate parameters for the between-trial heterogeneity generally offer the best trade-off of power, precision and type I error, with the meta-analytic-predictive prior being the most promising method.

Several single 5 to 8-color tubes using multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) are able to provide extended differentials with sequential gating-based analysis strategies. We investigated a new 5-color MFC method to perform an extended 8-part differential with a simplified gating strategy. METHODS: Whole blood was stained with a combination of antibodies including HLA-DR-FITC/CD19-PE/CD45-ECD/CD16-PC5 + CD71-PC5/CD5-PC7. RESULTS: An original approach was developed to exclude debris and straightforwardly gate the cells to identify sixteen populations. Strong correlations were obtained with the analyzer for neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophils (R(2) >0.9). Abnormal cells, such as immature granulocytes and blast cells were identified with a good sensitivity and excellent correlation against cytomorphologic review (R(2) =0.66 and 0.99, respectively). The choice of HLA-DR and CD5 improved specificity for the identification of activated T-lymphocytes and some lymphoid neoplastic cells, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Here a new cytometric differential is proposed with a robust gating strategy which may be used even by unskilled cytometrists and can be easily automated.

The last decade has seen a surge in successful immune-based therapies in various solid tumors; however, the role of immune therapies in AML remains poorly defined. This chapter describes the rationale, clinical data, and toxicity profiles of immune-based therapeutic modalities in AML including naked and conjugated monoclonal antibodies, bispecific T-cell engager antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells, and checkpoint blockade via blockade of PD1/PDL1 or CTLA4. Monoclonal antibodies commonly used in AML therapy target highly expressed ""leukemia"" surface antigens and include (1) naked antibodies against common myeloid markers such as anti-CD33 (e.g., lintuzumab), (2) antibody-drug conjugates linked to either, (a) a highly potent toxin such as calicheamicin, pyrrolobenzodiazepine, maytansine, or others in various anti-CD33 (gemtuzumab ozogamicin, SGN 33A), anti-123 (SL-401), and anti-CD56 (lorvotuzumab mertansine) formulations, or (b) radioactive particles, such as (131)I, (213)Bi, or (225)Ac-labeled anti-CD33 or CD45 antibodies. Novel monoclonal antibodies that recruit and promote proximity-induced cytotoxicity of tumor cells by T cells (bispecific T-cell engager [BiTE] such as anti CD33/CD3, e.g., AMG 330) or block immune checkpoint pathways such as CTLA4 (e.g., ipilimumab) or PD1/PD-L1 (e.g., nivolumab) unleashing the patients T cells to fight leukemic cells are being evaluated in clinical trials in patients with AML.

METHODS: Analysis of the episodes of fungemia due to common Candida species in adults, based on an active hospital-based surveillance program (Paris area, France, 2002 to 2014). RESULTS: Of the 3417 patients (3666 isolates), 1164 (34.1%) had a solid tumor (45.7% digestive tract) and 586 (17.1%) a hematological malignancy (41.8% lymphoma, 33.5% acute leukemia). The hematology patients were significantly younger, more often pre-exposed to antifungals, more often infected by C. tropicalis, C. krusei, or C. kefyr, and more often treated in the first instance with an echinocandin. Compared with inpatients who were not in ICU at the time of fungemia, those in ICU were less frequently infected by C. parapsilosis (p < 0.02), had more recent surgery (p < 0.03), and died more frequently before day 8 and day 30 (p < 0.0001). An increase in crude mortality over time in ICU was observed only in oncology patients (p < 0.04). For all patients, lack of prescription of antifungals despite knowledge of positive blood culture increased the risk of death. The odds of being infected by a given Candida species compared with C. albicans were uneven regarding age, gender, type of malignancy, hospitalization in ICU, central venous catheter, HIV status, intravenous drug addiction, and previous exposure to antifungal drugs. Compared with C. albicans, C. glabrata (OR = 0.69 [0.54-0.89]) and C. parapsilosis (OR = 0.49 [0.35-0.67]) were associated with a decreased risk of death by day 8 and day 30.

We observed overexpression of beta-catenin in BC-CML stem/progenitor cells, particularly in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, and highest among a novel CD34(+)CD38(+)CD123(hi)Tim-3(hi) subset as determined by CyTOF analysis. Co-culture with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) induced the expression of beta-catenin and its target CD44 in CML cells. A novel Wnt/beta-catenin signaling modulator, C82, and nilotinib synergistically killed KBM5(T315I) and TKI-resistant primary BC-CML cells with or without BCR-ABL kinase mutations even under leukemia/MSC co-culture conditions. Silencing of beta-catenin by short interfering RNA restored sensitivity of primary BCR-ABL(T315I/E255V) BC-CML cells to nilotinib. Combining the C82 pro-drug, PRI-724, with nilotinib significantly prolonged the survival of NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma null mice injected with primary BCR-ABL(T315I/E255V) BC-CML cells. The combined treatment selectively targeted CML progenitors and inhibited CD44, c-Myc, survivin, p-CRKL and p-STAT5 expression. In addition, pretreating primary BC-CML cells with C82, or the combination, but not with nilotinib alone, significantly impaired their engraftment potential in NOD/SCID/IL2Rgamma-null-3/GM/SF mice and significantly prolonged survival.

Exosome-mediated transfer of proteins or genes (RNA, miRNA, DNA) results in reprogramming of recipient cell functions. Exosomes carry and deliver information that is essential for health, and they participate in pathological events, including malignant transformation. Within the hematopoietic system, exosomes maintain crosstalk between cells located in the bone marrow compartment and at distant tissue sites. In hematological malignancies, tumor-derived exosomes (TEX) reprogram the bone marrow environment, suppress anti-leukemia immunity, mediate drug resistance and interfere with immunotherapies. TEX are also viewed as promising biomarkers of malignant progression and as potential therapeutic targets.

It is well-established that activating NOTCH1 mutations are the major genetic lesions driving T-ALL in most patients, but efforts to develop targeted therapies against this pathway have produced limited success in decreasing leukemic burden and come with significant clinical side effects. A finer detailed understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying T-ALL is required identify patients at increased risk for treatment failure and the development of precision medicine strategies. Generation of genetic models that more accurately reflect the normal developmental history of T-ALL are necessary to identify new avenues for treatment. The DNA methyltransferase enzyme DNMT3A is also recurrently mutated in T-ALL patients, and we show here that inactivation of Dnmt3a combined with Notch1 gain-of-function leads to an aggressive T-ALL in mouse models. Moreover, conditional inactivation of Dnmt3a in mouse hematopoietic cells leads to an accumulation of immature progenitors in the thymus, which are less apoptotic.

We carried out a decision analysis on 1728 MDS who received supportive care, transplantation or hypomethylating agents (HMAs). Risk assessment was based on the revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R). We used a continuous-time multistate Markov model to describe the natural history of disease and evaluate the effect of different treatment policies on survival. Life expectancy increased when transplantation was delayed from the initial stages to intermediate IPSS-R risk (gain-of-life expectancy 5.3, 4.7 and 2.8 years for patients aged 55, 60 and 65 years, respectively), and then decreased for higher risks. Modeling decision analysis on IPSS-R versus original IPSS changed transplantation policy in 29% of patients, resulting in a 2-year gain in life expectancy. In advanced stages, HMAs given before transplant is associated with a 2-year gain-of-life expectancy, especially in older patients. These results provide a preliminary evidence to maximize the effectiveness of allo-SCT in MDS.",,"['Della Porta, M G', 'Jackson, C H', 'Alessandrino, E P', 'Rossi, M', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'van Lint, M T', 'Bernardi, M', 'Allione, B', 'Bosi, A', 'Guidi, S', 'Santini, V', 'Malcovati, L', 'Ubezio, M', 'Milanesi, C', 'Todisco, E', 'Voso, M T', 'Musto, P', 'Onida, F', 'Iori, A P', 'Cerretti, R', 'Grillo, G', 'Molteni, A', 'Pioltelli, P', 'Borin, L', 'Angelucci, E', 'Oldani, E', 'Sica, S', 'Pascutto, C', 'Ferretti, V', 'Santoro, A', 'Bonifazi, F', 'Cazzola, M', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Della Porta MG', 'Jackson CH', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Rossi M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'van Lint MT', 'Bernardi M', 'Allione B', 'Bosi A', 'Guidi S', 'Santini V', 'Malcovati L', 'Ubezio M', 'Milanesi C', 'Todisco E', 'Voso MT', 'Musto P', 'Onida F', 'Iori AP', 'Cerretti R', 'Grillo G', 'Molteni A', 'Pioltelli P', 'Borin L', 'Angelucci E', 'Oldani E', 'Sica S', 'Pascutto C', 'Ferretti V', 'Santoro A', 'Bonifazi F', 'Cazzola M', 'Rambaldi A']","['Cancer Center, Humanitas Research Hospital & Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'MRC Biostatistics Unit, Institute of Public Health, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cancer Center, Humanitas Research Hospital & Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Gemelli, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, San Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology & Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Hematology & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Hematology & Bone Marrow Transplantation, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cancer Center, Humanitas Research Hospital & Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', 'Cancer Center, Humanitas Research Hospital & Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', ""Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome 'Tor Vergata', Rome, Italy."", 'Scientific Direction, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, Fondazione IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Rome Transplant Network, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology Oncology, Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda, Milan, Italy."", ""Department of Hematology Oncology, Ospedale Niguarda Ca' Granda, Milan, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology & Transplant Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology & Transplant Unit, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Ospedale Oncologico di Riferimento Regionale A Businco, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, San Martino Hospital, Genova, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Cancer Center, Humanitas Research Hospital & Humanitas University, Rozzano, Milan, Italy.', ""Institute of Hematology 'L. and A.

By performing a gene expression profile of NOTCH1-mutated (NOTCH1-mut) versus NOTCH1 wild-type CLL, we identified a gene signature of NOTCH1-mut CLL characterized by the upregulation of genes related to ribosome biogenesis, such as nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) and ribosomal proteins (RNPs). Activation of NOTCH1 signaling by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or by coculture with JAGGED1-expressing stromal cells increased NPM1 expression, and inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling by either NOTCH1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or gamma-secretase inhibitor reduced NPM1 expression. Bioinformatic analyses and in vitro activation/inhibition of NOTCH1 signaling suggested a role of MYC as a mediator of NOTCH1 effects over NPM1 and RNP expression in NOTCH1-mut CLL. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed on NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD)-transfected CLL-like cells showed the direct binding of NOTCH1 to the MYC promoter, and transfection with MYC-specific siRNA reduced NPM1 expression. In turn, NPM1 determined a proliferation advantage of CLL-like cells, as demonstrated by NPM1-specific siRNA transfection. In conclusion, NOTCH1 mutations in CLL are associated with the overexpression of MYC and MYC-related genes involved in protein biosynthesis including NPM1, which are allegedly responsible for cell growth and/or proliferation advantages of NOTCH1-mut CLL.",,"['Pozzo, F', 'Bittolo, T', 'Vendramini, E', 'Bomben, R', 'Bulian, P', 'Rossi, F M', 'Zucchetto, A', 'Tissino, E', 'Degan, M', ""D'Arena, G"", 'Di Raimondo, F', 'Zaja, F', 'Pozzato, G', 'Rossi, D', 'Gaidano, G', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Gattei, V', 'Dal Bo, M']","['Pozzo F', 'Bittolo T', 'Vendramini E', 'Bomben R', 'Bulian P', 'Rossi FM', 'Zucchetto A', 'Tissino E', 'Degan M', ""D'Arena G"", 'Di Raimondo F', 'Zaja F', 'Pozzato G', 'Rossi D', 'Gaidano G', 'Del Poeta G', 'Gattei V', 'Dal Bo M']","['Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', ""Department of Onco-Hematology, IRCCS 'Centro di Riferimento Oncologico della Basilicata', Rionero in Vulture, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Ferrarotto Hospital, Catania, Italy.', ""Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari 'Carlo Melzi' DISM, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria S Maria Misericordia, Udine, Italy."", 'Department of Internal Medicine and Hematology, Maggiore General Hospital, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy.', 'Hematology, Institute of Oncology Research and Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Department of Translational Medicine, Division of Hematology, University of Eastern Piedmont, Novara, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, S Eugenio Hospital and University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.', 'Clinical and Experimental Onco-Hematology Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano, Italy.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Coculture Techniques', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2017/03/23 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201790 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.90 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2407-2415. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.90.

ATL/ATLL cells express CC chemokine receptor 4, and mogamulizumab (anti-CCR4 monoclonal antibody) exhibits strong cytotoxicity for ATL/ATLL cells. We analyzed plasma samples of 6 patients with ATL/ATLL treated with chemotherapy followed by mogamulizumab therapy (mogatherapy) for changes in the levels of biomarkers in relation to immune-related adverse effects. As treatment is often associated with skin eruptions, we investigated the profiles of inflammatory cytokines, including galectin-9 (Gal-9), which becomes increased in various infectious diseases and allergic patients. Gal-9, soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IL-10 levels were increased before chemotherapy, and Gal-9 levels were associated with the sIL-2 receptor, which reflects tumor burden. Inflammatory levels decreased after chemotherapy. After mogatherapy, 5 of 6 patients attained complete remission (CR), whereas 1 patient showed no response (NR) and died. Among 5 patients with CR, the biomarkers remained low during mogatherapy, except for a 3-5-fold increment in Gal-9 (associated with skin eruptions). A skin biopsy showed infiltration by inflammatory cells and Gal-9 synthesis in areas with CD8 cell infiltration. In the patient with NR, increased levels of Gal-9 and the aforementioned biomarkers were noted 3 days after mogatherapy, followed by opportunistic infections resembling immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. Therefore, an increased Gal-9 plasma level in ATL/ATLL indicates tumor burden and reflects immune activation by mogatherapy. These findings may indicate that an increase in the Gal-9 level, a novel immune checkpoint molecule, can reflect immune-related adverse effects of various biotherapies.",,"['Mohammed, Tareg Omer', 'Chagan-Yasutan, Haorile', 'Ashino, Yugo', 'Nakayama, Wakana', 'Takahashi, Yayoi', 'Shimomura, Taizo', 'Fujimoto, Tetsuhiro', 'Watanabe, Yuko', 'Niki, Toshiro', 'Suzushima, Hitoshi', 'Hattori, Toshio']","['Mohammed TO', 'Chagan-Yasutan H', 'Ashino Y', 'Nakayama W', 'Takahashi Y', 'Shimomura T', 'Fujimoto T', 'Watanabe Y', 'Niki T', 'Suzushima H', 'Hattori T']","['Division of Emerging Infectious Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Tohoku University.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Galectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/chemically induced/immunology', 'Receptors, CCR4/*immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Skin/pathology', 'Solubility', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",,,2017/03/23 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1620/tjem.241.201 [doi]'],ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 2017 Mar;241(3):201-208. doi: 10.1620/tjem.241.201.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (IL10 protein, human)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'YI437801BE (mogamulizumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These late effects include chronic inflammation-related comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, but the underlying cause is poorly understood. RESULTS: We compared the anal microbiota composition of adult survivors of childhood ALL (N = 73) with healthy control subjects (N = 61). We identified an altered community with reduced microbial diversity in cancer survivors, who also exhibit signs of immune dysregulation including increased T cell activation and chronic inflammation. The bacterial community among cancer survivors was enriched for Actinobacteria (e.g. genus Corynebacterium) and depleted of Faecalibacterium, correlating with plasma concentrations of IL-6 and CRP and HLA-DR+CD4+ and HLA-DR+CD8+ T cells, which are established markers of inflammation and immune activation.

Immune cells are thought to be crucial to bone homeostasis, and abnormal immune cells lead to serious disruption of bone homeostasis, such as in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This disruption primarily occurs due to inhibition of the osteogenic differentiation of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). METHODS: In this study, we detected local and systemic bone loss in trabecular bone by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and measurement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) expression in BMSCs using real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Additionally, changes in lymphocytes (B cells and CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow were analysed by flow cytometry. BMSC-derived osteoblasts and adipocytes, cultured in osteogenic or adipogenic media or co-cultured with lymphocytes, were detected by BCIP/NBT, Alizarin Red S and Oil Red O staining. RESULTS: Focal irradiation induced local and systemic bone loss in trabecular bone. Increased PPARgamma expression and decreased RUNX2 expression were observed, accompanied by upregulated adipogenesis and downregulated osteogenesis of BMSCs. B cells and CD8(+) T lymphocytes were increased in the blood and bone marrow after irradiation, while CD4(+) T lymphocytes were decreased in the blood. Inhibition of RUNX2 expression and reduction of alkaline phosphatase activity and mineralization deposits were observed in lymphocyte-co-cultured BMSCs, accompanied by an increase in PPARgamma expression and in the number of lipid droplets. CONCLUSIONS: Focal irradiation induced local and systemic bone loss in trabecular bone. Increased B cells and CD8(+) T lymphocytes led to systemic bone loss by decreasing BMSC osteogenesis.",,"['Xu, Xiaoya', 'Li, Ruixia', 'Zhou, Yi', 'Zou, Qiong', 'Ding, Qiaoling', 'Wang, Jinfeng', 'Jin, Weifang', 'Hua, Guoqiang', 'Gao, Jianjun']","['Xu X', 'Li R', 'Zhou Y', 'Zou Q', 'Ding Q', 'Wang J', 'Jin W', 'Hua G', 'Gao J']","['Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University, No. 419 Fangxie Road, Shanghai, 200011, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China.', 'Department of Radiation Biology, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China. mulei80@sina.com.', 'Department of Bone Metabolism, Institute of Radiation Medicine, Fudan University, No. 2094 Xie-Tu Road, Shanghai, 200032, China. mulei80@sina.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,IM,"['Adipocytes/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Adipogenesis/*radiation effects', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gamma Rays', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/*radiation effects', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Osteogenesis/*radiation effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs)', '*Irradiation', '*Lymphocytes', '*PPARgamma', '*RUNX2']",2017/03/23 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-017-0527-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-017-0527-0 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2017 Mar 20;8(1):71. doi: 10.1186/s13287-017-0527-0.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",PMC5360074,,20170320,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that a large fraction of these markers were likely related to early disease manifestations. Here we aim to gain a better understanding of the natural history of the identified markers by comparing results from our prediagnostic analysis, the only prediagnostic analysis to date, to results obtained from a meta-analysis of a series of publically available transcriptomics profiles obtained in incident CLL cases and controls. RESULTS: We observed considerable overlap between the results from our prediagnostic study and the clinical CLL signals (p-value for overlap Bonferroni significant markers 0.01; p-value for overlap nominal significant markers < 2.20e-16). We observed similar patterns with time to diagnosis and similar functional annotations for the markers that were identified in both settings compared to the markers that were only identified in the prediagnostic study. These results suggest that both gene sets operate in similar pathways. CONCLUSION: An overlap exists between expression levels of genes predictive of CLL identified in prediagnostic blood and expression levels of genes associated to CLL at the clinical stage. Our analysis provides insight in a set of genes for which expression levels can be used to follow the time-course of the disease; providing an opportunity to study CLL progression in more detail in future studies.",,"['Vlaanderen, Jelle', 'Leenders, Max', 'Chadeau-Hyam, Marc', 'Portengen, Lutzen', 'Kyrtopoulos, Soterios A', 'Bergdahl, Ingvar A', 'Johansson, Ann-Sofie', 'Hebels, Dennie D G A J', 'de Kok, Theo M C M', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Vermeulen, Roel C H']","['Vlaanderen J', 'Leenders M', 'Chadeau-Hyam M', 'Portengen L', 'Kyrtopoulos SA', 'Bergdahl IA', 'Johansson AS', 'Hebels DD', 'de Kok TM', 'Vineis P', 'Vermeulen RC']","['Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Institute of Biology, Medicinal Chemistry and Biotechnology, National Hellenic Research Foundation, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Biobank Research, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Umea, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Toxicogenomics, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Toxicogenomics, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Molecular and Genetic Epidemiology, Human Genetics Foundation (HuGeF), Turin, Italy.', 'Institute for Risk Assessment Sciences (IRAS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands. r.c.h.vermeulen@uu.nl.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Imperial College London, London, UK. r.c.h.vermeulen@uu.nl.', 'Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. r.c.h.vermeulen@uu.nl.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9096-692X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', '*Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell lymphoma', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Prediagnostic study', '*Public data', '*Transcriptomics']",2017/03/23 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/03/22 06:00'],"['2016/10/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-017-3627-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-017-3627-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2017 Mar 20;18(1):239. doi: 10.1186/s12864-017-3627-4.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",PMC5360061,,20170320,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed at determining the effect of an apoptotic endonuclease G (EndoG) on alternative splicing of hTERT and telomerase activity in CD4+ human T lymphocytes. Overexpression of EndoG in CD4+ T cells downregulated the expression of the active full-length hTERT variant and upregulated the inactive alternatively spliced variant. Reduction of full-length hTERT levels caused downregulation of the telomerase activity, critical telomere shortening during cell division that converted cells into the replicative senescence state, activation of apoptosis, and finally cell death.

The studies were conducted in 1990, 2002 and 2014 using the same research design. In each of the three rounds, a sample of Norwegian physicians was asked to rate a set of 38 diseases on a scale from 1 to 9 according to the prestige they believed health personnel in general would award them. The results show a remarkable stability in the prestige rank order over 25 years. The top three diseases in all three surveys were leukaemia, brain tumour and myocardial infarction. The four lowest ranked were fibromyalgia, depressive neurosis, anxiety neurosis and hepatocirrhosis. The most notable change concerns apoplexy (brain stroke), which moved from a rank of 33 to 29 and then to 23 over the three rounds. We argue that the stable pattern, as well as this change, substantiate the interpretation of previous research, i.e. that the prestige of a disease is affected by the localization of the affected organ or body part, the effect and style of its typical treatment, and the social attributes of the typical patient. Analysing physicians' shared evaluations of different diseases, the paper contributes to the cultural understanding of disease conceptions in medicine.

METHODS: We assessed parental occupational pesticide exposure from the year before pregnancy to the child's third year of life for 669 children diagnosed with ALL and 1021 controls. We conducted expert rating using task-based job modules (JM) to estimate exposure to pesticides among farmer workers, gardeners, agricultural packers, and pesticide applicators. We compared this method to (1) partial JM using job titles and a brief description, but without completing the task-based questionnaire, and (2) job exposure matrix (JEM) linking job titles to the International Standard Classifications of Occupation Codes. We used unconditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for ALL cancer risk and pesticide exposure adjusting for child's sex, age, race/ethnicity and household income. RESULTS: Compared to complete JMs, partial JMs and JEM led to 3.1% and 9.4% of parents with pesticide exposure misclassified, respectively. Misclassification was similar in cases and controls. Using complete JMs, we observed an increased risk of ALL for paternal occupational exposure to any pesticides (OR=1.7; 95% CI=1.2, 2.5), with higher risks reported for pesticides to treat nut crops (OR=4.5; 95% CI=0.9, 23.0), and for children diagnosed before five years of age (OR=2.3; 95% CI: 1.3, 4.1). Exposure misclassification from JEM attenuated these associations by about 57%. Maternal occupational pesticide exposure before and after birth was not associated with ALL. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of ALL was elevated in young children with paternal occupational pesticide exposure during the perinatal period, using more detailed occupational information for exposure classification.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The survival of MRD stem or progenitor cells in the absence of oncogenic kinase signaling, a phenomenon referred to as intrinsic resistance, depends on diverse growth factors. Here we report that oncogenic kinase and growth-factor signaling converge to induce the expression of the signaling proteins FBJ osteosarcoma oncogene (c-FOS, encoded by Fos) and dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1). Genetic deletion of Fos and Dusp1 suppressed tumor growth in a BCR-ABL fusion protein kinase-induced mouse model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacological inhibition of c-FOS, DUSP1 and BCR-ABL eradicated MRD in multiple in vivo models, as well as in mice xenotransplanted with patient-derived primary CML cells. Growth-factor signaling also conferred TKI resistance and induced FOS and DUSP1 expression in tumor cells modeling other types of kinase-driven leukemias. Our data demonstrate that c-FOS and DUSP1 expression levels determine the threshold of TKI efficacy, such that growth-factor-induced expression of c-FOS and DUSP1 confers intrinsic resistance to TKI therapy in a wide-ranging set of leukemias, and might represent a unifying Achilles' heel of kinase-driven cancers.",,"['Kesarwani, Meenu', 'Kincaid, Zachary', 'Gomaa, Ahmed', 'Huber, Erika', 'Rohrabaugh, Sara', 'Siddiqui, Zain', 'Bouso, Muhammad F', 'Latif, Tahir', 'Xu, Ming', 'Komurov, Kakajan', 'Mulloy, James C', 'Cancelas, Jose A', 'Grimes, H Leighton', 'Azam, Mohammad']","['Kesarwani M', 'Kincaid Z', 'Gomaa A', 'Huber E', 'Rohrabaugh S', 'Siddiqui Z', 'Bouso MF', 'Latif T', 'Xu M', 'Komurov K', 'Mulloy JC', 'Cancelas JA', 'Grimes HL', 'Azam M']","[""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", 'Department of Medicine, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.', 'Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Immunobiology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Hematology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA."", ""Division of Pathology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8162-6758'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nat Med,Nature medicine,9502015,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",,,2017/03/21 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2017/03/21 06:00'],"['2016/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['nm.4310 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.4310 [doi]']",ppublish,Nat Med. 2017 Apr;23(4):472-482. doi: 10.1038/nm.4310.

Here we introduce a CRISPR-based double knockout (CDKO) system that improves the efficiency of combinatorial genetic screening using an effective strategy for cloning and sequencing paired single guide RNA (sgRNA) libraries and a robust statistical scoring method for calculating genetic interactions (GIs) from CRISPR-deleted gene pairs. We applied CDKO to generate a large-scale human GI map, comprising 490,000 double-sgRNAs directed against 21,321 pairs of drug targets in K562 leukemia cells and identified synthetic lethal drug target pairs for which corresponding drugs exhibit synergistic killing. These included the BCL2L1 and MCL1 combination, which was also effective in imatinib-resistant cells. We further validated this system by identifying known and previously unidentified GIs between modifiers of ricin toxicity.

Ex-vivo AML exhibits a high level of spontaneous apoptosis. Furthermore, relapse for patients achieving remission occurs from minimal residual disease harboured within the BM microenvironment. Taken together, these observations illustrate the importance of the BM microenvironment in sustaining AML. While significant progress has been made elaborating the small-scale genetic mutations and larger-scale chromosomal translocations that contribute to the development of AML and its prognosis in response to treatment, less is understood about the complex microenvironment of the BM, which is known to be a key player in the pathogenesis of the disease. As we look towards future therapies, the consideration that the BM microenvironment is uniquely important as a niche for AML - coupled with the idea that leukaemic blasts are more likely to be genetically unstable and therefore evolve resistance to conventional chemotherapies - make the functions of the non-malignant cells of the BM attractive targets for therapy. In this review, we discuss the microanatomy of the BM and provide an overview of the evidence supporting the role of the BM microenvironment in creating conditions conducive to the survival and proliferation of AML blasts. Ultimately, we examine the therapeutic potential of uncoupling AML from the BM microenvironment.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This is lethal in the germline but we show here that adult T cells and hepatocytes can survive conditional inactivation of the Mad2l1 SAC gene and resulting CIN.

This leaves a large subpopulation of CN-AML patients without NPM1 or FLT3-ITD mutations with heterogeneous outcomes with overall survivals (OS) ranging from several weeks to years. Therefore, new prognostic markers are needed to better risk stratify this subset of patients. METHODS: The retrospective study included 60 de novo adult AML patients diagnosed at our institution with normal karyotype, no FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutations, and who did not receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantations. We investigated the prognostic significance of immunophenotypic markers and clinical laboratory features in this double-negative population. RESULTS: Older age (>60) and CD4 expression (14%) were significantly correlated with shorter event-free survival (EFS) (P < 0.001, P = 0.016, respectively). Expression of CD56 (12%), as well as lack of CD34 expression (19% of the cases), was also associated with a worse EFS (P = 0.048, P = 0.028, respectively). On multivariable analysis, CD4 expression and old age (>60) were identified as independent predictors for worse EFS (P = 0.016; P = 0.001, respectively) and OS (P = 0.048; P = 0.028, respectively).

FLT3-ITD mutations are detected in t(6;9) patients. The t(6;9) abnormality is associated with poor outcomes. We studied the clinicopathologic and molecular profiles of patients with AML/MDS carrying t(6;9). METHODS: We collected clinical data of nine patients with AML/MDS with isolated t(6;9) (median age = 41 years; male/female = 4/5) and genotyped DNAs using whole exome, Sanger, and targeted sequencing. RESULTS: Our cohort was characterized by frequent multilineage dysplasia (56%), absence of phospho-STAT3/STAT5 expression, presence of myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, CD34, CD117, HLA-DR) with an aberrant expression of CD7, and poor outcome (median survival of 20 months). Although basophilia has been described in association with t(6;9), we observed lack of marrow basophilia in our cohort. Molecularly, 83% (5/6) of patients with AML/MDS with t(6;9) were characterized by at least one somatic mutation. Among them, four patients showed multiple mutations. FLT3-ITD mutations were detected in 33% of patients (2/6); 80% (4/5) of mutant patients died even after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple studies have examined the toxicities of the primary chemotherapeutic agents used to treat childhood ALL in relation to host genetic factors. However, few results have been replicated independently, largely due to cohort differences in ancestry, chemotherapy treatment protocols, and definitions of toxicities. To date, there is only one widely accepted clinical guideline for dose modification based on gene status: thiopurine dosing based on TPMT genotype. Based on recent data, it is likely that this guideline will be modified to incorporate other gene variants, such as NUDT15. We highlight genetic variants that have been consistently associated with TRT across treatment groups, as well as those that best illustrate the underlying pathophysiology of TRT. In the coming decade, we expect that survivorship care will routinely specify screening recommendations based on genetics. Furthermore, clinical trials testing protective interventions may modify inclusion criteria based on genetically determined risk of specific TRTs.",,"['Maxwell, Rochelle R', 'Cole, Peter D']","['Maxwell RR', 'Cole PD']","[""The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, 3415 Bainbridge Avenue, Bronx, NY, 10467, USA."", ""The Children's Hospital at Montefiore, 3415 Bainbridge Avenue, Bronx, NY, 10467, USA. peter.cole@einstein.yu.edu."", 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, 1225 Morris Park Avenue, Van Etten Building, Room VE 6A03, Bronx, NY, 10461, USA. peter.cole@einstein.yu.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/diagnosis/etiology', 'Humans', '*Pharmacogenetics', '*Pharmacogenomic Variants', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Chemotherapy toxicity', '*Genetic polymorphisms', '*Pediatric cancer', '*Pharmacogenetics']",2017/03/21 06:00,2017/10/20 06:00,['2017/03/21 06:00'],"['2017/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/20 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-017-0376-z [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-017-0376-z [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2017 Jun;12(3):176-186. doi: 10.1007/s11899-017-0376-z.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a new microfluidic cell enrichment technology that continuously fractionates cells through differences in biomechanical properties, resulting in highly pure cellular subpopulations. Cell fractionation is achieved in a microfluidic channel with an array of diagonal ridges that are designed to segregate biomechanically distinct cells to different locations in the channel. Due to the imposition of elastic and viscous forces during cellular compression, which are a function of cell biomechanical properties including size and viscoelasticity, larger, stiffer and less viscos cells migrate parallel to the diagonal ridges and exhibit positive lateral displacement. On the other hand, smaller, softer and more viscous cells migrate perpendicular to the diagonal ridges due to circulatory flow induced by the ridges and result in negative lateral displacement. Multiple outlets are then utilized to collect cells with finer gradation of differences in cell biomechanical properties. The result is that cell fractionation dramatically improves cell separation efficiency compared to binary outputs and enables the measurement of subtle biomechanical differences within a single cell type. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we mix two different leukemia cell lines (K562 and HL60) and utilize cell fractionation to achieve over 45-fold enhancement of cell populations, with high purity cellular enrichment (90% to 99%) of each cell line. In addition, we demonstrate cell fractionation of a single cell type (K562 cells) into subpopulations and characterize the variations of biomechanical properties of the separated cells with atomic force microscopy. These results will be beneficial to obtaining label-free separation of cellular mixtures, or to better investigate the origins of biomechanical differences in a single cell type.",,"['Wang, Gonghao', 'Turbyfield, Cory', 'Crawford, Kaci', 'Alexeev, Alexander', 'Sulchek, Todd']","['Wang G', 'Turbyfield C', 'Crawford K', 'Alexeev A', 'Sulchek T']","['George W.

METHODS: MLPA assay and propidium iodide FPA were used to test samples from 53 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute leukemia referred to our laboratory for immunophenotyping. Results were compared by nonparametric statistics. RESULTS: The combined use of both methods significantly increased the rate of detection of aneuploidy as compared to that obtained by each method alone. The limitations of one method are somehow countervailed by the other and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: MPLA and FPA yield different yet complementary information concerning aneuploidy in acute leukemia. The simultaneous use of both methods might be recommended in the clinical setting.

With the introduction of imatinib, the first TKI developed and approved to effectively treat CML, patient survival has increased dramatically and, in some cases, this fatal cancer can be managed as a chronic disease. Since the approval of imatinib in 2002, four additional TKIs have been developed to treat this disease including the second-generation TKIs nilotinib, dasatinib, and bosutinib and the third-generation TKI ponatinib. Despite their significant impact on the progression of CML, there is increasing recognition of cardiovascular toxicities which can limit their long-term use and impact patient morbidity and mortality. The majority of the cardiotoxicities are associated with the second- and third-generation TKIs, the most concerning of which are vascular events including myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral arterial disease. In addition, QT prolongation, pleural effusions, and both systemic and pulmonary hypertension are also observed. It is essential for both cardiologists and oncologists to possess knowledge of these issues in order to develop appropriate monitoring and risk mitigation strategies to prevent these toxicities and avoid premature cessation of the drug.",,"['Damrongwatanasuk, Rongras', 'Fradley, Michael G']","['Damrongwatanasuk R', 'Fradley MG']","['Cardio-Oncology Program, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of South Florida and H.

Although imatinib mesylate is highly tolerable, it has been implicated in severe congestive heart failure in mouse models and patients. A hallmark of imatinib mesylate-induced cardiotoxicity is mitochondrial dysfunction. The mitochondrial scaffold Sab has been implicated in facilitating signaling responsible for mitochondrial dysfunction in a c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)-dependent manner. We examined the impact of Sab-mediated signaling on imatinib mesylate cardiotoxicity in H9c2 rat cardiomyocyte-like cells. Silencing Sab increased the LD50 of imatinib mesylate 4-fold in H9c2 cells. Disrupting Sab-mediated signaling prevented imatinib mesylate-induced apoptosis as well. Knockdown of Sab or inhibition with a small peptide prevented oxidative stress, which was indicated by decreased reactive oxygen species production, lipid peroxidation, and protein carbonylation. Further, inhibition of Sab-related signaling partially rescued deficits in mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, and membrane potential in imatinib mesylate-treated H9c2 cells. Conversely, over-expression of Sab in H9c2 cells increased the cardiotoxicity of imatinib mesylate in vitro decreasing the LD50 over 4-fold. Sab expression was induced in H9c2 cells following cardiovascular-like stress in an AP-1 dependent manner. These data demonstrate that imatinib mesylate influences mitochondrial signaling leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiotoxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

APOBEC3C (A3C) is a strong antiviral factor against viral infectivity factor (vif)-deficient simian immunodeficiency virus Deltavif, which is, however, a weak inhibitor against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 for reasons unknown. The precise link between the antiretroviral effect of A3C and its catalytic activity is incompletely understood. Here, we show that the S61P mutation in human A3C (A3C.S61P) boosted hypermutation in the viral genomes of simian immunodeficiency virus Deltavif and murine leukemia virus but not in human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1Deltavif. The enhanced antiviral activity of A3C.S61P correlated with enhanced in vitro cytidine deamination. Furthermore, the S61P mutation did not change the substrate specificity of A3C, ribonucleoprotein complex formation, self-association, Zinc coordination, or viral incorporation features. We propose that local structural changes induced by the serine-to-proline substitution are responsible for the gain of catalytic activity of A3C.S61P. Our results are a first step toward an understanding of A3C's DNA binding capacity, deamination-dependent editing, and antiviral functions at the molecular level. We conclude that the enhanced enzymatic activity of A3C is insufficient to restrict HIV-1, indicating an unknown escape mechanism of HIV-1.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Alternative splicing affects genes involved in all crucial cellular processes, including apoptosis. During cancerogenesis impaired apoptotic control facilitates survival of cells bearing molecular aberrations, contributing to their unrestricted proliferation and chemoresistance. Apparently, SR and hnRNP proteins regulate all levels of expression of apoptotic genes, including transcription initiation and elongation, alternative splicing, mRNA stability, translation, and protein degradation. The frequently disturbed expressions of SR/hnRNP proteins in cancers lead to impaired functioning of target apoptotic genes, including regulators of the extrinsic (Fas, caspase-8, caspase-2, c-FLIP) and the intrinsic pathway (Apaf-1, caspase-9, ICAD), genes encoding Bcl-2 proteins, IAPs, and p53 tumor suppressor. Prototypical members of SR/hnRNP families, SRSF1 and hnRNP A1, promote synthesis of anti-apoptotic splice variants of Bcl-x and Mcl-1, which results in attenuation of programmed cell death in breast cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia. SR/hnRNP proteins significantly affect responses to chemotherapy, acting as mediators or modulators of drug-induced apoptosis. Aberrant expression of SRSF1 and hnRNP K can interfere with tumor responses to chemotherapy in pancreatic and liver cancers. Currently, a number of splicing factor inhibitors is being tested in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this review we discuss recent findings on the role of SR and hnRNP proteins in apoptotic control in cancer cells as well as their significance in anticancer treatments.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

BCR-ABL inhibitors revolutionized CML chemotherapy while blast crisis (BC) CML patients are less responsive. Since suppression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase1 (S6K1) phosphorylation reverses the resistance to BCR-ABL inhibitor in CML cells and S6K1 inhibitors augment cisplatin toxicity in lung cancer cells, we speculated that combination of S6K1 inhibitor and cisplatin may be beneficial for eliminating BC CML cells. To our surprise, S6K1 inhibition decreased cisplatin-induced DNA damage and cell death only in p53(-/-) BC CML cells but not in p53(+/+) BC CML cells. During the progression of CML, p53 expression either decreases or mutates. Moreover, the expression of p53 affects drug response of CML cells. Our results confirmed that S6K1 inhibition reversed cisplatin toxicity is dependent on p53 expression in CML cells. Moreover, p53 attenuated the phosphorylation and localization of S6K1 via attenuating 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) phosphorylation. Furthermore, S6K1 acts via DNA-PKcs to regulate H2AX phosphorylation and PARP cleavage, respectively.

METHODS: Children that were diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL and classified as belonging to the medium-risk group for relapse were selected for this study. Individuals who were in continuous remission and on maintenance therapy were included in the study group. Cases that had central nervous system involvement were excluded. Age-matched, otherwise healthy children were selected for the control group. Each study participant underwent a comprehensive eye examination and SD-OCT evaluation. Thickness measurements were made within the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), central macula, posterior polar, and peripapillary choroid. RESULTS: A total of 112 eyes of 56 children were included: 54 eyes in the study group and 58 in the control group. Compared to the control group, subfoveal and temporal choroidal thicknesses of the posterior pole were significantly thinner in the study group (P < 0.005). Similarly, peripapillary choroidal thicknesses were significantly thinner in most sectors of the study group (P < 0.005). There were no major differences between groups in terms of central macular thicknesses and overall RNFL thicknesses. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of choroidal attenuation was found in this subgroup of pediatric ALL patients. Further studies are warranted to clarify the utility of SD-OCT in detecting subclinical ocular involvement and monitoring treatment response and risk of relapse in patients with pediatric leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and', 'Strabismus.

Detection of leukemia mutations using multigene next-generation sequencing (NGS) can potentially be used to measure residual disease. We used a targeted 28-gene NGS panel to detect mutations and different-from-normal 10-color MFC to measure MRD in AML patients before allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Residual disease was defined when any abnormal blast population was detected using MFC and when any leukemia allele was detected with a variant allele frequency (VAF) >/= 5% using NGS. We tracked the clearance of leukemia alleles between AML diagnosis and immediately before HCT and found that mutations in DNMT3A, TET2, and JAK2 were less likely to be cleared than NPM1, IDH 1/2, and FLT3-ITD. Despite varying sensitivities, the concordance rate of residual disease detection before HCT using the 2 assays was 44 of 62 (71%) evaluable cases. Discordance could be explained by residual mutations in DNMT3A and TET2 that were not detected by MFC and presence of residual leukemia mutations with VAF below the established thresholds for mutation calling. Presence of flow MRD and residual mutations immediately before HCT using the 2 assays was associated with relapse risk (MFC: hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32 to 16.09; P = .016 and NGS: hazard ratio, 4.35; 95% CI, 1.63 to 11.6; P = .003) and survival (MFC: hazard ratio, 2.44; 95% CI, 1 to 5.97; P = .05 and NGS: hazard ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, .97 to 4.55; P = .059) after HCT. Residual disease detected concurrently by MFC and NGS conferred the highest relapse risk compared with patients who were either negative by both assays or had discordant status (overall, P = .008). Although MFC is universally applicable, a multigene NGS approach to measuring residual disease in AML provides additional information on differential clearance of disease alleles and can assess clonal architecture before transplantation.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

The advent of IDH inhibitors has engendered hope in novel and targeted therapies in IDH1/2 mutant myeloid malignancies. We here summarize the basic physiology of IDH, the metabolic and oncogenic consequences of mutant IDH1/2, and the clinical significance of IDH inhibition in hematologic malignancies.

However, the specific role of NOTCH1 in leukemogenesis remains to be established. Here, we report that the active intracellular portion of NOTCH1 (ICN1) is detectable in approximately 50% of peripheral blood CLL cases lacking gene mutations. We identify a ""NOTCH1 gene-expression signature"" in CLL cells, and show that this signature is significantly enriched in primary CLL cases expressing ICN1, independent of NOTCH1 mutation. NOTCH1 target genes include key regulators of B-cell proliferation, survival, and signal transduction. In particular, we show that NOTCH1 transactivates MYC via binding to B-cell-specific regulatory elements, thus implicating this oncogene in CLL development.

Thus, the identification of alternative neoantigens is a pressing need. Here, we identify 36 MHC class I-associated peptide antigens with O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modifications as candidate neoantigens, using three experimental approaches. Thirteen of these peptides were also detected with disaccharide units on the same residues and two contain either mono- and/or di-methylated arginine residues. A subset were linked with key cancer pathways, and these peptides were shared across all of the leukemia patient samples tested (5/5). Seven of the O-GlcNAc peptides were synthesized and five (71%) were shown to be associated with multifunctional memory T-cell responses in healthy donors. An O-GlcNAc-specific T-cell line specifically killed autologous cells pulsed with the modified peptide, but not the equivalent unmodified peptide.

Additionally, we assessed GA as a candidate for combinational therapy in CML along with the current frontline treatment, imatinib (IM). Treatment of K562 CML cells with GA alone resulted in significant induction of apoptosis and loss of cell viability. GA was well tolerated by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) up to 2 mM doses which were subsequently used in combination with IM. Co-treatment of CML with GA and IM greatly enhanced the levels of apoptosis in human CML. The effectiveness of GA was not limited to in vitro studies as treatment of EL-4 lymphoma-bearing mice with GA (50 or 500 mg/kg/day) led to significant dose-related decrease in tumor burden that correlated with a significant increase in the level of apoptotic tumors in vivo. The broad activity of GA against different tumor cell types, its tolerance by PBMCs and synergistic effects when combined with IM suggests that GA may be a viable candidate for combinational treatment strategies in CML and other hematological malignancies.","['Copyright(c) 2017, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Hostetler, Bryan J', 'Uchakina, Olga N', 'Ban, Hao', 'McKallip, Robert J']","['Hostetler BJ', 'Uchakina ON', 'Ban H', 'McKallip RJ']","['Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA, U.S.A.', 'Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA, U.S.A.', 'Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA, U.S.A.', 'Division of Basic Medical Sciences, Mercer University School of Medicine, Macon, GA, U.S.A. mckallip_r@mercer.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Glycyrrhizic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Glycyrrhizic acid', '*apoptosis', '*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*hyaluronic acid']",2017/03/21 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2017/03/19 06:00'],"['2017/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['37/3/997 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.11409 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2017 Mar;37(3):997-1004. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.11409.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '6FO62043WK (Glycyrrhizic Acid)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we review recently discovered roles of SHP2 in normal and aberrant hematopoiesis along with novel strategies to target it. RECENT FINDINGS: Cell autonomous role of SHP2 in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis has long been recognized. The review will discuss the newly discovered role of SHP2 in lineage specific differentiation. Recently, a noncell autonomous role of oncogenic SHP2 has been reported in which activated SHP2 was shown to alter the bone marrow microenvironment resulting in transformation of donor derived normal hematopoietic cells and development of myeloid malignancy. From being considered as an 'undruggable' target, recent development of allosteric inhibitor has made it possible to specifically target SHP2 in receptor tyrosine kinase driven malignancies. SUMMARY: SHP2 has emerged as an attractive target for therapeutic targeting in hematological malignancies for its cell autonomous and microenvironmental effects. However a better understanding of the role of SHP2 in different hematopoietic lineages and its crosstalk with signaling pathways activated by other genetic lesions is required before the promise is realized in the clinic.",,"['Pandey, Ruchi', 'Saxena, Mallika', 'Kapur, Reuben']","['Pandey R', 'Saxena M', 'Kapur R']","['aDepartment of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research bDepartment of Microbiology and Immunology cDepartment of Medical and Molecular Genetics dDepartment of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,2017/03/18 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000345 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2017 Jul;24(4):307-313. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000345.,"['R01 HL081111/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA173852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007519/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077177/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",PMC5709049,['NIHMS892638'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Frequency of CD8(+) /Tim-3(+) /PD-1(+) exhausted cells was determined by flow cytometry. For functional analysis, magnetic beads-isolated CD8(+) T cells were stimulated with PHA and PMA/ionocymin to assess their proliferative responses and cytokine production by MTT and ELISA, respectively. Cytotoxic activity of isolated CD8(+) T cells was determined using CD107a degranulation assay. RESULTS: The proportion of exhausted CD8(+) T cells was significantly higher in CLL compared to controls. Isolated CD8(+) T cells from CLL showed functional defects in proliferation, degranulation, and cytokines production. While IL-2, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma were significantly lower in CLL patients, IL-10 was higher in the patients group. Patients with progressive clinical stages showed higher frequency and dysfunction of exhausted CD8(+) T cells. CONCLUSION: Targeting immune inhibitory receptors to restore the function of tumor surrounding T cells could be helpful for immunotherapy of CLL.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This review discusses the state-of-the-art knowledge of the enigmatic role played by RUNX1 in female-related cancers of the breast, the uterus and the ovary. The weight of evidence accumulated so far is indicative of a very context-dependent role, as either an oncogene or a tumour suppressor. This is corroborated by high-throughput sequencing endeavours which report different genetic alterations affecting the gene, including amplification, deep deletion and mutations. Herein, we attempt to dissect that contextual role by firstly giving an overview of what is currently known about RUNX1 function in these specific tumour types, and secondly by delving into connections between this transcription factor and the physiology of these female tissues. In doing so, RUNX1 emerges not only as a gene involved in female sex development but also as a crucial mediator of female hormone signalling. In view of RUNX1 now being listed as a driver gene, we believe that greater knowledge of the mechanisms underlying its functional dualism in epithelial cancers is worthy of further investigation.",['(c) 2017 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Riggio, Alessandra I', 'Blyth, Karen']","['Riggio AI', 'Blyth K']","['Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Bearsden, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Bearsden, Glasgow, UK.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Estrogens/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sexual Maturation', 'Signal Transduction', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*RUNX1', '*breast cancer', '*oestrogen/ER signalling', '*ovarian cancer', '*uterine cancer']",2017/03/18 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.14059 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2017 Aug;284(15):2345-2362. doi: 10.1111/febs.14059.

Due to its remarkable antileukemic activities, HT has been utilized clinically in China for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). No antibody that recognizes free HT has been reported to date due to the difficulty of preparing antigen conjugates in which haptens bind to a carrier protein. To overcome this difficulty, we focused on sodium periodate (NaIO4), which catalyzes unique oxidative reactions; the resulting conjugates enabled the production of a highly specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) against HT (MAb 1D2) and the establishment of an indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) for the determination of HT. Further analysis revealed that MAb 1D2 was produced by the HT3 (8-carbonyl HT)-based conjugate antigen; HT3 was synthesized by a NaIO4-mediated oxidative reaction. The minimum detectable concentration for HT in the icELISA system was found to be 0.76 ng mL(-1), which is approximately 13 to 160 times more sensitive than a conventional HPLC system.

Although there has been progress in 3D stem cell culturing, most existing in vitro methodologies do not allow for mimicking of the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of stimuli that drive morphogenetic processes in vivo. To address this, we present a perfusion-free microchip concept for the in vitro 3D perturbation of stem cell fate. Stem cells are encapsulated in a hydrogel compartment that is flanked by open reservoirs for the diffusion-driven generation of biomolecule gradients. Juxtaposing additional compartments bearing supportive cells enables investigating the influence of long range cell-cell communication. We explore the utility of the microchips in manipulating early fate choices and self-organizing characteristics of 3D-cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under neural differentiation conditions and exposure to gradients of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). mESCs respond to LIF gradients in a spatially dependent manner. At higher LIF concentrations, multicellular colonies maintain pluripotency in contrast, at lower concentrations, mESCs develop into apicobasally polarized epithelial cysts. This versatile system can help to systematically explore the role of multifactorial microenvironments in promoting self-patterning of various stem cell types.",,"['Tabata, Yoji', 'Lutolf, Matthias P']","['Tabata Y', 'Lutolf MP']","['Laboratory of Stem Cell Bioengineering, Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences and School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell Bioengineering, Institute of Bioengineering, School of Life Sciences and School of Engineering, Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Chemical Sciences and Engineering, School of Basic Science, EPFL, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cellular Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Diffusion', 'Extracellular Matrix/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microfluidics', 'Microtechnology', 'Mouse Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Solubility']",,,2017/03/18 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['srep44711 [pii]', '10.1038/srep44711 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Mar 17;7:44711. doi: 10.1038/srep44711.,,['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)'],PMC5356187,,20170317,,,,,,,,,,,

Like the first three members of this family, transcription of MS4A4A appears to be limited to hematopoietic cells. To evaluate expression of the MS4A4A protein in hematopoietic cell lineages and subsets we generated monoclonal antibodies against extracellular epitopes for use in flow cytometry. In human peripheral blood we found that MS4A4A is expressed at the plasma membrane in monocytes but not in granulocytes or lymphocytes. In vitro differentiation of monocytes demonstrated that MS4A4A is expressed in immature but not activated dendritic cells, and in macrophages generated in the presence of interleukin-4 ('alternatively activated' or M2 macrophages) but not by interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide ('classically' activated or M1 macrophages). MS4A4A was expressed in the U937 monocytic cell line only after differentiation. In normal bone marrow, MS4A4A was expressed in mature monocytes but was undetected, or detected at only a low level, in myeloid/monocytic precursors, as well as their malignant counterparts in patients with various subtypes of myeloid leukemia. Although MS4A4A was not expressed in healthy B lymphocytes, it was highly expressed in normal plasma cells, CD138+ cells from multiple myeloma patients, and bone marrow B cells from a patient with mantle cell lymphoma. These findings suggest immunotherapeutic potential for MS4A4A antibodies in targeting alternatively activated macrophages such as tumor-associated macrophages, and in the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.",,"['Sanyal, Ratna', 'Polyak, Maria J', 'Zuccolo, Jonathan', 'Puri, Mandip', 'Deng, Lili', 'Roberts, Luc', 'Zuba, Ania', 'Storek, Jan', 'Luider, Joanne M', 'Sundberg, Ellen M', 'Mansoor, Adnan', 'Baigorri, Eva', 'Chu, Michael P', 'Belch, Andrew R', 'Pilarski, Linda M', 'Deans, Julie P']","['Sanyal R', 'Polyak MJ', 'Zuccolo J', 'Puri M', 'Deng L', 'Roberts L', 'Zuba A', 'Storek J', 'Luider JM', 'Sundberg EM', 'Mansoor A', 'Baigorri E', 'Chu MP', 'Belch AR', 'Pilarski LM', 'Deans JP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Departments of Medicine and Oncology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Calgary Laboratory Services, Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, University of Alberta and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and Snyder Institute for Chronic Diseases, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",,,2017/03/18 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['icb201718 [pii]', '10.1038/icb.2017.18 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 2017 Aug;95(7):611-619. doi: 10.1038/icb.2017.18.

In this work, a custom-fit pipeline is demonstrated for thorough investigation of the voluminous MILE gene expression data set. Three analyses are accomplished, each for gaining a deeper understanding of the processes underlying leukaemia types and subtypes. First, the main disease groups are tested for differential expression against the healthy control as in a standard case-control study. Here, the basic knowledge on molecular mechanisms is confirmed quantitatively and by literature references. Second, pairwise comparison testing is performed for juxtaposing the main leukaemia types among each other. In this case by means of the Dice coefficient similarity measure the general relations are pointed out. Moreover, lists of candidate main leukaemia group biomarkers are proposed. Finally, with this approach being successful, the third analysis provides insight into all of the studied subtypes, followed by the emergence of four leukaemia subtype biomarkers. In addition, the class enhanced DEG signature obtained on the basis of novel pipeline processing leads to significantly better classification power of multi-class data classifiers.

We assessed changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis using a simultaneous thrombin and plasmin generation assay (T/P-GA) during HSCT. Measurements of endogenous thrombin potential (T-EP) and plasmin peak height (P-Peak) using T/P-GA in six pediatric acute leukemia patients treated with HSCT were compared to normal plasma. In the SOS case, the ratios of T-EP and P-Peak to normal were simultaneously decreased at four weeks post-HSCT (Pre; ~1.1/1.1-1.4, Week+4; 0.14/0.0084, respectively). Similarly, in the TMA patient, both ratios were decreased at 3 weeks and recovered after 8 weeks (Pre; 1.2/~0.95, Week+3; 0.59/0.22, Week+8; 1.2/0.64-0.85). In the other patients, when SOS/TMA was not evident, the T/P-GA data remained within normal limits.

ILC are involved in early effector cytokine-mediated responses during infections in peripheral tissues. ILC also play an important role in chronic skin inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. Although classical ILC express CD127, it has been recently reported that the presence of non-classical CD127(-) ILC populations and an early ILC precursor (EILP) CD127(low). ILC development has predominately been investigated in mouse models. However, in humans, different transcription factors have been described for ILC identification. NFIL3 (nuclear factor, IL-3 regulated) is crucial for ILC development in response to IL-7. CD123 (IL-3Ralpha) is usually used to exclude basophils during ILC identification, however, it is unknown if in response to IL-3, NFIL3 could be relevant to induce ILC features in Lin(-) CD123(+) populations in addition, is also unknown whether peripheral blood (PB) population with ILC features may have skin-homing potential to participate in skin inflammatory chronic diseases. Here, we report a Lin(-) CD123(+) CD127(low) CD7(+) CLA(+) population that share some phenotypic properties with basophils, but expresses several transcription factors for ILC commitment such as inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2), NFIL3, promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), thymocyte selection-associated high-mobility group box protein (TOX), and T cell factor-1 (TCF-1). In addition, this population expresses different ILC markers: CD132, CD90, CD161, alpha4 integrin, c-Kit, CRTH2, AhR, and IL-23R. IL-3 prevents apoptosis and increases their NFIL3, TOX, and PLZF expression. In PB, the CD123(+) CD127(low) population is predominantly a conspicuous population that expresses T-bet and RORgammat. The Lin(-) CD123(+) CD127(low) population in PB has a limited Th type cytokine expression and highly expresses IL-8. The Lin(-) CD123(+) CD127(low) population expresses skin-homing receptors (cutaneous lymphocyte antigen and CXCR4) and transmigrates through endothelial cells in response to SDF-1. An equivalent Lin(-) CD123(low) population was identified in control skin, which shows a broader phenotypic diversity and cytokine production, including IL-22 and IL-17. Remarkably, the CD123(low) population in the lesion and non-lesion skin of psoriasis patients expresses IL-17 and IL-22. Our findings suggest the identification of an alternative Lin(-) CD123(+) CD127(low) population with ILC features endowed with migratory capabilities that might contribute to immunopathological hallmarks of psoriasis.",,"['Mora-Velandia, Luz Maria', 'Castro-Escamilla, Octavio', 'Mendez, Andres Gonzalez', 'Aguilar-Flores, Cristina', 'Velazquez-Avila, Martha', 'Tussie-Luna, Maria Isabel', 'Tellez-Sosa, Juan', 'Maldonado-Garcia, Cesar', 'Jurado-Santacruz, Fermin', 'Ferat-Osorio, Eduardo', 'Martinez-Barnetche, Jesus', 'Pelayo, Rosana', 'Bonifaz, Laura C']","['Mora-Velandia LM', 'Castro-Escamilla O', 'Mendez AG', 'Aguilar-Flores C', 'Velazquez-Avila M', 'Tussie-Luna MI', 'Tellez-Sosa J', 'Maldonado-Garcia C', 'Jurado-Santacruz F', 'Ferat-Osorio E', 'Martinez-Barnetche J', 'Pelayo R', 'Bonifaz LC']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico; Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , Mexico City , Mexico.', ""Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital de Oncologia, Centro Medico Nacional 'Siglo XXI' , Mexico City , Mexico."", 'Division de Investigacion, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (UNAM), Mexico City, Mexico; Unidad de Investigacion en Virologia y Cancer, Hospital Infantil de Mexico ""Federico Gomez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Sobre Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica , Cuernavaca, Morelos , Mexico.', 'Centro Dermatologico ""Dr. Ladislao de la Pascua"", Secretaria de Salud de la Ciudad de Mexico , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Centro Dermatologico ""Dr. Ladislao de la Pascua"", Secretaria de Salud de la Ciudad de Mexico , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , Mexico City , Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Sobre Enfermedades Infecciosas, Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica , Cuernavaca, Morelos , Mexico.', ""Unidad de Investigacion en Enfermedades Oncologicas, Hospital de Oncologia, Centro Medico Nacional 'Siglo XXI' , Mexico City , Mexico."", 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Inmunoquimica Hospital de Especialidades Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social , Mexico City , Mexico.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CXCR4 axis', 'IL-17', 'IL-3Ralpha', 'SDF-1', 'innate lymphoid cells', 'psoriasis', 'skin inflammation']",2017/03/18 06:00,2017/03/18 06:01,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/08/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/18 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00176 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Mar 2;8:176. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00176. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5332395,,20170302,,,,,,,,,,,

In such cases, the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics such as fourth-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems is recommended as first-line antimicrobial treatment; however, the effectiveness of these agents in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not been investigated in detail. We retrospectively examined and evaluated the effectiveness of first-line antibiotic treatment regimens for chemotherapy-induced FN in patients with AML in Japanese Red Cross Nagoya Daiichi Hospital. The evaluated first-line treatment regimens were as follows: cefozopran (CZOP) + amikacin (AMK) in 38 cases, cefepime (CFPM) alone in 2 cases, CFPM + AMK in 2 cases, piperacillin (PIPC) + AMK in 2 cases, and CZOP alone in 1 case. Additionally, prophylactic antifungal agents were administered in all cases. Markedly effective, effective, moderately effective, and ineffective responses occurred in 31.1%, 8.9%, 8.9%, and 51.1%, respectively, of the treated cases. The response rate, defined as the combination of markedly effective and effective outcomes, was 40.0%. In 11 cases, impairment of renal functions were observed, and they were associated with combination treatments including AMK; nine of these were associated with a glycopeptide. The combination of CZOP with AMK (84.4%) was the most commonly used first-line treatment for FN in patients with AML; carbapenem or tazobactam/PIPC has never been used for treatment of such cases.

While improvements in treatment and supportive care have occurred, it is unknown whether these advances have resulted in improved outcome specifically among those diagnosed with acute graft-versus-host disease. We examined outcome following diagnosis of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease according to time period, and explored effects according to original graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimen and maximum overall grade of acute graft-versus-host disease. Between 1999 and 2012, 2,905 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (56%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (30%) or myelodysplastic syndromes (14%) received a sibling (24%) or unrelated donor (76%) blood (66%) or marrow (34%) transplant and developed grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (n=497 for 1999-2001, n=962 for 2002-2005, n=1,446 for 2006-2010). The median (range) follow-up was 144 (4-174), 97 (4-147) and 60 (8-99) months for 1999-2001, 2002-2005, and 2006-2010, respectively. Among the cohort with grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease, there was a decrease in the proportion of grade III-IV disease over time with 56%, 47%, and 37% for 1999-2001, 2002-2005, and 2006-2012, respectively (P<0.001). Considering the total study population, univariate analysis demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival and treatment-related mortality over time, and deaths from organ failure and infection declined. On multivariate analysis, significant improvements in overall survival (P=0.003) and treatment-related mortality (P=0.008) were only noted among those originally treated with tacrolimus-based graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, and these effects were most apparent among those with overall grade II acute graft-versus-host disease.

However, due to their genetic heterogeneity, only a handful of markers are currently used for the evaluation of minimal residual disease (MRD). Recent studies using multi-target strategies indicate that detection of residual mutations in less than 5% of cells in complete remission is associated with a better survival. Here, in a series of 69 AMLs with known clonal architecture, we design a clone-specific strategy based on fluorescent in situ hybridization and high-sensitivity next generation sequencing to detect chromosomal aberrations and mutations, respectively, in follow-up samples. The combination of these techniques allows tracking chromosomal and genomic lesions down to 0.5-0.4% of the cell population in remission samples. By testing all lesions in follow-up samples from 65 of 69 evaluable patients, we find that initiating events often persist and appear to be, on their own, inappropriate markers to predict short-term relapse. In contrast, the persistence of two or more lesions in more than 0.4% of the cells from remission samples is strongly associated with lower leukemia-free and overall survivals in univariate and multivariate analyses. Although larger prospective studies are needed to extend these results, our data show that a personalized, clone-specific, MRD follow up strategy is feasible in the vast majority of AML

However, the majority of clinical trials do not reflect the demographics of CLL patients treated in the community. We examined treatment patterns, outcomes, and disease-related mortality in patients >/= 75 years with CLL (E-CLL) in a real-world setting. METHODS: The Connect(R) CLL registry is a multicenter, prospective observational cohort study, which enrolled 1494 adult patients between 2010-2014, at 199 US sites. Patients with CLL were enrolled within 2 months of initiating first line of therapy (LOT1) or a subsequent LOT (LOT >/= 2). Kaplan-Meier methods were used to evaluate overall survival. CLL- and infection-related mortality were assessed using cumulative incidence functions (CIF) and cause-specific hazards. Logistic regression was used to develop a classification model. RESULTS: A total of 455 E-CLL patients were enrolled; 259 were enrolled in LOT1 and 196 in LOT >/= 2. E-CLL patients were more likely to receive rituximab monotherapy (19.3 vs. 8.6%; p < 0.0001) and chemotherapy-alone regimens (p < 0.0001) than younger patients. Overall and complete responses were lower in E-CLL patients than younger patients when given similar regimens. With a median follow-up of 3 years, CLL-related deaths were higher in E-CLL patients than younger patients in LOT1 (12.6 vs. 5.1% p = 0.0005) and LOT >/= 2 (31.3 vs. 21.5%; p = 0.0277). Infection-related deaths were also higher in E-CLL patients than younger patients in LOT1 (7.4 vs. 2.7%; p = 0.0033) and in LOT >/= 2 (16.2 vs. 11.2%; p = 0.0786). A prognostic score for E-CLL patients was developed: time from diagnosis to treatment < 3 months, enrollment therapy other than bendamustine/rituximab, and anemia, identified patients at higher risk of inferior survival. Furthermore, higher-risk patients experienced an increased risk of CLL- or infection-related death (30.6 vs 10.3%; p = 0.0006). CONCLUSION: CLL- and infection-related mortality are higher in CLL patients aged >/= 75 years than younger patients, underscoring the urgent need for alternative treatment strategies for these understudied patients.

We also utilized sequencing data to analyze the allele frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and detected the cancer-associated SNPs, i.e., the SNPs displaying the significant allele frequency difference between cancer and normal samples. RESULTS: After applying this model to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) data, we identified REs differentially activated (dREs) between normal and CLL cells, consisting of 6,802 dREs gained and 4,606 dREs lost in CLL. The identified regulatory perturbations coincide with changes in the expression of target genes. In particular, the genes encoding DNA methyltransferases harbor multiple lost-in-cancer dREs and zero gained-in-cancer dREs, indicating that the damaged regulation of these genes might be one of the key causes of tumor formation. dREs display a significantly elevated density of the genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs associated with CLL and CLL-related traits. We observed that most of dRE GWAS SNPs associated with CLL and CLL-related traits (83%) display a significant haplotype association among the identified cancer-associated alleles and the risk alleles that have been reported in GWAS. Also dREs are enriched for the binding sites of the well-established B-cell and CLL transcription factors (TFs) NF-kB, AP2, P53, E2F1, PAX5, and SP1. We also identified CLL-associated SNPs and demonstrated that the mutations at these SNPs change the binding sites of key TFs much more frequently than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Through exploring sequencing data measuring DNA methylation, we identified the epigenetic alterations (more specifically, DNA methylation) and genetic mutations along non-coding genomic regions CLL, and demonstrated that these changes play a critical role in carcinogenesis through damaging the regulation of key genes and alternating the binding of key TFs in B and CLL cells.",,"['Huang, Di', 'Ovcharenko, Ivan']","['Huang D', 'Ovcharenko I']","['Computational Biology Branch, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', 'Computational Biology Branch, National Center for Biotechnology Information, National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. ovcharen@nih.gov.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genomics/methods', 'Haplotypes', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Protein Binding', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*Genetic mutation', '*Genome-wide association study', '*Regulatory elements', '*Transcription factor binding site']",2017/03/18 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-017-3617-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-017-3617-6 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2017 Mar 16;18(1):236. doi: 10.1186/s12864-017-3617-6.,,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],PMC5353786,,20170316,,,,,,,,,,,

The transduction efficiency of hematopoietic and T cells is more efficient using gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) pseudotyping. In this context gammaretroviral vector producer cells offer competitive higher titers than transient lentiviral vectors productions. The main aim of this work was to identify the key parameters governing GaLV-pseudotyped gammaretroviral vector productivity in stable producer cells, using a retroviral vector expression cassette enabling positive (facilitating cell enrichment) and negative cell selection (allowing cell elimination). The retroviral vector contains a thymidine kinase suicide gene fused with a ouabain-resistant Na(+),K(+)-ATPase gene, a potential safer and faster marker. The establishment of retroviral vector producer cells is traditionally performed by randomly integrating the retroviral vector expression cassette codifying the transgene. More recently, recombinase-mediated cassette exchange methodologies have been introduced to achieve targeted integration. Herein we compared random and targeted integration of the retroviral vector transgene construct. Two retroviral producer cell lines, 293 OuaS and 293 FlexOuaS, were generated by random and targeted integration, respectively, producing high titers (on the order of 10(7) infectious particles.ml(-1)). Results showed that the retroviral vector transgene cassette is the key retroviral vector component determining the viral titers notwithstanding, single-copy integration is sufficient to provide high titers. The expression levels of the three retroviral constructs (gag-pol, GaLV env, and retroviral vector transgene) were analyzed. Although gag-pol and GaLV env gene expression levels should surpass a minimal threshold, we found that relatively modest expression levels of these two expression cassettes are required. Their levels of expression should not be maximized. We concluded, to establish a high producer retroviral vector cell line only the expression level of the genomic retroviral RNA, that is, the retroviral vector transgene cassette, should be maximized, both through (1) the optimization of its design (i.e., genetic elements composition) and (2) the selection of high expressing chromosomal locus for its integration. The use of methodologies identifying and promoting integration into high-expression loci, as targeted integration or high-throughput screening are in this perspective highly valuable.",,"['Bandeira, Vanessa S', 'Tomas, Helio A', 'Alici, Evren', 'Carrondo, Manuel J T', 'Coroadinha, Ana S']","['Bandeira VS', 'Tomas HA', 'Alici E', 'Carrondo MJ', 'Coroadinha AS']","['1 Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica , Oeiras, Portugal .', '2 Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa , Oeiras, Portugal .', '1 Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica , Oeiras, Portugal .', '2 Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa , Oeiras, Portugal .', '3 Cell and Gene Therapy Group, Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge , Stockholm, Sweden .', '1 Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica , Oeiras, Portugal .', '4 Faculdade de Ciencias e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Caparica, Portugal .', '1 Instituto de Biologia Experimental e Tecnologica , Oeiras, Portugal .', '2 Instituto de Tecnologia Quimica e Biologica Antonio Xavier, Universidade Nova de Lisboa , Oeiras, Portugal .']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther Methods,Human gene therapy methods,101573202,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Transgenic, Suicide/genetics', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*GalV pseudotypes', '*gene therapy', '*immunotherapies', '*retroviral vectors', '*stable production', '*targeted integration']",2017/03/18 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2017/03/18 06:00'],"['2017/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hgtb.2016.149 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther Methods. 2017 Apr;28(2):78-90. doi: 10.1089/hgtb.2016.149.,,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence, prognosis, and optimal management of multiple nonleukemic MS have not been addressed. The role of allogenic or autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for nonleukemic MS is also less well defined. We present a case of MS characterized by systemic lymphadenopathies and multiple effusions, which presumably had a very poor prognosis. The patient was treated with acute myeloid leukemia-type induction chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation, and, unexpectedly, she has remained disease free for more than 6 years. We also reviewed the literature on this rare disease, and found that multiple nonleukemic MS was associated with younger age and a worse prognosis when compared with the overall nonleukemic MS population.

However, to the authors' knowledge, the optimal dose of ATG is unknown. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized trial, the authors compared the long-term outcomes of 2 ATG doses (rabbit thymoglobulin) used in myeloablative conditioning before unmanipulated haplo-HSCT. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to received 10 mg/kg (ATG-10) or 6 mg/kg (ATG-6) of ATG. Analysis of disease-free survival, GVHD-free/recurrence-free survival (GRFS), disease recurrence, nonrecurrence mortality, and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) included the entire population. Late effects were assessed in disease-free patients who had survived for at least 6 months and had received regular follow-up evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were recruited. The median follow-up period was 1614 days (range, 28-1929 days). The rate of infection-related deaths in ATG-10 arm was double that of the ATG-6 arm (14.3% vs 7.1%; P = .084). The 5-year cumulative incidence was comparable between the ATG-6 and ATG-10 groups for disease recurrence (12.8% vs 13.4%; P = .832) and nonrecurrence mortality (11.6% vs 17.0%; P = .263). The 5-year probability of disease-free survival was comparable between the groups (75.6% vs 69.6%; P = .283). The 5-year cumulative incidence of cGVHD was found to be higher with ATG-6 (75.0% vs 56.3% [P = .007] and moderate-to-severe cGVHD: 56.3% vs 30.4% [P<.0001]) as well as that for late effects (71.2% vs 56.9%; P = .043). The 5-year probability of GRFS was higher in the ATG-10 group (41.0% vs 26.8%; P = .008). In the multivariate analysis, ATG-10 was found to be associated with a lower risk of cGVHD and improved GRFS. CONCLUSIONS: ATG-10 was found to be associated with better GVHD prevention and superior GRFS, but an increase in infection-related deaths. Cancer 2017;123:2881-92.

One factor which contributes to TKI resistance is a germline intronic deletion polymorphism in the BCL2-like 11 (BIM) gene which impairs the expression of pro-apoptotic splice isoforms of BIM. SB939 (pracinostat) is a hydroxamic acid based HDAC inhibitor with favorable pharmacokinetic, physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties, and we investigated if this drug could overcome BIM deletion polymorphism-induced TKI resistance. We found that SB939 corrects BIM pre-mRNA splicing in CML cells with the BIM deletion polymorphism, and induces apoptotic cell death in CML cell lines and primary cells with the BIM deletion polymorphism. More importantly, SB939 both decreases the viability of CML cell lines and primary CML progenitors with the BIM deletion and restores TKI-sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that SB939 overcomes BIM deletion polymorphism-induced TKI resistance, and suggest that SB939 may be useful in treating CML patients with BIM deletion-associated TKI resistance.",,"['Rauzan, Muhammad', 'Chuah, Charles T H', 'Ko, Tun Kiat', 'Ong, S Tiong']","['Rauzan M', 'Chuah CT', 'Ko TK', 'Ong ST']","['Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Cancer and Stem Cell Biology Signature Research Programme, Duke-NUS Medical School, Singapore.', 'Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, Singapore.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Centre Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/*genetics', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Gene Deletion', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA Splicing']",,,2017/03/17 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/03/17 06:00'],"['2016/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0174107 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-39979 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 16;12(3):e0174107. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0174107. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (SB939 compound)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC5354438,,20170316,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that knockdown of the 40S ribosomal protein S6 kinase-2 (S6K2), which acts downstream of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), enhanced breast cancer cell death by apoptotic stimuli. The increase in cell death by S6K2 depletion was partly due to inactivation of Akt. In the present study, we investigated if S6K2 regulates Mcl-1, which acts downstream of Akt. Silencing of S6K2 but not S6K1 in T47D cells decreased Mcl-1 level, and potentiated apoptosis induced by TRAIL and doxorubicin. Knockdown of S6K2 also decreased the level of anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl. Depletion of the tumor suppressor protein PDCD4 (programmed cell death 4), which regulates translation of several anti-apoptotic proteins, reversed downregulation of Bcl-xl but not Mcl-1 and failed to reverse the effect of S6K2 knockdown on potentiation of doxorubicin-induced apoptosis. Downregulation of Mcl-1 by S6K2 knockdown was partly restored by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Overexpression of catalytically-active Akt or knockdown of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3)-beta, a substrate for Akt, had little effect on Mcl-1 downregulation caused by S6K2 deficiency. Silencing of S6K2 increased the level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and knockdown of JNK1 increased basal Mcl-1 level and partly reversed the effect of S6K2 knockdown on Mcl-1 downregulation. JNK1 knockdown also had a modest effect in attenuating the increase in doxorubicin-induced apoptosis caused by S6K2 deficiency. These results suggest that S6K2 regulates apoptosis via multiple mechanisms, and involves both Akt and JNK.",,"['Basu, Alakananda', 'Sridharan, Savitha']","['Basu A', 'Sridharan S']","['Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, United States of America.', 'Institute for Molecular Medicine, University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth, Texas, United States of America.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1656-0788'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2017/03/17 06:00,2017/09/08 06:00,['2017/03/17 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0173854 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-39802 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 16;12(3):e0173854. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173854. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)']",PMC5354308,,20170316,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether these structural transitions also involve genomic repositioning of H3K9me2, we used ChIP-sequencing to map genome-wide topography of H3K9me2 in normal human granulocytes, normal CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, primary myeloblasts from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and a model leukemia cell line K562. We observe that H3K9me2 naturally repositions from the previously designated ""repressed"" chromatin state in hematopoietic progenitors to predominant association with heterochromatin regions in granulocytes. In contrast, AML cells accumulate H3K9me2 on previously undefined large (> 100 Kb) genomic blocks that are enriched with AML-specific single nucleotide variants, sites of chromosomal translocations, and genes downregulated in AML. Specifically, the AML-specific H3K9me2 blocks are enriched with genes regulated by the proto-oncogene ERG that promotes stem cell characteristics. The AML-enriched H3K9me2 blocks (in contrast to the heterochromatin-associated H3K9me2 blocks enriched in granulocytes) are reduced by pharmacological inhibition of the histone methyltransferase G9a/GLP in K562 cells concomitantly with transcriptional activation of ERG and ETS1 oncogenes. Our data suggest that G9a/GLP mediate formation of transient H3K9me2 blocks that are preserved in AML myeloblasts and may lead to an increased rate of AML-specific mutagenesis and chromosomal translocations.",,"['Salzberg, Anna C', 'Harris-Becker, Abigail', 'Popova, Evgenya Y', 'Keasey, Nikki', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Claxton, David F', 'Grigoryev, Sergei A']","['Salzberg AC', 'Harris-Becker A', 'Popova EY', 'Keasey N', 'Loughran TP', 'Claxton DF', 'Grigoryev SA']","['Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics and Penn State Institute for Personalized Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania, United States of America.', 'Penn State College of Medicine, Dept.

Nonetheless, there are several challenges to overcome before introduction into clinical practice, such as: (i) further refinement of the manufacturing process, (ii) further improvement of efficacy, (iii) finding the optimal infusion cell dose, (iv) optimization of lymphocyte-depleting chemotherapy, (v) identification of the best CAR structure, and (vi) optimization of toxicity management including cytokine release syndrome, neurologic toxicity, and on-target off-tumor toxicity. Several ways to solve these problems are currently under study. In this review, we describe the updated clinical data regarding anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy, with a focus on B-NHL, and discuss the clinical implications and perspectives of CAR T-cell therapy.","['(c) 2017 The Authors.

Here, we compared the effects of a farnesyl diphosphate synthase inhibitor, zoledronate, and a geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) inhibitor, digeranyl bisphosphonate (DGBP), on lymphocytic leukemia cell proliferation and apoptosis. Both zoledronate and DGBP inhibited proliferation with DGBP doing so more potently. DGBP was markedly less toxic than zoledronate toward the viability of healthy human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Addition of GGPP, but not farnesyl diphosphate (FPP), prevented the anti-proliferative effects of DGBP. Both GGPP and FPP partially rescued the effects of zoledronate. Co-treatment with DGBP and zoledronate was antagonistic. To further assess the effects of the bisphosphonates, we analyzed annexin V and propidium iodide staining via flow cytometry and found that DGBP induced apoptosis more potently than zoledronate. Western blots show that DGBP treatment altered expression and membrane affinity of some but not all geranylgeranylated small GTPases, activated caspases and increased ERK phosphorylation. Importantly, the anti-proliferative effects of DGBP were blocked by treatment with a caspase inhibitor and by treatment with a MEK inhibitor. Together, our findings indicate that DGBP is a more potent and selective compound than zoledronate in inducing apoptosis mediated through pathways that include caspases and MEK/ERK.

Dehydrocostus lactone significantly inhibits cell proliferation by inducing cells to undergo cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation. Dehydrocostus lactone suppresses the expression of cyclin B1, cyclin A, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) and increases p21 expression, resulting in S-G2/M phase arrest in K562 cells. Dehydrocostus lactone also induces apoptosis by increasing the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and modulating the protein levels of Bcl-2 family members. We also found that dehydrocostus lactone significantly inhibits the phosphorylation expression of Bcr/Abl, STAT5, JAK2, and STAT3 and downstream molecules including p-CrkL, Mcl-1, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-2 proteins in K562 cells. At a low concentration, dehydrocostus lactone significantly increased CD11b and CD14 expression on the surface of K562 cells, and induced cells to differentiate into monocytes or mature macrophages. Taken together, this study provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms of dehydrocostus lactone actions that may contribute to the chemoprevention of chronic myeloid leukemia. J. Cell.

In this study, we performed miR expression analysis using NanoString nCounter to discover differentially regulated miRs after therapy with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Of the differentially regulated miRs in the discovery set, miR-29c and miR-126 were confirmed using real-time PCR to be upregulated in CLL patient cells with ibrutinib therapy. In the validation set, an inverse correlation was observed between miR-126 levels and expression of its putative target p85beta, an isoform of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase p85 regulatory subunit. We found that mRNA for the host gene EGFL7, primary unprocessed miR-126, and mature miR-126 are all downregulated in CLL cells compared to normal B cells. Patients in later stages of disease have a greater decrease in miR-126 expression compared to treatment-naive patients, indicating that lower miR-126 levels may associate with disease progression.

Their involvement in two organs, blood and skin, is well documented. This review summarizes currently known Runx functions in the stem cells of these tissues. The fundamental core mechanism(s) mediated by Runx proteins has been sought; however, it appears that there does not exist one single common machinery that governs both tissue stem cells. Instead, Runx family genes employ multiple spatiotemporal mechanisms in regulating individual tissue stem cell populations. Such specific Runx requirements have been unveiled by a series of cell type-, developmental stage- or age-specific gene targeting studies in mice. Observations from these experiments revealed that the regulation of stem cells by Runx family genes turned out to be far more complex than previously thought. For instance, although it has been reported that Runx1 is required for the endothelial-to-hematopoietic cell transition (EHT) but not thereafter, recent studies clearly demonstrated that Runx1 is also needed during the period subsequent to EHT, namely at perinatal stage. In addition, Runx1 ablation in the embryonic skin mesenchyme eventually leads to complete loss of hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in the adult epithelium, suggesting that Runx1 facilitates the specification of skin epithelial stem cells in a cell extrinsic manner. Further in-depth investigation into how Runx family genes are involved in stem cell regulation is warranted.",,"['Wang, Chelsia Qiuxia', 'Mok, Michelle Meng Huang', 'Yokomizo, Tomomasa', 'Tergaonkar, Vinay', 'Osato, Motomi']","['Wang CQ', 'Mok MM', 'Yokomizo T', 'Tergaonkar V', 'Osato M']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. csimo@nus.edu.sg.', 'International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan. csimo@nus.edu.sg.', 'Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, A*STAR, Singapore, Singapore. csimo@nus.edu.sg.', 'Department of Paediatrics, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. csimo@nus.edu.sg.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Hair Follicle/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Skin/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/*physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Aging', '*Conditional knockout mice', '*DNA damage repair', '*Fetal liver', '*Hair follicle stem cell', '*Hematopoietic stem cell', '*Hmga2', '*Leukemia', '*Niche', '*Perinatal', '*Runx', '*Skin cancer']",2017/03/17 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/03/17 06:00'],"['2017/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-10-3233-2_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2017;962:117-138. doi: 10.1007/978-981-10-3233-2_9.,,['0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim is to study the effect of increased lipoprotein levels on the pharmacokinetics of PSZ and VCR upon co-administration in rats. METHODS: Rats were assigned to three groups, normolipidemic (NL), intermediate hyperlipidemic (IHL), and extreme hyperlipidemic (HL) groups. All rats were administered PSZ orally followed by VCR intravenously 4 h later. For the pharmacokinetic study, serial plasma samples were collected over 96 h and for tissue distribution study; plasma, lung, and liver tissues were collected over 48 h post oral dosing. RESULTS: Posaconazole showed higher plasma concentrations than VCR at all time points. Co-administration of VCR with PSZ reduced PSZ weight normalized oral clearance, increased PSZ area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity, showed higher PSZ liver concentrations, and increased VCR volume of distribution of the central compartment. Upon increasing the lipoprotein levels, PSZ showed higher plasma availability and delayed tissue distribution, whereas VCR had shown a significant decrease in PSZ AUC0-24h, AUC0-tlast, and AUCo-inf (NL = IHL > HL) and a significant increase in the volume of distribution (NL = IHL < HL). Vincristine has shown higher tissue uptake and concentrations. CONCLUSION: Monitoring cholesterol and triglyceride levels in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia is advisable to decrease VCR neurological side effect incidences and delay the activity of both PSZ and VCR.",,"['Khalil, Hadeel A', 'ElKhatib, Mohammed A W', 'Belal, Tarek S', 'El-Yazbi, Ahmed F', 'Hamdy, Dalia A']","['Khalil HA', 'ElKhatib MAW', 'Belal TS', 'El-Yazbi AF', 'Hamdy DA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Alexandria University, 1 El Khartoum Square, P.O.

Case reports have described large vessel vasculitis occurring in individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome, preceding transformation to acute myeloid leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old Afghanistan-born woman presented with fever, a tender left carotid artery, and raised inflammatory markers. Computed tomography revealed thickening of the wall of her left carotid artery. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously; however, they recurred weeks later on the contralateral side, along with abdominal pain after eating. Further imaging with computed tomography and positron emission tomography demonstrated resolution of her left carotid artery abnormality, but new wall thickening and inflammation in her right carotid artery, abdominal aorta, and superior mesenteric artery. She was diagnosed as having large vessel vasculitis, which resolved with corticosteroids and methotrexate. Five months later, she developed acute myeloid leukemia. She had no known history of myelodysplastic syndrome at the time of diagnosis with vasculitis. CONCLUSIONS: Large vessel vasculitis in older individuals presenting with atypical clinical features, such as a migratory pattern of affected vessels, vessel wall tenderness, and marked systemic inflammation, should prompt a search for underlying myelodysplasia.

For instance, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is generally indolent and low risk; however, it may transform into acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is much more aggressive. METHODS: We develop a novel network analysis approach that uses expression of eigengenes to delineate the biological differences between these two diseases. RESULTS: We find that specific genes in the extracellular matrix pathway are underexpressed in AML. We validate this finding in three ways: (a) We train our model on a microarray dataset of 364 cases and test it on an RNA Seq dataset of 74 cases. Our model showed 95% sensitivity and 86% specificity in the training dataset and showed 98% sensitivity and 91% specificity in the test dataset. This confirms that the identified biological signatures are independent from the expression profiling technology and independent from the training dataset. (b) Immunocytochemistry confirms that MMP9, an exemplar protein in the extracellular matrix, is underexpressed in AML. (c) MMP9 is hypermethylated in the majority of AML cases (n=194, Welch's t-test p-value <10(-138)), which complies with its low expression in AML. Our novel network analysis approach is generalizable and useful in studying other complex diseases (e.g., breast cancer prognosis). We implement our methodology in the Pigengene software package, which is publicly available through Bioconductor.

The enigmatic pathogenesis of HCL was recently clarified by the discovery of its underlying genetic cause, the BRAF-V600E kinase-activating mutation, which is somatically and clonally present in almost all patients through the entire disease spectrum and clinical course. By aberrantly activating the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway, BRAF-V600E shapes key biologic features of HCL, including its specific expression signature, hairy morphology, and antiapoptotic behavior. Accompanying mutations of the KLF2 transcription factor or the CDKN1B/p27 cell cycle inhibitor are recurrent in 16% of patients with HCL and likely cooperate with BRAF-V600E in HCL pathogenesis. Conversely, BRAF-V600E is absent in other B-cell neoplasms, including mimickers of HCL that require different treatments (eg, HCL-variant and splenic marginal zone lymphoma). Thus, testing for BRAF-V600E allows for a genetics-based differential diagnosis between HCL and HCL-like tumors, even noninvasively in routine blood samples. BRAF-V600E also represents a new therapeutic target. Patients' leukemic cells exposed ex vivo to BRAF inhibitors are spoiled of their HCL identity and then undergo apoptosis. In clinical trials of patients with HCL who have experienced multiple relapses after purine analogs or who are refractory to purine analogs, a short course of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib produced an almost 100% response rate, including complete remission rates of 35% to 42%, without myelotoxicity. To further improve on these results, it will be important to clarify the mechanisms of incomplete leukemic cell eradication by vemurafenib and to explore chemotherapy-free combinations of a BRAF inhibitor with other targeted agents (eg, a MEK inhibitor and/or an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody).",,"['Tiacci, Enrico', 'Pettirossi, Valentina', 'Schiavoni, Gianluca', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Tiacci E', 'Pettirossi V', 'Schiavoni G', 'Falini B']","['All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', 'All authors: Institute of Hematology and Center for Hemato-Oncology Research, University and Hospital of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Animals', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*genetics']",,,2017/03/16 06:00,2017/08/03 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/JCO.2016.71.1556 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2017 Mar 20;35(9):1002-1010. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2016.71.1556.

AML, similar to most other cancers, is characterized by multiple somatically acquired mutations that affect genes of different functional categories, a complex clonal architecture, and disease evolution over time. Patterns of mutations seem to follow specific and temporally ordered trajectories. Mutations in genes encoding epigenetic modifiers, such as DNMT3A, ASXL1, TET2, IDH1, and IDH2, are commonly acquired early and are present in the founding clone. The same genes are frequently found to be mutated in elderly individuals along with clonal expansion of hematopoiesis that confers an increased risk for the development of hematologic cancers. Furthermore, such mutations may persist after therapy, lead to clonal expansion during hematologic remission, and eventually lead to relapsed disease. In contrast, mutations involving NPM1 or signaling molecules (eg, FLT3, RAS) typically are secondary events that occur later during leukemogenesis. Genetic data are now being used to inform disease classification, risk stratification, and clinical care of patients. Two new provisional entities, AML with mutated RUNX1 and AML with BCR- ABL1, have been included in the current update of the WHO classification of myeloid neoplasms and AML, and mutations in three genes- RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53-have been added in the risk stratification of the 2017 European LeukemiaNet recommendations for AML. Integrated evaluation of baseline genetics and assessment of minimal residual disease are expected to further improve risk stratification and selection of postremission therapy.

Multicolor flow cytometry has been widely used to distinguish stem and myeloid progenitor cells from other populations in normal and malignant bone marrow. In this study, we present a method for assessing drug sensitivity in MDS and AML patient hematopoietic stem and myeloid progenitor cell populations ex vivo using the investigational Nedd8-activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 and standard-of-care agent cytarabine as examples. Utilizing a multicolor flow cytometry antibody panel for identification of hematopoietic stem cells, multipotent progenitors, common myeloid progenitors, granulocyte-monocyte progenitors, and megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors present in mononuclear cell fractions isolated from bone marrow aspirates, we compare stem and progenitor cell counts after treatment for 24 hours with drug versus diluent. We demonstrate that MLN4924 exerts a cytotoxic effect on MDS and AML stem and progenitor cell populations, whereas cytarabine has more limited effects. Further application of this method for evaluating drug effects on these populations ex vivo and in vivo may inform rational design and selection of therapies in the clinical setting.

A significant proportion of myofibroblasts has been reported to originate via endothelial-mesenchymal transition. We initially hypothesized that exposing myofibroblasts to the extract of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) could reverse this transition. Indeed, in vitro treatment of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-activated fibroblasts with EPC extract prevented expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA); however, it did not enhance expression of endothelial markers. In two distinct models of renal fibrosis-unilateral ureteral obstruction and chronic phase of folic acid-induced nephropathy-subcapsular injection of EPC extract to the kidney prevented and reversed accumulation of alpha-SMA-positive myofibroblasts and reduced fibrosis. Screening the composition of EPC extract for cytokines revealed that it is enriched in leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and vascular endothelial growth factor. Only LIF was capable of reducing fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition of TGF-beta1-activated fibroblasts. In vivo subcapsular administration of LIF reduced the number of myofibroblasts and improved the density of peritubular capillaries; however, it did not reduce the degree of fibrosis. A receptor-independent ligand for the gp130/STAT3 pathway, hyper-interleukin-6 (hyper-IL-6), not only induced a robust downstream increase in pluripotency factors Nanog and c-Myc but also exhibited a powerful antifibrotic effect. In conclusion, EPC extract prevented and reversed fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and renal fibrosis. The component of EPC extract, LIF, was capable of preventing development of the contractile phenotype of activated fibroblasts but did not eliminate TGF-beta1-induced collagen synthesis in cultured fibroblasts and models of renal fibrosis, whereas a receptor-independent gp130/STAT3 agonist, hyper-IL-6, prevented fibrosis. In summary, these studies, through the evolution from EPC extract to LIF and then to hyper-IL-6, demonstrate the instructive role of microenvironmental cues and may provide in the future a facile strategy to prevent and reverse renal fibrosis.

The nature of the histiocytoid infiltrate has generated considerable controversy in the literature. Objective: The main goal of this study was to conduct a comprehensive overview of the immunohistochemical phenotype of the infiltrate in histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. We also analyze whether this variant of Sweet syndrome is more frequently associated with hematologic malignancies than classic Sweet syndrome. Design: This is a retrospective case series study of the clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular features of 33 patients with a clinicopathologic diagnosis of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome was conducted in the dermatology departments of 5 university hospitals and a private laboratory of dermatopathology. Main Outcome and Measures: The clinical, histopathological, immunohistochemical, and follow-up features of 33 patients with histiocytoid Sweet syndrome were analyzed. In some cases, cytogenetic studies of the dermal infiltrate were also performed. We compare our findings with those of the literature. Results: The dermal infiltrate from the 33 study patients (20 female; median age, 49 years; age range, 5-93 years; and 13 male; median age, 42 years; age range, 4-76 years) was mainly composed of myeloperoxidase-positive immature myelomonocytic cells with histiocytoid morphology. No cytogenetic anomalies were found in the infiltrate except in 1 case in which neoplastic cells of chronic myelogenous leukemia were intermingled with the cells of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. Authentic histiocytes were also found in most cases, with a mature immunoprofile, but they appeared to be a minor component of the infiltrate. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome was not more frequently related with hematologic malignancies than classic neutrophilic Sweet syndrome. Conclusions and Relevance: The dermal infiltrate of cutaneous lesions of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is composed mostly of immature cells of myeloid lineage.

Previous studies showed that alterations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced protein 3 gene (TNFAIP3; A20) are frequent in SS. In this study, we characterized the mutation and polymorphisms of A20 in a case with SS and compared with the genetic feature of A20 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). METHODS: Using a novel approach based on the combination of fine-tiling array comparative genomic hybridization ( and ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) to identify SS clone, the polymorphisms in the A20 gene (promoter, exons 2-9 [coding region] and 3'UTR) were detected by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: The malignant SS clone was identified as TCR Valpha2-Jalpha22 rearrangement without deletion at the A20 loci (6q23-27 region) in the SS case. Six polymorphisms were identified, all of them are belonging to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are recorded in genebank: rs5029924, rs5029937, rs2230926, rs582757 and rs77191406, while rs2307859 was not identified in the SS sample, which is found in all T-ALL. The alteration pattern of A20 in this case seemed different from the T-ALL samples, in contrast, it is similar to the alteration of A20 in samples from rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus with poor clinical outcome and cancer developing. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic alteration of A20 in the SS case was different from the T-ALL samples and similar to the cases with refractory autoimmune disease and related to tumorigenesis. The findings lead to discuss whether such SNPs of A20 may link the refractory autoimmune inflammation and the tumorigenesis.","['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Zhou, Lingling', 'Zheng, Haitao', 'Huang, Xin', 'Zhu, Lihua', 'Wu, Suijing', 'Zeng, Chengwu', 'Yang, Lijian', 'Chen, Shaohua', 'Luo, Gengxin', 'Du, Xin', 'Li, Yangqiu']","['Zhou L', 'Zheng H', 'Huang X', 'Zhu L', 'Wu S', 'Zeng C', 'Yang L', 'Chen S', 'Luo G', 'Du X', 'Li Y']","['Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Rheumatism and Immunology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guangdong General Hospital (Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences), Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Regenerative Medicine of Ministry of Education, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou, China.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol,Asia-Pacific journal of clinical oncology,101241430,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Sezary Syndrome/*genetics/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['A20 gene', 'Sezary syndrome', 'T cell clone', 'TCR rearrangement', 'polymorphisms']",2017/03/16 06:00,2018/05/23 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajco.12672 [doi]'],ppublish,Asia Pac J Clin Oncol. 2018 Apr;14(2):e116-e123. doi: 10.1111/ajco.12672.

A flow cytometric platelet aggregation test independent of the patient platelet count was made. Platelet aggregation was reduced in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological cancer. High platelet aggregation ruled out bleeding tendency in thrombocytopenic patients. SUMMARY: Background Methods for testing platelet aggregation in thrombocytopenia are lacking. Objective To establish a flow-cytometric test of in vitro platelet aggregation independently of the patient's platelet count, and examine the association of aggregation with a bleeding history in thrombocytopenic patients. Patients/methods We established a flow-cytometric assay of platelet aggregation, and measured samples from healthy individuals preincubated with antiplatelet drugs, and samples from two patients with inherited platelet disorders. Then, we included 19 healthy individuals and 20 patients with platelet counts of </= 50 x 10(9) L(-1) , diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. We measured platelet aggregation and platelet activation by platelet surface expression of activated glycoprotein IIb-IIIa, P-selectin and CD63 after addition of agonists: collagen-related peptide, thrombin receptor-activating peptide (TRAP), and ADP. Results The platelet aggregation assay showed a low intraserial coefficient of variation of </= 3%. Similar results were obtained for platelet-rich plasma and isolated platelets at platelet counts of > 10 x 10(9) L(-1) ; otherwise, platelet isolation was required. The platelet aggregation percentage decreased with increasing antiplatelet drug concentration. Platelet aggregation in patients was reduced as compared with healthy individuals: 42% (interquartile range [IQR] 27-58) versus 66% (IQR 60-67) for TRAP; 41% (IQR 25-48) versus 70% (IQR 69-72) for collagen-related peptide; and 44% (IQR 30-53) versus 65% (IQR 46-72) for ADP. Platelet activation after stimulation was reduced in patients and correlated with platelet aggregation (e.g. r = 0.78-0.81 when stimulated with collagen-related peptide). Platelet aggregation had a negative predictive value of 100% for a bleeding tendency among patients. Conclusion The established platelet aggregation assay was applicable for thrombocytopenic patients, and improved the identification of bleeding risk.",['(c) 2017 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis.'],"['Vinholt, P J', 'Frederiksen, H', 'Hvas, A-M', 'Sprogoe, U', 'Nielsen, C']","['Vinholt PJ', 'Frederiksen H', 'Hvas AM', 'Sprogoe U', 'Nielsen C']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2035-0169'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Carrier Proteins/blood', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Hemorrhage/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood', 'P-Selectin/metabolism', 'Peptides/blood', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', '*Platelet Count', 'Platelet Function Tests/*methods', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/diagnosis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*flow cytometry', '*hematologic neoplasms', '*methods', '*platelet aggregation', '*thrombocytopenia']",2017/03/16 06:00,2018/04/24 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jth.13675 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2017 Jun;15(6):1191-1202. doi: 10.1111/jth.13675.

We examined the pharmacokinetics (PK) and BA of 6-MP in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) comparing a marketed tablet, two extemporaneously prepared liquid formulations, and data from the approved liquid formulation. METHODS: Twenty-two children (6-17 years) participated in a randomized two-way, crossover study of two cohorts. Group 1 (n = 11; five males) received a 5 mg/ml liquid formulation and the marketed 50 mg 6-MP tablet on separate occasions, and Group 2 (n = 11; five males) received a 50 mg/ml liquid formulation and the marketed tablet. The usual prescribed 6-MP dose (25-115 mg/m(2) ) was given after an 8-hr fast. Serial blood samples were collected over 8 hr postdose. Plasma 6-MP concentrations were determined using a good laboratory practice (GLP)-validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. PK parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis and compared within and between cohorts, and thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotype was analyzed. RESULTS: No patient had a TPMT genotype reflective of a poor metabolizer phenotype. Comparison of PK parameters between 5 and 50 mg/ml treatments revealed significant differences (P <0.05) in AUCN (where AUC is area under the curve), CmaxN , and Tmax . Comparisons within each group revealed significant differences in AUC0-infinity and Tmax in the 5 mg/ml group. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic profiles of 6-MP established in healthy adults with the approved liquid formulation may not reflect the PK profile in children with ALL. Formulation-specific differences in PK may significantly impact the dose-exposure profile in these children and must be considered.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tolbert, Jaszianne A', 'Bai, Shasha', 'Abdel-Rahman, Susan M', 'August, Keith J', 'Weir, Scott J', 'Kearns, Gregory L', 'Neville, Kathleen A']","['Tolbert JA', 'Bai S', 'Abdel-Rahman SM', 'August KJ', 'Weir SJ', 'Kearns GL', 'Neville KA']","[""Divisions of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", ""Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Toxicology, and Therapeutic Innovation, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.', ""Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', ""Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Toxicology, and Therapeutic Innovation, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.', ""Divisions of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Toxicology and Therapeutics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.', 'Institute for Advancing Medical Innovation, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas.', 'University of Kansas Cancer CenterKansas City, Kansas.', ""Divisions of Clinical Pharmacology, Medical Toxicology, and Therapeutic Innovation, Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, Kansas City, Missouri."", 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Missouri-Kansas City, Kansas City, Missouri.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas.', ""Sections of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas."", ""Sections of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dosage Forms', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'pediatric oncology', 'pharmacokinetics']",2017/03/16 06:00,2017/09/15 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/07 00:00 [revised]', '2016/12/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26465 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Aug;64(8). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26465.

We report a case of gastric carcinoid tumor that occurred after allogeneic HSCT. A 13-year-old girl with ETP acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent allogeneic HSCT from a 7/8 HLA-matched unrelated donor. She presented with rashes, abdominal pain, and diarrhea, which were suggestive of GVHD, 7 months after HSCT. Immunosuppressive agents failed to resolve these symptoms well. After a series of evaluations, carcinoid syndrome caused by a gastric carcinoid tumor was diagnosed. The tumor was located in the antral region and resulted in partial gastric outlet obstruction. She received subtotal gastrectomy with regional lymph node dissection. However, she had a flare-up of GVHD 1 month after surgery, and immunosuppressive therapy was intensified accordingly. Although her GVHD was getting better, she developed respiratory syncytial viral pneumonia with rapid progression to respiratory failure. She died of multiple organ failure 2 months postoperatively. This is the first pediatric case of a gastric carcinoid tumor following allogeneic HSCT.

These include inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), splenic tyrosine kinase and protein kinase Cbeta. Two agents are already approved in the USA and Europe: ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor, for the treatment of chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia; and idelalisib, a PI3Kdelta inhibitor, for the treatment of CLL and follicular lymphoma. In addition, the role of these drugs in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma is under investigation, as single agents and in combination with chemotherapy. In CLL, both ibrutinib and idelalisib have an established role as first-line therapy in patients with del(17p), and in MCL, ibrutinib is a standard option for patients relapsing after chemoimmunotherapy. Unexpected toxicities have been encountered when combining these potent new agents with other drugs, including chemotherapy and lenalidomide, and based on this experience the risks and benefits of novel combinations must be evaluated carefully.

In 3 cases, CLL and HL were diagnosed simultaneously. Hl was characterized by advanced stage in 79% of cases, International Prognostic Score (IPS) >/=4 in 50%, extranodal involvement in 39%, B symptoms in 70%. Prior treatment for CLL had been received by 82% of patients and included fludarabine in 67%. Coexistence of CLL and HL was detected in the same bioptic tissue in 87% of cases. The most common administered treatment was the ABVD regimen given to 22 patients (66.6%). The complete response (CR) rate after ABVD was 68%, and was influenced by the IPS (P = .03) and interval from the last CLL treatment (P = .057). Survival from HL was also influenced by the IPS (P = .006) and time from the last CLL treatment (P = .047).

Furthermore, polymorphisms in several cytokine genes, including IL-10 and IFN-gamma, are associated with leukemia development. However, the mechanisms and timing of these influences remain unknown. Here, we use the Emu-ret transgenic mouse model of B-cell precursor ALL to assess the influence of IFN-gamma on the early-life burden of leukemia-initiating cells. The absence of IFN-gamma activity resulted in greater numbers of leukemia-initiating cells early in life and was associated with accelerated leukemia onset. The leukemia-initiating cells from IFN-gamma-knockout mice had reduced suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1) expression, were significantly more sensitive to IFN-gamma, and exhibited more rapid expansion in vivo than their wild-type counterparts. However, sensitivity to this inhibitory pathway was lost in fully transformed IFN-gamma-knockout leukemia cells. These results demonstrate that the influence of IFN-gamma on ALL progression may not be mediated by selection of nascent transformed cells but rather through a general SOCS-mediated reduction in B-cell precursor proliferation. Thus, while cytokine levels may influence leukemia at multiple points during disease progression, our study indicates a significant early influence of basal, infection-independent cytokine production on leukemogenesis.","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although a preliminary analysis of a small sample of patients indicated that FoxO3a aberrations in glioma might be related to aggressive clinical behavior, the clinical significance of FoxO3a in glioblastoma remains unclear. We investigated the expression of FoxO3a in a cohort of 91 glioblastoma specimens and analyzed the correlations of protein expression with patient prognosis. Furthermore, the functional impact of FoxO3a on GBM progression and the underlying mechanisms of FoxO3a regulation were explored in a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. FoxO3a expression was elevated in glioblastoma tissues, and high nuclear FoxO3a expression in human GBM tissues was associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, knockdown of FoxO3a significantly reduced the colony formation and invasion ability of GBM cells, whereas overexpression of FoxO3a promoted the colony formation and invasion ability. The results of in vivo GBM models further confirmed that FoxO3a knockdown inhibited GBM progression. More, the pro-oncogenic effects of FoxO3a in GBM were mediated by the activation of c-Myc, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B) and Beclin1 in a mixed-lineage leukemia 2 (MLL2)-dependent manner. These findings suggest that high FoxO3a expression is associated with glioblastoma progression and that FoxO3a independently indicates poor prognosis in patients.

To assess the impact of technical standardisation and the development of the International Scale (IS) upon the accuracy of BCR-ABL1 testing, we reviewed EQA trial data from 2007 to 2015. Comparison of participant results identified considerable variability at both high and low levels of disease, including therapeutically important decision points; however, results converted to the IS showed less variability compared to unconverted data sets. We also found that different methods of converting to the IS produce consistently different median results within UKNEQAS LI IS data sets. This data suggests that whilst the development of the IS has improved the comparability of results between centres, there is still the need for further improvement in the processes of converting raw results to the IS in order to fully realise the benefits of molecular monitoring of CML.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Scott, Stuart', 'Travis, Debbie', 'Whitby, Liam', 'Bainbridge, John', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Barnett, David']","['Scott S', 'Travis D', 'Whitby L', 'Bainbridge J', 'Cross NCP', 'Barnett D']","['UKNEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, UK.', 'UKNEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, UK.', 'UKNEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biostatistics Center, Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK.', 'UKNEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield, UK.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods/standards', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",['NOTNLM'],"['* BCR-ABL1', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*external quality assessment', '*quality', '*reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",2017/03/16 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14557 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 May;177(3):414-422. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14557.

NDI-031301 treatment of human T-ALL cell lines resulted in induction of apoptosis that was not observed with the JAK inhibitors tofacitinib and baricitinib. Further investigation revealed that NDI-031301 treatment uniquely leads to activation of three mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), resulting in phosphorylation of ERK, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK coincident with PARP cleavage. Activation of p38 MAPK occurred within 1 h of NDI-031301 treatment and was responsible for NDI-031301-induced T-ALL cell death, as pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK partially rescued apoptosis induced by TYK2 inhibitor. Finally, daily oral administration of NDI-031301 at 100 mg/kg bid to immunodeficient mice engrafted with KOPT-K1 T-ALL cells was well tolerated, and led to decreased tumour burden and a significant survival benefit. These results support selective inhibition of TYK2 as a promising potential therapeutic strategy for T-ALL.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Akahane, Koshi', 'Li, Zhaodong', 'Etchin, Julia', 'Berezovskaya, Alla', 'Gjini, Evisa', 'Masse, Craig E', 'Miao, Wenyan', 'Rocnik, Jennifer', 'Kapeller, Rosana', 'Greenwood, Jeremy R', 'Tiv, Hong', 'Sanda, Takaomi', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Look, A Thomas']","['Akahane K', 'Li Z', 'Etchin J', 'Berezovskaya A', 'Gjini E', 'Masse CE', 'Miao W', 'Rocnik J', 'Kapeller R', 'Greenwood JR', 'Tiv H', 'Sanda T', 'Weinstock DM', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Chuo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Center for Immuno - Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Nimbus Therapeutics, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Schrodinger, Inc., New York, NY, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'TYK2 Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*NDI-031301', '*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*TYK2', '*p38 MAPK']",2017/03/16 06:00,2017/06/15 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/15 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.14563 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2017 Apr;177(2):271-282. doi: 10.1111/bjh.14563.

We analysed 143 consecutive patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, transplanted between 2000 and 2012, to determine the prognostic relevance of mixed chimerism post-alloSCT and the ability of post-transplant immunomodulation to treat relapse. Mixed T-cell chimerism occurred in 50% of patients at 3 months and 43% at 6 months post-alloSCT; upon 3- and 6-month landmark analysis, this was associated with inferior progression-free survival (PFS) [Hazard ratio (HR) 1.93, P = 0.003 and HR 2.58, P < 0.001] and survival (HR 1.66, P = 0.05 and HR 2.17, P < 0.001), independent of baseline patient characteristics, and a lower rate of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GHVD) (16% vs. 52%, P < 0.001). Thirty-three patients were treated with immunomodulation for relapse post-alloSCT (immunosuppression withdrawal, n = 6, donor lymphocyte infusion, n = 27); 17 achieved complete response (CR), which predicted superior PFS (53 months vs. 10 months, P < 0.001) and survival (117 months vs. 30 months, P = 0.006). Relapsed patients with mixed chimerism had inferior response to immunomodulation; conversion to full donor chimerism was highly correlated both with CR and with the development of severe acute GVHD, which was fatal in 3/8 patients.

To identify the bioactive constituents from M. bontioides, a newly-identified flavone, 3,4'-dimethoxy-3',5,7-trihydroxyflavone (compound 1), along with eight known compounds, were investigated in human MCF-7 breast cancer, SCC4 oral cancer, and THP-1 monocytic leukemia cells. Among these compounds, compound 1 exhibited the strongest antiproliferative activity with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 3.3 muM (MCF-7) to 8.6 muM (SCC4). Flow cytometric analysis indicated that compound 1 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in MCF-7 cells. Mechanistic evidence suggests that the G2/M arrest could be attributable to compound 1's modulatory effects on the phosphorylation and expression of numerous key signaling effectors, including cell division cycle 2 (CDC2), CDC25C, and p53. Notably, compound 1 downregulated the expression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and HDAC4, leading to increased histone H3 acetylation and p21 upregulation.

The clinical and laboratory characteristics were compared between wild-type and mutant cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy newly diagnosed de novo AML patients were recruited at the time of diagnosis prior to chemotherapy; among them, 54 had CN-AML. For detecting mutations, the FLT3 and NPM1 genes were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction method, followed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: Our results showed that the frequencies of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and NPM1 mutations in CN-AML patients were 25.9%, 5.9%, and 20.8%, respectively. The most frequent NPM1 mutation type was the type A mutation. The FLT3-ITD mutation was seen more frequently in non-M3 patients compared with M3 patients. No mutation was observed in either the FLT3-TKD or the NPM1 gene in patients in the M3 French-American-British group. There was no significant association between the presence of FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in CN-AML patients (p>0.05). The frequency of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, and NPM1 mutation was higher in CN-AML patients in comparison with AML patients with cytogenetic aberrations, although the differences were not statistically significant (p>0.05). There were no significant differences in mean white blood cell and platelet counts, serum hemoglobin levels, and bone marrow blast percentages between patients with wild-type and mutant FLT3-ITD and NPM1 genes (p>0.05). No difference was observed in the frequency of FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutation regarding age or sex (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Given the high stability of NPM1 during the disease course, it can be used in combination with FLT3 as well as other known genetic markers to monitor patients, especially for minimal residual disease detection.",,"['Rezaei, Narges', 'Arandi, Nargess', 'Valibeigi, Behnaz', 'Haghpanah, Sezaneh', 'Khansalar, Mehdi', 'Ramzi, Mani']","['Rezaei N', 'Arandi N', 'Valibeigi B', 'Haghpanah S', 'Khansalar M', 'Ramzi M']","['Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Namazi Hospital, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'FLT3 NPM1.', 'Gene mutation']",2017/03/16 06:00,2018/07/17 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.4274/tjh.2016.0489 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2017 Dec 1;34(4):300-306. doi: 10.4274/tjh.2016.0489.

IFN-lambdas act by binding to the heterodimeric IFN-lambda receptor (IFNLR), activating a STAT phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade. Thereby hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes are induced, which modulate various immune functions via complex forward and feedback loops. When compared to the well-characterized IFN-alpha signaling cascade, three important differences have been discovered. First, the IFNLR is not ubiquitously expressed: in particular, immune cells show significant variation in the expression levels of and susceptibilities to IFN-lambdas. Second, the binding affinities of individual IFN-lambdas to the IFNLR varies greatly and are generally lower compared to the binding affinities of IFN-alpha to its receptor. Finally, genetic variation in the form of a series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to genes involved in the IFN-lambda signaling cascade has been described and associated with the clinical course and treatment outcomes of hepatitis B and C virus infection. The clinical impact of IFN-lambda signaling and the SNP variations may, however, reach far beyond viral hepatitis. Recent publications show important roles for IFN-lambdas in a broad range of viral infections such as human T-cell leukemia type-1 virus, rotaviruses, and influenza virus. IFN-lambda also potentially modulates the course of bacterial colonization and infections as shown for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the immunological processes involved in controlling viral and bacterial infections are distinct, IFN-lambdas may interfere at various levels: as an innate immune cytokine with direct antiviral effects; or as a modulator of IFN-alpha-induced signaling via the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 inhibitory feedback loops. In addition, the modulation of adaptive immune functions via macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, and subsequent priming, activation, and proliferation of pathogen-specific T- and B-cells may also be important elements associated with infectious disease outcomes.

HAM/TSP is the result of demyelination and cell death in the spinal cord and disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), mediated by a virus-induced inflammatory response. In this study, we applied Positron Emission Tomography with 18F-fluordeoxyglucose (18F-FDG PET) to evaluate brain metabolism in a group of 47 patients infected with HTLV-1, and 18 healthy controls. Patients were divided into three groups according to their neurological symptoms. A machine learning (ML) based Gaussian Processes classification algorithm (GPC) was applied to classify between patient groups and controls and also to organize the three patient groups, based on gray and white matter brain metabolism. We found that GPC was able to differentiate the HAM/TSP group from controls with 85% accuracy (p = 0.003) and the asymptomatic seropositive patients from controls with 85.7% accuracy (p = 0.001). The weight map suggests diffuse cortical hypometabolism in both patient groups when compared to controls. We also found that the GPC could separate the asymptomatic HTLV-1 patients from the HAM/TSP patients, but with a lower accuracy (72.7%, p = 0.026). The weight map suggests a diffuse pattern of lower metabolism in the asymptomatic group when compared to the HAM/TSP group. These results are compatible with distinctive patterns of glucose uptake into the brain of HTLV-1 patients, including those without neurological symptoms, which differentiate them from controls.

The role of natural killer (NK) cells and other antileukemic lymphocytes in CMML is largely unknown. We aimed to provide insight into the mechanisms of immune evasion in CMML with a focus on immunosuppressive reactive oxygen species (ROS) formed by the myeloid cell NADPH oxidase-2 (NOX2). The dominant population of primary human CMML cells was found to express membrane-bound NOX2 and to release ROS, which, in turn, triggered extensive PARP-1-dependent cell death in cocultured NK cells, CD8(+) T effector memory cells, and CD8(+) T effector cells. Inhibitors of ROS formation and scavengers of extracellular ROS prevented CMML cell-induced lymphocyte death and facilitated NK cell degranulation toward Ab-coated, primary CMML cells. In patients with CMML, elevation of immature cell counts (CD34(+)) in blood was associated with reduced expression of several NK cell-activating receptors.

However, clinical utility was limited by the requirement for a 7-day infusion. Here we assessed the potential of a nanoparticle formulation of the selective Aurora kinase B inhibitor AZD2811 (formerly known as AZD1152-hQPA) in preclinical models of AML. When administered to HL-60 tumor xenografts at a single dose between 25 and 98.7 mg/kg, AZD2811 nanoparticle treatment delivered profound inhibition of tumor growth, exceeding the activity of AZD1152. The improved antitumor activity was associated with increased phospho-histone H3 inhibition, polyploidy, and tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, AZD2811 nanoparticles increased antitumor activity when combined with cytosine arabinoside. By modifying dose of AZD2811 nanoparticle, therapeutic benefit in a range of preclinical models was further optimized. At high-dose, antitumor activity was seen in a range of models including the MOLM-13 disseminated model. At these higher doses, a transient reduction in bone marrow cellularity was observed demonstrating the potential for the formulation to target residual disease in the bone marrow, a key consideration when treating AML. Collectively, these data establish that AZD2811 nanoparticles have activity in preclinical models of AML. Targeting Aurora B kinase with AZD2811 nanoparticles is a novel approach to deliver a cell-cycle inhibitor in AML, and have potential to improve on the clinical activity seen with cell-cycle agents in this disease.

Low producing clones release an overwhelming proportion of non-infectious virions containing retroviral RNA but deficient in the Env protein. Non-infectious virion production is not due to an inability of the cells to support infectious MuLV production or to an inherent replicative defectiveness of the proviruses. Reinfection of the lowest producing lines with the polytropic or an ecotropic MuLV results in enormous increases in the specific infectivity of the released virions. This indicates a reversible state of retroviral latency characterized by the release of non-infectious virions that is likely the result of insufficient levels of Env protein required for infectivity.

Few studies have measured the economic burden of care for childhood and adolescent cancers. OBJECTIVES: To estimate costs of cancer care in population-based cohorts of children and adolescents from the public payer perspective. METHODS: We identified patients with cancer, aged 91 days to 19 years, diagnosed from 1995 to 2009 using cancer registry data, and matched each to three noncancer controls. Using linked administrative health care records, we estimated total and net resource-specific costs (in 2012 Canadian dollars) during 90 days prediagnosis and 1 year postdiagnosis. RESULTS: Children (</=14 years old) numbered 4,396: 36% had leukemia, 21% central nervous system tumors, 10% lymphoma, and 33% other cancers. Adolescents (15-19 years old) numbered 2,329: 28.9% had lymphoma. Bone and soft tissue sarcoma, germ cell tumor, and thyroid carcinoma each comprised 12% to 13%. Mean net prediagnosis costs were $5,810 and $1,127 and mean net postdiagnosis costs were $136,413 and $62,326 for children and adolescents, respectively; the highest were for leukemia ($157,764 for children and $172,034 for adolescents). In both cohorts, costs were much higher for patients who died within 1 year of diagnosis. Inpatient hospitalization represented 69% to 74% of postdiagnosis costs. CONCLUSIONS: Treating children with cancer is costly, more costly than treating adolescents or adults. Substantial survival gains in children mean that treatment may still be very cost-effective. Comprehensive age-specific population-based cost estimates are essential to reliably assess the cost-effectiveness of cancer care for children and adolescents, and measure health system performance.","['Copyright (c) 2017 International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes', 'Research (ISPOR).

Here, we demonstrate that the ETO2-GLIS2 fusion oncoprotein, which is found in aggressive acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, confers megakaryocytic identity via the GLIS2 moiety while both ETO2 and GLIS2 domains are required to drive increased self-renewal properties. ETO2-GLIS2 directly binds DNA to control transcription of associated genes by upregulation of expression and interaction with the ETS-related ERG protein at enhancer elements. Importantly, specific interference with ETO2-GLIS2 oligomerization reverses the transcriptional activation at enhancers and promotes megakaryocytic differentiation, providing a relevant interface to target in this poor-prognosis pediatric leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional, analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Haematology Department, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi, from January 2012 to February 2014. METHODOLOGY: A total number of 87 patients of CML were studied. The diagnosis was made on the basis of clinical history, peripheral blood and bone marrow aspiration. These patients were tested for the presence of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene by RT-PCR and FISH. About 5 ml of venous blood was collected, half was taken in heparin for FISH and half in ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) for CBC and PCR. For FISH, cells were cultured for 24 hours in RPMI 1640 medium and evaluated using BX51 fluorescence microscope for dual fusion signal of yellow colour. Samples having 20 or more interphases positive for dual fusion signals were taken as positive. For PCR, RNA extraction was done by Tri-Reagent LS (MRC, USA) and cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase and gene specific primer. RT-PCR was done on ABI-7500. The positive samples were identified when fluorescence exceeded threshold limit. Results of RT-PCR and FISH were compared. RESULTS: Out of the 87 patients, 85 (97.7%) were PCR positive and 2 (2.3%) were PCR negative, whereas in FISH 83 (95.4%) were positive and 4 (4.5%) were negative. Sensitivity and specificity of FISH was 97.6% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: FISH is a reliable supplementary method to PCR for detection of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene in the diagnosis of CML.",,"['Ali, Javaid', 'Khan, Saleem Ahmed', 'Rauf, Shan -E-', 'Ayyub, Muhammad', 'Ali, Nadir', 'Afridi, Nabeel Khan']","['Ali J', 'Khan SA', 'Rauf S-', 'Ayyub M', 'Ali N', 'Afridi NK']","['Department of Pathology, Combined Military Hospital, Pano Aqil.', 'Department of Pathology, Army Medical College, Rawalpindi.', 'Department of Pathology, Combined Military Hospital, Thal, FATA.', 'Department of Pathology, Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi.', 'Department of Pathology, Combined Military Hospital, Peshawar.', 'Department of Pathology, Combined Military Hospital, Gilgit.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,IM,"['Adult', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,,2017/03/16 06:00,2017/12/30 06:00,['2017/03/16 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/30 06:00 [medline]']","['040579197 [pii]', '2516 [doi]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2017 Jan;27(1):26-29. doi: 2516.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes differentially methylated in the chemoresponsive pre-B-ALL compared to chemoresistant pre-B-ALL cases provide potential prognostic markers. METHODS: DNA methylation profiles of five B-ALL childhood patients who achieved morphological complete remission (chemoresponsive) and five B-ALL patients who did not (chemoresistant) after induction treatments as well as four normal controls were compared on 27 000 CpG sites microarray chips. Subsequently, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) on selected hypermethylated genes was conducted on an additional 37 chemoresponsive and 9 chemoresistant B-ALL samples and 2 normal controls. RESULTS: Both methods were found to be highly correlated. Unsupervised principal component analysis showed that the chemotherapy-responsive and -resistant B-ALL patients could be segregated from one another. Selection of segregated genes at high stringency identified two potential genes (CDH11 and ADAMTSL5). MSP analysis on the larger cohort of samples (42 chemoresponsive, 14 chemoresistant B-ALL samples and 6 normal controls) revealed significantly higher rates of hypermethylation in chemoresistant samples for ADAMTSL5 (93 vs. 38%; p = 0.0001) and CDH11 (79% vs. 40%, p < 0.01). All control cases remained unmethylated. CONCLUSION: Chemoresistant B-ALL patients are associated with increased methylation in ADAMTSL5 and CDH11.

The ethanolic extracts of BJK, its five individual plants, and pure constituents of BJK were investigated for their anti-allergic activity using immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized beta-hexosaminidase in the rat basophilic leukemia-2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells and anti-inflammatory activity using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in the murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. The ethanolic extracts of BJK showed anti-allergic activity (IC50=12.69mug/ml) and exhibited potent NO inhibitory effect (IC50=16.60mug/ml), but inactive on TNF-alpha release. Moreover, 6-shogaol and plumbagin, two pure compounds from BJK, showed higher anti-allergic activity than the ethanolic BJK extract with IC50 values of 0.28 and 4.03mug/ml, respectively.

Determination of the anti-inflammatory activity by measuring the inhibition of NO production presented that plumbagin and 6-shogaol exhibited higher than crude BJK extract with IC50 values of 0.002 and 0.92mug/ml, respectively. In particular, plumbagin also showed higher anti-inflammatory than prednisolone, positive control, with IC50 value of 0.59mug/ml. 6-Shogaol also showed inhibitory effect on TNF-alpha release (IC50=9.16mug/ml). These preliminary results may provide some scientific support for the use of BJK for the anti-allergic treatment and inflammatory disorders through the inhibition of NO production.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The durability of responses and long-term safety of this drug in patients with polycythaemia vera and essential thrombocythaemia have not been reported. Here, we present long-term efficacy and safety data from a single-centre, open-label, phase 2 trial, after a median of 83 months follow up. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years who were diagnosed with essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera according to 2001 WHO criteria were eligible to enrol in our study. The initial starting dose of pegylated interferon alfa-2a was 450 mug subcutaneously once per week, but was decreased in a stepwise manner due to toxic effects to a final starting dose of 90 mg per week: three patients were started at a dose of 450 mg per week, three at 360 mg per week, 19 at 270 mg per week, 26 at 180 mg per week, and 32 at 90 mg per week. Treatment was continued for as long as the patients derived clinical benefit with reductions in dose and frequency of administration allowed at the discretion of the treating physician. Haematological responses were assessed every 3-6 months on the basis of blood counts as defined by the European LeukemiaNet critieria. The primary endpoint of the initial study was the proportion of patients with a haematological response. Complete haematological response was defined as normalisation of blood counts (for patients with essential thrombocythaemia, platelets </=440 x 10(9) per L; for patients with polycythaemia vera, haemoglobin <15.0 g/L without phlebotomy) with complete resolution of palpable splenomegaly or symptoms in the absence of a thrombotic event. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics and in the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00452023 and is ongoing but not enrolling new patients. FINDINGS: Between May 21, 2005, and Dec 1, 2015, patients were followed up for a median of 83 months (IQR 69-94 months). Pegylated interferon alfa-2a induced haematological (66 [80%] of 83 patients) and molecular responses (35 [63%] of 55 patients) in 40 patients with essential thrombocythaemia and 43 patients with polycythaemia vera, with median durations of 66 months (IQR 35-83) and 53 months (24-70), respectively. 26 (39%) of 66 haematological responders and 25 (71%) of 35 molecular responders (with the JAK2 Val617Phe mutation) have maintained some response during follow-up: 49% maintained their best molecular response (nine of ten patients who had a complete response, five of 20 who had a partial response, and three of five who had a minor response). The incidence of major venous-thrombotic events during the study was 1.22 per 100 person-years. Overall, 18 (22%) of 83 patients discontinued therapy due to treatment-related toxicity. Although toxicity rates decreased over time, five patients had treatment-limiting grade 3 or 4 toxicities after 60 months on therapy. 32 patients are still enrolled on the study. INTERPRETATION: Pegylated interferon alfa-2a can induce durable haematological and molecular responses in patients with essential thrombocythaemia and polycythaemia vera. This drug alone and in combination with other drugs could be explored further in clinical trials. FUNDING: US National Cancer Institute.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In 2003, the Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project described a powerful biomarker-the proliferation signature-using gene expression in fresh frozen material. Herein, we describe the training and validation of a new assay that measures the proliferation signature in RNA derived from routinely available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsies. Methods Forty-seven FFPE biopsies were used to train an assay on the NanoString platform, using microarray gene expression data of matched fresh frozen biopsies as a gold standard. The locked assay was applied to pretreatment FFPE lymph node biopsies from an independent cohort of 110 patients uniformly treated with rituximab plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone. Seventeen biopsies were tested across three laboratories to assess assay reproducibility. Results The MCL35 assay, which contained a 17-gene proliferation signature, yielded gene expression of sufficient quality to assign an assay score and risk group in 108 (98%) of 110 archival FFPE biopsies. The MCL35 assay assigned patients to high-risk (26%), standard-risk (29%), and low-risk (45%) groups, with different lengths of overall survival (OS): a median of 1.1, 2.6, and 8.6 years, respectively (log-rank for trend, P < .001). In multivariable analysis, these risk groups and the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index were independently associated with OS ( P < .001 for both variables). Concordance of risk assignment across the three independent laboratories was 100%. Conclusion The newly developed and validated MCL35 assay for FFPE biopsies uses the proliferation signature to define groups of patients with significantly different OS independent of the Mantle Cell Lymphoma International Prognostic Index. Importantly, the analytic and clinical validity of this assay defines it as a reliable biomarker to support risk-adapted clinical trials.",,"['Scott, David W', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Wright, George W', 'Slack, Graham W', 'Mottok, Anja', 'Villa, Diego', 'Jares, Pedro', 'Rauert-Wunderlich, Hilka', 'Royo, Cristina', 'Clot, Guillem', 'Pinyol, Magda', 'Boyle, Merrill', 'Chan, Fong Chun', 'Braziel, Rita M', 'Chan, Wing C', 'Weisenburger, Dennis D', 'Cook, James R', 'Greiner, Timothy C', 'Fu, Kai', 'Ott, German', 'Delabie, Jan', 'Smeland, Erlend B', 'Holte, Harald', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Steidl, Christian', 'Connors, Joseph M', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Staudt, Louis M', 'Campo, Elias', 'Rimsza, Lisa M']","['Scott DW', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Wright GW', 'Slack GW', 'Mottok A', 'Villa D', 'Jares P', 'Rauert-Wunderlich H', 'Royo C', 'Clot G', 'Pinyol M', 'Boyle M', 'Chan FC', 'Braziel RM', 'Chan WC', 'Weisenburger DD', 'Cook JR', 'Greiner TC', 'Fu K', 'Ott G', 'Delabie J', 'Smeland EB', 'Holte H', 'Jaffe ES', 'Steidl C', 'Connors JM', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Rosenwald A', 'Staudt LM', 'Campo E', 'Rimsza LM']","[""David W.

Patients with lymphoma that is chemotherapy refractory or relapsed after autologous stem-cell transplantation have a grim prognosis, and new treatments for these patients are clearly needed. Chemotherapy administered before adoptive T-cell transfer has been shown to enhance the antimalignancy activity of adoptively transferred T cells. Patients and Methods We treated 22 patients with advanced-stage lymphoma in a clinical trial of CAR-19 T cells preceded by low-dose chemotherapy. Nineteen patients had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, two patients had follicular lymphoma, and one patient had mantle cell lymphoma. Patients received a single dose of CAR-19 T cells 2 days after a low-dose chemotherapy conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide plus fludarabine. Results The overall remission rate was 73% with 55% complete remissions and 18% partial remissions. Eleven of 12 complete remissions are ongoing. Fifty-five percent of patients had grade 3 or 4 neurologic toxicities that completely resolved. The low-dose chemotherapy conditioning regimen depleted blood lymphocytes and increased serum interleukin-15 (IL-15). Patients who achieved a remission had a median peak blood CAR(+) cell level of 98/muL and those who did not achieve a remission had a median peak blood CAR(+) cell level of 15/muL ( P = .027). High serum IL-15 levels were associated with high peak blood CAR(+) cell levels ( P = .001) and remissions of lymphoma ( P < .001). Conclusion CAR-19 T cells preceded by low-dose chemotherapy induced remission of advanced-stage lymphoma, and high serum IL-15 levels were associated with the effectiveness of this treatment regimen. CAR-19 T cells will likely become an important treatment for patients with relapsed lymphoma.",,"['Kochenderfer, James N', 'Somerville, Robert P T', 'Lu, Tangying', 'Shi, Victoria', 'Bot, Adrian', 'Rossi, John', 'Xue, Allen', 'Goff, Stephanie L', 'Yang, James C', 'Sherry, Richard M', 'Klebanoff, Christopher A', 'Kammula, Udai S', 'Sherman, Marika', 'Perez, Arianne', 'Yuan, Constance M', 'Feldman, Tatyana', 'Friedberg, Jonathan W', 'Roschewski, Mark J', 'Feldman, Steven A', 'McIntyre, Lori', 'Toomey, Mary Ann', 'Rosenberg, Steven A']","['Kochenderfer JN', 'Somerville RPT', 'Lu T', 'Shi V', 'Bot A', 'Rossi J', 'Xue A', 'Goff SL', 'Yang JC', 'Sherry RM', 'Klebanoff CA', 'Kammula US', 'Sherman M', 'Perez A', 'Yuan CM', 'Feldman T', 'Friedberg JW', 'Roschewski MJ', 'Feldman SA', 'McIntyre L', 'Toomey MA', 'Rosenberg SA']","['James N.

METHODS: Ophthalmic examination and investigation including fundus photography and fluorescein angiography. RESULTS: Three months after commencement of ATRA therapy, the patient was found to have florid bilateral NVD with adjacent preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages. Fundus fluorescein angiography was undertaken and NVD was confirmed in both eyes, which was significantly greater than expected for the extent of disease secondary to diabetic retinopathy. As a result of the fluorescein angiography findings, we believe ATRA-mediated upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor may be the etiology of the NVD. Literature review shows some in vitro studies, which describe ATRA-induced upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in ocular tissues. The patient was managed successfully by cessation of ATRA and a single intravitreal injection of bevacizumab in each eye. CONCLUSION: Acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with ATRA may result in upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor in retinal tissues. Subsequent development of NVD may occur; however, this resolves well by cessation of ATRA and intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. We recommend that all patients undergoing treatment with ATRA for acute promyelocytic leukemia be monitored by an ophthalmologist.",,"['Rocke, John R', 'Clark, J Ben', 'Campbell, Philip J', 'Kurniawan, Emil']","['Rocke JR', 'Clark JB', 'Campbell PJ', 'Kurniawan E']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Australia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Australia.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Geelong, Geelong, Australia.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Retin Cases Brief Rep,Retinal cases & brief reports,101298744,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Consolidation Chemotherapy/adverse effects', '*Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Retinal Neovascularization/*chemically induced', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",,,2017/03/16 06:00,2019/05/07 06:00,['2017/03/15 06:00'],"['2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/ICB.0000000000000560 [doi]'],ppublish,Retin Cases Brief Rep. 2019 Spring;13(2):189-193. doi: 10.1097/ICB.0000000000000560.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tricepyridinium had antimicrobial activity, but not against E. coli, and cytotoxicity against P388 cells.

Surface adhesion properties regulated by adhesion receptors and membrane tethers are critical in understanding cell rolling behavior. Locally, adhesion molecules are distributed at the tips of membrane tethers. However, how functional adhesion properties are globally distributed on the individual cell's surface is unknown. Here, we developed a label-free technique to determine the spatial distribution of adhesive properties on rolling cell surfaces. Using dark-field imaging and particle tracking, we extract the rotational motion of individual rolling cells. The rotational information allows us to construct an adhesion map along the contact circumference of a single cell. To complement this approach, we also developed a fluorescent adhesion footprint assay to record the molecular adhesion events from cell rolling. Applying the combination of the two methods on human promyelocytic leukemia cells, our results surprisingly reveal that adhesion is non-uniformly distributed in patches on the cell surfaces.

Two clinical studies (ADAGIO and Hammersmith) have proven a clear correlation between adherence and achieving optimal treatment response and have revealed that non-adherence is common in CML patients (Marin et al. in J Clin Oncol 28(24):2381-2388, 2010, Noens et al. in Haematologica 99(33):437-447, 2014). The aim of this study is to assess the extent of suboptimal adherence and to investigate motivations and behavioural patterns of adherence in a worldwide patient sample. Questionnaires were provided by the CML Advocates Network and were filled in by patients online and offline. Patient characteristics, treatment and motivations were collected. Adherence was assessed by the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence scale. Logistic regression models were fitted to investigate the influence of different factors on adherence. Overall, 2 546 questionnaires from 63 countries and 79 CML patient organisations were evaluable. 32.7% of participants were highly adherent, 46.5% were in the medium and 20.7% in the low adherence group. Factors increasing the probability of being in the high adherence group are older age, male sex, management of side effects, only one tablet per day and feeling well informed about CML by the doctor. More than 2 years since diagnosis were significantly lowering the chance as was the use of reminding tools. Living arrangements, multiple medication and personal payment obligations increased the probability to be at least in the medium adherent group. This is the most comprehensive study conducted to date to gain knowledge about factors causing non-adherence in CML. Better information on the disease, medication and management of side effects, supported by haematologists, is key to improve adherence.",,"['Geissler, Jan', 'Sharf, Giora', 'Bombaci, Felice', 'Daban, Mina', 'De Jong, Jan', 'Gavin, Tony', 'Pelouchova, Jana', 'Dziwinski, Euzebiusz', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Hoffmann, Verena Sophia']","['Geissler J', 'Sharf G', 'Bombaci F', 'Daban M', 'De Jong J', 'Gavin T', 'Pelouchova J', 'Dziwinski E', 'Hasford J', 'Hoffmann VS']","['Leukemia Patient Advocates Foundation, Bern, Switzerland. jan@cmladvocates.net.', 'LeukaNET e.V., Riemerling, Germany. jan@cmladvocates.net.', ', Munzgraben 6 P.O.B. 453, CH-3000, Bern, Switzerland. jan@cmladvocates.net.', 'Leukemia Patient Advocates Foundation, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Israeli CML Patients Organization, Netanya, Israel.', 'Gruppo AIL Pazienti Leucemia Mieloide Cronica, Rome, Italy.', 'LMC France, Marseille, France.', 'Stichting Hematon, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Leukaemia CARE, Worcester, UK.', 'Diagnoza CML, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Polish Nationwide Association for CML Patients Aid, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institute for Medical Information Sciences, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Information Sciences, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitaet, Munich, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Sex Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adherence patient motivations', 'Behavioural patterns of adherence', 'CML treatment adherence', 'Chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'Driving factors of nonadherence', 'Factors causing nonadherence', 'Haematology', 'Molecular response', 'Morisky Medication Adherence scale', 'Optimal adherence', 'Patient advocacy', 'Patient-driven survey', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2017/03/16 06:00,2017/09/19 06:00,['2017/03/15 06:00'],"['2017/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-017-2372-z [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-017-2372-z [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 Jul;143(7):1167-1176. doi: 10.1007/s00432-017-2372-z.

METHODS: Through a procedure based on a sequence of classical statistics methods, we investigated the possible relationships between treatment efficacy/tolerability and combinations of time-independent variables as gender and genetic covariates in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or combinations thereof. Moreover, since the drug tolerability has a strong incidence on the discontinuation of the therapy, we investigated whether the time of manifestation of the most frequent toxic effects can be related to time-independent patients' characteristics or not. RESULTS: We found that a combination of two polymorphisms, namely hOCT1 c.480C>G (rs683369) and ABCB1 c.3435C>T (rs1045642), seems to play the role of predictor for imatinib in both efficacy and toxicity. Furthermore, the time of manifestation of edema toxicity is found to be associated to a combination of gender and ABCB1 c.3435C>T, whereas the time of manifestation of cramp toxicity appears related to gender. CONCLUSIONS: The novelty of this study is dual: the achievement of results that potentially have a significant clinical interest and the demonstration that the adoption of composed covariates may represent a unique tool to study different aspects of the treatment with imatinib.",,"['Galeotti, Laura', 'Ceccherini, Francesco', 'Domingo, Dario', 'Laurino, Marco', 'Polillo, Marialuisa', 'Di Paolo, Antonello', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Fava, Carmen', ""D'Avolio, Antonio"", 'Cervetti, Giulia', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Fontanelli, Giulia', 'Ciabatti, Elena', 'Grassi, Susanna', 'Arrigoni, Elena', 'Danesi, Romano', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Cornolti, Fulvio', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Galimberti, Sara']","['Galeotti L', 'Ceccherini F', 'Domingo D', 'Laurino M', 'Polillo M', 'Di Paolo A', 'Barate C', 'Fava C', ""D'Avolio A"", 'Cervetti G', 'Guerrini F', 'Fontanelli G', 'Ciabatti E', 'Grassi S', 'Arrigoni E', 'Danesi R', 'Petrini M', 'Cornolti F', 'Saglio G', 'Galimberti S']","['Phymtech Srl, Via Giuntini 63, Navacchio, 56023, Pisa, Italy.', 'Phymtech Srl, Via Giuntini 63, Navacchio, 56023, Pisa, Italy.', 'Phymtech Srl, Via Giuntini 63, Navacchio, 56023, Pisa, Italy.', 'Phymtech Srl, Via Giuntini 63, Navacchio, 56023, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy. antonello.dipaolo@med.unipi.it.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Biological and Clinical Sciences, University of Torino, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 143 Orbassano, Turin, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacogenetics, Department of Medical Sciences, Unit of Infectious Diseases, University of Torino, Amedeo di Savoia Hospital, Turin, Italy.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.', 'Phymtech Srl, Via Giuntini 63, Navacchio, 56023, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Physics, University of Pisa, Largo Pontecorvo 3, 56127, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Biological and Clinical Sciences, University of Torino, San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Regione Gonzole 10, 143 Orbassano, Turin, Italy.', 'Section of Pharmacology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Via Roma 55, 56126, Pisa, Italy.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2661-6183'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Edema/chemically induced/genetics', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Cramp/chemically induced/genetics', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/*genetics', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Characteristics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ABCB1', '*Complete cytogenetic response', '*Factor analysis of mixed data', '*Imatinib', '*Tolerability', '*hOCT1']",2017/03/16 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/03/15 06:00'],"['2016/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3271-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3271-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Apr;79(4):767-773. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3271-3.

However, the rate and extent of clinical responses to approved therapies are limited and often nonexistent in many solid tumors. This is partially because immune checkpoint therapies are most effective against T-cell-inflamed tumors, and non-T-cell-inflamed or T-cell-excluded tumors remain a significant barrier. New strategies are needed to overcome immune resistance mechanisms that arise during tumor development, which result in T-cell exclusion. Approaches may need to be combined with conventional therapies such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and molecularly targeted therapy, and many clinical trials are ongoing. This review discusses the challenge of T-cell exclusion and innate oncologic pathways that contribute to this problem, including beta-catenin, STAT3, NF-kappaB, PTEN, and AXL tyrosine kinase. The GAS6/AXL pathway is of interest immunologically, as its targeting can lead to greater antitumor immune responses after radiotherapy. In addition, several targeted therapies that are selective and nonselective for AXL are in preclinical and clinical development in acute myelogenous leukemia and renal cell cancer. There remains much to learn, but the future is bright for anti-AXL therapies, though effective combinations and their impact may not be realized for years to come. Clin Cancer Res; 23(12); 2928-33.

However, recent data have suggested that PMNs, like macrophages, can also mediate trogocytosis. We have performed experiments to more precisely investigate this point and to discriminate between trogocytosis and phagocytosis. In live-cell time-lapse microscopy experiments, we could not detect any significant phagocytosis by purified PMNs of anti-CD20-opsonized CLL B cells, but could detect only the repeated close contact between effectors and targets, which suggested trogocytosis. Similarly, in flow cytometry assays using CLL B-cell targets labeled with the membrane dye PKH67 and opsonized with rituximab or obinutuzumab, we observed that a mean of 50% and 75% of PMNs had taken a fraction of the dye from CLL B cells at 3 and 20 hours, respectively, with no significant decrease in absolute live or total CLL B-cell numbers, confirming that trogocytosis occurs, rather than phagocytosis. Trogocytosis was accompanied by loss of membrane CD20 from CLL B cells, which was evident with rituximab but not obinutuzumab. We conclude that PMNs mediate mostly trogocytosis rather than phagocytosis of anti-CD20-opsonized CLL B cells, and we discuss the implications of this finding in patients with CLL treated with rituximab or obinutuzumab in vivo.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Valgardsdottir, Rut', 'Cattaneo, Irene', 'Klein, Christian', 'Introna, Martino', 'Figliuzzi, Marina', 'Golay, Josee']","['Valgardsdottir R', 'Cattaneo I', 'Klein C', 'Introna M', 'Figliuzzi M', 'Golay J']","['Center of Cellular Therapy G.

Thus, we sought to assess patient and physician agreement on patient-reported quality of life (QoL), and whether patient-related variables predict disagreement. In this cross-sectional, multisite study, patients and physicians completed the FACT-BMT at day 90. Agreement was analyzed with the intraclass coefficient correlation (ICC). Rates of underestimation and overestimation were calculated. Logistic regression models identified predictors of disagreement. We analyzed 96 pairs of questionnaires completed by 96 patients and 11 physicians. The patients' median age was 54 years, 52% were men, and 52% had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). The physicians' median age was 42, 64% were men, and they had worked in the HCT field for an average of 12 years. Agreement on QoL was moderate (ICC = .436). Exploratory analyses revealed poor agreement for emotional (ICC = .092) and social (ICC = .270) well-being and moderate agreement for physical (ICC = .457), functional (ICC = .451), and BMT concerns (ICC = .445). Patients' well-being was underestimated by physicians in 41% to 59% of the categories of well-being parameters, and overestimated in 10% to 24%. Patient's anxiety predicted less disagreement in all scales except in social well-being, for which nonsignificant associations were observed. Patient-related variables explained 12% to 19% of the variance in disagreement across well-being scales. Patient and physician agreement on QoL was suboptimal, particularly in emotional and social well-being. The implementation of patient-reported outcomes in the daily care of HCT recipients may contribute to improving patient-centered care.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute treatment-related leukemia (t-AML) associated with TMZ chemotherapy for patients with glioma is quite a rare complication. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 43-year-old man with an anaplastic astrocytoma received radiation therapy synchronized with ranimustine and adjuvant TMZ chemotherapy for 15 cycles. Close follow-up magnetic resonance imaging of the head during TMZ chemotherapy showed no evidence of tumor progression. One year after the completion of TMZ chemotherapy, a bone-marrow aspiration was performed because the patient's white blood cell count decreased. He was diagnosed with t-AML based on the bone marrow examination, and then he was referred to the cancer center for the treatment of t-AML. CONCLUSIONS: In this case study, we continued adjuvant TMZ therapy beyond the recommended 6 cycles. Currently, there is no consensus as to how long the adjuvant TMZ therapy should be continued for the treatment of residual tumor showing no apparent interval change. A new decision-making tool to assess the clinical benefits against the side effects for long-term adjuvant TMZ therapy is needed.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Understanding the laboratory and patient characteristics that increase risk of PHK is key to preventing diagnostic errors. METHODS: Serum/plasma potassium results collected at 2 laboratories over 4years were selected based on blood cell counts collected within 24h and whole blood potassium concentrations determined within 2h of the serum/plasma sample. Differences between whole blood and serum or plasma potassium were compared as functions of platelet or leukocyte count, fit to linear models, and stratified based on leukemia diagnosis codes. Patients having a serum/plasma potassium concentration that was at least 1mEq/mL higher than the whole blood concentration were defined as having PHK. Based on this analysis, high-risk patients were prospectively identified and PHK risk was communicated to providers. Medication administration records were queried to compare rates of kayexalate use pre- and post-intervention. RESULTS: Approximately 14% of serum samples with platelet counts >500x10(9)/L had a>1mEq/L increase relative to whole blood potassium. >25% of serum and plasma samples showed a>1mEq/L increase relative to whole blood potassium when leukocyte counts were >50x10(9)/L. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and high WBC count demonstrated the highest rates of PHK. The rate of kayexalate administration prior to confirmatory testing decreased from 37% to 16% after the laboratory started verbally communicating the possibility of PHK to treating providers. CONCLUSIONS: According to our data, a leukocyte count threshold for plasma samples of 50x10(9)/L is appropriate for indicating a high risk of PHK. Direct communication by the laboratory to the care team reduces inappropriate potassium lowering treatment in populations at high risk.",['Copyright (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this article is to review the current evidence of the benefits of breastfeeding for children and society, and to elaborate the risks associated with the replacement of lactation with baby formulas. Breastfeeding is a protective factor for several infectious, atopic, and cardiovascular diseases as well as for leukaemia, necrotising enterocolitis, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. It also has a positive impact on neurodevelopment, improving IQ and reducing the risk of attention deficit disorder, and generalised developmental and behavioural disorders. Lactation can decrease the risk of sudden infant deaths syndrome by 36% and prevent 13% of infant mortality worldwide. Breastfeeding result in direct saving on the use of infant formulas and bottles, and indirectly on associated health costs, premature deaths, and quality-adjusted life years, among others. In addition, breastfeeding is environmentally friendly; it does not leave an ecological footprint in its production and consumption. The use of baby formulas and bottles have inherent risks, because they increase the risk of oral diseases, such as mouth breathing, malocclusion, alteration of bite, and tooth decay.

However, information concerning its up- and downstream regulation is rare. We investigated its upstream regulation and downstream effector in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In total, 94 paired HCC and adjacent tissue samples were involved in the study, and the results indicated that decreased miR-30e levels were associated with increased MTA1 levels in human HCC. miR-30e exerted its regulation of MTA1 transcription by binding to its 3'-untranslated region, and was negatively associated with EMT. Furthermore, significantly higher expression of MTA1 was associated with overexpression of v-erb-b2 avian erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2) in human HCC, and MTA1 can promote transcription of ErbB2 by binding with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and acting as a promoter. The EMT promotion effect caused by MTA1 largely depended on ErbB2, and reducing the activity of ErbB2 can significantly attenuate EMT promotion by causing overexpression of MTA1 both in vitro and in vivo. In general, downregulation of miR-30e can increase levels of MTA1 in human HCC, and furthermore promote cell invasion and metastasis by promoting ErbB2.",,"['Deng, L', 'Tang, J', 'Yang, H', 'Cheng, C', 'Lu, S', 'Jiang, R', 'Sun, B']","['Deng L', 'Tang J', 'Yang H', 'Cheng C', 'Lu S', 'Jiang R', 'Sun B']","['Key Laboratory on Living Donor Liver Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Department of Liver Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory on Living Donor Liver Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Department of Liver Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Immunology, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory on Living Donor Liver Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Department of Liver Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Key Laboratory on Living Donor Liver Transplantation, Ministry of Health, Department of Liver Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/genetics/*pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Trans-Activators']",,,2017/03/14 06:00,2017/09/30 06:00,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2016/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/30 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016491 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.491 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Jul 13;36(28):3976-3985. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.491.

Additionally, a de novo c.1066G>A (p.Ala356Thr) variant was identified in a sixth individual (family 4). We overexpressed the mutant constructs in HEK 293T cells and observed increased tyrosine phosphorylation, suggesting increased ABL1 kinase activities associated with both the p.Tyr245Cys and p.Ala356Thr substitutions.

Coffee consumption is not associated with overall cancer risk. A meta-analysis reported a pooled relative risk (RR) for an increment of 1 cup of coffee/day of 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-1.01] for all cancers. Coffee drinking is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. A meta-analysis of cohort studies found an RR for an increment of consumption of 1 cup/day of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81-0.90) for liver cancer and a favorable effect on liver enzymes and cirrhosis. Another meta-analysis showed an inverse relation for endometrial cancer risk, with an RR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96) for an increment of 1 cup/day. A possible decreased risk was found in some studies for oral/pharyngeal cancer and for advanced prostate cancer. Although data are mixed, overall, there seems to be some favorable effect of coffee drinking on colorectal cancer in case-control studies, in the absence of a consistent relation in cohort studies. For bladder cancer, the results are not consistent; however, any possible direct association is not dose and duration related, and might depend on a residual confounding effect of smoking. A few studies suggest an increased risk of childhood leukemia after maternal coffee drinking during pregnancy, but data are limited and inconsistent. Although the results of studies are mixed, the overall evidence suggests no association of coffee intake with cancers of the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, and prostate overall. Data are limited, with RR close to unity for other neoplasms, including those of the esophagus, small intestine, gallbladder and biliary tract, skin, kidney, brain, thyroid, as well as for soft tissue sarcoma and lymphohematopoietic cancer.",,"['Alicandro, Gianfranco', 'Tavani, Alessandra', 'La Vecchia, Carlo']","['Alicandro G', 'Tavani A', 'La Vecchia C']","[""aDepartment of Clinical Sciences and Community Health, University of Milan bDepartment of Epidemiology, IRCCS - Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche 'Mario Negri', Milan, Italy.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,IM,"['Antioxidants/physiology', 'Coffee/*adverse effects/chemistry/physiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Risk Factors']",,,2017/03/14 06:00,2018/05/01 06:00,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000341 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2017 Sep;26(5):424-432. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000341.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Coffee)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CDC25 inhibition is regarded as a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We investigated the in vitro effects of CDC25 inhibitors on primary human AML cells derived from 79 unselected patients in suspension cultures. Both the previously well-characterized CDC25 inhibitor NSC95397, as well as five other inhibitors (BN82002 and the novel small molecular compounds ALX1, ALX2, ALX3, and ALX4), only exhibited antiproliferative effects for a subset of patients when tested alone. These antiproliferative effects showed associations with differences in genetic abnormalities and/or AML cell differentiation. However, the responders to CDC25 inhibition could be identified by analysis of global gene expression profiles. The differentially expressed genes were associated with the cytoskeleton, microtubules, and cell signaling. The constitutive release of 28 soluble mediators showed a wide variation among patients and this variation was maintained in the presence of CDC25 inhibition. Finally, NSC95397 had no or only minimal effects on AML cell viability. In conclusion, CDC25 inhibition has antiproliferative effects on primary human AML cells for a subset of patients, and these patients can be identified by gene expression profiling.",,"['Brenner, Annette K', 'Reikvam, Hakon', 'Rye, Kristin Paulsen', 'Hagen, Karen Marie', 'Lavecchia, Antonio', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Reikvam H', 'Rye KP', 'Hagen KM', 'Lavecchia A', 'Bruserud O']","['Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Bergen, Bergen 5021, Norway. annette.brenner@uib.no.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen 5021, Norway.

The spread of ALV-J mainly depends on congenital infection and horizontal contact. Although ALV-J infection causes enormous losses yearly in the poultry industry worldwide, effective measures to control ALV-J remain lacking. In this study, we demonstrated that Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen polysaccharide (TPPPS), a natural polysaccharide extracted from Taishan Pinus massoniana pollen, can significantly inhibit ALV-J replication in vitro by blocking viral adsorption to host cells. Electron microscopy and blocking ELISA tests revealed that TPPPS possibly blocks viral adsorption to host cells by interacting with the glycoprotein 85 protein of ALV-J. Furthermore, we artificially established a congenitally ALV-J-infected chicken model to examine the anti-viral effects of TPPPS in vivo. TPPPS significantly inhibited viral shedding and viral loads in immune organs and largely eliminated the immunosuppression caused by congenital ALV-J infection. Additionally, pre-administration of TPPPS obviously reduced the size and delayed the occurrence of tumors induced by acute oncogenic ALV-J infection.

The objective of this analysis was to assess healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with AEs, previously identified using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) in another study, among TKI-treated patients. METHODS: Adult patients with >/=1 inpatient or >/=2 outpatient ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for CML and >/=1 claim for a TKI treatment between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2012 were identified from the Commercial and Medicare MarketScan databases. The first claim for a TKI was designated as the index event. Patients were required to have no TKI treatment during a 12-month baseline period. Healthcare resource utilization and costs associated with select AEs having the strongest association with TKI treatment (femoral arterial stenosis [FAS], peripheral arterial occlusive disease [PAOD], intermittent claudication, coronary artery stenosis [CAS], pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, malignant pleural effusion, conjunctival hemorrhage) were evaluated during a 12-month follow-up period. RESULTS: The study sample included 2,005 CML patients receiving TKI therapy (mean age = 56 years; 56% male). Among all evaluated AEs, the highest mean inpatient healthcare costs were observed for FAS ($16,800 per patient) and PAOD ($14,263 per patient), which had total mean medical costs (inpatient + outpatient) of $17,015 and $15,154 per patient, respectively. Mean outpatient healthcare costs were highest for CAS ($1,861 per patient), followed by intermittent claudication ($947 per patient), PAOD ($891 per patient), and pleural effusion ($890 per patient). Total mean medical costs for fluid retention-related AEs, including pericardial effusion and pleural effusion, were $2,797 and $1,908 per patient, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare costs of AEs identified in the FAERS as having the strongest association with TKI treatment are substantial.

The recent introduction of generic imatinib presents an opportunity to lower pharmacy costs within a population that is growing due to improved survival. Recent literature has focused on the likely benefits to payers of step therapy through generic imatinib. Areas covered: This review provides a perspective that is broader than the evaluation of financial savings or narrowly defined health economic metrics by incorporating factors such as CML patient heterogeneity, including varying levels of disease progression risk, comorbidities and genetic mutation status, differences in TKI product profiles, clinical guideline recommendations, and the importance of individualized patient care.

However, a minority of patients fail to achieve optimal response due to impaired bioavailability of IM. The human organic cation transporter 1 (OCT1; SLC22A1) has been reported to be the main influx transporter involved in IM uptake into CML cells. Genetic variants and/or hOCT1 expression changes may influence IM response. In this study, we aimed to investigate the impact of both hOCT1 polymorphisms located in exon 7 and hOCT1 mRNA levels on the clinical outcome in CML patients. METHODS: hOCT1 expression profile was determined using the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 69 CML patients treated with IM (35 responders to IM patients and 34 IM-resistant patients), while genotyping of 69 cases and 51 controls for hOCT1 polymorphisms was performed by direct sequencing after amplification of exon7. RESULTS: Our results showed that the hOCT1 gene was significantly downregulated in the samples of the IM-resistant group when compared with the IM-responder group (p = 0.0211). Moreover, sequencing data show an association in all cases between the SNP 408V>M (g.1222G>A) and an intronic 8 bp (base pairs) insertion of GTAAGTTG (rs36056065) at the 3' end of exon 7. The genotype and allele distribution of the different SNPs did not differ significantly between the two groups of patients. CONCLUSIONS: hOCT1 mRNA expression may serve as a clinical biomarker of response to imatinib and could be useful to predict IM therapy outcome of CML patients.",,"['Ben Hassine, Islem', 'Gharbi, Hanene', 'Soltani, Ismail', 'Teber, Mouheb', 'Farrah, Ahlem', 'Ben Hadj Othman, Hind', 'Amouri, Hassiba', 'Bellaaj, Hatem', 'Lakhal, Rayhane Ben', 'Romdhane, Neila Ben', 'Abbes, Salem', 'Menif, Samia']","['Ben Hassine I', 'Gharbi H', 'Soltani I', 'Teber M', 'Farrah A', 'Ben Hadj Othman H', 'Amouri H', 'Bellaaj H', 'Lakhal RB', 'Romdhane NB', 'Abbes S', 'Menif S']","['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia. benhassine.islem@gmail.com.', ', 13 Place Pasteur, BP 74, 1002, Belvedere, Tunisia. benhassine.islem@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de medicine de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de medicine de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de medicine de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.', 'Faculte de medicine de Tunis, Tunis, Tunisia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tunisia', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Expression', '*Imatinib mesylate', '*Polymorphisms', '*Resistance', '*hOCT1']",2017/03/14 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2016/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3266-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3266-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Apr;79(4):737-745. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3266-0.

The outlook is particularly gloomy for patients with relapsed and/or refractory disease (cure rates no higher than 10%). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), the only realistic hope of cure for these patients, is an option for only a minority. In recent years, much has been learned about the genomic and epigenomic landscapes of AML, and the clonal architecture of both de novo and secondary AML has begun to be unraveled. These advances have paved the way for rational drug development as new ""drugable"" targets have emerged. Although no new drug has been approved for AML in over four decades, with the exception of gemtuzumab ozogamycin, which was subsequently withdrawn, there is progress on the horizon with the possible regulatory approval soon of agents such as CPX-351 and midostaurin, the Food and Drug Administration ""breakthrough"" designation granted to venetoclax, and promising agents such as the IDH inhibitors AG-221 and AG-120, the smoothened inhibitor glasdegib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor pracinostat. In our practice, we treat most patients with relapsed/refractory AML on clinical trials, taking into consideration their prior treatment history and response to the same. We utilize targeted sequencing of genes frequently mutated in AML to identify ""actionable"" mutations, e.g., in FLT3 or IDH1/2, and incorporate small-molecule inhibitors of these oncogenic kinases into our therapeutic regimens whenever possible. In the absence of actionable mutations, we rationally combine conventional agents with other novel therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and other targeted drugs. For fit patients up to the age of 65, we often use high-dose cytarabine-containing backbone regimens. For older or unfit patients, we prefer hypomethylating agent-based therapy. Finally, all patients with relapsed/refractory AML are evaluated for allogeneic HSCT.",,"['Bose, Prithviraj', 'Vachhani, Pankit', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Bose P', 'Vachhani P', 'Cortes JE']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Blvd, FC4.3062, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1400 Holcombe Blvd, FC4.3062, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology/mortality/*pathology/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Antibody-drug conjugates', '*Epigenetic therapy', '*FLT3 inhibitors', '*IDH inhibitors', '*Targeted therapy']",2017/03/14 06:00,2017/08/16 06:00,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-017-0456-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-017-0456-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2017 Mar;18(3):17. doi: 10.1007/s11864-017-0456-2.,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A myriad of variables contribute to the lack of clear clinical guidance. First, the disease course is slow and treatment may not be required for years, requiring a long follow-up to prospectively study. Second, due to the long lag time from study initiation to conclusion, many of the induction therapies used at the onset of the study may not be favored at present, providing a conclusion that cannot be reconciled with current clinical practice. For example, bendamustine and rituximab are typically the favored initial treatment agents in follicular lymphoma, which was not true when many maintenance trials were initiated. Third, several studies' inclusion criteria allow for patient enrollment at both initial diagnosis as well as at disease recurrence. In some studies, patients who are asymptomatic are started on therapy, counter to the accepted watch and wait approach. This contributes to the difficulty of generalizing results. The question of the benefit of maintenance therapy has been studied enough, and there may not be a smoking gun in the foreseeable future. However, what does hold promise is focusing on the patients with minimum residual disease after conclusion of chemotherapy. This may be a population that could receive benefit from a prolonged treatment approach. In the meantime, maintenance therapy should not be used in all patients, and the rationale for use should be data-driven, as well as an assessment of a patient's potential intolerability of cytotoxic chemotherapy.",,"['Tees, Michael T', 'Flinn, Ian W']","['Tees MT', 'Flinn IW']","['Colorado Blood Cancer Institute, 1721 E 19th Avenue, Suite 300, Denver, CO, 80218, USA.

However, individually distinctive responsiveness to the GC therapy may attenuate their clinical efficacy, and more reliable predictor for GC resistance is still eagerly needed. Recent studies indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs), which demonstrate regulatory functions targeting mRNAs during the post-transcription, involved in the regulation of GCs sensitivity through several mechanisms, especially adjusting the magnitude of GC receptors (GRs), which mediates the cellular effects of GCs and plays a pivotal role in GCs sensitivity, inspiring that special miRNAs pattern could serve as the biomarkers to predict GC sensitivity and bring forth potential strategies for overcoming drug resistance. In this review, we discuss related miRNAs and their diverse effects exerted on multifaceted complexity of GCs responsiveness for further exploiting the molecular mechanism of GC resistance and future construction of the molecular diagnostic method and reverse GC resistance. METHODS: We have reviewed and searched for eligible literature relating to the effects of microRNAs on GC responsiveness from systematic PubMed searches. RESULTS: GC response can be mediated by miRNAs through influence on GC signaling pathway, leading to diverse glucocorticoid responsiveness. Mutations in miRNA gene also influence GC response. As well, GCs regulate the function of several miRNAs, and suggesting a bidirectional influence among them.

Dysfunction of epigenetic modifiers contributes significantly to the pathogenesis of AML. One frequently mutated gene involved in epigenetic modification is DNMT3A (DNA methyltransferase-3-alpha), a DNA methyltransferase that alters gene expression by de novo methylation of cytosine bases at CpG dinucleotides. Approximately 22% of AML and 36% of cytogenetically normal AML cases carry DNMT3A mutations and around 60% of these mutations affect the R882 codon. These mutations have been associated with poor prognosis and adverse survival outcomes for AML patients. Advances in whole-exome sequencing techniques have recently identified a large number of DNMT3A mutations present in clonal cells in normal elderly individuals with no features of haematological malignancy. Categorically distinct from other preleukaemic conditions, this disorder has been termed clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Further insight into the mutational landscape of CHIP may illustrate the consequence of particular mutations found in DNMT3A and identify specific ""founder"" mutations responsible for clonal expansion that may contribute to leukaemogenesis.

The primary aim of this single-institution study was to compare the results of our adult ALL patients that had been allografted with those reported in the current literature. Subjects and Methods: This study included 53 consecutive adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) with myeloablative (92%) and reduced-intensity (8%) conditioning between 1993 and 2011. Results: Mean patient age was 27 years (SD:8.62) and donor age was 33.7 years (SD:9.47). Fourteen patients were in first remission; 21 in >/=2nd remission, 15 in relapse and 3 had primary refractory leukemia. Thirty-four, 15 and 4 patients received busulfan plus cyclophosphamide, cyclophosphamide/total body irradiation and fludarabine-based regimens, respectively. For graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, cyclosporine plus methotrexate were used. Forty-six donors were related and 7 were unrelated. Thirty patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood and 23 received bone marrow as stem cell source. Twenty-six patients relapsed at a mean duration of 11.3 months (SD:19.1). Forty-four patients succumbed to their disease after a mean follow-up of 13.6 months (SD:19.5). The cause of mortality was relapse (n=24; 54.5%) and transplant-related etiologies (n=20; 45.5%).

Unresponsiveness to TKIs limits therapeutic options, making allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) the only option leading to molecular remission. The aim of this study is to characterize CML patients unresponsive to first- and/or second-generation TKI therapy who underwent HSCT and to describe the main factors associated with treatment failure. Subjects and Methods: Twenty one CML patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT and had previously used first- and/or second-generation TKIs from January 2005 to May 2014. Results: Of the 21 patients, 52.4% were male, with a median age of 49 years (23-65 years) and 85.7% had chronic phase CML at the time of diagnosis; 28.6% showed inadequate treatment adherence to TKI therapy. Thirteen patients were resistant and eight were intolerant to TKIs; additionally, nine did not have T315I mutation. Ten transplantations involved related donors, and more than a half of patients (11) died, three of which due to graft failure. Most patients who survived transplantation were in the chronic phase of disease at the time of HSCT. Conclusion: The population was composed mainly of young age patients at diagnosis, male, white, and coming from areas in the state of Rio Grande do Sul other than Porto Alegre and metropolitan region.

Both active and passive cancer immunotherapies exploit the fact that tumor cells express specific antigens on the cell surface, thereby mounting an immune response specifically against malignant cells. It is well established that cancer cells typically lose surface antigens following natural or therapy-induced selective pressure and these antigen-loss variants are often the population that causes therapy-resistant relapse. CD19 and CD20 antigen loss in acute lymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, respectively, and lineage switching in leukemia associated with mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene rearrangements are well-documented evidences in this regard. Although increasing number of novel immunotherapies are being developed, majority of these do not address the control of antigen loss variants. Here, we review the occurrence of antigen loss variants in leukemia and discuss the therapeutic strategies to tackle the same. We also present an approach of dual-targeting immunoligand effectively retargeting NK cells against antigen loss variants in MLL-associated leukemia.

L.,38,10.1186/s12935-017-0404-z [doi],"BACKGROUND: The incidence and mortalities from cancers remain on the rise worldwide. Despite significant efforts to discover and develop novel anticancer agents, many cancers remain in the unmet need category. As such, efforts to discover and develop new and more effective and less toxic agents against cancer remain a top global priority. Our drug discovery approach is natural products based with a focus on plants. Tillandsia recurvata (L.) L. is one of the plants selected by our research team for further studies based on previous bioactivity findings on the anticancer activity of this plant. METHODS: The plant biomass was extracted using supercritical fluid extraction technology with CO2 as the mobile phase. Bioactivity guided isolation was achieved by use of chromatographic technics combined with anti-proliferative assays to determine the active fraction and subsequently the pure compound. Following in house screening, the identified molecule was submitted to the US National Cancer Institute for screening on the NCI60 cell line panel using standard protocols. Effect of HLBT-100 on apoptosis, caspase 3/7, cell cycle and DNA fragmentation were assessed using standard protocols. Antiangiogenic activity was carried out using the ex vivo rat aortic ring assay. RESULTS: A flavonoid of the flavanone class was isolated from T. recurvata (L.) L. with potent anticancer activity. The molecule was code named as HLBT-100 (also referred to as HLBT-001). The compound inhibited brain cancer (U87 MG), breast cancer (MDA-MB231), leukemia (MV4-11), melanoma (A375), and neuroblastoma (IMR-32) with IC50 concentrations of 0.054, 0.030, 0.024, 0.003 and 0.05 microM, respectively. The molecule also exhibited broad anticancer activity in the NCI60 panel inhibiting especially hematological, colon, CNS, melanoma, ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Twenty-three of the NCI60 cell lines were inhibited with GI50 values <0.100 microM. In terms of potential mechanisms of action, the molecule demonstrated effect on the cell cycle as evidenced by the accumulation of cells with <G1 DNA content, activation of caspase 3/7, DNA fragmentation and culminating in apoptotic cell death. HLBT-100 also demonstrated antiangiogenic potential by inhibiting capillary sprout and tube formation in a dose dependent manner in the ex vivo rat aortic ring. CONCLUSION: This paper describes for the first time the anticancer activity of HLBT-100 isolated from T. recurvate (L.) L. The broad and selective anticancer activity of HLBT-100 as evidenced by its potent activity against IMR-32, CNS cancer cell line while not active against neuro-2a, a normal CNS cell line. The activity demonstrated by HLBT-100 in these studies makes the molecule a potential candidate for further development targeting especially those cancers that remain in the unmet need category such as glioblastoma multiforme and acute myeloid leukemia in addition to other cancers.",,"['Lowe, Henry I C', 'Toyang, Ngeh J', 'Watson, Charah T', 'Ayeah, Kenneth N', 'Bryant, Joseph']","['Lowe HIC', 'Toyang NJ', 'Watson CT', 'Ayeah KN', 'Bryant J']","['Bio-Tech R&D Institute, University of the West Indies, 6 St. Johns Close, Mona, Jamaica.0000 0001 2322 4996grid.12916.3d', 'Educational & Scientific LLC, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD USA.0000 0001 2175 4264grid.411024.2', 'Educational & Scientific LLC, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD USA.0000 0001 2175 4264grid.411024.2', 'Bio-Tech R&D Institute, University of the West Indies, 6 St. Johns Close, Mona, Jamaica.0000 0001 2322 4996grid.12916.3d', 'Educational & Scientific LLC, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD 21201 USA.', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD USA.0000 0001 2175 4264grid.411024.2', 'Institute of Human Virology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 725 W Lombard St, Baltimore, MD USA.0000 0001 2175 4264grid.411024.2']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Angiogenesis', 'Anticancer', 'Ball Moss', 'Flavanone', 'Tillandsia recurvata']",2017/03/14 06:00,2017/03/14 06:01,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2016/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-017-0404-z [doi]', '404 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2017 Mar 7;17:38. doi: 10.1186/s12935-017-0404-z. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5341182,,20170307,,,,,,,,,,,

LEE011 is a novel inhibitor of both CDK4 and 6. To date, the molecular function of LEE011 in leukemia remains unclear. METHODS: Leukemia cell growth and apoptosis following LEE011 treatment was assessed through CCK-8 and annexin V/propidium iodide staining assays. Cell senescence was assessed by beta-galactosidase staining and p16(INK4a) expression analysis. Gene expression profiles of LEE011 treated HL-60 cells were investigated using an Arraystar Human LncRNA array. Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analysis were then used to analyze the differentially expressed genes from the cluster analysis. RESULTS: Our studies demonstrated that LEE011 inhibited proliferation of leukemia cells and could induce apoptosis. Hoechst 33,342 staining analysis showed DNA fragmentation and distortion of nuclear structures following LEE011 treatment. Cell cycle analysis showed LEE011 significantly induced cell cycle G1 arrest in seven of eight acute leukemia cells lines, the exception being THP-1 cells. beta-Galactosidase staining analysis and p16(INK4a) expression analysis showed that LEE011 treatment can induce cell senescence of leukemia cells. LncRNA microarray analysis showed 2083 differentially expressed mRNAs and 3224 differentially expressed lncRNAs in LEE011-treated HL-60 cells compared with controls. Molecular function analysis showed that LEE011 induced senescence in leukemia cells partially through downregulation of the transcriptional expression of MYBL2. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate for the first time that LEE011 treatment results in inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of G1 arrest and cellular senescence in leukemia cells. LncRNA microarray analysis showed differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in LEE011-treated HL-60 cells and we demonstrated that LEE011 induces cellular senescence partially through downregulation of the expression of MYBL2. These results may open new lines of investigation regarding the molecular mechanism of LEE011 induced cellular senescence.",,"['Tao, Yan-Fang', 'Wang, Na-Na', 'Xu, Li-Xiao', 'Li, Zhi-Heng', 'Li, Xiao-Lu', 'Xu, Yun-Yun', 'Fang, Fang', 'Li, Mei', 'Qian, Guang-Hui', 'Li, Yan-Hong', 'Li, Yi-Ping', 'Wu, Yi', 'Ren, Jun-Li', 'Du, Wei-Wei', 'Lu, Jun', 'Feng, Xing', 'Wang, Jian', 'He, Wei-Qi', 'Hu, Shao-Yan', 'Pan, Jian']","['Tao YF', 'Wang NN', 'Xu LX', 'Li ZH', 'Li XL', 'Xu YY', 'Fang F', 'Li M', 'Qian GH', 'Li YH', 'Li YP', 'Wu Y', 'Ren JL', 'Du WW', 'Lu J', 'Feng X', 'Wang J', 'He WQ', 'Hu SY', 'Pan J']","[""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", 'CAM-SU Genomic Resource Center, Soochow University, Suzhou, China.0000 0001 0198 0694grid.263761.7', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7"", ""Institute of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.grid.452253.7""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0292-5141'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Arraystar Human LncRNA array', 'CDK4/6', 'Cellular senescence', 'LEE011', 'Leukemia']",2017/03/14 06:00,2017/03/14 06:01,['2017/03/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-017-0405-y [doi]', '405 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2017 Mar 6;17:35. doi: 10.1186/s12935-017-0405-y. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5340031,,20170306,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for various feline infectious agents, including feline vector-borne pathogens (FVBP), in cats from Cyprus. METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive, multicentre study was performed on 174 feline samples [138 owned and 36 shelter-feral, including both healthy (43) and non-healthy (131), cats] from private veterinary clinics from all six districts of Cyprus. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were used to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" (CMhm) and ""Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis"" (CMt). The population was tested for four FVBP including Bartonella henselae and Leishmania spp. using qPCR, while conventional PCR assays were used to detect Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Serological assays were performed to detect Leishmania infantum antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed to test associations and possible risk factors between variables and infectious agents. RESULTS: Ninety-six (55.2%) of the 174 cats were PCR-positive for at least one infectious agent. Forty-six cats (26.4%) were haemoplasma positive, including 13 (7.5%) for Mhf, 36 (20.7%) for CMhm and 12 (6.9%) for CMt. Sixty-six cats (37.9%) were positive for Hepatozoon spp., while 19 (10.9%) were positive for B. henselae, four (2.3%) for Leishmania spp. and one (0.6%) for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. Sequencing revealed the presence of Hepatozoon felis, L. infantum and Anaplasma platys. Of the 164 cats that underwent retroviral serology, 10 (6.1%) were FeLV-positive and 31 (18.9%) were FIV-positive, while L. infantum serology was positive in 7 (4.4%) of the 160 cats tested. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significant associations for various infectious agents including L. infantum with each of Hepatozoon spp. and CMt infection. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of infectious agents was found in cats from Cyprus with Mhf, CMhm, CMt, L. infantum, B. henselae, H. felis, A. platys, FeLV and FIV infections reported for the first time.

The aim of this study was to assess the molecular prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon spp. and to identify associated risk factors and clinical and laboratory abnormalities in a population of cats from Madrid, Spain. METHODS: Six hundred and forty-four client-owned and stray cats from Madrid, Spain, were included in this study. DNA samples were analyzed by two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect a partial sequence of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon spp. In order to evaluate possible associations between infection by these protozoans and epidemiological or clinical parameters, data were collected related to: the season of sample collection, age, gender, spayed/neutered status, breed, living area, lifestyle, outdoor access, contact with other animals, prey on wild animals, history of tick or flea infestation, travel history, ectoparasiticide treatment, previous blood transfusion, previous tetracycline administration in the last 60 days, Feline Leukemia virus (FeLV) and Feline Immunodeficiency virus (FIV) status, positivity to other vector-borne diseases, the presence or absence of clinical signs and hematological or biochemical alterations. RESULTS: DNA of Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon sp. was amplified from the blood of 10 (1.6%) and 8 (1.2%) cats, respectively. Previous treatment with tetracyclines in the last 60 days, previous administration of blood transfusion, a decrease in haematocrit and an increase in creatinine were associated with Hepatozoon spp. infection. Cytauxzoon sp. infection was more frequent in samples collected during the winter months and in cats living in rural areas. This infection was associated with a FIV-positive status. Some of the cats that were positive for Hepatozoon spp. or Cytauxzoon sp. had been exposed to other vector-borne pathogens, such as Ehrlichia canis and Bartonella henselae. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that cats from Madrid, central Spain, are infected with Hepatozoon spp. and Cytauxzoon sp., although with a low prevalence.

We enrolled 115 consecutive patients who received either DLI (n = 20) or Chemo-DLI (n = 95) during the same period. For each DLI recipient, three recipients matched for age at the HSCT, underlying diseases, and the year of the HSCT were randomly selected from the Chemo-DLI cohort (n = 60). The 2-year cumulative incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and chronic GVHD was comparable between the groups. Fifteen (75.0%) and 47 (78.3%) patients in the DLI and Chemo-DLI groups turned MRD-negative, respectively. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse and non-relapse mortality after intervention were 30.7 versus 39.6% (P = 0.582) and 10.3 versus 6.0% (P = 0.508) in the DLI and Chemo-DLI groups, respectively.

GONPs induced the expression of antioxidative enzymes and inflammatory factors, whereas rGONPs had substantially higher cellular uptake rate, higher levels of NF-kappaB expression. These distinct toxic mechanisms were observed because the two nanomaterials differ in their oxidation state, which imparts different affinities for the cell membrane. Because GONPs have a higher cell membrane affinity and higher impact on membrane proteins compared with rGONPs, macrophages (THP-1a) derived from GONPs treated THP-1cells showed a severer effect on phagocytosis.

The most common practice in hypoxic cell culture is to maintain cells in an incubator with controlled gas inlet (i.e., hypoxic chamber). Here, we describe the design and characterization of enzyme-immobilized hydrogels to create solution hypoxia under ambient conditions for in vitro cancer cell culture. Specifically, glucose oxidase (GOX) was acrylated and co-polymerized with poly(ethylene glycol)-diacrylate (PEGDA) through photopolymerization to form GOX-immobilized PEG-based hydrogels. We first evaluated the effect of soluble GOX on inducing solution hypoxia (O2<5%) and found that both unmodified and acrylated GOX could sustain hypoxia for at least 24h even under ambient air condition with constant oxygen diffusion from the air-liquid interface. However, soluble GOX gradually lost its ability to sustain hypoxia after 24h due to the loss of enzyme activity over time. On the other hand, GOX-immobilized hydrogels were able to create hypoxia within the hydrogel for at least 120h, potentially due to enhanced protein stabilization by enzyme 'PEGylation' and immobilization. As a proof-of-concept, this GOX-immobilized hydrogel system was used to create hypoxia for in vitro culture of Molm14 (acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line) and Huh7 (hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell line). Cells cultured in the presence of GOX-immobilized hydrogels remained viable for at least 24h. The expression of hypoxia associated genes, including carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) and lysyl oxidase (LOX), were significantly upregulated in cells cultured with GOX-immobilized hydrogels. These results have demonstrated the potential of using enzyme-immobilized hydrogels to create hypoxic environment for in vitro cancer cell culture.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Although thoracic complications are frequent in CLL, only limited data exist regarding the etiologies of these complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients admitted to a tertiary care, CLL referral center, with CLL and a respiratory complaint from 2001 through 2013, to categorize pulmonary complaints and diagnoses. RESULTS: There were 277 patients with CLL admitted on 409 occasions with respiratory complaints. The median age was 73 years, with a male to female ratio of 2:1. The majority of patients had a high-risk Rai classification and had received prior treatment. Common presenting symptoms included dyspnea, cough, and sputum production. The most common diagnoses were pneumonia (62.8%), with an identified organism in 44.7%, pleural effusions (31.8%), lung cancer (6.9%), and leukemic infiltrates (5.9%). Invasive procedures were performed 138 times: 70 bronchoscopies, 24 surgical lung biopsies, 10 computed tomography-guided lung biopsies, and 34 thoracenteses. In-hospital mortality was 24.9%. In a multivariable analysis, an elevated blood urea nitrogen level and creatinine, thrombocytopenia, and a presenting symptom of dyspnea correlated significantly with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSION: Thoracic manifestations in CLL are common among hospitalized patients. Although infectious pneumonia remains most common, unusual or opportunistic infections may be increasing, and direct lung damage owing to CLL itself or to newer biologic agents are being diagnosed with lung tissue sampling. Recognition of these complications will allow earlier diagnosis, which may change management including removal of offending biologic agents or augmentation of treatment for CLL when infiltrative leukemic cells are present.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively searched pediatric patients (< 18 years old) who were diagnosed with AML and underwent whole body MR imaging during their illness between January 2006 and December 2014. The presence of chloromas was defined as when it was proven pathologically or showed typical imaging features. Nonchloroma lesions that were incidentally detected and were not previously seen on other imaging studies were defined as clinically occult nonchloroma lesions. RESULTS: Sixty-nine whole body MR scans of 40 patients with AML were included. The musculoskeletal system (42.9%) was the most commonly affected by chloromas. A total of 77 chloromas were identified in 11 (27.5%) of 40 patients. Nine (81.8%) of these 11 patients had 2 or more chloromas. There were 39 (50.6%) unexpected chloromas, which were incidentally detected, in 7 patients. Whole body MR scanning provided additional information regarding 21 clinically occult nonchloroma lesions in this patient population.

However, the process of QDs on cell membrane is worth further investigations because such process may lead to harmful effects on organisms and also important for QD application. In this study, adhesion of amino- and carboxyl-coated CdTe QDs (A-QDs and C-QDs) on cell membrane and the subsequent internalization are studied using a series of endocytosis-free model membranes, including giant and small unilamellar vesicles, supported lipid bilayers and giant plasma membrane vesicles (GPMVs). The adhered QD amounts on model membranes are quantified by a quartz crystal microbalance. The CdTe QD adhesion on model membranes is governed by electrostatic forces. Positively charged A-QDs adhere on GPMV surface and passively penetrate the plasma membrane via endocytosis-free mechanism, but negatively charged C-QDs cannot. Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells are exposed to CdTe QDs to monitor the QD internalization process. Both A- and C-QDs are internalized by RBL-2H3 cells mainly via endocytosis. CdTe QDs do not accumulate on the plasma membrane of living cells due to the fast endocytosis and the weakened electrostatic attraction in biological medium, resulting in low chance of passive penetration. The suspended cells after trypsin digestion take more QDs than the adherent cells. A-QDs cause lower cell viability than C-QDs, probably because the approach of positively charged QDs to cells is favored and the smaller aggregates of A-QDs.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Abnormalities are not equally distributed and their incidence is highly variable among malignancies. Deletion and mutation, usually associated, of ATM or TP53 are frequent in Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma. MYC gain, absent in post-GC malignancies, is frequent in B-Prolymphocytic-Leukemia, Multiple Myeloma and Plasma Cell Leukemias. RAS mutations are rare except in MM and PCL. Multiple Factorial Analysis notes that MYC deregulation is closely related to TP53 status. Moreover, MYC gain, TP53 deletion and RAS mutations are inversely correlated with survival.

There has been an increase in the incidence of CSP worldwide in recent years. It's a life-threatening condition because of the high risk of uncontrolled hemorrhage and uterine rupture. The mechanism of CSP is still unclear. The endometrial receptivity might be different in the cesarean scar between CSP and normal pregnancies. Endometrial expression of integrin beta3 and LIF positively correlates with endometrial receptivity and embryo implantation. The purpose of the study is to explore the mechanism of CSP. METHODS: The EnVision two-step immunohistochemical staining technique was used to detect the expression of integrin beta3 and LIF in the decidua of women with CSP (20 cases) and normal pregnancies (20 cases). The distribution and staining intensity of integrin beta3 and LIF in the two groups were observed. Observation of the staining were done using microscope within five randomly selected high-power fields (HPF, 10 x 40). All data analyses were conducted with SPSS 17.0 and the statistical significance was set at P <0.05. RESULTS: The decidua in the different parts of both two groups that stained with the anti-integrin beta3 and anti-LIF antibody: most of the integrin beta3 and LIF positive cells were located in glandular epithelium. The expression intensity of integrin beta3 in the cesarean scar in CSP group was significant higher than the uterine cavity in CSP group and the cesarean scar in normal pregnancy group. It's similar with the uterine cavity in normal pregnancy group. The expression intensity of LIF in the cesarean scar in CSP group was significant higher than the uterine cavity in CSP group and the cesarean scar in normal pregnancy group. It's significant lower than the uterine cavity in normal pregnancy group. CONCLUSIONS: The decidual integrin beta3 and LIF might play an important role in the mechanism of CSP. The increase expression of integrin beta3 and LIF in the cesarean scar decidua might be associated with embryo implantation in cesarean scar. The occurrence of CSP might be related to the changes of endometrial receptivity in local cesarean scar.",,"['Qian, Zhi-Da', 'Weng, Yue', 'Wang, Chun-Fen', 'Huang, Li-Li', 'Zhu, Xiao-Ming']","['Qian ZD', 'Weng Y', 'Wang CF', 'Huang LL', 'Zhu XM']","[""Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310006, People's Republic of China."", ""Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310006, People's Republic of China."", ""Maternal and Child Health Institute of Lin'an City, 25 Jiangnan Road, Lin'an, Zhejiang Province, 311300, People's Republic of China."", ""Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310006, People's Republic of China."", ""Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, 1 Xueshi Road, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, 310006, People's Republic of China. fbzhuxiaoming@163.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Reproductive Genetics (Hangzhou, Zhejiang University), Ministry of Education, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China. fbzhuxiaoming@163.com.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,100967799,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cesarean Section/*adverse effects', 'Cicatrix', 'Decidua/*metabolism', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Ectopic/etiology/*metabolism', 'Uterus/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cesarean scar pregnancy', '*Decidua', '*Endometrial receptivity', '*Integrin', '*Leukaemia-inhibitory factor']",2017/03/13 06:00,2017/12/28 06:00,['2017/03/13 06:00'],"['2015/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12884-017-1270-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12884-017-1270-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2017 Mar 11;17(1):84. doi: 10.1186/s12884-017-1270-3.,,"['0 (ITGB3BP protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",PMC5346263,,20170311,,,,,,,,,,,

In older patients with breast cancer, accurate overall survival estimates would facilitate discussions about adjuvant therapies. METHODS: Secondary analyses were performed of data from two parallel breast cancer studies (CALGB/Alliance 49907/NCT000224102 and CALGB/Alliance 369901/NCT00068328). We included patients (n = 971) who were age 70 years and older with complete baseline quality of life data (194 from 49907; 777 from 369901). Estimated versus observed all-cause two-year mortality rates were compared. ePrognosis score was calculated based on age, sex, and daily function (derived from EORTC QLQ-C30). ePrognosis scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating worse prognosis based on mortality of community-dwelling elders and were categorized into three groups (0-2, 3-6, 7-10). Observed mortality rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: Patient mean age was 75.8 years (range 70-91) and 73% had stage I-IIA disease. Most patients were classified by ePrognosis as good prognosis (n = 562, 58% 0-2) and few (n = 18, 2% 7-10) poor prognosis. Two-year observed mortality rates were significantly lower than ePrognosis estimates for patients scoring 0-2 (2% vs 5%, p = 0.001) and 3-6 (8% vs 12%, p = 0.01).

Dasatinib, a BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia, has been associated with PAH. In contrast, the BCR-ABL1 TKI imatinib has demonstrated anti-vasoproliferative properties and has been investigated as a potential treatment for PAH. Here we describe studies evaluating the effects of dasatinib and imatinib on cardiovascular and pulmonary functions to understand the reported differential consequences of the two TKIs in a clinical setting. METHODS: The direct effects of dasatinib and imatinib were explored in vivo to investigate possible mechanisms of dasatinib-induced PAH. In addition, effects of dasatinib and imatinib on PAH-related mediators were evaluated in vitro. RESULTS: In rats, both TKIs increased plasma nitric oxide (NO), did not induce PAH-related structural or molecular changes in PA or lungs, and did not alter hemodynamic lung function compared with positive controls. Similarly, in the pulmonary artery endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells co-culture model, imatinib and dasatinib increased NO and decreased endothelin-1 protein and mRNA. CONCLUSIONS: The results of these studies indicated that dasatinib did not induce physiological changes or molecular signatures consistent with PAH when compared to positive controls. Instead, dasatinib induced changes consistent with imatinib. Both dasatinib and imatinib induced biochemical and structural changes consistent with a protective effect for PAH. These data suggest that other factors of unclear etiology contributed to the development of PAH in patients treated with dasatinib.",,"['Baumgart, Bethany', 'Guha, Mausumee', 'Hennan, James', 'Li, Julia', 'Woicke, Jochen', 'Simic, Damir', 'Graziano, Michael', 'Wallis, Nicola', 'Sanderson, Thomas', 'Bunch, Roderick Todd']","['Baumgart B', 'Guha M', 'Hennan J', 'Li J', 'Woicke J', 'Simic D', 'Graziano M', 'Wallis N', 'Sanderson T', 'Bunch RT']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA. bethany.baumgart@bms.com.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Company, 777 Scudders Mill Road, Princeton, NJ, 08536, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Dasatinib/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Endothelin-1/blood', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hemodynamics/drug effects', 'Hypertension, Pulmonary/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Lung/pathology', 'Male', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/drug effects', 'Nitric Oxide/blood', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Pulmonary Artery/drug effects', 'Pulmonary Circulation/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Dasatinib', '*Imatinib', '*Nonclinical', '*Pulmonary arterial hypertension']",2017/03/12 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2017/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/12/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-017-3264-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-017-3264-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2017 Apr;79(4):711-723. doi: 10.1007/s00280-017-3264-2.

The anti-CD52 mAb, alemtuzumab, was used widely in clinics for the treatment of patients such as organ transplantation. In the present manuscript, we will briefly summarize the immunological function of CD52 and discuss the application of anti-CD52 mAb in transplantation settings. FINDINGS: We reviewed studies published until July 2016 to explore the role of CD52 in immune cell function and its implication in organ transplantation. We showed that ligation of cell surface CD52 molecules may offer costimulatory signals for T-cell activation and proliferation. However, soluble CD52 molecules will interact with the inhibitory sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 10 (Siglec10) to significantly inhibit T cell proliferation and activation. Although the physiological and pathological significances of CD52 molecules are still poorly understood, the anti-CD52 mAb, alemtuzumab, was used widely for the treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, autoimmune diseases as well as cell and organ transplantation in clinics. CONCLUSION: Studies clearly showed that CD52 can modulate T-cell activation either by its intracellular signal pathways or by the interaction of soluble CD52 and Siglec-10 expressing on T cells. However, the regulatory functions of CD52 on other immune cell subpopulations in organ transplantation require to be studied in the near future.",,"['Zhao, Yang', 'Su, Huiting', 'Shen, Xiaofei', 'Du, Junfeng', 'Zhang, Xiaodong', 'Zhao, Yong']","['Zhao Y', 'Su H', 'Shen X', 'Du J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhao Y']","['Transplantation Biology Research Division, State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beichen West Road 1-5, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Transplantation Biology Research Division, State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beichen West Road 1-5, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Transplantation Biology Research Division, State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beichen West Road 1-5, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of General Surgery, PLA Army General Hospital, Dongsishitiao Namencang 5, Dongcheng District, Beijing, 100007, China. dujf66@126.com.', 'Department of Urology, Beijing Chaoyang Hospital, Capital Medical University, 8 Gong Ti Nan Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100020, China. zhangxiaodong@bjcyh.com.', 'Transplantation Biology Research Division, State Key Laboratory of Membrane Biology, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beichen West Road 1-5, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100101, China. zhaoy@ioz.ac.cn.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. zhaoy@ioz.ac.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Here, we present results demonstrating that macroH2A variants have a major function in maintaining nuclear organization and heterochromatin architecture. Specifically, we find that a substantial amount of macroH2A is associated with heterochromatic repeat sequences. We further identify macroH2A on sites of interstitial heterochromatin decorated by histone H3 trimethylated on K9 (H3K9me3). Loss of macroH2A leads to major defects in nuclear organization, including reduced nuclear circularity, disruption of nucleoli and a global loss of dense heterochromatin. Domains formed by DNA repeat sequences are disorganized, expanded and fragmented, and mildly re-expressed when depleted of macroH2A. At the molecular level, we find that macroH2A is required for the interaction of repeat sequences with the nucleostructural protein lamin B1. Taken together, our results argue that a major function of macroH2A histone variants is to link nucleosome composition to higher-order chromatin architecture.",['(c) 2017.

This study reveals that the selective inhibitor of RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcription, CX-5461, effectively treats aggressive AML, including mixed-lineage leukemia-driven AML, and outperforms standard chemotherapies. In addition to the previously characterized mechanism of action of CX-5461 (ie, the induction of p53-dependent apoptotic cell death), the inhibition of Pol I transcription also demonstrates potent efficacy in p53null AML in vivo. This significant survival advantage in both p53WT and p53null leukemic mice treated with CX-5461 is associated with activation of the checkpoint kinases 1/2, an aberrant G2/M cell-cycle progression and induction of myeloid differentiation of the leukemic blasts. The ability to target the leukemic-initiating cell population is thought to be essential for lasting therapeutic benefit. Most strikingly, the acute inhibition of Pol I transcription reduces both the leukemic granulocyte-macrophage progenitor and leukemia-initiating cell (LIC) populations, and suppresses their clonogenic capacity. This suggests that dysregulated Pol I transcription is essential for the maintenance of their leukemia-initiating potential. Together, these findings demonstrate the therapeutic utility of this new class of inhibitors to treat highly aggressive AML by targeting LICs.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of

We performed gene expression profiling analysis of 542 human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples and identified 55% with upregulated mtDNA biosynthesis pathway expression compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Genes that support mitochondrial nucleotide pools, including mitochondrial nucleotide transporters and a subset of cytoplasmic nucleoside kinases, were also increased in AML compared with normal hematopoietic samples. Knockdown of cytoplasmic nucleoside kinases reduced mtDNA levels in AML cells, demonstrating their contribution in maintaining mtDNA. To assess cytoplasmic nucleoside kinase pathway activity, we used a nucleoside analog 2'3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC), which is phosphorylated to the activated antimetabolite, 2'3'-dideoxycytidine triphosphate by cytoplasmic nucleoside kinases. ddC is a selective inhibitor of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma. ddC was preferentially activated in AML cells compared with normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. ddC treatment inhibited mtDNA replication, oxidative phosphorylation, and induced cytotoxicity in a panel of AML cell lines. Furthermore, ddC preferentially inhibited mtDNA replication in a subset of primary human leukemia cells and selectively targeted leukemia cells while sparing normal progenitor cells. In animal models of human AML, treatment with ddC decreased mtDNA, electron transport chain proteins, and induced tumor regression without toxicity. ddC also targeted leukemic stem cells in secondary AML xenotransplantation assays. Thus, AML cells have increased cytidine nucleoside kinase activity that regulates mtDNA biogenesis and can be leveraged to selectively target oxidative phosphorylation in AML.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Liyanage, Sanduni U', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Voisin, Veronique', 'Bridon, Gaelle', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Xu, ChangJiang', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Siriwardena, Thirushi P', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Yehudai, Dana', 'Sriskanthadevan, Shrivani', 'Avizonis, Daina', 'Shamas-Din, Aisha', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Bader, Gary D', 'Laposa, Rebecca', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Liyanage SU', 'Hurren R', 'Voisin V', 'Bridon G', 'Wang X', 'Xu C', 'MacLean N', 'Siriwardena TP', 'Gronda M', 'Yehudai D', 'Sriskanthadevan S', 'Avizonis D', 'Shamas-Din A', 'Minden MD', 'Bader GD', 'Laposa R', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Goodman Cancer Research Centre, Metabolomics Core Facility, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Goodman Cancer Research Centre, Metabolomics Core Facility, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada; and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice, SCID', 'NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases/metabolism', 'Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase/metabolism', '*Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zalcitabine/metabolism']",,,2017/03/12 06:00,2017/09/09 06:00,['2017/03/12 06:00'],"['2016/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33398-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-10-741207 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 May 11;129(19):2657-2666. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-10-741207.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of patients with CML receiving first-line and second-line generic imatinib in Bosnia and Herzegovina. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study of patients (n = 41) treated with generic imatinib in Bosnia between September 1, 2013 and August 5, 2016. Patients were categorized into 2 study groups: Group 1 (n = 27) included newly diagnosed patients with CML receiving front-line generic imatinib, and Group 2 (n = 14) consisted of patients who started with front-line Glivec and were mandated to switch to the second-line generic imatinib. RESULTS: The median follow-up for Group 1 (first-line generic imatinib) and Group 2 (second-line generic imatinib) was 16 and 36 months, respectively. At 36 months, the overall survival for patients in Group 1 was 85%, and the achievement of complete cytogenetic response was 81%. At 24 months, the major molecular response rate was 48%. Overall, 52% of patients switched from first-line generic imatinib to nilotinib owing to treatment failure and side-effects. In Group 2, 93% of patients sustained cytogenetic and molecular response at 3 years after the switch from branded to generic imatinib. CONCLUSION: Our results lead us to conclude that generic imatinib as second-line therapy does not have deleterious effects on patient outcomes. However, first-line generic imatinib showed suboptimal efficacy compared with branded imatinib.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

However, BDMC did not enhance X-ray-mediated activation of the p53 signaling pathway via p53's transactivation or mitochondrial translocation. On the other hand, BDMC promoted the X-ray-induced dephosphorylation at Ser 70 in Bcl-2's flexible loop regulatory domain and Bcl-2 binding to p53.

Increasing researches have demonstrated that autophagy becomes activated when cancer cells are subjected to chemotherapy, which is involved in the development of drug resistance. Therefore, combining chemotherapy with inhibition of autophagy serves as a new strategy in cancer treatment. Tigecycline is an antibiotic that has received attention as an anti-cancer agent due to its inhibitory effect on mitochondrial translation. However, whether combination of tigecycline with inhibition of autophagy could overcome drug resistance in CML remains unclear. METHODS: We analyzed the biological and metabolic effect of tigecycline on CML primary cells and cell lines to investigate whether tigecycline could regulate autophagy in CML cells and whether coupling autophagy inhibition with treatment using tigecycline could affect the viabilities of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant CML cells. RESULTS: Tigecycline inhibited the viabilities of CML primary cells and cell lines, including those that were drug-resistant. This occurred via the inhibition of mitochondrial biogenesis and the perturbation of cell metabolism, which resulted in apoptosis. Moreover, tigecycline induced autophagy by downregulating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Additionally, combining tigecycline use with autophagy inhibition further promoted the anti-leukemic activity of tigecycline. We also observed that the anti-leukemic effect of tigecycline is selective.

Treatment failures and delay in appropriate therapy for CRKP infections are frequent and the mortality rate associated with CRKP bacteremia in neutropenic haematological patients is reported about 60%. METHODS: Haematological patients harboring CRKP hospitalized between February 2012 and May 2013 in an Italian Teaching hospital were examined. Conditions favouring CRKP spread in a haematological unit, risk factors for bacteremia in CRKP-carriers and for CRKP bacteremia-related death were evaluated in this observational retrospective study. RESULTS: CRKP was isolated in 22 patients, 14 (64%) had bacteremia. Control measures implementation, particularly the weekly rectal screening for CRKP performed in all hospitalized patients and contact precautions for CRKP-carriers and newly admitted patients until proved CRKP-negative, reduced significantly the CRKP spread (14 new carriers identified of 131 screened patients vs 5 of 242 after the intervention, p = 0.001). Fifty-eight percent of carriers developed CRKP bacteremia, and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) resulted independently associated with the bacteremia occurrence (p = 0.02). CRKP bacteremias developed mainly during neutropenia (86%) and in CRKP-carriers (79%). CRKP bacteremias were breakthrough in 10 cases (71%). Ten of 14 patient with CRKP bacteremias died (71%) and all had AML. The 70% of fatal bacteremias occurred in patients not yet recognized as CRKP-carriers and 80% were breakthrough. Initial adequate antibiotic therapy resulted the only independent factor able to protect against death (p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of CRKP-carriers is confirmed critical to prevent CRKP spread. AML patients colonized by CRKP resulted at high risk of CRKP-bacteremia and poor outcome and the adequacy of the initial antibiotic therapy may be effective to improve survival. To limit the increase of resistance, the extensive use of antibiotics active against CRKP should be avoided, but in the setting of high CRKP pressure and high-risk CRKP-colonized haematological patients, timely empiric antibiotic combinations active against CRKP could be suggested as treatment of febrile neutropenia.",,"['Micozzi, Alessandra', 'Gentile, Giuseppe', 'Minotti, Clara', 'Cartoni, Claudio', 'Capria, Saveria', 'Ballaro, Daniele', 'Santilli, Stefania', 'Pacetti, Emanuele', 'Grammatico, Sara', 'Bucaneve, Giampaolo', 'Foa, Robin']","['Micozzi A', 'Gentile G', 'Minotti C', 'Cartoni C', 'Capria S', 'Ballaro D', 'Santilli S', 'Pacetti E', 'Grammatico S', 'Bucaneve G', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sapienza Universita di Roma, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy. micozzi@bce.uniroma1.it.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sapienza Universita di Roma, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy.', 'Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy.', 'Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sapienza Universita di Roma, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Azienda Policlinico Umberto I, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sapienza Universita di Roma, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sapienza Universita di Roma, Via Benevento 6, 00161, Rome, Italy.', 'Ospedale S.

It is commonly found in environmental sources and can be isolated from skin, gastrointestinal system and respiratory tract of healthy individuals as well. It mainly infects patients with hematological malignancies such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in the presence of neutropenia; and mortality rates are high in those patients. Although the data about the in vitro antifungal susceptibility are limited, it is being reported that amphotericin B and voriconazole are more effective on S.capitata isolates whereas caspofungin had no activity. Here, we report a case of fungemia and septic arthritis due to S.capitata in a patient with Fanconi aplastic anemia. A 22-year-old male patient with Fanconi aplastic anemia was hospitalized in our hematology department for bone marrow transplantation. Two days after the hospitalization, neutropenic fever developed and multiple nodules similar to candidiasis were detected in his liver with the whole abdomen magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Caspofungin treatment (single 70 mg/kg loading dose, followed by 1 x 50 mg/kg/day) was started. The patient remained febrile, and his blood culture yielded S.capitata. The treatment regimen was changed to a combination of liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg/day) and voriconazole (2 x 4 mg/kg/day). A few days later, pain and swelling came out on patient's left knee and he underwent a surgical process with the prediagnosis of septic arthritis. Culture of synovial fluid was also positive for S.capitata. On the 26th day of the hospitalization, the patient died due to sepsis and multiple organ failure. Patient's blood and synovial fluid samples were incubated in BacT/Alert automated blood culture system (bioMerieux, France). After receiving the growth signal, yeast cells were seen in Gram staining and cream-coloured, wrinkled, yeast-like colonies that were able to grow at 45oC and resistant to cycloheximide were detected on Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA). Urease test was negative, and according to API 20C AUX (bioMerieux, France) system, none of the carbonhydrates were utilized except glucose. The isolates that were able to produce annelloconidia in corn meal-Tween 80 agar slide culture were identified as S.capitata. The identification was further confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B, fluconazole, voriconazole, and caspofungin were found to be 0.5 microg/ml, 1.5 microg/ml, 0.032 microg/ml, and > 16 microg/ml respectively. Repetitive sequence based PCR (rep-PCR) (DiversiLab system, bioMerieux, France) was used to determine clonal relatedness of the isolates from blood and synovial fluid samples. The isolates were indistinguishable (similarity coefficient > 97%) according to rep-PCR. In conclusion, S.capitata infections should be taken into consideration in the presence of fungemia and septic arthritis in hematological patients who receive caspofungin therapy.",,"['Parkan, Omur Mustafa', 'Atalay, Mustafa Altay', 'Koc, Ayse Nedret', 'Pala, Cigdem', 'Aydemir, Gonca', 'Kaynar, Leylagul']","['Parkan OM', 'Atalay MA', 'Koc AN', 'Pala C', 'Aydemir G', 'Kaynar L']","['Erciyes University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Microbiology, Kayseri, Turkey. omurparkan@hotmail.com.']",,['tur'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Turkey,Mikrobiyol Bul,Mikrobiyoloji bulteni,7503830,IM,"['Arthritis, Infectious/*microbiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fanconi Anemia/*complications/surgery', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Fungemia/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mycoses/*microbiology', 'Saccharomycetales/*pathogenicity', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/03/12 06:00,2017/09/22 06:00,['2017/03/12 06:00'],"['2017/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5578/mb.33176 [doi]'],ppublish,Mikrobiyol Bul. 2017 Jan;51(1):87-93. doi: 10.5578/mb.33176.,,,,,,,,,,,,Fanconi aplastik anemili bir hastada Saprochaete capitata'nin neden oldugu fungemi ve septik artrit: bir olgu sunumu.,,,,

We also described a circRNA signature related to AML risk-status based on the bioinformatics prediction. In particular, a downregulated circRNA, hsa_circ_0004277, was characterized and functionally evaluated in a cohort of 115 human samples, thus offering a potential diagnostic marker and treatment target in AML. Interestingly, we found chemotherapy could significantly restore the expression of hsa_circ_0004277, indicating the increasing level of hsa_circ_0004277 was associated with successful treatment. Furthermore, a detailed circRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction network was presented for hsa_circ_0004277, allowing us to better understand its underlying mechanisms for function in AML.",,"['Li, Wei', 'Zhong, Chaoqin', 'Jiao, Jun', 'Li, Peng', 'Cui, Baoxia', 'Ji, Chunyan', 'Ma, Daoxin']","['Li W', 'Zhong C', 'Jiao J', 'Li P', 'Cui B', 'Ji C', 'Ma D']","['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. liwei_medicine@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. zhongchq07@126.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. jiaojun206@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. pengli85@163.com.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. cuibaoxia@sdu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. jichunyan@sdu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China. daoxinma@sdu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Circular']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'biomarker', 'circRNAs', 'hsa_circ_0004277']",2017/03/12 06:00,2017/04/21 06:00,['2017/03/12 06:00'],"['2017/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18030597 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18030597 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Mar 9;18(3). pii: ijms18030597. doi: 10.3390/ijms18030597.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",PMC5372613,,20170309,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the CXCR4 (CD184) expression in the harvest cells and in the post-transplant bone marrow (BM) and its relation to engraftment, as determined by the consensus criteria and chimerism. METHODS: This is a prospective study which included 30 patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; 15 patients received autograft and 15 patients received allograft on dates between January 2012 and May 2014. We assessed CD184 (CXCR4) using flow cytometry in the harvest cells together with post-transplant BM assessment on Day 28 and Day 90 for complete morphologic, molecular studies, and detection of CD184 expression on CD34(+) cells with chimerism studies on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Diagnoses of the enrolled patients were as follows: seven (24.1%) with acute myeloid leukemia, eight (27.6%) with multiple myeloma, four (13.8%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three (10.3%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (6.9%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, two (6.9%) with aplastic anemia, two (6.9%) with chronic myeloid leukemia, one (3.4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma, and one (3.4%) with plasmacytomas. One patient died and was excluded from the study because there were not enough data about engraftment. There was no statistical significance between the level of CD184 in stem cell harvest and the prediction of successful engraftment (p>0.05) as well as in Day 28 BM sample (p>0.05), whereas there was a statistical significance between the level of CD184 in Day 90 BM sample and the occurrence of successful engraftment (p=0.002). CONCLUSION: SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a crucial role in engraftment; however, more studies are warranted to assess their expression post-transplant. Evaluating the ligand (chemokine, SDF-1) or its receptor (CXCR4) may serve as potential surrogate markers for assessment of engraftment.","['Copyright (c) 2017 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

However, the impact of autophagy on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) maintenance and the validity of autophagy as a viable target in AML therapy remain unclear. Here we show that Kmt2a/Mll-Mllt3/Af9 AML (MA9-AML) cells have high autophagy flux compared with normal bone marrow cells, but autophagy-specific targeting, either through Rb1cc1-disruption to abolish autophagy initiation, or via Atg5-disruption to prevent phagophore (the autophagosome precursor) membrane elongation, does not affect the growth or survival of MA9-AML cells, either in vitro or in vivo. Mechanistically, neither Atg5 nor Rb1cc1 disruption impairs endolysosome formation or survival signaling pathways. The autophagy inhibitor chloroquine shows autophagy-independent anti-leukemic effects in vitro but has no efficacy in vivo likely due to limited achievable drug efficacy in blood. Further, vesicular exocytosis appears to mediate chloroquine resistance in AML cells, and exocytotic inhibition significantly enhances the anti-leukemic effect of chloroquine.

Various toxic agents from different sources are used in immunotoxin development, including bacterial, plant and human origin cytotoxic elements. Although bacterial and plant-derived toxins are highly toxic and commonly used in immunotoxins, their immunogenicity for human restricted their application in cancer therapy. Here, we discuss the advantages and limitations of bacterial toxins such as Pseudomonas and Diphtheria toxins, plant toxins such as ricin and gelonin, and some endogenous protein of human origin such as RNases and Granzymes. This article will also review different generations of immunotoxins with special focus on immunotoxins which are under clinical trials or approved for clinical use. Finally, current deimmunization strategies for development of new less-immunogenic recombinant immunotoxins will be discussed.

The objective in the current study of 262 patients with PV was to validate these observations and also identify other risk factors for myelofibrosis-free survival (MFFS). About 127 (48%) patients displayed grade 1 reticulin fibrosis at the time of diagnosis; presenting clinical and laboratory features were not significantly different between patients with or without BM fibrosis. In univariate analysis, BM fibrosis had no significant impact on overall, leukemia-free or thrombosis-free survival, whereas a significant association was noted for MFFS (P=0.009, hazard ratio 2.9; 95% confidence interval 1.32-6.78); other risk factors for MFFS included leukocytosis 15 x 10(9)/l, presence of palpable splenomegaly and abnormal karyotype. During multivariable analysis, leukocytosis 15 x 10(9)/l, palpable splenomegaly and grade 1 BM reticulin fibrosis remained significant. The current study validates the previously observed association between grade 1 BM reticulin fibrosis in PV and subsequent fibrotic progression, and identifies leukocytosis and palpable splenomegaly as additional risk factors for fibrotic progression; additional studies are required to clarify the impact of BM fibrosis on thrombosis and that of abnormal karyotype on MFFS.",,"['Barraco, D', 'Cerquozzi, S', 'Hanson, C A', 'Ketterling, R P', 'Pardanani, A', 'Gangat, N', 'Tefferi, A']","['Barraco D', 'Cerquozzi S', 'Hanson CA', 'Ketterling RP', 'Pardanani A', 'Gangat N', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fibrosis', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/*diagnosis/genetics/*mortality', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Reticulin/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/03/11 06:00,2017/11/29 06:00,['2017/03/11 06:00'],"['2017/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/29 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201717 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2017.17 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2017 Mar 10;7(3):e538. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2017.17.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Reticulin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",PMC5380902,,20170310,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We investigated the constitutive release of 28 mediators during in vitro culture for 79 consecutive patients. RESULTS: Constitutive cytokine release profiles differed among patients, and hierarchical clustering identified three subsets with high, intermediate and low release, respectively. The high-release subset showed high levels of most mediators, usually monocytic differentiation as well as altered mRNA expression of proteins involved in intracellular iron homeostasis and molecular trafficking; this subset also included 4 out of 6 patients with inv(16). Spontaneous in vitro apoptosis did not differ among the subsets. For the high-release patients, cytokines were released both by CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells. The mRNA and released protein levels showed statistically significant correlations only for eleven of the cytokines. The overall survival after intensive anti-leukemic therapy was significantly higher for high-release compared with low-release patients. Pharmacological targeting of iron metabolism (iron chelation, transferrin receptor blocking) altered the cytokine release profile.

Concentration of interleukin 21 (IL-21) was evaluated by ELISA, and the correlation between clinical prognosis and the ratio of TFH cells was analyzed. RESULTS: Significantly increased ICOS(+)- and PD-1(+) TFH cells were found in MLD patients at pretreatment compared to healthy controls. Decreased or even close to normal levels of ICOS(+)- and PD-1(+) TFH cells were found at the end of treatment. However, in the patients with progressive disease, high levels of ICOS(+)- and PD-1(+) TFH cells were found. Moreover, a significantly increased plasma IL-21 level was found in MLD patients. Negative correlation was found between the level of ICOS(+)-, PD-1(+) TFH cells, as well as IL-21 and the prognosis of MLD.

Such genes also often called informative genes are able to differentiate tissue samples belonging to different classes of the studied disease. Despite the fact that there is a wide number of proposals, the complexity imposed by this problem remains a challenge today. This research proposes a gene selection approach by means of a clustering-based multi-agent system.

We investigated MYD88 L265P and WHIM-like CXCR4 mutations in various IgM-RD. Patients with serum immunofixation electrophoresis confirmed IgM monoclonal gammopathy who had enough material for DNA extraction and presented between January 2008 and October 2016 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital were enrolled in this cohort. We performed real-time allele-specific-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing to explore the presence of MYD88 L265P and WHIM-like CXCR4 mutations. One hundred and twelve patients (64 male and 48 female patients) were included in this retrospective study. The median age at diagnosis was 62 years (range, 30-84 years). In total, 64 patients (57.1%) carried the MYD88 L265P mutation and 14 patients (12.5%) carried the CXCR4 WHIM-like mutation. We identified the MYD88 L265P somatic variant in cases with WM (39/42), MGUS (8/18), NHL (14/41, including 4/13 diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), 1/8 mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, 3/6 splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL), 1/4 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 2/3 nodal marginal zone lymphoma (NMZL), 1/2 mantle cell lymphoma, 1 Burkitt lymphoma, and 1 B cell NHL that could not be classified), primary AL (2/2), and IgM-PN (1/1). The mutation was absent in five patients with Cryoglobulinemia, two with primary cold agglutinin disease and one with MM. The CXCR4 WHIM-like mutation was present in 10/42 patients with WM, 3/41 with NHL (1 DLBCL, 1 SMZL, and 1 NMZL), and 1/18 patients with IgM MGUS. Among the patients with NHL, those with the mutated MYD88 L265P genotype were younger and had lower level of IgG and IgA than the patients with the wild-type genotype. Patients with the mutated MYD88 L265P genotype with WM and MZL were compared. More male patients, higher levels of IgM and lower levels of LDH were found in the WM group. There was no significant difference in overall survival between the two groups. We present a study of the prevalence of the MYD88 L265P mutation and CXCR4 WHIM-like mutation in IgM RD. The MYD88 L265P mutation may play a key role in the pathogenesis of IgM monoclonal gammopathies.

In vivo studies are usually employed for evaluating bioactivity of these glycomolecules. However, alternative methods are required to simplify the bioassay and avoid ethical issues associated with in vivo studies. Negatively charged sialic acid residues are known to be critical for in vivo bioactivity of rHuEPO. To address this need, we employed the human acute myeloid leukemia cell line UT-7 for the determination of proliferative stimulation induced by rHuEPO. Relative potencies of various intact and sugar-trimmed rHuEPO preparations were estimated using the International Standard for Human r-DNA derived EPO (87/684) as a reference for bioactivity. The cellular response was measured with a multi-channel photometer using a colorimetric microassay, based on the metabolism of the Resazurin sodium by cell viability. For a resourceful probing of physiological features of rHuEPO with significance, we obtained partly or completely desialylated rHuEPO digested by the neuraminidase enzyme without degradation of carbohydrates. Two-fold higher specific activity was shown by asialoerythropoietin in in vitro analysis compared with the sialoerythropoietin. Further, computational studies were also carried out to construct the 3D model of the erythropoietin (EPO) protein structure using standard comparative modeling methods. The quality of the model was validated using Procheck and protein structure analysis (ProSA) server tools. N-glycan units were constructed; moreover, EPO protein was glycosylated at potential glycosylation amino acid residue sites. The method described should be suitable for potency assessments of pharmaceutical formulations of rHuEPO (European Pharmacopeia, 2016).",,"['Metta, Manoj Kumar', 'Malkhed, Vasavi', 'Tantravahi, Srinivasan', 'Vuruputuri, Uma', 'Kunaparaju, Rajkumar']","['Metta MK', 'Malkhed V', 'Tantravahi S', 'Vuruputuri U', 'Kunaparaju R']","['Department of Biotechnology, GIS, GITAM University, Gandhi Nagar, Rushikonda, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, 530045, India.', 'Department of Chemistry, University College of Science Saifabad, Osmania University, Saifabad, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500004, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, GIS, GITAM University, Gandhi Nagar, Rushikonda, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, 530045, India. saveplants@gmail.com.', 'Department of Chemistry, University College of Science, Osmania University, Tarnaka, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500007, India.', 'Usha Biotech, 62/A, 1st Floor, Sundari Reddy Bhavan, Beside Heritage Fresh, Vengal Rao Nagar, Hyderabad, Telangana, 500038, India.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3966-8281'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Protein J,The protein journal,101212092,IM,"['Biological Assay/*methods', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythroid Cells', 'Erythropoietin/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Recombinant Proteins/*chemistry/pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Biological activity', '*In vitro bioassay', '*Procheck and ProSA', '*Recombinant human erythropoietin', '*UT-7 cell line']",2017/03/11 06:00,2017/06/08 06:00,['2017/03/11 06:00'],"['2017/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10930-017-9704-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s10930-017-9704-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Protein J. 2017 Apr;36(2):112-122. doi: 10.1007/s10930-017-9704-3.,,"['0 (EPO protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'GZP2782OP0 (N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PTEN, PI3K/AKT and Notch pathways are frequently altered in T-ALL. PTEN is a tumor suppressor that inactivates the PI3K pathway. We profiled miRNAs in Pten-deficient mouse T-ALL and identified miR-26b as a potentially dysregulated gene. We validated decreased expression levels of miR-26b in mouse and human T-ALL cells. In addition, expression of exogenous miR-26b reduced proliferation and promoted apoptosis of T-ALL cells in vitro, and hindered progression of T-ALL in vivo. Furthermore, miR-26b inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway by directly targeting PIK3CD, the gene encoding PI3Kdelta, in human T-ALL cell lines. ShRNA for PIK3CD and CAL-101, a PIK3CD inhibitor, reduced the growth and increased apoptosis of T-ALL cells. Finally, we showed that PTEN induced miR-26b expression by regulating the differential expression of Ikaros isoforms that are transcriptional regulators of miR-26b. These results suggest that miR-26b functions as a tumor suppressor in the development of T-ALL.

Here we decipher the interplay between mTORC1 activity and glucose metabolism in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We show that mTORC1 signaling that is constantly overactivated in AML cells promotes glycolysis and leads to glucose addiction. The level of mTORC1 activity determines the sensitivity of AML cells to glycolysis inhibition as switch-off mTORC1 activity leads to glucose-independent cell survival that is sustained by an increase in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic analysis identified the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) as an important pro-survival pathway for glucose metabolism in AML cells with high mTORC1 activity and provided a clear rational for targeting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in AML. Indeed, our analysis of the cancer genome atlas AML database pinpointed G6PD as a new biomarker in AML, as its overexpression correlated with an adverse prognosis in this cohort. Targeting the PPP using the G6PD inhibitor 6-aminonicotinamide induces in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity against AML cells and synergistically sensitizes leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Our results demonstrate that high mTORC1 activity creates a specific vulnerability to G6PD inhibition that may work as a new AML therapy.",,"['Poulain, L', 'Sujobert, P', 'Zylbersztejn, F', 'Barreau,

We studied the effects of the CXCR4 antagonist BL-8040 on the survival of AML blasts, and investigated the molecular mechanisms by which CXCR4 signaling inhibition leads to leukemic cell death. Treatment with BL-8040 induced the robust mobilization of AML blasts from the BM. In addition, AML cells exposed to BL-8040 underwent differentiation. Furthermore, BL-8040 induced the apoptosis of AML cells in vitro and in vivo. This apoptosis was mediated by the upregulation of miR-15a/miR-16-1, resulting in downregulation of the target genes BCL-2, MCL-1 and cyclin-D1. Overexpression of miR-15a/miR-16-1 directly induced leukemic cell death. BL-8040-induced apoptosis was also mediated by the inhibition of survival signals via the AKT/ERK pathways. Importantly, treatment with a BCL-2 inhibitor induced apoptosis and act together with BL-8040 to enhance cell death. BL-8040 also synergized with FLT3 inhibitors to induce AML cell death. Importantly, this combined treatment prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice and reduced minimal residual disease in vivo.

Post-transplant toxoplasmosis is often a reactivation of prior infection and typically occurs within the first 6 months of transplant. Herein, we report that cerebral toxoplasmosis may occur 22 months after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. CASE REPORT We describe a case of cerebral toxoplasmosis that occurred 22 months after an allogeneic HCT while the patient was on aerosolized pentamidine for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis. The disease was only diagnosed after brain biopsy because of atypical MRI appearance of the cerebral lesion and negative Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody test result in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The patient received pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine treatment, with dramatic improvement after several months. The patient is alive 2 years after infection diagnosis, with no evidence of disease and is off Toxoplasma prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS Cerebral toxoplasmosis can occur late after allogeneic HCT while patients are on immunosuppression therapy, with atypical features on imaging studies and negative Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibody test result in the CSF. Pre-transplant serologic screening for T. gondii antibodies in allogeneic transplant candidates is warranted. Brain biopsy can be a helpful diagnostic tool for cerebral lesions.",,"['Khalaf, Ahmed M', 'Hashim, Mahmoud A', 'Alsharabati, Mohammed', 'Fallon, Kenneth', 'Cure, Joel K', 'Pappas, Peter', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Saad, Ayman']","['Khalaf AM', 'Hashim MA', 'Alsharabati M', 'Fallon K', 'Cure JK', 'Pappas P', 'Mineishi S', 'Saad A']","['Department of Imaging Physics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Program, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Department of Neurology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Neuroradiology Section, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Penn State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, PA, USA.', 'Blood and Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy Program, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,IM,"['Adult', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Toxoplasmosis, Cerebral/*diagnostic imaging/*etiology/therapy']",,,2017/03/11 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2017/03/11 06:00'],"['2017/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['899687 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.899687 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2017 Mar 10;18:246-250. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.899687.,,,PMC5358837,,20170310,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic natural killer (NK) cells have been adoptively transferred with promising clinical results. Here, we report the first-in-human study exploiting a unique scalable NK-cell product generated ex vivo from CD34(+) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) from partially HLA-matched umbilical cord blood units.Experimental Design: Ten older AML patients in morphologic complete remission received an escalating HSPC-NK cell dose (between 3 and 30 x 10(6)/kg body weight) after lymphodepleting chemotherapy without cytokine boosting.Results: HSPC-NK cell products contained a median of 75% highly activated NK cells, with <1 x 10(4) T cells/kg and <3 x 10(5) B cells/kg body weight. HSPC-NK cells were well tolerated, and neither graft-versus-host disease nor toxicity was observed. Despite no cytokine boosting being given, transient HSPC-NK cell persistence was clearly found in peripheral blood up to 21% until day 8, which was accompanied by augmented IL15 plasma levels. Moreover, donor chimerism up to 3.5% was found in bone marrow. Interestingly, in vivo HSPC-NK cell maturation was observed, indicated by the rapid acquisition of CD16 and KIR expression, while expression of most activating receptors was sustained.

We evaluated 93 patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and analyzed the association between T cell depletion strategies with the cumulative incidence of relapse and CMV reactivation. A total of 33% of patients who received ATG vs. 34% who received alemtuzumab developed CMV reactivation. The cumulative incidence of relapse was 3% at 1year and 20% at 3 years in patients with CMV reactivation vs. 30% at 1year and 38% at 3 years in patients without CMV reactivation (p=0.02). When analyzed separately, this effect persisted in the myeloid, but not the lymphoid group. There was a numerical trend towards increased non-relapse mortality (NRM) in patients with CMV reactivation, especially in the myeloid group. The choice of T cell depleting agent and the rate of CMV reactivation were not associated with different overall survival (OS) rates. These results suggest that the choice of T cell depletion strategy may have similar effects on rates of CMV reactivation, disease relapse, and survival.

The subclass that includes Bcl-XL binds strongly to Bad BH3 peptide while it has weak binding affinity for the second subclass of Bcl-2 proteins such as Mcl-1 and A1. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins are considered to be attractive drug targets for anti-cancer drugs. BH3-mimetic inhibitors such as ABT-737 have been shown to be specific to Bcl-XL subclass while Mcl-1 and A1 show resistance to the same drug. An efficacious inhibitor should target all the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Hence, development of inhibitors selective to Mcl-1 and A1 is of prime importance for targeted cancer therapeutics. The first step to achieve this goal is to understand the molecular basis of high binding affinities of specific pro-apoptotic BH3 peptides for Mcl-1 and A1. To understand the interactions between the BH3 peptides and Mcl-1/A1, we performed multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of six complex structures of Mcl-1 and A1. With the exception of Bad, all complex structures were experimentally determined. Bad complex structures were modeled. Our simulation studies identified specific pattern of polar interactions between Mcl-1/A1 and high-affinity binding BH3 peptides. The lack of such polar interactions in Bad peptide complex is attributed to specific basic residues present before and after the highly conserved Leu residue. The close approach of basic residues in Bad and Mcl-1/A1 is hypothesized to be the cause of weak binding affinity. To test this hypothesis, we generated in silico mutants of these basic residues in Bad peptide and Mcl-1/A1 proteins. MD simulations of the mutant systems established the pattern of stable polar interactions observed in high-affinity binding BH3 peptides. We have thus identified specific residue positions in Bad and Mcl-1/A1 responsible for the weak binding affinity. Results from these simulation studies will aid in the development of inhibitors specific to Mcl-1 and A1 proteins.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Regarding prognostic factors, no clear correlations with stage, IGHV, or beta-2-microglobulin were found; in a cox multivariate analysis of the 'early' patients, sCD52 and IGHV both had independent prognostic value. Following chemo-immunotherapy, sCD52 decreased in parallel with leukocytes while during ibrutinib treatment and ibrutinib-induced ymphocytosis, sCD52 decreased along with lymph node reductions. In vitro IgM stimulation of CLL cells led to increased sCD52 levels in the medium.

Moreover, we found that inhibiting autophagy pathway could partially attenuate sertraline-induced apoptosis and cell growth inhibition, indicating that sertraline-induced autophagy process could facilitate AML cell apoptosis to some degree.

Objective: To assess the clinical and biochemical effects of voluntary cardiovascular exercise on pedicled flaps in a rodent model. Design, Setting, and Participants: Eighteen adult Sprague-Dawley male rats were randomized into a resting animal group (RAG) (n=9) and an exercise animal group (EAG) (n=9) for 14 days (July 23, 2013, through July 30, 2013). A pedicled transposition flap was performed on the ventral surface of the rat, and biopsy specimens were taken from the proximal, middle, and distal portions on postoperative days 0, 2, 5, and 9. Flap survival was analyzed planimetrically, and biopsy specimens were analyzed by hematoxylin-eosin-stained microscopy and immunoblotting. The housing, exercise, surgery, and analysis of the rats were conducted at a single basic science research laboratory at the tertiary care center campus of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Exposures: The rats were caged for 14 days or housed in a cage connected to an exercise wheel and pedometer. Main Outcomes and Measures: Study measures were gross and micrographic necrosis and expression of proteins within cell survival and apoptosis pathways. Results: A total of 18 rats were studied, 9 in the RAG and 9 in the EAG. the mean (SEM) amount of necrosis in flaps was 41.3% (3%) in the RAG rats and 10.5% (3.5%) in the EAG rats (P < .001). Immunoblotting revealed increased Caspase-9 activity resulting in poly-(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase 1 cleavage in the RAG vs the EAG, as well as lower phosphorylated protein kinase B (also known as Akt), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3, and total B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein levels. Throughout the postoperative period, the cumulative vascular endothelial growth factor A levels of the EAG flaps were significantly higher than those of the RAG flaps (2.30 vs 1.25 fold induction [FI], P = .002), with differences of 2.76 vs 1.54 FI in the proximal segment, 2.40 vs 1.20 FI in the middle segment, and 1.90 vs 0.79 FI in the distal segment. A similar response was noted when comparing phosphorylated Akt, with cumulative mean (SEM) p-Akt expression levels of 0.62 (0.04) for RAG and 1.98 (0.09) for EAG (P = .002 between the 2 groups). Conclusions and Relevance: Voluntary preoperative exercise improves survival in pedicled fasciocutaneous flaps; the EAG rats had less necrosis, decreased apoptotic markers, and increased amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor A and prosurvival proteins. These results have implications to increase flap survival in other mammal populations, such as humans.

In addition to genetic polymorphism and karyotypic abnormalities, methylation of CpG island 1 (CpG1) in the promoter region is found to modulate GGH activity by reducing GGH mRNA expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. We aim to investigate methylation status of two CpG islands (CpG1 and CpG2) in the GGH promoter region in pediatric patients with ALL and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). METHODS: 70B-ALL, 29 AML, 10 ITP (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura) and 40 healthy children are recruited in the present study. MS-HRM (methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) are used to detect methylation change and its level in CpG1 and CpG2 in the GGH promoter region. GGH mRNA expression is quantified by real-time PCR. Correlation between CpG island methylation and GGH mRNA expression is assessed by statistical software. RESULTS: Methylations of CpG1 are detected in leukemia cells samples obtained from 30.9% (21/68) of patients with ALL and 20.7% (6/29) of patients with AML. These methylations are not detected in the controls. Methylations of CpG2 are detected in leukemia cell samples obtained from 44.1% (30/68) of the ALL patients and 37.9% (11/29) of the AML patients. These percentages are significantly higher than that observed in the control cell samples: 6.0% (3/50) (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.000). The abundance of CpG1 methylation in all leukemia cell samples is classified as Grade I (methylation level is less than 10%) and the abundance of CpG2 methylation in leukemia cell samples is classified in separate grades. Our results indicate that methylation of CpG1 or hypermethylation (the methylation level is greater than 10%) of CpG2 could significantly reduce GGH mRNA expression in leukemia cells from the ALL and AML patients (ALL-CpG1: t = 4.632, P = 0.000; ALL-CpG2: t = 3.250, P = 0.006; AML-CpG1: t = -2.254, P = 0.037; AML-CpG2: t = 1.328, P = 0.202). CONCLUSION: Either methylation of CpG1 or hypermethylation of CpG2 in GGH promoter region can significantly reduce GGH mRNA expression in pediatric patients with acute leukemia, which can improve the response to treatment.",,"['Li, Yue', 'Liu, Sixi', 'Wang, Huihui', 'Mai, Huirong', 'Yuan, Xiuli', 'Li, Changgang', 'Chen, Xiaowen', 'Wen, Feiqiu']","['Li Y', 'Liu S', 'Wang H', 'Mai H', 'Yuan X', 'Li C', 'Chen X', 'Wen F']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Shenzhen Institute of Pediatrics, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3118-3837'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'CpG Islands/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/*genetics']",,,2017/03/10 06:00,2017/09/01 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2016/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0173472 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-48186 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 9;12(3):e0173472. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173472. eCollection 2017.,,['EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)'],PMC5344458,,20170309,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to determine the predictive molecular value at three months on different outcome variables using the Xpert BCR-ABL1 MonitorTM assay (Xpert BCR-ABL1). We monitored 125 newly diagnosed consecutive CML patients in the chronic phase (CML-CP) using an automated method: Xpert BCR-ABL1. Only 5% of patients did not achieve an optimal response at 3 months, and the 10% BCR-ABL1 cutoff defined by RQ-PCR (IS) methods was unable to identify significant differences in the probabilities of achieving a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) (50% vs. 87%, p = 0.1) or a major molecular response (MMR) (60% vs. 80%, p = 0.29) by 12 months. In contrast, a cutoff of 1.5% more accurately identified differences in the probabilities of achieving CCyR (98% vs. 54%, p<0.001) and MMR (88% vs. 56%, p<0.001) by 12 months, as well as probabilities of treatment changes (p = 0.005). Therefore, when using the Xpert BCR-ABL1 assay, a cutoff of 1.5% at 3 months could with high probability identify patients able to achieve an optimal response at 12 months.",,"['Garcia-Gutierrez, Valentin', 'Gomez-Casares, Maria T', 'Puerta, Jose M', 'Alonso-Dominguez, Juan M', 'Osorio, Santiago', 'Hernandez-Boluda, Juan C', 'Collado, Rosa', 'Ramirez, Maria J', 'Ibanez, Fatima', 'Martin, Maria L', 'Rodriguez-Gambarte, Juan D', 'Martinez-Laperche, Carolina', 'Gomez, Montse', 'Fiallo, Dolly V', 'Redondo, Sara', 'Rodriguez, Alicia', 'Ruiz-Nuno, Concepcion', 'Steegmann, Juan L', 'Jimenez-Velasco, Antonio']","['Garcia-Gutierrez V', 'Gomez-Casares MT', 'Puerta JM', 'Alonso-Dominguez JM', 'Osorio S', 'Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Collado R', 'Ramirez MJ', 'Ibanez F', 'Martin ML', 'Rodriguez-Gambarte JD', 'Martinez-Laperche C', 'Gomez M', 'Fiallo DV', 'Redondo S', 'Rodriguez A', 'Ruiz-Nuno C', 'Steegmann JL', 'Jimenez-Velasco A']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Doctor Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Unidad de Gestion Clinica Hematologia y Hemoterapia, Hospital Universitario Virgen de las Nieves, Granada, Spain.', 'Hospital Universitario Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico, Valencia, Spain.', 'Genetic Laboratory, Hematology Department, Consorcio Hospital General Universitario, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital de Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital San Pedro de Alcantara, Caceres, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Doctor Negrin, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Virgen Macarena, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga, IBIMA, Malaga, Spain.', 'Hematology Department & IIS-IP, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Regional Universitario de Malaga, IBIMA, Malaga, Spain.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6421-7872'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,,2017/03/10 06:00,2017/09/07 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2016/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0173532 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-45062 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 9;12(3):e0173532. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173532. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",PMC5344481,,20170309,,,,['Spanish Group of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (GELMC)'],,,,,,,

In recent years, compound BCR-ABL mutations have emerged as a new threat to CML patients by causing higher degrees of resistance involving multiple TKIs, including ponatinib. However, there are limited reports about association of compound BCR-ABL mutations with disease progression in imatinib (IM) sensitive CML patients. Therefore, we investigated presence of ABL-KD mutations in chronic phase (n = 41), late chronic phase (n = 33) and accelerated phase (n = 16) imatinib responders. Direct sequencing analysis was used for this purpose. Eleven patients (12.22%) in late-CP CML were detected having total 24 types of point mutations, out of which 8 (72.72%) harbored compound mutated sites. SH2 contact site mutations were dominant in our study cohort, with E355G (3.33%) being the most prevalent. Five patients (45%) all having compound mutated sites, progressed to advanced phases of disease during follow up studies. Two novel silent mutations G208G and E292E/E were detected in combination with other mutants, indicating limited tolerance for BCR-ABL1 kinase domain for missense mutations. However, no patient in early CP of disease manifested mutated ABL-KD. Occurrence of mutations was found associated with elevated platelet count (p = 0.037) and patients of male sex (p = 0.049). The median overall survival and event free survival of CML patients (n = 90) was 6.98 and 5.8 y respectively. The compound missense mutations in BCR-ABL kinase domain responsible to elicit disease progression, drug resistance or disease relapse in CML, can be present in yet Imatinib sensitive patients. Disease progression observed here, emphasizes the need of ABL-KD mutation screening in late chronic phase CML patients for improved clinical management of disease.",,"['Akram, Afia Muhammad', 'Iqbal, Zafar', 'Akhtar, Tanveer', 'Khalid, Ahmed Mukhtar', 'Sabar, Muhammad Farooq', 'Qazi, Mahmood Hussain', 'Aziz, Zeba', 'Sajid, Nadia', 'Aleem, Aamer', 'Rasool, Mahmood', 'Asif, Muhammad', 'Aloraibi, Saleh', 'Aljamaan, Khaled', 'Iqbal, Mudassar']","['Akram AM', 'Iqbal Z', 'Akhtar T', 'Khalid AM', 'Sabar MF', 'Qazi MH', 'Aziz Z', 'Sajid N', 'Aleem A', 'Rasool M', 'Asif M', 'Aloraibi S', 'Aljamaan K', 'Iqbal M']","['a Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Lahore , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'b Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetic Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories , Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'b Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetic Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories , Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'c Cancer and Medical Genetics, CAMS-A, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences & King Abdullah International Medical Research Centre (KAIMRC), King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs , Al Ahsa , Saudi Arabia.', 'b Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetic Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories , Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'a Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Lahore , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'd Centre for Applied Molecular Biology (CAMB), University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'a Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, The University of Lahore , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'e Department of Oncology , Hameed Latif Hospital , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'f Department of Hematology and Oncology , Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Oncology , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'g College of Medicine and King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia.', 'h Centre of Excellence in Genomic Medicine Research, King Abdulaziz University , Jeddah , Saudi Arabia.', 'i Department of Biotechnology , Office of Research Innovation and Commercialization, Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences , Quetta , Pakistan.', 'j College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard- Health Affairs , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia.', 'k Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Oncology/King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences , King Abdulaziz Medical City, National Guard Health Affairs , Riyadh , Saudi Arabia.', 'b Hematology Oncology and Pharmacogenetic Engineering Sciences (HOPES) Group, Health Sciences Research Laboratories , Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab , Lahore , Pakistan.', 'l Asian Medical Institute, Kant City, & National Surgical Centre , Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/blood/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Platelet Count', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*BCR-ABL', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*compound mutations', '*disease progression', '*late chronic phase']",2017/03/10 06:00,2018/03/10 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2017.1294289 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2017 Apr 3;18(4):214-221. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2017.1294289.

MDS is heterogeneous in biology and clinical behavior. MDS are generally divided into lower-risk (LR) and higher-risk (HR) MDS. Goals of care in HR-MDS focus on changing the natural history of the disease, whereas in LR-MDS symptom control and quality of life are the main goals. Areas covered: We review the epidemiology, tools of risk assessment, and the available therapeutic modalities for LR-MDS. We discuss the use of erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs), immunosuppressive therapy (IST), lenalidomide and the hypomethylating agents (HMAs). We also discuss the predictors of response, combination treatment modalities, and management of iron overload. Lastly, we overview the most promising investigational agents for LR-MDS. Expert commentary: It remains unclear how to best incorporate a wealth of new genetic and epigenetic prognostic markers into risk assessment tools especially for LR-MDS patients. Only a subset of patients respond to current treatment modalities and most responders eventually lose their response. Once standard therapeutic options fail, management becomes more challenging. Combination-based approaches have been largely unsuccessful. Among the most promising investigational are the TPO agonists, TGF- beta pathway inhibitors, telomerase inhibitors, and the splicing modifiers.",,"['Stahl, Maximilian', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Stahl M', 'Zeidan AM']","['a Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University and the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'a Section of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology, Yale University and the Yale Comprehensive Cancer Center , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,IM,"['Anemia, Macrocytic', 'Biomarkers', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy/methods', 'Disease Management', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Standard of Care', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Myelodysplastic syndrome', '*epigenetics', '*erythropoiesis stimulating agents', '*hypomethylating agents', '*immunosuppressive therapy', '*lenalidomide', '*lower-risk']",2017/03/10 06:00,2017/05/19 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2017.1297704 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2017 Apr;10(4):345-364. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2017.1297704.

Self-renewal is essential in embryogenesis and normal tissue repair and homeostasis. However, in cancer, self-renewal pathways, e.g. WNT, NOTCH, Hedgehog and BMP, frequently become de-regulated in stem cells, or more mature progenitor cells acquire self-renewal properties, resulting in abnormal tissue growth and tumorigenesis. Areas covered: This review considers the conserved embryonic self-renewal pathways, including WNT, NOTCH, Hedgehog and BMP. The article describes recent advances in our understanding of these pathways in leukemia and, more specifically, leukemia stem cells (LSC), how these pathways cross-talk and interact with the LSC microenvironment, and discusses the clinical implications and potential therapeutic strategies, both in preclinical and in clinical trials for hematological malignancies. Expert opinion: The conserved embryonic self-renewal pathways are frequently de-regulated in cancer stem cells (CSC), including LSCs. There is significant cross-talk between self-renewal pathways, and their downstream targets, and the microenvironment. Effective targeting of these pathways is challenging due to cross-talk, and importantly, because these pathways are important for normal stem cells as well as CSC, adverse effects on normal tissues may mean a therapeutic window cannot be identified. Nonetheless, several agents targeting these pathways are currently in clinical trials in hematological malignancies.",,"['Horne, Gillian A', 'Copland, Mhairi']","['Horne GA', 'Copland M']","[""a Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences , University of Glasgow , Glasgow , UK."", ""a Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences , University of Glasgow , Glasgow , UK.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Drug Discov,Expert opinion on drug discovery,101295755,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Hedgehog', '*Notch', '*Self-renewal', '*Wnt', '*bone morphogenic protein', '*cancer stem cell', '*leukemia stem cell', '*microenvironment']",2017/03/10 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17460441.2017.1303477 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Discov. 2017 May;12(5):465-474. doi: 10.1080/17460441.2017.1303477.

Here, we identified five novel NF-kappaB target genes. Firstly, we found that 20 NF-kappaB potential target genes (PTGs) identified by ChIP-Seq and Genechip assay were enriched into the KEGG term of Pathways in cancer, 16 of them were enriched into the KEGG pathways of small cell lung cancer, chronic myeloid leukemia, basal cell carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. Among these PTGs, there are many documented NF-kappaB target genes. Therefore, NF-kappaB may play important role in cancer progression by transcriptionally regulating these genes. Apart from the known target genes, we also found some novel PTGs including CYCS, MITF, FZD1, FZD8, and PIAS1. We subsequently demonstrated whether NF-kappaB transcriptionally control the five PTGs. The ChIP-Seq assay revealed that NF-kappaB/p65 bound to these genes in TNFalpha-treated HeLa. The bioinformatic analysis indicated that the NF-kappaB binding regions (i.e., ChIP-Seq peaks) contained kappaB sites and NF-kappaB/RelA DNA-binding motif. The ChIP-qPCR assay also confirmed that NF-kappaB bound to these regions in both TNFalpha-treated HeLa and HepG2 cells. The reporter construct showed that NF-kappaB could regulate luciferase expression via its binding region. Finally, qPCR and Western blot assay demonstrated that NF-kappaB indeed regulated the expression of these genes in the TNFalpha-treated HeLa and HepG2 cells. In a word, CYCS, MITF, FZD1, FZD8, and PIAS1 were identified as bona fide NF-kappaB target genes.

Beside intrinsic genetic features characterizing the leukemic cell, signals coming from the microenvironment have a key role in promoting cell survival and in protecting CLL cells from the action of drugs. Consequently, the identification of previously unrecognized genetic lesions is important in risk-stratification of CLL patients and is progressively becoming a critical tool for choosing the best therapeutic strategy. Significant efforts have also been dedicated to define microenvironment-dependent mechanisms that sustain leukemic cells favoring survival, proliferation, and accumulation of additional genetic lesions. Furthermore, understanding the molecular and biological mechanisms, potentially driving disease progression and chemoresistance, is the first step to design therapies that could be effective in high-risk patients. Significant progress has been made in the identification of the different mechanisms through which patients relapse after ""new"" and ""old"" therapies. These studies have led to the development of targeted strategies to overcome, or even prevent, resistance through the design of novel agents or their combination.In this chapter we will give an overview of the main therapeutic options for CLL patients and review the mechanisms of resistance responsible for treatment failure.

Several studies showed higher rates of major molecular remission (MMR) at 12 months with 800 mg compared to 400 mg, suggesting that high-dose imatinib may be the appropriate comparator rather than 400 mg. METHODS: We systematically reviewed randomized trials comparing the two dosages, calculated a common estimator and compared the result to a common estimator of trials evaluating a second generation TKI in comparison with 400 mg imatinib daily. RESULTS: We identified three trials comparing 400-800 mg imatinib resulting in a common relative risk of 1.30 (1.13-1.49) and indicating a significantly higher rate of MMR in patients treated with 800 mg imatinib (p = 0.0003). We identified five trials comparing 400 mg imatinib daily to a second generation TKI. The common relative risk for MMR at 12 months was 1.69 (1.50-1.90, p < 0.0001). Differences in the prognostic profiles precluded a direct comparison of the common efficacy estimates. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that imatinib was probably not licensed at the optimal dose initially. We suggest that in the future, new TKIs are compared with a higher dose of imatinib. In addition, high-dose imatinib should be considered more often for routine clinical decisions based on the characteristics of the individual patient.",,"['Hoffmann, Verena S', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger']","['Hoffmann VS', 'Hasford J', 'Deininger M', 'Cortes J', 'Baccarani M', 'Hehlmann R']","['Institute for Medical Information Sciences, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377, Munich, Germany. verena.s.hoffmann@lrz.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine, Medical Center of the University of Munich (LMU), Munich, Germany. verena.s.hoffmann@lrz.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Institute for Medical Information Sciences, Biometry, and Epidemiology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377, Munich, Germany.', 'University of Utah Huntsman Cancer Institute, Salt Lake City, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology L. and A.

Due to its activity in regulating the cell cycle, it has also been evaluated for the treatment of other cancers. However, the efficacy of atRA has been limited by atRA inducing its own metabolism during therapy, resulting in a decrease of atRA exposure during continuous dosing. Frequent relapse occurs in patients receiving atRA monotherapy. In an attempt to combat therapy resistance, inhibitors of atRA metabolism have been developed. Of these, ketoconazole and liarozole have shown some benefits, but their usage is limited by side effects and low potency toward the cytochrome P450 26A1 isoform (CYP26A1), the main atRA hydroxylase. We determined the pharmacokinetic basis of therapy resistance to atRA and tested whether the complex disposition kinetics of atRA could be predicted in healthy subjects and in cancer patients in the presence and absence of inhibitors of atRA metabolism using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling. A PBPK model of atRA disposition was developed and verified in healthy individuals and in cancer patients. The population-based PBPK model of atRA disposition incorporated saturable metabolic clearance of atRA, induction of CYP26A1 by atRA, and the absorption and distribution kinetics of atRA. It accurately predicted the changes in atRA exposure after continuous dosing and when coadministered with ketoconazole and liarozole. The developed model will be useful in interpretation of atRA disposition and efficacy, design of novel dosing strategies, and development of next-generation atRA metabolism inhibitors.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Jing, Jing', 'Nelson, Cara', 'Paik, Jisun', 'Shirasaka, Yoshiyuki', 'Amory, John K', 'Isoherranen, Nina']","['Jing J', 'Nelson C', 'Paik J', 'Shirasaka Y', 'Amory JK', 'Isoherranen N']","['Department of Pharmaceutics (J.J., C.N., Y.S., N.I.), Department of Medicine (J.A.), and Department of Comparative Medicine (J.P.), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics (J.J., C.N., Y.S., N.I.), Department of Medicine (J.A.), and Department of Comparative Medicine (J.P.), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics (J.J., C.N., Y.S., N.I.), Department of Medicine (J.A.), and Department of Comparative Medicine (J.P.), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics (J.J., C.N., Y.S., N.I.), Department of Medicine (J.A.), and Department of Comparative Medicine (J.P.), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics (J.J., C.N., Y.S., N.I.), Department of Medicine (J.A.), and Department of Comparative Medicine (J.P.), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics (J.J., C.N., Y.S., N.I.), Department of Medicine (J.A.), and Department of Comparative Medicine (J.P.), University of Washington, Seattle, Washington ni2@uw.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Biopharmaceutics/methods', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Interactions', 'Humans', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase/*metabolism', 'Tissue Distribution', '*Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics']",,,2017/03/10 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2017/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['jpet.117.240523 [pii]', '10.1124/jpet.117.240523 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2017 May;361(2):246-258. doi: 10.1124/jpet.117.240523.

In contrast, both Bar-Me and CF3DODA-Me induce reactive oxygen species in HL-60 and Jurkat leukemia cells, inhibit cell growth, induce apoptosis and differentiation, and decrease expression of specificity proteins (Sp) 1, 3, and 4, and cMyc, and these effects are significantly attenuated after cotreatment with the antioxidant GSH. In contrast to solid tumor-derived cells, cMyc and Sp transcriptions are regulated independently and cMyc plays a more predominant role than Sp transcription factors in regulating HL-60 or Jurkat cell proliferation and differentiation compared with that observed in cells derived from solid tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Jin, Un-Ho', 'Cheng, Yating', 'Zhou, Beiyan', 'Safe, Stephen']","['Jin UH', 'Cheng Y', 'Zhou B', 'Safe S']","['Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.', 'Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas ssafe@cvm.tamu.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Sp Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Triterpenes/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,2017/03/10 06:00,2017/05/10 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['mol.116.106245 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.116.106245 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2017 May;91(5):438-450. doi: 10.1124/mol.116.106245.

However, the mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to characterize the plasma lipid profile, Apo distribution, and lipoprotein composition of 80 childhood ALL survivors compared with 22 healthy controls. Our results show that, despite their young age, 50% of the ALL survivors displayed dyslipidemia, characterized by increased plasma triglyceride (TG) and LDL-cholesterol, as well as decreased HDL-cholesterol. ALL survivors exhibited lower plasma Apo A-I and higher Apo B-100 and C-II levels, along with elevated Apo C-II/C-III and B-100/A-I ratios. VLDL fractions of dyslipidemic ALL survivors contained more TG, free cholesterol, and phospholipid moieties, but less protein. Differences in Apo content were found between ALL survivors and controls for all lipoprotein fractions except HDL3 HDL2, especially, showed reduced Apo A-I and raised Apo A-II, leading to a depressed Apo A-I/A-II ratio. Analysis of VLDL-Apo Cs disclosed a trend for higher Apo C-III1 content in dyslipidemic ALL survivors. In conclusion, this thorough investigation demonstrates a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in ALL survivors, while highlighting significant abnormalities in their plasma lipid profile and lipoprotein composition. Special attention must, therefore, be paid to these subjects given the atherosclerotic potency of lipid and lipoprotein disorders.","['Copyright (c) 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular', 'Biology, Inc.']","['Morel, Sophia', 'Leahy, Jade', 'Fournier, Maryse', 'Lamarche, Benoit', 'Garofalo, Carole', 'Grimard, Guy', 'Poulain, Floriane', 'Delvin, Edgard', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Marcil, Valerie', 'Levy, Emile']","['Morel S', 'Leahy J', 'Fournier M', 'Lamarche B', 'Garofalo C', 'Grimard G', 'Poulain F', 'Delvin E', 'Laverdiere C', 'Krajinovic M', 'Drouin S', 'Sinnett D', 'Marcil V', 'Levy E']","['Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Nutrition Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Nutrition Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Nutrition Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec, Quebec, Canada G1V 0A6.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Department of Nutrition Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5 emile.levy@recherche-ste-justine.qc.ca.', 'Department of Nutrition Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3T 1C5.', 'Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods, Laval University, Quebec, Quebec, Canada G1V 0A6.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,IM,"['Apolipoproteins E/blood/genetics', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Dyslipidemias/complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/genetics', 'Lipoproteins/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*apolipoproteins', '*atherosclerosis', '*cancer', '*cardiovascular diseases', '*clinical studies', '*dyslipidemia', '*lipid and lipoprotein metabolism', '*metabolic syndrome']",2017/03/10 06:00,2017/12/23 06:00,['2017/03/10 06:00'],"['2016/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2275(20)33834-7 [pii]', '10.1194/jlr.M072207 [doi]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 2017 May;58(5):982-993. doi: 10.1194/jlr.M072207.

While it functions as either oncogene or tumor suppressor in a context-dependent manner, the expression and role of USP9X in gastric cancer is largely unknown. METHODS: Sixty-eight cases of patients with gastric cancer were enrolled in this study. The expression of USP9X and MCL1 were detected by immunohistochemistry. USP9X expression was further analyzed by Western blot. Furthermore, we analyzed the correlation between USP9X and MCL1 expression, as well as USP9X expression and clinicopathologic parameters of gastric cancer. Finally, the significance of USP9X expression in gastric cancer was analyzed by both Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: USP9X expression significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared to matched normal tissues. Moreover, expression of USP9X was positive correlated with MCL1 expression (P=0.006) and significant associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.016), distant metastasis (P=0.001) and tumor staging (P=0.013) in gastric cancer. Importantly, the increasing expression of USP9X in gastric cancer reduces overall survival rate and was an independent factor predicts poor prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, deubiquitylating enzyme USP9X was overexpressed in gastric cancer, suggesting a potential implication as an oncogene, and was significantly associated with a poorer survival.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The objective of this report is to determine the reasons precluding intraoperative randomization. METHODS: From June 15, 2007, to March 22, 2013, 637 patients were preregistered to the trial. Three hundred eighty-nine were randomized successfully (61%), and 248 patients were not randomized (39%). We analyzed the reasons for nonrandomization among a subset of the nonrandomized patients (208) for whom additional data were available. RESULTS: Of these 208 patients, undiagnosed benign nodules (n =104, 16% of all registered patients) and understaging of NSCLC (n =45, 7% of all registered patients) were the dominant reasons precluding randomization. Granulomas represent one-quarter of the benign nodules. The understaged patients had unsuspected nodal metastases (n =28) or other more advanced NSCLC. The rate of randomization was significantly greater in those patients who had a preoperative biopsy (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: In a carefully monitored cohort of patients with suspected small NSCLC </=2 cm, a substantial number are misdiagnosed (benign nodules) or understaged. These patients may not have benefited from a thoracic surgical procedure. Preoperative biopsy significantly increased the rate of correct diagnosis. Preoperative biopsy of small suspected NSCLC will reduce the number of nontherapeutic or unnecessary thoracic procedures. Accuracy in preoperative diagnosis is increasingly important as more such small nodules are discovered through lung cancer screening.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery.

Patients with high-risk ALL are often managed with transplant using a radiation-based conditioning regimen. Historically, a high-dose prophylactic cranial boost (CB) of >/=12 Gy was given to reduce risk of central nervous system (CNS) recurrence. However, the use of CB has fallen out of favor because of toxicity concerns. In high-risk adults undergoing transplant at our institution, we have used a low-dose 6 Gy CB to reduce toxicity while conditioning adults with fully developed brains. The safety, efficacy, and utility of a low-dose CB in adults are poorly studied; herein, we report their outcomes and toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We identified all high-risk ALL patients undergoing total body irradiation as part of their conditioning regimen. Those who received 6 Gy CB or no CB were included (55 total). Their charts were reviewed and statistical analyses were completed with R, version 2.15.2. RESULTS: In patients undergoing CB, 3-year CNS disease-free survival and overall survival were 94.7% and 62.7%. In those not undergoing CBs, survivals were 81.8% and 51.5%. Notably, within the CB cohort, patients without prior CNS involvement had no CNS failures. In contrast, in the non-CB cohort, there were 2 CNS failures in patients with no history of CNS involvement. In the CB cohort, the only notable acute toxicity was parotitis (2.8%). Late toxicity in the CB cohort included 1 instance of cataracts (2.8%) without any evidence of cognitive impairment or potential radiation induced secondary malignancy. CONCLUSIONS: A dose of 6 Gy CB is well-tolerated in the adult ALL population as part of a radiation-based conditioning regimen. Low-dose CB may be considered in adult patients with high-risk ALL without prior CNS involvement to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

This study aims to demonstrate that cancer research in Iran concentrates on the cancer research priorities based on the global burden of disease (GBD) reports. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive evaluation of all cancers disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) was performed using GBD data. Also a comprehensive search was conducted using cancer-associated keywords to obtain all cancer-related publications from Iran, indexed in Web of Science. METHOD: Multiple regression analysis and correlation coefficients (R(2)) were used to evaluate the possible associations between cancer research publications and GBD. RESULTS: During 1996-2014, the majority of cancer-related publications in Iran focused on breast cancer, leukaemia and stomach cancer, respectively. This study found hypothetical correlations between cancer publications in Iran in line with the burden of cancer as reported by GBD. Particularly, correlations between years lived with disability (YLD) and cancer-related publications were more obvious.

The present study aims to comprehend the biological attributes of Rhus punjabensis, an unexplored traditional medicinal plant. METHODS: Leaf and stem extracts of R. punjabensis prepared in 11 different organic solvents are evaluated for multimode antioxidant potential, total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined through colorimetric assays, HPLC-DAD analysis was carried out for quantification of various polyphenols in extracts. Brine shrimp lethality, SRB and MTT assays were used to elucidate plant's cytotoxic and antileishmanial potentials. Disc diffusion assay was used to elucidate the protein kinase inhibitory, antibacterial and antifungal spectrum. RESULTS: Ethanol + ethyl acetate yielded maximum extract recovery from leaf (6.11 +/- 1.09% w/w), total phenolic content (80.5 +/- 2.18 mug GAE/mg extract) and reducing power potential (165.4 +/- 2.29 mug AAE/mg extract). Maximum flavonoid content (30.50 +/- 1.11 mug QE/mg extract) and highest DPPH based free radical scavenging activity (IC50 11.4 +/- 2.07) was exhibited by the methanol + chloroform leaf extract. The methanol extract showed maximum total antioxidant capacity (74.5 +/- 2.25 mug AAE/mg DW), protein kinase inhibitory (12.5 +/- 1.10 bald phenotype at 100 mug/disc) and antifungal (MIC = 25 mug/disc against Aspergillus flavus) potential. Reverse phase HPLC-DAD based quantification reveals presence of gallic acid, apigenin, rutin and catechin in various extracts. Brine shrimp lethality assay demonstrated most extracts as highly cytotoxic (LC50 < 50 mug/mL) whereas chloroform extract of leaf demonstrated maximuminhibition against human leukemia cell line (IC50 7.80 +/- 0.01 mug/mL). A significant activity against leishmanial promastigotes was demonstrated by n-hexane leaf extract (IC50 = 15.78 +/- 0.15 mug/mL). A better antibacterial activity,by the extracts, against Gram positive strains as compared to Gram negative was observed.

These mutations distinctively produce (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2-HG) from alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG). (D)-2-hydroxyglutarate is accumulated to very high concentrations which inhibit the function of enzymes that are dependent on alpha-ketoglutarate. This modification leads to a hyper-methylated state of DNA and histones, resulting in different gene expression that can activate oncogenes and inactivate tumor-suppressor genes. In our work we review the impact of the mutations that occur in IDH genes, we focus on their impact on distribution in cancer. As IDH mutations appear in many different conditions we expose the extent of IDH mutations and derivate their impact on cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and even their oncogenicity, we will also link their impact to HIF-1alpha and derivate some target and finally, we present some of the therapeutics under research and out on market.",['Copyright (c) 2017.

We conducted efficacy and safety analyses on the basis of more than 10 years of follow-up in patients with CML who were treated with imatinib as initial therapy. METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter trial with crossover design, we randomly assigned patients with newly diagnosed CML in the chronic phase to receive either imatinib or interferon alfa plus cytarabine. Long-term analyses included overall survival, response to treatment, and serious adverse events. RESULTS: The median follow-up was 10.9 years. Given the high rate of crossover among patients who had been randomly assigned to receive interferon alfa plus cytarabine (65.6%) and the short duration of therapy before crossover in these patients (median, 0.8 years), the current analyses focused on patients who had been randomly assigned to receive imatinib. Among the patients in the imatinib group, the estimated overall survival rate at 10 years was 83.3%. Approximately half the patients (48.3%) who had been randomly assigned to imatinib completed study treatment with imatinib, and 82.8% had a complete cytogenetic response. Serious adverse events that were considered by the investigators to be related to imatinib were uncommon and most frequently occurred during the first year of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Almost 11 years of follow-up showed that the efficacy of imatinib persisted over time and that long-term administration of imatinib was not associated with unacceptable cumulative or late toxic effects.

Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog-1 (SIRT1) is overexpressed in most cancer cells by increasing proliferation as a tumorigenic gene. The present study was performed to investigate the underlying interaction between miR-9 and SIRT1 in AE-positive AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression of miR-9 and SIRT1 in AE-positive AML patients, healthy donors and AML cell lines were detected by qPCR. Relevance between miR-9 and SIRT1 was assessed by plasmid transfection, Western blot and correlation analysis. Luciferase assay was used to confirm the target gene of miR-9. Knockdown of SIRT1 in different cell lines was achieved by shRNA transfection and CCK-8 assay was used to investigate the effects on cell proliferation. RESULTS: The miR-9 expression was lower in AE-positive cell lines compared to that in other AE-negative AML cell lines, while expression of SIRT1 was higher in AE-positive cell lines. Expression of miR-9 was also downregulated in adult primary t(8;21) AML patients compared to healthy donors. The over-expression of miR-9 decreased luciferase activity of wild-type SIRT1, which was recovered after transfection with mutant SIRT1. The miR-9 directly targets SIRT1 by binding to its 3'-untranslated region and reducing its protein levels. Importantly, miR-9 and SIRT1 mRNA levels were inversely correlated in AE-positive AML cell lines and t(8;21) AML primary leukemia cells. Knockdown of SIRT1 levels using shSIRT1 inhibited cell proliferation in AE-positive AML cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: SIRT1 is the target gene of miR-9 and the signaling pathway connecting miR-9 and SIRT1 is a therapeutic target for t(8;21) AML.",,"['Zhou, L', 'Fu, L', 'Lv, N', 'Chen, X-S', 'Liu, J', 'Li, Y', 'Xu, Q-Y', 'Huang, S', 'Zhang, X-D', 'Dou, L-P', 'Wang, L L', 'Li, Y-H', 'Yu, L']","['Zhou L', 'Fu L', 'Lv N', 'Chen XS', 'Liu J', 'Li Y', 'Xu QY', 'Huang S', 'Zhang XD', 'Dou LP', 'Wang LL', 'Li YH', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China. chunhuiliyu@yahoo.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirtuin 1/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2017/03/09 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2017 Feb;21(4):786-794.,,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the most important drugs in the CML therapy and provide long disease-free survival. Due to the increased survival of CML patients with continual administration of these drugs, the chance of development of secondary malignancies may increase. The most common secondary malignancies are prostate, colorectal and lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, malignant melanoma, non-melanoma skin tumors and breast cancer. Herein, we are describing a rare case of Hodgkin lymphoma in a patient of CML after ten year of primary disease presentation. Hodgkin lymphoma in a known case of CML is very rare and further studies are also needed to know the pathogenic relationship between the two entities and to assess the risk of secondary Hodgkin lymphoma in CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CML itself is a risk factor for development of solid cancers and hematologic malignancies. In addition, patients on chemotherapy are immune-compromised and may be at greater risk of neoplasm driven by infectious agents such as Epstein-Barr virus.",,"['Gajendra, Smeeta', 'Sharma, Archana', 'Sharma, Rashi', 'Gupta, Sunil Kumar', 'Sood, Nitin', 'Sachdev, Ritesh']","['Gajendra S', 'Sharma A', 'Sharma R', 'Gupta SK', 'Sood N', 'Sachdev R']","['Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Medanta the Medicity, GURGAON, INDIA.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Turkey,Turk Patoloji Derg,Turk patoloji dergisi,9440471,,"['Centrosome/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/chemically induced', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hodgkin Disease/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Time Factors']",,,2017/03/09 06:00,2019/08/07 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.5146/tjpath.2016.01368 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk Patoloji Derg. 2019;35(1):74-78. doi: 10.5146/tjpath.2016.01368.,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,Hodgkin Lymphoma in a Case of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Treated with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors.,,,,

Zinc is an important essential trace metal, whose deficiency is associated with various chronic ailments, including vascular diseases. We assessed T2DM B6.BKS(D)-Leprdb/J (db/db) mice fed for six months on a normal diet containing three zinc levels (deficient, adequate, and supplemented), to explore the role of zinc in DCM development and progression. Cardiac function, reflected by ejection fraction, was significantly decreased, along with increased left ventricle mass and heart weight to tibial length ratio, in db/db mice. As a molecular cardiac hypertrophy marker, atrial natriuretic peptide levels were also significantly increased. Cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy were accompanied by significantly increased fibrotic (elevated collagen accumulation as well as transforming growth factor beta and connective tissue growth factor levels) and inflammatory (enhanced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta, caspase recruitment domain family member 9, and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10, and activated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase) responses in the heart. All these diabetic effects were exacerbated by zinc deficiency, and not affected by zinc supplementation, respectively. Mechanistically, oxidative stress and damage, mirrored by the accumulation of 3-nitrotyrosine and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, was significantly increased along with significantly decreased expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidants (NQO-1 and catalase). This was also exacerbated by zinc deficiency in the db/db mouse heart. These results suggested that zinc deficiency promotes the development and progression of DCM in T2DM db/db mice. The exacerbated effects by zinc deficiency on the heart of db/db mice may be related to further suppression of Nrf2 expression and function.",,"['Wang, Shudong', 'Wang, Bowei', 'Wang, Yuehui', 'Tong, Qian', 'Liu, Quan', 'Sun, Jian', 'Zheng, Yang', 'Cai, Lu']","['Wang S', 'Wang B', 'Wang Y', 'Tong Q', 'Liu Q', 'Sun J', 'Zheng Y', 'Cai L']","['Cardiovascular Center & Geriatric Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China. wangshudong816@163.com.', 'Pediatric Research Institute, The Department of Pediatrics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. wangshudong816@163.com.', 'Pediatric Research Institute, The Department of Pediatrics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. wangbw@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Gynecology and Obstetrics, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130041, Jilin, China. wangbw@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Cardiovascular Center & Geriatric Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China. yuehuiwang300@hotmail.com.', 'Cardiovascular Center & Geriatric Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China. tongqian@126.com.', 'Cardiovascular Center & Geriatric Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China. liuquan@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Cardiovascular Center & Geriatric Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China. sunjian@163.com.', 'Cardiovascular Center & Geriatric Medicine, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, Jilin, China. zhengyang@jlu.edu.cn.', 'Pediatric Research Institute, The Department of Pediatrics, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. l0cai001@louisville.edu.', 'Wendy Novak Diabetes Care Center, Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY 40202, USA. l0cai001@louisville.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications', 'Diabetic Cardiomyopathies/*etiology/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Dietary Supplements', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fibrosis', 'Inflammation/etiology/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Liver/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/metabolism/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Protective Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Zinc/*administration & dosage/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['diabetic cardiomyopathy', 'inflammation', 'nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2', 'oxidative stress', 'zinc supplement']",2017/03/09 06:00,2017/04/30 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18030580 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18030580 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Mar 7;18(3). pii: ijms18030580. doi: 10.3390/ijms18030580.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Protective Agents)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",PMC5372596,,20170307,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENT CONCERNS: We report 4 cases of AML cutis, where skin infiltration precedes any blood or bone marrow evidence of leukemia. We also reviewed 13 cases reported in English and Chinese literature. The 4 cases all presented typical cutaneous lesions without any systemic evidence of leukemia. Histopathological examination found that dense monomorphous cell infiltration involved the dermis. Some cells surrounded blood vessels and skin appendages in a concentric manner or showed single-row arrangement in the collagen fiber bundles. Uninvolved papillary dermis was found to separate normal epidermis from dermal infiltration. Minor cells had a large kidney-shaped or oval nucleus with nucleoli and slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemical analysis was positive for CD4, CD56, while CD123 was negative in all cases. DIAGNOSES: AML-M5. INTERVENTIONS: 2 patients received chemotherapy ,but others rejected treatment. OUTCOMES: Most patients died within 1 year after the onset of skin lesions. LESSONS: These findings suggest that skin infiltration of AML may precede any systemic evidence, and typical cutaneous lesions in elderly individuals may be indicative for AML.",,"['Jin, Xianhua', 'Li, Fuqiu', 'Li, Xue', 'Zhu, Wenjing', 'Mou, Yan', 'Huang, Yang', 'Zhao, Huanyu', 'Gao, Wei', 'Xia, Jianxin']","['Jin X', 'Li F', 'Li X', 'Zhu W', 'Mou Y', 'Huang Y', 'Zhao H', 'Gao W', 'Xia J']","['Department of Dermatology, The Second Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Skin/*pathology']",,,2017/03/09 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000006269 [doi]', '00005792-201703100-00047 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Mar;96(10):e6269. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000006269.,,,PMC5348187,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) involved the RhoA/Rho kinase signaling pathway responsible for the cytoskeletal arrangement, and previous studies have revealed that inhibition of MLCK induces apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In this study, glycogen-induced neutrophils isolated from rats or mice were incubated with ML-7, a MLCK-specific inhibitor, and LPS-induced ALI mice administrated with ML-7 were investigated, to demonstrate the roles of MLCK in neutrophil apoptosis as well as its possibility of contributing to the clearance of inflammation. We found that ML-7 dramatically promoted neutrophil apoptosis that possibly signal through the p38 to upregulate the expression of the apoptotic proteins caspase-9 and B-cell lymphoma 2 and to downregulate the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2-associated X protein and myeloid cell leukemia-1. In mice, ML-7 accelerated the clearance of inflammation in LPS-induced ALI through attenuating neutrophil accumulation, histopathological changes, and pulmonary edema. ML-7 promoted elimination of inflammation possibly by accelerating neutrophil apoptosis and macrophage-mediated clearance. Moreover, ML-7 also reduced the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and the activity of myeloperoxidase. Taken together, the present study uncovers a hitherto uncharacterized role of MLCK in neutrophil apoptosis that contributes to the alleviation of inflammation in response to LPS.",,"['Shi, Wei', 'Xu, Chengyun', 'Hussain, Musaddique', 'Wu, Fugen', 'Lu, Meiping', 'Wu, Xiling', 'Tang, Lanfang', 'Wu, Ximei', 'Wu, Junsong']","['Shi W', 'Xu C', 'Hussain M', 'Wu F', 'Lu M', 'Wu X', 'Tang L', 'Wu X', 'Wu J']","[""*Department of Critical Care Medicine, The First Affiliated Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou City, China daggerDepartment of Pharmacology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou City, China double daggerDepartment of Paediatrics, The First People's Hospital of Wenling City, Wenling City, China section signDepartment of Respiratory Medicine, The Affiliated Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou City, China.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Shock,"Shock (Augusta, Ga.)",9421564,IM,"['Acute Lung Injury/chemically induced/*enzymology/pathology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/enzymology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,,2017/03/09 06:00,2018/05/05 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/05/05 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/SHK.0000000000000863 [doi]'],ppublish,Shock. 2017 Sep;48(3):377-386. doi: 10.1097/SHK.0000000000000863.,,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', 'EC 2.7.11.18 (Myosin-Light-Chain Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is little data in literature available regarding its presentation in medullary chronic phase (CP) as well as outcomes in the era of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and needs to be carefully evaluated as it can present the first sign of progressive disease before haematological progression. METHODS: We identified cases of MS presenting with medullary CML-CP from January 2002 to December 2015. We analyzed their clinical profile and outcomes with TKI. RESULTS: Only 8 out of 615 CML-CP cases developed MS. Median age of presentation was 43 years with male: female ratio of 1.7:1. Sites of presentation were soft tissue deposits (7 cases) and lymph nodes (2 cases). All the cases had myeloblastic morphology. With higher dose Imatinib/Nilotinib, median overall survival was 14 months with longest survival of 36 months in a case on Nilotinib while 4 patients progressed to medullary BP at a median duration of 9 months (2-10) and expired. CONCLUSION: MS in medullary CML-CP carries better prognosis than medullary CML-BP. Due to rarity of presentation, MS presenting in soft tissues might be overlooked as an infection/hematoma unless proven otherwise.

There are limited studies of use of Imatinib Mesylate (IM) alone in management of CML in this age group. METHOD: We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 30 consecutive children with CML chronic phase treated with IM alone. RESULTS: The median age at the time of diagnosis was 11 years with male preponderance. Asthenia and abdominal discomfort due to splenomegaly were the most common presenting features and splenomegaly a dominant sign. At time of starting IM, 19 children were in early CP while 11 were in late CP. Complete hematological remission was achieved in 90% with a median time to achieve CHR was 60 days. Among evaluable children, 83.3% achieved cytogenetic response (CyGR). Those who achieved complete CyGR were in major molecular remission at the time of last follow up. At 3 years, progression-free survival was 81.5% and overall survival was 100%. At 10 years, 12 (40%) children failed on IM therapy of which 3(10%) children developed primary IM resistance while 9 (30%) developed secondary IM resistance. IM was well tolerated and severe (grade III-IV) events were infrequent. Non-haematological toxicities were uncommon except hypopigmentation of skin which was seen in 60% of the cohort. CONCLUSION: Presenting features of CML-CP in children is comparable to other Indian and international studies. IM is very effective and safe drug for the first line treatment of CML-CP in children. It is very effective in inducing CHR. Adherence to treatment is very important for achieving CyGR and long term survival.

OBJECTIVE: To describe a family with Emberger syndrome with incomplete penetrance. METHODS: A DNA sequencing of GATA2 gene was performed in the parents and offspring (five individuals in total). RESULTS: The family consisted of 5 individuals with a GATA2 null mutation (c.130G>T, p.Glu44*); three of them were affected (two of which were deceased) while two remained unaffected at the age of 40 and 13 years old. The three affected siblings (two boys and one girl) presented with lymphedema of the lower limbs, recurrent warts, epistaxis and recurrent infections. Two died due to hematological abnormalities (AML and pancytopenia). In contrast, the two other family members who carry the same mutation (the mother and one brother) have not presented any symptoms and their blood tests remain normal. DISCUSSION: Incomplete penetrance may indicate that GATA2 haploinsufficiency is not enough to produce the phenotype of Emberger syndrome. It could be useful to perform whole exome or genome sequencing, in cases where incomplete penetrance or high variable expressivity is described, in order to probably identify specific gene interactions that drastically modify the phenotype. In addition, skewed gene expression by an epigenetic mechanism of gene regulation should also be considered.",,"['Brambila-Tapia, Aniel Jessica Leticia', 'Garcia-Ortiz, Jose Elias', 'Brouillard, Pascal', 'Nguyen, Ha-Long', 'Vikkula, Miikka', 'Rios-Gonzalez, Blanca Estela', 'Sandoval-Muniz, Roberto de Jesus', 'Sandoval-Talamantes, Ana Karen', 'Bobadilla-Morales, Lucina', 'Corona-Rivera, Jorge Roman', 'Arnaud-Lopez, Lisette']","['Brambila-Tapia AJL', 'Garcia-Ortiz JE', 'Brouillard P', 'Nguyen HL', 'Vikkula M', 'Rios-Gonzalez BE', 'Sandoval-Muniz RJ', 'Sandoval-Talamantes AK', 'Bobadilla-Morales L', 'Corona-Rivera JR', 'Arnaud-Lopez L']","['a Departamento de Psicologia Basica , Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS), Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'b Division de Genetica, Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Occidente (CIBO) , Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'c Human Molecular Genetics , de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain , Brussels , Belgium.', 'c Human Molecular Genetics , de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain , Brussels , Belgium.', 'c Human Molecular Genetics , de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain , Brussels , Belgium.', 'd Walloon Excellence in Life sciences and Biotechnology (WELBIO) , Universite catholique de Louvain , Brussels , Belgium.', 'e Unidad Medico Familiar #34 , Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS) , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'f Doctorado en Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS) , Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'f Doctorado en Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS) , Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'f Doctorado en Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS) , Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'g Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Genomica , Instituto de Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS), Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'f Doctorado en Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS) , Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', 'g Departamento de Biologia Molecular y Genomica , Instituto de Genetica Humana, Centro Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud (CUCS), Universidad de Guadalajara , Guadalajara , Jalisco , Mexico.', ""h Servicio de Genetica, Division de Pediatria , Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, 'Dr. Juan I.

There have been only two major reports on pediatric FL. The present retrospective study on pediatric FL in Japan, including FL with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), analyzed data from 1991 to 2014. Twenty-two patients with pediatric FL were analyzed. Sixteen patients were boys and six were girls. Median age of onset was 9 years (range 4-17 years). In 11 patients, DLBCL co-existed with FL. The initial lesions involved cervical lesions in 16 patients, and the abdomen in six. With regard to stage of disease at diagnosis, 17 patients were at stage I or II, four were at stage III, and one was at stage IV. Chemotherapy was administered in 18 patients, and only resection was performed in four patients. Mature B lymphoma regimens were selected for 17 patients who received chemotherapy.

Because there is limited research on the quality of life (QoL) of Saudi Arabian cancer patients, the aim of this study was to identify the predictors of the QoL in a sample of Saudis with cancer. In August 2016, a cross-sectional study was conducted on 438 patients with a variety of cancer types (145 breast, 109 colorectal, 38 leukemia, 45 lymphoma, and 99 other types) who attended the Oncology Outpatient Clinics at KAMC. Sociodemographics, clinical symptoms, and cancer treatments were collected for each patient. We used the SF-36 instrument to assess QoL. Of the cancer patients studied, 28.4% had a family history of cancer, and, according to subgroup analyses, the elderly, those lacking formal education, the unemployed, those diagnosed with Stage III/IV, and those with metastasis had significantly worse physical functions than the other cancer patients. According to multiple linear regression analyses, cancer patients who exercised regularly tended to have better physical function, emotional role function, vitality, social function, and general health (increase in SF-36 scores of 8.82, 9.75, 5.54, 6.66, and 4.97, respectively). Patients with first-year-after-cancer diagnosis tended to have poor emotional wellbeing, social function, and general health (decrease in SF-36 scores of 5.20, 7.34, and 6.12, respectively). Newly diagnosed cancer patients and patients who did not exercise tended to experience significantly poor QoL in several domains; thus, the effectiveness of exercise must be assessed in Saudi cancer patients as an intervention to improve QoL.",,"['Ahmed, Anwar E', 'Almuzaini, Alaa S', 'Alsadhan, Mohannad A', 'Alharbi, Abdulrahman G', 'Almuzaini, Hanin S', 'Ali, Yosra Z', 'Jazieh, Abdul-Rahman']","['Ahmed AE', 'Almuzaini AS', 'Alsadhan MA', 'Alharbi AG', 'Almuzaini HS', 'Ali YZ', 'Jazieh AR']","['King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ahmedan@ngha.med.sa.', 'King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. ahmedan@ngha.med.sa.', 'King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Medicine, Imam Abdulrahman Al Faisal University, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Oncology, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Oncology, King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cancer Educ,Journal of cancer education : the official journal of the American Association for Cancer Education,8610343,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Emotions', 'Female', '*Health Behavior', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mental Health', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Support', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",['NOTNLM'],"['*First-year-cancer diagnosis', '*QoL', '*Regular exercise', '*SF-36', '*Saudi Arabia']",2017/03/09 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s13187-017-1198-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s13187-017-1198-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Educ. 2018 Oct;33(5):1011-1019. doi: 10.1007/s13187-017-1198-3.,,,PMC6208783,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to detect the specific microRNAs involved in predicting relapse or progression in acute and chronic leukemias, as well as their relationship with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). The relevant literature was identified through a PubMed and Scholar search (2008-2016) of English-language papers using the terms Leukemia, microRNAs, survival and relapse. Different leukemia types and subtypes show specific microRNA expression profile and different changes, which can be useful in the differentiation between leukemias and evaluation of relapse at the time of diagnosis. Altered microRNA expression profiles can turn these molecules into oncogenes or tumor suppressors, which affect the expression of relapse-related genes. Therefore, monitoring of specific microRNA expression profiles from diagnosis and during follow-up of patients can contribute to the assessment of outcome and determination of relapse and prognosis of leukemic patients.",,"['Hajizamani, S', 'Shahjahani, M', 'Shahrabi, S', 'Saki, N']","['Hajizamani S', 'Shahjahani M', 'Shahrabi S', 'Saki N']","['Diagnostic Laboratory Sciences and Technology Research Center, School of Paramedical Sciences, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Semnan University of Medical Sciences, Semnan, Iran.', 'Health Research Institute, Research Center of Thalassemia and Hemoglobinopathy, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. najmaldinsaki@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*therapy', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['Leukemia', 'MicroRNA', 'Overall survival', 'Relapse', 'Relapse-free survival']",2017/03/09 06:00,2018/04/27 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1638-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1638-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2017 Aug;19(8):951-960. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1638-x.

Oncogenic FLT3 mutants display constitutive activity leading to aberrant cell proliferation and survival. Phosphorylation on several critical tyrosine residues is known to be essential for FLT3 signaling. Among these tyrosine residues, Y842 is located in the so-called activation loop. The position of this tyrosine residue is well conserved in all receptor tyrosine kinases. It has been reported that phosphorylation of the activation loop tyrosine is critical for catalytic activity for some but not all receptor tyrosine kinases. The role of Y842 residue in FLT3 signaling has not yet been studied. In this report, we show that Y842 is not important for FLT3 activation or ubiquitination but plays a critical role in regulating signaling downstream of the receptor as well as controlling receptor stability. We found that mutation of Y842 in the FLT3-ITD oncogenic mutant background reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, the introduction of the Y842 mutation in the FLT3-ITD background led to a dramatic reduction in in vitro colony forming capacity. Additionally, mice injected with cells expressing FLT3-ITD/Y842F displayed a significant delay in tumor formation, compared to FLT3-ITD expressing cells. Microarray analysis comparing gene expression regulated by FLT3-ITD versus FLT3-ITD/Y842F demonstrated that mutation of Y842 causes suppression of anti-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, we showed that cells expressing FLT3-ITD/Y842F display impaired activity of the RAS/ERK pathway due to reduced interaction between FLT3 and SHP2 leading to reduced SHP2 activation. Thus, we suggest that Y842 is critical for FLT3-mediated RAS/ERK signaling and cellular transformation.",,"['Kazi, Julhash U', 'Chougule, Rohit A', 'Li, Tianfeng', 'Su, Xianwei', 'Moharram, Sausan A', 'Rupar, Kaja', 'Marhall, Alissa', 'Gazi, Mohiuddin', 'Sun, Jianmin', 'Zhao, Hui', 'Ronnstrand, Lars']","['Kazi JU', 'Chougule RA', 'Li T', 'Su X', 'Moharram SA', 'Rupar K', 'Marhall A', 'Gazi M', 'Sun J', 'Zhao H', 'Ronnstrand L']","['Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', ""Department of Pathogen Biology and Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, People's Republic of China."", 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong.', 'Division of Translational Cancer Research, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Medicon Village, Lund, Sweden. lars.ronnstrand@med.lu.se.', 'Lund Stem Cell Center, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. lars.ronnstrand@med.lu.se.', 'Department of Oncology, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. lars.ronnstrand@med.lu.se.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1275-5809'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cell Mol Life Sci,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,9705402,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Stability', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/metabolism', 'Proteolysis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*chemistry/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Activation loop', '*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*FLT3', '*FLT3-ITD', '*Microarray', '*SHP2', '*Survival', '*Transformation']",2017/03/09 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2016/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00018-017-2494-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00018-017-2494-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Life Sci. 2017 Jul;74(14):2679-2688. doi: 10.1007/s00018-017-2494-0.

Comprehensive records of 86 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were used to obtain resource utilization, which, multiplied by unit costs, were used to determine overall and mean costs. Descriptive statistics are presented for patient demographics, medical resource utilization, and costing data. RESULTS: The total cost for the cohort was $2.2 million over a mean follow-up period of 4.7 years. The mean total cost per patient (regardless of follow-up) was $25,736. In terms of Rai staging, overall mean costs were highest for stage iv patients. Almost 50% of the total cost was attributable to cll treatments, among which fludarabine-based treatments had the highest utilization.

The antitumor effects were associated with the development of thrombocytopenia, one of the common side effects observed in patients treated with imetelstat. The events underlying these adverse effects are not apparent. In this report, we investigated the potential mechanisms that account for imetelstat's beneficial effects in MPN patients and the manner by which imetelstat treatment leads to a reduction in platelet numbers. Using a well-established system of ex vivo megakaryopoiesis, we demonstrated that imetelestat treatment affects normal megakaryocyte (MK) development by exclusively delaying maturation of MK precursor cells. By contrast, additional stages along MPN MK development were affected by imetelstat resulting in reduced numbers of assayable colony-forming unit MK and impaired MK maturation. In addition, treatment with imetelstat inhibited the secretion of fibrogenic growth factors by malignant but not by normal MK. Our results indicate that the delay observed in normal MK maturation may account for imetelstat-induced thrombocytopenia, while the more global effects of imetelstat on several stages along the hierarchy of MPN megakaryopoiesis may be responsible for the favorable clinical outcomes reported in MPN patients.",,"['Mosoyan, G', 'Kraus, T', 'Ye, F', 'Eng, K', 'Crispino, J D', 'Hoffman, R', 'Iancu-Rubin, C']","['Mosoyan G', 'Kraus T', 'Ye F', 'Eng K', 'Crispino JD', 'Hoffman R', 'Iancu-Rubin C']","['The Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY USA.', 'Center for Therapeutic Antibody Development, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Redwood City, CA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Evanston, IL, USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY USA.', 'The Tisch Cancer Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Polyploidy', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,,2017/03/09 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2016/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201778 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.78 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Nov;31(11):2458-2467. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.78.

The clinical effects of alloreactivity present a Janus-face: detrimental graft-versus-host disease increases non-relapse mortality, beneficial graft-versus-malignancy may cure the recipient. The ultimate consequences on long-term outcome remain a matter of debate. We hypothesized that increasing donor-recipient antigen matching would decrease the negative effects, while preserving antitumor alloreactivity. We analyzed retrospectively a predefined cohort of 32 838 such patients and compared it to 59 692 patients with autologous HSCT as reference group. We found a significant and systematic decrease in non-relapse mortality with decreasing phenotypic and genotypic antigen disparity, paralleled by a stepwise increase in overall and relapse-free survival (Spearman correlation coefficients of cumulative excess event rates at 5 years 0.964; P<0.00; respectively 0.976; P<0.00). We observed this systematic stepwise effect in all main disease and disease-stage categories. The results suggest that detrimental effects of alloreactivity are additive with each step of mismatching; the beneficial effects remain preserved. Hence, if there is a choice, the best match should be donor of choice.

A microemulsion formulation was chosen to optimize absorption. After a 50-mg [(14)C]midostaurin dose, oral absorption was high (>90%) and relatively rapid. In plasma, the major circulating components were midostaurin (22%), CGP52421 (32.7%), and CGP62221 (27.7%). Long plasma half-lives were observed for midostaurin (20.3 hours), CGP52421 (495 hours), and CGP62221 (33.4 hours). Through careful mass-balance study design, the recovery achieved was good (81.6%), despite the long radioactivity half-lives. Most of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces (77.6%) mainly as metabolites, because only 3.43% was unchanged, suggesting mainly hepatic metabolism. Renal elimination was minor (4%). Midostaurin metabolism pathways involved hydroxylation, O-demethylation, amide hydrolysis, and N-demethylation. High plasma CGP52421 and CGP62221 exposures in humans, along with relatively potent cell-based IC50 for FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplications inhibition, suggested that the antileukemic activity in AML patients may also be maintained by the metabolites. Very high plasma protein binding (>99%) required equilibrium gel filtration to identify differences between humans and animals. Because midostaurin, CGP52421, and CGP62221 are metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 and are inhibitors/inducers for CYP3A, potential drug-drug interactions with mainly CYP3A4 modulators/CYP3A substrates could be expected. Given its low aqueous solubility, high oral absorption and extensive metabolism (>90%), midostaurin is a Biopharmaceutics Classification System/Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) class II drug in human, consistent with rat BDDCS in vivo data showing high absorption (>90%) and extensive metabolism (>90%).","['Copyright (c) 2017 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['He, Handan', 'Tran, Phi', 'Gu, Helen', 'Tedesco, Vivienne', 'Zhang, Jin', 'Lin, Wen', 'Gatlik, Ewa', 'Klein, Kai', 'Heimbach, Tycho']","['He H', 'Tran P', 'Gu H', 'Tedesco V', 'Zhang J', 'Lin W', 'Gatlik E', 'Klein K', 'Heimbach T']","['Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey handan.he@novartis.com.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, East Hanover, New Jersey.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Rats', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/pharmacokinetics/urine', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/03/09 06:00,2017/04/21 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2016/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.116.072744 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.116.072744 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2017 May;45(5):540-555. doi: 10.1124/dmd.116.072744.

We hypothesized that alterations in intracellular ROS would trigger AML-M5 relapse by activating the intrinsic pathway.Experimental Design: We studied ROS levels and conducted c-Jun activation domain-binding protein-1 (JAB1/COPS5) and thioredoxin (TRX) gene expression analyses with blood samples obtained from 60 matched AML-M5 patients at diagnosis and relapse and conducted mechanism studies of Jab1's regulation of Trx in leukemia cell lines.Results: Our data showed that increased production of ROS and a low capacity of antioxidant enzymes were characteristics of AML-M5, both at diagnosis and at relapse. Consistently, increased gene expression levels of TRX and JAB1/COPS5 were associated with low overall survival rates in patients with AML-M5. In addition, stimulating AML-M5 cells with low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide led to increased Jab1 and Trx expression. Consistently, transfection of ectopic Jab1 into leukemia cells increased Trx expression, whereas silencing of Jab1 in leukemia cells reduced Trx expression. Mechanistically, Jab1 interacted with Trx and stabilized Trx protein. Moreover, Jab1 transcriptionally regulated Trx. Furthermore, depletion of Jab1 inhibited leukemia cell growth both in vitro and in vivoConclusions: We identified a novel Jab1-Trx axis that is a key cellular process in the pathobiologic characteristics of AML-M5.

Here we describe recurrent activating intronic mutations of LMO2, a prominent oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL).

The majority of indels harbor putative de novo MYB, ETS1, or RUNX1 consensus binding sites. Analysis of 5'-capped RNA transcripts in mutant cell lines identified the usage of an intermediate promoter site, with consequential monoallelic LMO2 overexpression. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated disruption of the mutant allele in PF-382 cells markedly downregulated LMO2 expression, establishing clear causality between the mutation and oncogene dysregulation. Furthermore, the spectrum of CRISPR/Cas9-derived mutations provides important insights into the interconnected contributions of functional transcription factor binding.

Using reverse-phase protein arrays in large cohorts of newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) samples, we found that high FAK expression was associated with unfavorable cytogenetics (P = 2 x 10(-4)) and relapse (P = 0.02) in AML. FAK expression was significantly lower in patients with FLT3-ITD (P = 0.0024) or RAS (P = 0.05) mutations and strongly correlated with p-SRC and integrinbeta3 levels. FAK protein levels were significantly higher in CD34(+) (P = 5.42 x 10(-20)) and CD34(+)CD38(-) MDS (P = 7.62 x 10(-9)) cells compared with normal CD34(+) cells. MDS patients with higher FAK in CD34(+) cells tended to have better overall survival (P = 0.05). FAK expression was significantly higher in MDS patients who later transformed to compared with those who did not transform to AML and in AML patients who transformed from MDS compared with those with de novo AML. Coculture with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) increased FAK expression in AML cells. Inhibition of FAK decreased MSC-mediated adhesion/migration and viability of AML cells and prolonged survival in an AML xenograft murine model. Our results suggest that FAK regulates leukemia-stromal interactions and supports leukemia cell survival; hence, FAK is a potential therapeutic target in myeloid leukemia.

CNVs represent a recurrent molecular cause of CAKUT but the culprit gene remains often elusive. Our study aimed to define the gene responsible for CAKUT in patients with an 1q23.3q24.1 microdeletion. METHODS: We describe eight patients presenting with CAKUT carrying an 1q23.3q24.1 microdeletion as identified by chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Clinical features were collected, especially the renal and urinary tract phenotype, and extrarenal features. We characterised PBX1 expression and localisation in fetal and adult kidneys using quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: We defined a 276-kb minimal common region (MCR) that only overlaps with the PBX1 gene. All eight patients presented with syndromic CAKUT. CAKUT were mostly bilateral renal hypoplasia (75%). The most frequent extrarenal symptoms were developmental delay and ear malformations. We demonstrate that PBX1 is strongly expressed in fetal kidneys and brain and expression levels decreased in adult samples. In control fetal kidneys, PBX1 was localised in nuclei of medullary, interstitial and mesenchymal cells, whereas it was present in endothelial cells in adult kidneys. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that PBX1 haploinsufficiency leads to syndromic CAKUT as supported by the Pbx1-null mice model. Correct PBX1 dosage appears to be critical for normal nephrogenesis and seems important for brain development in humans. CMA should be recommended in cases of fetal renal anomalies to improve genetic counselling and pregnancy management.","['(c) Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text', 'of the article) 2017.

Autoantibodies developed against the organism's self-antigens are detected in the sera of subjects with cancer. In recent years carbonic anhydrase (CA) I and II autoantibodies have been shown in some autoimmune diseases and carcinomas, but the mechanisms underlying this immune response have not yet been explained. The aim of this study was to evaluate CA I and II autoantibodies in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to provide a novel perspective regarding the autoimmune basis of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-CA I and II antibody levels were investigated using ELISA in serum samples from 30 patients with AML and 30 healthy peers. RESULTS: Anti-CA I and II antibody titers in the AML group were significantly higher compared with the control group (p=0.0001 and 0.018, respectively). A strong positive correlation was also determined between titers of anti-CA I and II antibodies (r=0.613, p=0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that these autoantibodies may be involved in the pathogenesis of AML.

METHODS: The charts and laboratory data of 65 adult patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated according to the International Consortium on Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia 2006 protocol were reviewed. The identification of the promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor-alpha gene rearrangement at diagnosis, post-induction, post-consolidation and during maintenance treatment was performed by qualitative and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia over a seven-year period and of these 65 were eligible for treatment with the protocol. Among the 45 patients who received consolidation and maintenance treatment, six (13%) relapsed, three of whom presented hematologic and three presented molecular relapse. The first relapses occurred at a median of 39 months. Relapsed patients were from all risk groups (low, intermediate and high) and both morphological types (M3 and M3variant) were found. Three of these patients are alive and in molecular remission after salvage treatment. There were no statistically significant differences regarding gender, age, risk group, morphology, promyelocytic leukemia breakpoint cluster region, use of all-trans retinoic acid, development of differentiation syndrome and number of days to complete remission between the patients who relapsed and those who did not. CONCLUSION: Our results reinforce the importance of prolonged monitoring of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients using molecular methods to detect relapse early.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

Treatment is carried out according to clinical type with watchful waiting being recommended for less aggressive types. Aggressive adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is generally treated with chemotherapy and/or antivirals. The objective of this study was to correlate the survival of patients diagnosed in Bahia, Brazil, with the therapeutic approaches employed and to evaluate what issues existed in their treatment processes. METHODS: Eighty-three adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma patients (26 smoldering, 23 chronic, 16 acute, 13 lymphoma and five primary cutaneous tumoral) with available data were included in this study. RESULTS: Complete response was achieved in seven smoldering patients with symptomatic treatment, in two with chronic disease using antivirals/chemotherapy, in one with acute disease using antivirals and in one lymphoma using the LSG15 regimen [vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisolone (VCAP); doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisolone (AMP); and vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisolone (VECP)]. Smoldering patients who received symptomatic treatment presented longer survival. Favorable chronic patients treated with antivirals presented longer survival compared to the unfavorable subtype. However, for the acute form, first-line chemotherapy was better, albeit without significance, than antivirals. Only one of the patients with lymphoma and primary cutaneous tumors responded. CONCLUSIONS: Watchful waiting associated with phototherapy represents the best option for smoldering adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with survival in Bahia being superior to that described in Japan. There was a trend of better results with zidovudine/interferon-alpha in favorable chronic disease. Excellent results were achieved in the lymphoma type treated with the LSG15 protocol. Patients are diagnosed late probably due to lack of knowledge of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma by primary healthcare doctors and a Brazilian treatment protocol needs to be established.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia', 'Celular.

However, MEIS1 has also shown to be a potential tumor suppressor in some other cancers, such as non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and prostate cancer. Although multiple roles of MEIS1 in cancer development and progression have been identified, there is an urgent demand to discover more functions of this molecule for further therapeutic design. METHODS: MEIS1 was overexpressed via adenovirus vector in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells. Western blot and real-time qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) was performed to examine the protein and mRNA levels of MEIS1. Cell proliferation, survival, in vitro migration and invasion were tested by MTT, colony formation, soft-agar, transwell (in vitro invasion/migration) assays, and tumor in vivo growthwas measured on nude mice model. In addition, flow-cytometry analysis was used to detect cell cycle arrest or non-apoptotic cell death of ccRCC cells induced by MEIS1. RESULTS: MEIS1 exhibits a decreased expression in ccRCC cell lines than that in non-tumor cell lines. MEIS1 overexpression inhibits ccRCC cells proliferation and induces G1/S arrest concomitant with marked reduction of G1/S transition regulators, Cyclin D1 and Cyclin A. Moreover, MEIS1-1 overexpression also induces non-apoptotic cell death of ccRCC cells via decreasing the levels of pro-survival regulators Survivin and BCL-2. Transwell migration assay (TMA) shows that MEIS1 attenuates in vitro invasion and migration of ccRCC cells with down-regulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Further, in nude mice model, MEIS1 inhibits the in vivo growth of Caki-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: By investigating the role of MEIS1 in ccRCC cells' survival, proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, cell cycle progress, apoptosis and metastasis, in the present work, we propose that MEIS1 may play an important role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) development.",,"['Zhu, Jie', 'Cui, Liang', 'Xu, Axiang', 'Yin, Xiaotao', 'Li, Fanglong', 'Gao, Jiangping']","['Zhu J', 'Cui L', 'Xu A', 'Yin X', 'Li F', 'Gao J']","[""Department of Urology, Chinese PLA Medical School/Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Chinese PLA Medical School/Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Civil Aviation General Hospital/Civil Aviation Medical College of Peking University, Beijing, 100123, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Chinese PLA Medical School/Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Chinese PLA Medical School/Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Chinese PLA Medical School/Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Chinese PLA Medical School/Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China. jpgao@163.com.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Survivin']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', '*MEIS1', '*Proliferation', '*in vitro invasion or migration']",2017/03/09 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-017-3155-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-017-3155-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2017 Mar 7;17(1):176. doi: 10.1186/s12885-017-3155-2.,,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Survivin)']",PMC5341457,,20170307,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: In this research, the actions of a synthetic beta lactam-structured Cox-2 inhibitor with 4-(4- (Methylsulfonyl) phenyl)-1-pentyl-3-phenoxyazetidin-2-one on cellular viability of cancerous lymphoblast obtained from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and normal lymphocytes obtained from healthy donors were compared. METHODS: % the cell viability of cancerouslymphoblasts and normal lymphocytes treated with beta lactam derivatives were assayed with MTT test. Early apoptosis and necrosis were detected by double staining of annexin V/ propidium iodide and activity of caspase 3 as the final mediator in apoptotic mode of cell death was evaluated by colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Our results showed that beta lactam derivatives inhibited the proliferation of cancerous lymphoblast but not normal lymphocytes in a concentration-dependent mode by inducing apoptosis. Treatment with beta lactam derivatives resulted in a rapid loss of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and cytochrome c release in cytosol of mitochondria resulted in activation of procaspase-9 and formation of active apoptosome. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that 4-(4-(Methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-1-pentyl-3-phenoxyazetidin-2-one as a beta lactam could induce ROS-mediated death signaling throughmitochondrial pathway that results in apoptosis in only cancerous lymphoblast cells. The stimulationof apoptosis by beta lactams may provide a pivotal mechanismfor their anticancer effect in acute lymphocytic leukemia cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Pirahmadi, Nahal', 'Zarghi, Afshin', 'Salimi, Ahmad', 'Arefi, Hadi', 'Pourahmad, Jalal']","['Pirahmadi N', 'Zarghi A', 'Salimi A', 'Arefi H', 'Pourahmad J']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran.

Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are common treatments of breast cancer. However, tumor relapse and metastasis following therapy are major clinical challenges. The importance of B-lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (BMI-1) was implicated in cell proliferation, stem cell maintenance, and tumor initiation. We established radio- and temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant (IRC-R) MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines to investigate the mechanism involved in therapeutic resistance. Cell proliferation and sphere number were dramatically elevated, and BMI-1 was remarkably upregulated, in IRC-R cells compared to parental cells. Silencing BMI-1 by RNA interference only affected the cell proliferation of IRC-R but not parental cells, suggesting the critical role of BMI-1 in radio- and TMZ resistance. We used a xenograft mice model to elucidate that BMI-1 was necessary in tumor development by assessing tumor volume and Ki67 expression. We found that Hedgehog (Hhg) signaling exerted synergized functions together with BMI-1, implicating the importance of BMI-1 in Hhg signaling. Downregulation of BMI-1 could be an effective strategy to suppress tumor growth, which supports the potential clinical use of targeting BMI-1 in breast cancer treatment.",,"['Yan, Yanfang', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhao, Pengxin', 'Ma, Weiyuan', 'Hu, Zhigang', 'Zhang, Kaili']","['Yan Y', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao P', 'Ma W', 'Hu Z', 'Zhang K']","['1 Department of Gland Surgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', '1 Department of Gland Surgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', '1 Department of Gland Surgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', '1 Department of Gland Surgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', '1 Department of Gland Surgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.', '1 Department of Gland Surgery, The Second Hospital of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Cell Self Renewal', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/*metabolism', 'Temozolomide', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-lymphoma moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region-1 (BMI-1)', '*Hedgehog (Hhg)', '*breast cancer', '*radioresistance', '*temozolomide (TMZ)']",2017/03/09 06:00,2018/06/21 06:00,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1933719117697255 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2017 Dec;24(12):1620-1629. doi: 10.1177/1933719117697255.

In Spain, HTLV underdiagnosis is highlighted by the high proportion of patients presenting either with tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) or adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) at first diagnosis. We examined whether the renewed efforts for expanding HCV testing may provide a sentinel population that might selectively be targeted to unveil asymptomatic HTLV carriers. The presence of anti-HTLV antibodies was examined in 3,838 consecutive individuals with reactive HCV serology attended during the last three years at 13 hospitals distributed across the Spanish geography. Overall 71% were male and the median age was 41-years old. Foreigners represented 9% of the study population. A total of 50 individuals (1.3%) were seroreactive for HTLV, being 30 confirmed as HTLV-2 and two as HTLV-1 (0.12%). The remaining 18 had indeterminate Western blot patterns. Most individuals with HTLV-2 and HTLV indeterminate serology were HIV-positive, former injection drug users and native Spaniards. In contrast, the two HTLV-1 infections were found in men coming from Brazil and the Dominican Republic, respectively. In summary, the overall prevalence of HTLV infection in individuals living in Spain seropositive for HCV is 1.3%, more than 10-fold greater than in general outclinics in Spain. However, immigrants from HTLV-1 endemic regions and former injection drug users with HTLV-2 infection are by far the major contributory groups in HCV patients. Therefore, testing for HTLV in newly diagnosed HCV individuals would not contribute much to improve late HTLV diagnosis in Spain.",,"['Trevino, Ana', 'Aguilera, Antonio', 'Rodriguez-Iglesias, Manuel A', 'Hernandez, Araceli', 'Benito, Rafael', 'Roc, Lourdes', 'Ramos, Jose Manuel', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul', 'Poveda, Eva', 'Rodriguez, Carmen', 'Del Romero, Jorge', 'Calderon, Enrique', 'Garcia, Juan', 'Requena, Silvia', 'Soriano, Vincent', 'de Mendoza, Carmen']","['Trevino A', 'Aguilera A', 'Rodriguez-Iglesias MA', 'Hernandez A', 'Benito R', 'Roc L', 'Ramos JM', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu R', 'Poveda E', 'Rodriguez C', 'Del Romero J', 'Calderon E', 'Garcia J', 'Requena S', 'Soriano V', 'de Mendoza C']","['Hospital Carlos III , Sinesio Delgado, 10 , Madrid, Spain , 28029.', 'Spain ; ana.trevino.rc@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Conxo, Service of Microbiology, Santiago de Compostela, Spain ; antonio.aguilera.guirao@gmail.com.', ', Hospital de Puerto Real, Service of Microbiology , CN IV, Km 665 , Cadiz, Spain , 11510 ; manuel.rodrigueziglesias@uca.es.', 'Hospital Insular, Service of Microbiology, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain ; maracelih@gmail.com.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Service of Microbiology, Zaragoza, Spain ; rbenito@salud.aragon.es.', 'Hospital Miguel Servet, Service of Microbiology , P feminine isabel la catolica n masculine3 , Zaragoza, Spain , 50009 ; lroc@salud.aragon.es.', 'Hospital General de Eche, Infectious Diseases, Elche, Alicante, Spain ; jramosrincon@yahoo.es.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario, Service of Microbiology, Valladolid, Spain ; rortizdelejarazu@saludcastillayleon.es.', 'Hospital Carlos III, Department of Infectious Diseases , Calle Sinesio Delgado, 10 , Madrid, Spain , 28029 ; evapoveda@hotmail.com.', 'Centro Sanitario Sandoval , Calle Sandoval, 7 , Madrid, Spain , 28010 ; carmen.rodriguezma@salud.madrid.org.', 'Centro Sanitario Sandoval, Madrid, Spain ; jorgedelromero@gmail.com.', 'Virgen del Rocio University Hospital, Seville, Spain ; sandube@cica.es.', 'Hospital Cristal-Pinor, Service of Microbiology, Orense, Spain ; juan.garcia.costa@sergas.es.', 'Hospital Universitario Puerta del Hierro Majadahonda, 16370, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain ; silvia-818@hotmail.com.', 'Hospital Universitario La Paz, 16268, Infectious Diseases, Madrid, Madrid, Spain ; vsoriano@dragonet.es.', 'Hospital Carlos III, Madrid, Madrid, Spain ; cmendoza.cdm@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,,,,,2017/03/09 06:00,2017/03/09 06:01,['2017/03/09 06:00'],"['2017/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/09 06:01 [medline]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/AID.2016.0323 [doi]'],ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2017 Ocy;33(10):1013-1017. doi: 10.1089/AID.2016.0323.

In this work, we discuss the creation of an eligibility criteria dataset for clinical trials for patients with two disparate diseases, annotated with the preferred data source for each criterion (i.e., structured or unstructured) by annotators with medical training. The dataset includes 50 heart-failure trials with a total of 766 eligibility criteria and 50 trials for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with 677 criteria. Further, we developed machine learning models to predict the preferred data source: kernel methods outperform simpler learning models when used with a combination of lexical, syntactic, semantic, and surface features. Evaluation of these models indicates that the performance is consistent across data from both diagnoses, indicating generalizability of our method.

Resulted hybridomas using three culture media were screened by indirect ELISA, then cloned by limiting dilution, and isotype was determined after obtaining ascitic fluid and antibody purification. RESULTS: We obtained a stable secreting clone, capable of secreting a high-affinity monoclonal antibody against CD44 protein, IgG2a kappa, with the affinity of 5.4 x 10-8 M without cross-reactivity.

Despite their remarkable sensitivity and specificity, both methods have inherent limitations, such as qualitative MRD evaluation and relative quantification. Herein, we used droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to monitor MRD in 21 APL patients and compared its performance with nPCR and qPCR. After assessing the limit of detection (LOD) for each technique on serial dilutions of PML-RARA bcr1 and bcr3 transcripts, a total of 48 follow-up samples were analyzed and the results compared. ddPCR showed good linearity and efficiency and reached an LOD comparable or even superior to nPCR and qPCR. When tested on primary samples, ddPCR exhibited a sensitivity and specificity of >/=95% and >/=91% for bcr1 and bcr3 transcripts and displayed a significant concordance with both techniques, particularly with nPCR. The peculiar advantage of ddPCR-based monitoring of MRD is represented by absolute quantification, which provides crucial information for the management of patients whose MRD fluctuates under the LOD of qPCR and is detectable, but not quantifiable, by nPCR. Our findings highlight ddPCR as a reliable complementary approach to monitor MRD in APL, and suggest its advantageous application, particularly for the molecular follow-up of patients at high risk of relapse.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

To identify the candidate molecule responsible for resistance during IM treatment, an IM-resistant K562 cell line was generated by culturing in gradually increasing dose of IM. The expression of Nrf-2 and its downstream target, Gst-alpha, were significantly induced in these cells. GST-alpha, in turn, mediated cell survival by maintaining intracellular low level of 4-HNE. Inhibition of Nrf-2 effectively reduced the expression of Gst-alpha, resulting in accumulation of 4-HNE and elevated sensitiveness to IM. Moreover, in IM-sensitive K562 cells enforced Gst-alpha expression strikingly protected cells from the insult of IM. Finally, we also examined the levels of Nrf-2 in clinical bone morrow samples. Nrf-2 and Gst-alpha were more abundant in bone morrow of CML patients compared with that of healthy donors.

The enzyme telomerase is a very attractive target for cancer therapeutics; in normal cells such as lymphocytes, it plays a decisive role for cell maintenance. The effect of I3C and DIM on telomerase in normal human immune cells (PBMC) was studied compared to leukaemia cells (HL-60). Signalling of telomerase regulation via estrogen receptor (ER) was addressed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Short-term treatment with I3C and DIM inhibited telomerase activity in leukaemia cells (>30 muM I3C; >3 muM DIM). In CD3/CD28 activated PBMC, inhibition was stronger, though (>3 muM I3C; >1 muM DIM). DIM long-term treatment resulted in DNA damage induction and proliferation inhibition in PBMC as determined by the comet assay and CFSE staining, respectively. A relevance of ERalpha/beta-AP1 signaling for telomerase inhibition on enzyme activity, but not transcription level became evident indicating a nonclassical mode for ER regulation of telomerase by DIM. CONCLUSION: Although desired in cancer cells, this study identified a potential adverse impact of I3C and DIM on telomerase action in normal human immune cells, partly mediated by an ER-dependent mechanism. These new findings should be considered for potential chronic high-dose chemoprevention strategies using these compounds.","['(c) 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Targeting the niche-based microenvironment is thus a new approach for leukemia therapy. Cordycepin is an analogue of adenosine and has been suggested to possess anti-leukemia properties. However, whether cordycepin influences association of leukemia and mesenchymal stromal cells has never been investigated. Here we show that cordycepin reduces CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in U937 and K562 cells and induces Dkk1 expression via autocrine and paracrine regulation in leukemia and mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs). Cordycepin suppresses cell attachment of leukemia with MSCs and downregulates N-cadherin in leukemia and VCAM-1 in MSCs. Moreover, incubation with leukemic conditioned media (CM) significantly induces IL-8 and IL-6 expression in MSCs, which is abrogated by cordycepin. Suppression of leukemic CM-induced VCAM-1 and IL-8 by cordycepin in MSCs is mediated by impairing NFkappaB signaling. Finally, cordycepin combined with an adenosine deaminase inhibitor prolongs survival in a leukemic mouse model.

Yet, underlying mechanisms have remained obscure. Genome instability seems an unlikely reason as the energy transmitted by ELF-MF is too low to damage DNA and induce cancer-promoting mutations. ELF-MF, however, may perturb the epigenetic code of genomes, which is well-known to be sensitive to environmental conditions and generally deranged in cancers, including leukaemia. We examined the potential of ELF-MF to influence key epigenetic modifications in leukaemic Jurkat cells and in human CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells undergoing in vitro differentiation into the neutrophilic lineage. During granulopoiesis, sensitive genome-wide profiling of multiple replicate experiments did not reveal any statistically significant, ELF-MF-dependent alterations in the patterns of active (H3K4me2) and repressive (H3K27me3) histone marks nor in DNA methylation. However, ELF-MF exposure showed consistent effects on the reproducibility of these histone and DNA modification profiles (replicate variability), which appear to be of a stochastic nature but show preferences for the genomic context. The data indicate that ELF-MF exposure stabilizes active chromatin, particularly during the transition from a repressive to an active state during cell differentiation.",,"['Manser, Melissa', 'Sater, Mohamad R Abdul', 'Schmid, Christoph D', 'Noreen, Faiza', 'Murbach, Manuel', 'Kuster, Niels', 'Schuermann, David', 'Schar, Primo']","['Manser M', 'Sater MR', 'Schmid CD', 'Noreen F', 'Murbach M', 'Kuster N', 'Schuermann D', 'Schar P']","['Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Mattenstrasse 28, Basel, CH-4058, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Socinstrasse 57, Basel, CH-4002, Switzerland.', 'University of Basel, Petersplatz 1, Basel, CH-4001, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute, Socinstrasse 57, Basel, CH-4002, Switzerland.', 'University of Basel, Petersplatz 1, Basel, CH-4001, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Mattenstrasse 28, Basel, CH-4058, Switzerland.', 'SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics, Basel, Switzerland.', ""IT'IS Foundation, Zeughausstrasse 43, Zurich, CH-8004, Switzerland."", ""IT'IS Foundation, Zeughausstrasse 43, Zurich, CH-8004, Switzerland."", 'Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), Zurich, CH-8006, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Mattenstrasse 28, Basel, CH-4058, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel, Mattenstrasse 28, Basel, CH-4058, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells/*radiation effects', '*Magnetic Fields', 'Methylation']",,,2017/03/08 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2017/03/08 06:00'],"['2016/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['srep43345 [pii]', '10.1038/srep43345 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2017 Mar 7;7:43345. doi: 10.1038/srep43345.,,"['0 (Histones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",PMC5339735,,20170307,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Pooled analyses were conducted of 19 prospective population-based cohorts included in the Asia Cohort Consortium, comprising data from 658,611 East Asians and 112,686 South Asians. HRs were used to compare individuals with diabetes at baseline with those without diabetes for the risk of death from any cancer and from site-specific cancers, including cancers of the oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, colon, rectum, liver, bile duct, pancreas, lung, breast, endometrium, cervix, ovary, prostate, bladder, kidney and thyroid, as well as lymphoma and leukaemia. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 12.7 years, 37,343 cancer deaths (36,667 in East Asians and 676 in South Asians) were identified. Baseline diabetes status was statistically significantly associated with an increased risk of death from any cancer (HR 1.26; 95% CI 1.21, 1.31). Significant positive associations with diabetes were observed for cancers of the colorectum (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.26, 1.57), liver (HR 2.05; 95% CI 1.77, 2.38), bile duct (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.04, 1.92), gallbladder (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.10, 1.61), pancreas (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.32, 1.77), breast (HR 1.72; 95% CI 1.34, 2.19), endometrium (HR 2.73; 95% CI 1.53, 4.85), ovary (HR 1.60; 95% CI 1.06, 2.42), prostate (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.09, 1.82), kidney (HR 1.84; 95% CI 1.28, 2.64) and thyroid (HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.03, 3.86), as well as lymphoma (HR 1.39; 95% CI 1.04, 1.86). Diabetes was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of death from leukaemia and cancers of the bladder, cervix, oesophagus, stomach and lung. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Diabetes was associated with a 26% increased risk of death from any cancer in Asians. The pattern of associations with specific cancers suggests the need for better control (prevention, detection, management) of the growing epidemic of diabetes (as well as obesity), in order to reduce cancer mortality.",,"['Chen, Yu', 'Wu, Fen', 'Saito, Eiko', 'Lin, Yingsong', 'Song, Minkyo', 'Luu, Hung N', 'Gupta, Prakash C', 'Sawada, Norie', 'Tamakoshi, Akiko', 'Shu, Xiao-Ou', 'Koh, Woon-Puay',

The applications of murine models of cancer are numerous: mechanism discovery, oncogenesis, molecular genetics, microenvironment, metastasis, and therapeutic efficacy. Leukemias and lymphomas are a group of highly heterogeneous hematologic malignancies that affect people of all ages and ethnicities. Leukemia and lymphoma arise from hematopoietic and immune cells and usually spread widely throughout the body. The liquid nature of many of these malignancies, as well as the complex microenvironment from which they arise and their multifaceted genetic basis, has added to the difficulty in generating appropriate and translational models to study them. Murine models of leukemia and lymphoma have made substantial contributions to our understanding of the pathobiology of these disorders in humans. However, while there are many advantages to these models, limitations remain. In this review, we discuss the mouse as a model to study leukemia and lymphoma, and the importance of choosing the correct methodology. Specific examples of murine models of leukemias and lymphomas are provided, with particular attention to those that are highly translational to their human counterpart.

Gender medicine focuses on the impact of gender and sex on human physiology, pathophysiology and clinical features of diseases that are common to women and men. The term gender refers to a complex interrelation and integration of sex-as a biological and functional determinant-and psychological and cultural behaviours (due to ethnical, social or religious background). The attention to the impact of gender differences on the pathophysiology and, therefore, on the clinical management of the most common diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD), neurodegenerative disorders, immune and autoimmune diseases as well as several tumours, is in fact often neglected. Hence, studies covering different fields of investigation and including sex differences in the pathogenesis, in diagnostic and prognostic criteria as well as in response to therapy appear mandatory. However, prerequisites for this development are preclinical studies, including in vitro and in vivo approaches. They represent the first step in the development of a drug or in the comprehension of the pathogenetic mechanisms of diseases, in turn a necessary step for the development of new or more appropriate therapeutic strategies. However, sex differences are still poorly considered and the great majority of preclinical studies do not take into account the relevance of such disparities. In this review, we describe the state of the art of these studies and provide some paradigmatic examples of key fields of investigation, such as oncology, neurology and CVD, where preclinical models should be improved.","['(c) 2017 The Author(s). published by Portland Press Limited on behalf of the', 'Biochemical Society.']","['Buoncervello, Maria', 'Marconi, Matteo', 'Care, Alessandra', 'Piscopo, Paola', 'Malorni, Walter', 'Matarrese, Paola']","['Buoncervello M', 'Marconi M', 'Care A', 'Piscopo P', 'Malorni W', 'Matarrese P']","['Section of Experimental Immunotherapy, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Gender Medicine, Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicine Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Molecular Oncology, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Clinical, Diagnosis and Therapy of CNS Degenerative Diseases, Department of Neurosciences, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.', 'Section of Gender Medicine, Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicine Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy malorni@iss.it.', ""Center of Gender-Specific Medicine, Istituto Speriore di Sanita', 00161 Rome, Italy."", 'Section of Gender Medicine, Department of Therapeutic Research and Medicine Evaluation, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, 00161 Rome, Italy.', ""Center of Gender-Specific Medicine, Istituto Speriore di Sanita', 00161 Rome, Italy.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Sci (Lond),"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",7905731,IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/epidemiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/epidemiology', '*Sex Characteristics', 'Sex Distribution', 'Stroke/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['animal models', 'cell models', 'experimental medicine', 'gender', 'gender medicine', 'sex']",2017/03/08 06:00,2017/07/04 06:00,['2017/03/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/12/13 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['CS20160847 [pii]', '10.1042/CS20160847 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Sci (Lond). 2017 Mar 1;131(6):449-469. doi: 10.1042/CS20160847.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study aimed to detect the frequency of EBV and CMV DNA and their association with clinical characteristics and outcome of pediatric leukemic patients. METHODS: Samples of 50 immunocompromised pediatric leukemic patients and 30 apparently healthy children were subjected to the amplification of EBV DNA by one version of PCR targeting the Bam H1 W region of the genomic region of EBV, and the amplification of CMV DNA by targeting the CMV UL97 genomic region by a second round PCR. All investigations were performed on WBCs and sera. Results were correlated with the clinical and laboratory characteristics of the disease, and with overall survival. RESULTS: EBV and CMV DNA were detected in 20 and 54% of leukemic patients, respectively. Nine out of ten patients with EBV DNA (90%) were positive for CMV DNA in their sera. The presence of EBV DNA or CMV DNA was associated with neutropenia and a low total leukocyte count (TLC) (p = 0.02, 0.03, respectively). The presence of severe CMV disease, longer duration of febrile neutropenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and the presence of EBV DNA in patients' sera were significantly associated with worse overall survival. CONCLUSION: The detection of CMV disease and EBV DNA is relatively common in leukemic children and is significantly associated with a decline in the overall survival.",,"['Loutfy, Samah Aly', 'Abo-Shadi, Maha A', 'Fawzy, Mohamed', 'El-Wakil, Mohamed', 'Metwally, Shimaa A', 'Moneer, Manar M', 'Fattah, Nasra F Abdel', 'Kassem, Sara', 'Elgebaly, Ahmed']","['Loutfy SA', 'Abo-Shadi MA', 'Fawzy M', 'El-Wakil M', 'Metwally SA', 'Moneer MM', 'Fattah NF', 'Kassem S', 'Elgebaly A']","['Virology and Immunology Unit, Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Fom El-Khalig, Cairo, 11796, Egypt. samaly183@yahoo.com.', 'Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Girls), Al Azhar University, Nasr City, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Clinical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Beni-Suef University, Beni Suef, Egypt.', 'Microbiology and Immunology Department, Faculty of Pharmacy (Girls), Al Azhar University, Nasr City, Egypt.', 'Cancer Epidemiology and Biostatistics Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Virology and Immunology Unit, Cancer Biology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Fom El-Khalig, Cairo, 11796, Egypt.', 'Chemistry of natural and microbial products Department Pharmaceutical Industries Division, National Research Center, Giza, Egypt.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Al Azhar University, Nasr City, Egypt.', 'Medical Research Group of Egypt, Cairo, Egypt.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*epidemiology/pathology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CMV', '*EBV', '*PCR', '*Pediatric leukemia', '*Survival']",2017/03/08 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2017/03/08 06:00'],"['2016/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-017-0715-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-017-0715-7 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2017 Mar 6;14(1):46. doi: 10.1186/s12985-017-0715-7.,"['P01 CA174439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA171979/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177423/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)']",PMC5339968,,20170306,,,,,,,,,,,

Microvesicles (MVs) are membrane vesicles and play an important role in disease progression. Here, we investigated the role of MVs derived from MM cells (MM-MVs) in RI of MM. We found that MM-MVs significantly inhibited viability and induced apoptosis, but not epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human kidney-2 (HK-2), a human renal tubular epithelial cell line. The protein levels of cleaved caspase-3, 8, and 9, and E-cadherin, were increased, but vementin levels were decreased in the HK-2 cells treated with MM-MVs. Through a comparative sequencing and analysis of RNA content between the MVs from RPMI8226 MM cells (RPMI8226-MVs) and K562 leukemia cells, RPMI8226-MVs were enriched with more renal-pathogenic miRNAs, in which the selective miRNAs may participate in the up-regulation of the levels of cleaved caspase-3. Furthermore, the levels of CD138+ circulating MVs (cirMVs) in the peripheral blood were positively correlated with the severity of RI in newly-diagnosed MM. Our study supports MM-MVs representing a previously undescribed factor and playing a potential role in the development of RI of MM patients, and sheds light on the potential application of CD138+ cirMV counts in precise diagnosis of RI in MM and exploring MM-MVs as a therapeutic target.",,"['Zhao, Aiqi', 'Kong, Fancong', 'Liu, Chun-Jie', 'Yan, Guoxin', 'Gao, Fei', 'Guo, Hao', 'Guo, An-Yuan', 'Chen, Zhichao', 'Li, Qiubai']","['Zhao A', 'Kong F', 'Liu CJ', 'Yan G', 'Gao F', 'Guo H', 'Guo AY', 'Chen Z', 'Li Q']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. zhao_aiqi@163.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. konglinda212@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University, Nanchang 330000, China. konglinda212@163.com.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China. samliu@hust.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. dysrmygx@sina.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. gaof@hust.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. gh273397674@163.com.', 'Hubei Bioinformatics & Molecular Imaging Key Laboratory, Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China. guoay@hust.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. zhichaochen@hust.edu.cn.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China. qiubaili@hust.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell-Derived Microparticles/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Epithelial Cells/*metabolism', '*Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Renal Insufficiency/etiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndecan-1/metabolism', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['microvesicles', 'multiple myeloma', 'renal impairment']",2017/03/08 06:00,2017/04/21 06:00,['2017/03/08 06:00'],"['2016/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/21 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms18030513 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms18030513 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2017 Feb 27;18(3). pii: ijms18030513. doi: 10.3390/ijms18030513.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",PMC5372529,,20170227,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have included maternal cancers diagnosed up to 2 years after pregnancy; however, long latency periods of some cancers mean that cancers diagnosed many years postpartum might have been present during pregnancy in a preclinical state. This paper considers the association between maternal cancers diagnosed from 2 years prior to pregnancy until the mother reaches 50 years of age, and congenital anomalies, as diagnosed at birth or within the first year of life. The current population-based study looks at associations of cancers in mothers with congenital anomalies in their children. Children were followed up from birth to diagnosis of a congenital anomaly, death, emigration or end of follow-up (whichever occurred first). A total of 56,016 children (2.6%) were considered exposed to a maternal cancer of any type; and they had a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00, 1.09) compared with unexposed children. The greatest HR was seen among children whose mothers had been diagnosed with cancers before or during pregnancy (HR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.75). Similar results were seen when paternal cancers were used as a 'negative control'. Statistically significant associations were seen for some specific congenital anomalies of organ systems (congenital anomalies of the musculoskeletal system [HR: 1.13, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.25]) and for some specific types of maternal cancer (leukaemia [HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.61], The results of the main analyses suggest a small increase in risk of congenital anomalies in offspring of mothers diagnosed with cancer from 2 years before pregnancy, until the mother reaches 50 years of age; with the greatest increase seen for exposure in the pre-pregnancy and pregnancy period. These results may reflect shared causes for some cancers and some congenital anomalies. The similar results seen for paternal cancers indicate that the cause may be genetic or related to the families' social and environmental conditions.",,"['Momen, Natalie C', 'Ernst, Andreas', 'Arendt, Linn Hakonsen', 'Olsen, Jorn', 'Li, Jiong', 'Gissler, Mika', 'Rasmussen, Finn', 'Ramlau-Hansen, Cecilia Host']","['Momen NC', 'Ernst A', 'Arendt LH', 'Olsen J', 'Li J', 'Gissler M', 'Rasmussen F', 'Ramlau-Hansen CH']","['Department of Public Health, Section for Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Public Health, Section for Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Public Health, Section for Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Epidemiology, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'THL National Institute for Health and Welfare, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Karolinska Institute, Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Division of Family Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Public Health, Section for Epidemiology, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pregnancy', '*Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/03/07 06:00,2017/08/26 06:00,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2016/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0173355 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-33508 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 6;12(3):e0173355. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0173355. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5338803,,20170306,,,,,,,,,,,

Weighted generalized linear models adjusted costs and utilization (hospitalizations, inpatient days, and outpatient visit-days) for differences in age, sex, diagnosis year, region, insurance plan type, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index), and 60-day prediagnosis costs. Because mortality data were not available, models could not be adjusted for survival times. Among 29,915 patients with a primary diagnosis of AML, 985 patients met inclusion criteria (774 [79%] receiving chemotherapy alone and 211 [21%] alloHCT). Adjusted mean 1-year costs were $280,788 for chemotherapy and $544,178 for alloHCT. Patients receiving chemotherapy alone had a mean of 4 hospitalizations, 52.9 inpatient days, and 52.4 outpatient visits in the year after AML diagnosis; patients receiving alloHCT had 5 hospitalizations, 92.5 inpatient days, and 74.5 outpatient visits. Treating AML in the first year after diagnosis incurs substantial healthcare costs and utilization with chemotherapy alone and with alloHCT. Our analysis informs healthcare providers, policymakers, and payers so they can better understand treatment costs and utilization for privately insured patients aged 50 to 64 with AML.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Better selection of critically ill Allo-SCT patients for intensive care may alleviate costs to the patients, families, and the health care system. We aimed to develop a prognostic index tailored for critically ill Allo-SCT patients as traditional instruments are of limited value in this setting. Six hundred fifty-six Allo-SCT patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 2001 and 2010 were divided into training and test sets. Of the 3 multivariable regression models built to predict hospital mortality in the training set, the model with the largest area under receiver operating curve (AUC) in the test set was selected as the prognostic index for intensive care after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (PICAT). The parameters included in the regression model with the highest AUC (.81) were time to ICU from hospital admission, lactate dehydrogenase, bilirubin, albumin, reason for ICU admission, prothrombin time-international normalized ratio, conditioning intensity, age, and comorbidity score. AUC for hospital mortality of PICAT (.80) was significantly larger than that of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) (.61) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) (.72) in all patients. Hospital mortality and median overall survival of patients with PICAT scores of 0 to 2 (n = 141), >2 to 4 (n = 242), and >4 (n = 182) were 34%, 69%, and 91%; and 7.59, .67, and .30 months, respectively. PICAT has good calibration and accuracy in predicting mortality for Allo-SCT patients requiring intensive care. Its AUC was significantly higher than APACHE II and SOFA scores and is also associated with overall survival.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) acts as a modulator of the beta-catenin regulated canonical pathway. Activation of DKK1 leads to apoptosis and growth suppression, whereas silencing by promoter hypermethylation results in abnormal WNT activation. The secreted inhibitor Dickkopf can antagonize WNT signaling by competitively binding to low density lipoprotein receptors (LRPs) 5 and 6. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied DKK1 gene promoter methylation and investigated DKK1, beta-catenin, LRP5, and LRP6 mRNA levels in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients (n = 90). Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing were used for methylation profiling and quantitative real-time PCR was used for mRNA detection. RESULTS: The DKK1 gene was examined for its promoter methylation and only 33% of patients were found methylated. On the other hand, B-ALL cases showed high expression of DKK1 (P = 0.01), LRP5 (P = 0.04), and LRP6 (P = 0.02) compared to normal bone marrow cells. CONCLUSION: DKK1 methylation exists in some of cases but is not sufficient for WNT pathway activation alone in pediatric B-ALL.",,"['Firtina, Sinem', 'Hatirnaz Ng, Ozden', 'Erbilgin, Yucel', 'Ozbek, Ugur', 'Sayitoglu, Muge']","['Firtina S', 'Hatirnaz Ng O', 'Erbilgin Y', 'Ozbek U', 'Sayitoglu M']","['Department of Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Genetics, Institute for Experimental Medicine, Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, LDL/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Wnt Signaling Pathway/genetics', 'beta Catenin/analysis/genetics/metabolism']",,,2017/03/07 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2015/07/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1507-106 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2017 Feb 27;47(1):357-363. doi: 10.3906/sag-1507-106.,,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (DKK1 protein, human)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",,,20170227,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported a set of lipid metabolism (LiMe) genes with high expression in the contralateral unaffected breasts (CUBs) of ER-negative cancer cases. We now further examine LiMe gene expression in both tumor and CUB, and investigate the role of Pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox-1 (PBX1) as a candidate common transcription factor for LiMe gene expression. mRNA was extracted from laser-capture microdissected epithelium from tumor and CUB of 84 subjects (28 ER-positive cases, 28 ER-negative cases, 28 healthy controls). Gene expression was quantitated by qRT-PCR. Logistic regression models were generated to predict ER status of the contralateral cancer. Protein expression of HMGCS2 and PBX1 was measured using immunohistochemistry. The effect of PBX1 on LiMe gene expression was examined by overexpressing PBX1 in MCF10A cells with or without ER, and by suppressing PBX1 in MDA-MB-453 cells. The expression of DHRS2, HMGCS2, UGT2B7, UGT2B11, ALOX15B, HPGD, UGT2B28 and GLYATL1 was significantly higher in ER-negative versus ER-positive CUBs, and predicted ER status of the tumor in test and validation sets. In contrast, LiMe gene expression was significantly lower in ER-negative than ER-positive tumors. PBX1 overexpression in MCF10A cells up-regulated most LiMe genes, but not in MCF10A cells overexpressing ER. Suppressing PBX1 in MDA-MB-453 cells resulted in decrease of LiMe gene expression. Four binding sites of PBX1 and cofactor were identified in three lipid metabolism genes using ChIP-qPCR. These data suggest a novel role for PBX1 in the regulation of lipid metabolism genes in benign breast, which may contribute to ER-negative tumorigenesis.",['(c) 2017 UICC.'],"['Wang, Jun', 'Shidfar, Ali', 'Ivancic, David', 'Ranjan, Manish', 'Liu, Liannian', 'Choi, Mi-Ran', 'Parimi, Vamsi', 'Gursel, Demirkan B', 'Sullivan, Megan E', 'Najor, Matthew S', 'Abukhdeir, Abde M', 'Scholtens, Denise', 'Khan, Seema A']","['Wang J', 'Shidfar A', 'Ivancic D', 'Ranjan M', 'Liu L', 'Choi MR', 'Parimi V', 'Gursel DB', 'Sullivan ME', 'Najor MS', 'Abukhdeir AM', 'Scholtens D', 'Khan SA']","['Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Surgery, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Medicine, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL.', 'Robert H.

Furthermore, several studies have shown promising results in the human leukocyte antigen-matched setting. However, the use of high-dose cyclophosphamide has been associated with the development of cardiomyopathy. There is a paucity of data concerning posttransplant cardiac complications in patients undergoing PT-Cy-based HCT. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 176 patients undergoing HCT with PT-Cy was performed. The overall survival, left ventricular ejection fractions, brain natriuretic peptide levels, and cardiac comorbidities were reviewed. The associations between comorbidities and the onset of heart failure were assessed with a Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: Pretransplant cardiomyopathy was found in 16 patients (9.1%) but had no effect on their posttransplant overall survival. Thirty-five patients (21.9%) developed posttransplant cardiomyopathy, which correlated with increased mortality, but this was not statistically different from the frequency-matched non-PT-Cy cohort. The majority of these cardiomyopathies occurred in the setting of an infectious milieu. An age greater than 60 years and an HCT comorbidity index score equal to or greater than 4 were the only risk factors that correlated with posttransplant cardiomyopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of pretransplant cardiomyopathy does not negatively affect overall survival for patients who undergo HCT with PT-Cy. Furthermore, cardiomyopathy in PT-Cy patients is not caused by PT-Cy but is mostly concurrent with infectious complications and is associated with reduced overall survival.

Translocations that result in ALL are due to chromosome breaks. However, the exact mechanisms that cause these breaks have not been well studied. A detailed search of the breakpoints associated with ALL reported in the NCBI database shows that some are concentrated in limited regions of the chromosome, whereas others are scattered throughout. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the structural factors involved in chromosomal breaks in ALL. METHODS: We performed several bioinformatic studies on the sequences where chromosomal breakpoints have been reported in search of rearrangements: areas of high similarity, thermodynamic stability, composition and conformation of the DNA. RESULTS: Certain factors may influence chromosome breaks and are capable of predicting the propensity towards these types of events. CONCLUSIONS: These findings may be useful in the design of molecular techniques able to detect these changes in ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 IMSS. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The aim of the study was to examine the presence of autoimmune markers in HTLV carries. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from blood donors in Mashhad, northeastern Iran. One hundred and five HTLV-1 positive (cases) and 104 age- and sex-matched HTLV-1 negative donors (controls) were assessed for presence of serum autoimmune markers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean ages of cases and controls were 40.8 +/- 9.4 and 41.5 +/- 9.3 years, respectively (P = 0.5). In the case group, 81.9% and in the control group 83.7% were male (P = 0.74). The frequency of positive antinuclear antibodies and anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies in the serum of the two groups were not significantly different (P = 0.68 and P = 0.62, respectively). Only one antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-positive case (1%) was observed in the group and no anti-phospholipid immunoglobulin G positivity was observed. The frequency of rheumatoid factor (RF) was greater in case group than in the control group, although the difference was not significant (P = 0.08). The amount of RF in all 12 RF positive sera were higher than normal levels (33-37 IU/mL). CONCLUSION: Because we failed to detect any significant relation between serum autoimmune markers and HTLV-1 infection, and because of the relatively low prevalence of autoimmune diseases, it could be concluded that healthy HTLV-1 carriers do not produce rheumatologic-related auto-antibodies more than the healthy population.","['(c) 2017 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley &', 'Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Ahmadi Ghezeldasht, Sanaz', 'Hedayati-Moghaddam, Mohammad Reza', 'Habibi, Meysam', 'Mollahosseini, Farzad', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Miri, Rahele', 'Hatef Fard, MohammadReza', 'Sahebari, Maryam']","['Ahmadi Ghezeldasht S', 'Hedayati-Moghaddam MR', 'Habibi M', 'Mollahosseini F', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Miri R', 'Hatef Fard M', 'Sahebari M']","['Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Rheumatic Diseases Research Centre, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine and Razavi Khorasan Blood Transfusion Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Inflammation and Inflammatory Diseases Research Centre, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Blood Borne Infections Research Center, Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research (ACECR), Razavi Khorasan, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Rheumatic Diseases Research Centre, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Rheumatic Diseases Research Centre, School of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Rheum Dis,International journal of rheumatic diseases,101474930,IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies/blood', 'Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic/blood', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/blood', 'Autoantibodies/*blood', '*Autoimmunity', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Carrier State/blood/*immunology/virology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/diagnosis/*immunology/virology', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Iran', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Serologic Tests']",['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'HTLV1', 'Human T lymphotropic virus type 1', 'Iran', 'autoimmune markers', 'autoimmunity', 'case-control study']",2017/03/07 06:00,2018/09/01 06:00,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1756-185X.13002 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Rheum Dis. 2018 Jan;21(1):108-113. doi: 10.1111/1756-185X.13002.

Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) is an antiapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis-regulating proteins. It has been reported that Mcl-1 plays a pivotal role in protecting cells against apoptosis. Presently, the effects of Ang II on the expression of Mcl-1 remain unknown. In this study, we report, for the first time, that the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 is degraded by the proteasome during Ang II-induced apoptosis in HUVECs. Notably, our results demonstrate that prior phosphorylation by GSK-3beta is required for proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. Notably, the reduced level of Mcl-1 was abolished by a specific GSK-3beta inhibitor, suggesting that the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 by GSK-3beta is required for proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1. Overexpression of Mcl-1 rescued apoptosis induced by Ang II, however, knockdown of Mcl-1 exacerbated Ang II-induced apoptosis, thereby indicating that the protein level of Mcl-1 determines the response of endothelial cells to this drug.

Involvement of lymph nodes and extranodal structures is considered infrequent. Herein we describe our institutional experience of nodal (n = 10) and extranodal (n = 3) HCL during a 30-year period. METHODS AND RESULTS: Ten patients had prior evidence of HCL within the BM or PB at a median 35.8 months before nodal/extranodal diagnosis (range: <1-175 months), and HCL was diagnosed concurrently within the bone marrow of one additional patient. Nodal involvement showed distinct architectural patterns, including diffuse (62% of cases), sinusoidal (25%) and nodular (13%). Extranodal involvement was characterized as diffuse infiltration through underlying structures in all cases. Morphological features ranged from classic 'fried-egg' cytology to a plasmacytoid appearance. Nodal/extranodal disease showed an overlapping immunophenotypical profile with other small B cell lymphomas, including expression of cyclin D1 (70%), CD43 (55%), CD10 (38%) and CD5 (8%). Rates of both CD43 and CD10 reactivity were higher than described previously in leukaemic HCL, suggesting that expression may be enriched in cases with extramedullary extension. CONCLUSIONS: Although uncommon, HCL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of small B cell neoplasms involving nodal/extranodal sites, given the therapeutic implications. In particular, recent discoveries including detection of the BRAF(V)(600E) mutation in nearly all cases of HCL and the availability of an antibody to CD103 for use in paraffin-embedded tissues will facilitate the distinction of HCL from other small B cell lymphomas in the nodal/extranodal setting.",['(c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Cortazar, Jacqueline M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Pinkus, Geraldine S', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A']","['Cortazar JM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Pinkus GS', 'Morgan EA']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5880-9337'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['extranodal', 'hairy cell leukemia', 'lymph node']",2017/03/07 06:00,2018/04/12 06:00,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2017/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13206 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2017 Jul;71(1):112-124. doi: 10.1111/his.13206.

The aim of this study was to describe the clinicopathological features of acute leukaemias with a pure erythroid phenotype (ALPEP) irrespective of their WHO classification and to determine if ALPEP represents a distinct clinicopathological entity. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified seven cases of ALPEP, in which immature cells fulfilled WHO morphological and immunophenotypical criteria for PEL. All patients except one were male, with a median age of 60 years. Three cases represented de novo PEL, three were therapy-related myeloid neoplasms and one was a blast phase of a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Extensive tumour necrosis was present in five cases (71%). Five cases with available modal karyotypes all demonstrated a complex karyotype involving the TP53 gene locus, with three cases (60%) also showing a monosomy 5 or deletion 5q and additional material on chromosome 19q13. All patients died of their disease, with a mean overall survival of 189 and 64.7 days in cases without and with necrosis on the initial biopsy, respectively.

However, we have found that lung cancer cells constantly develop a high level of resistance to ATO. In this study, we have explored a possibility of combination of dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and ATO treatments to reduce ATO resistance of lung cancer cells. We determined the combinatory effects of DHA and ATO on cytotoxicity of human lung adenocarcinoma (A549) cells. We showed that co-exposure to DHA and ATO of A549 cells synergistically increased the cytotoxicity and apoptotic cell death in the cells. We found that the synergistic effect of DHA and ATO in promoting apoptosis mainly resulted from increased cellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. ATO alone only exerted moderate growth inhibitory effects on A549 cells. The results indicate that DHA can significantly sensitize ATO-induced cytotoxicity of A549 lung cancer cells through apoptosis mediated by ROS-induced DNA damage. Interestingly, we found that the combinatory treatment of DHA and ATO did not result in significant adverse effects in normal human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells.

IM is metabolized mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP) in the liver, specifically the CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 enzymes. Polymorphisms in these genes can alter the enzyme activity of IM and may affect its response. In this study, the impact of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), CYP3A5*3 (6986A>G) and CYP3A4*18 (878T>C), on IM treatment response in CML patients (n = 270; 139 IM resistant and 131 IM good responders) was investigated. METHODS: Genotyping of CYP3A4*18 and CYP3A5*3 was performed using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. The association between allelic variants and treatment response was assessed by means of odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals calculated by logistic regression. RESULTS: Our results indicated that CML patients carrying the heterozygous (AG) and homozygous variant (GG) genotype of CYP3A5*3 were associated with a significantly lower risk of acquiring resistance with OR 0.171; 95% CI: 0.090-0.324, p < 0.001 and OR 0.257; 95% CI: 0.126-0.525, p < 0.001, respectively. Although CML patients carrying the heterozygous (TC) genotype of CYP3A4*18 showed a lower risk of acquiring resistance toward IM (OR 0.648; 95% CI: 0.277-1.515), the association was not statistically significant (p = 0.316). No homozygous variant (CC) genotype of CYP3A4*18 was detected among the CML patients. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that polymorphism of CYP3A5*3 is associated with IM treatment response in Malaysian CML patients with carriers of CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3 genotypes posing lower risk for development of resistance to IM.",,"['Maddin, Najlaa', 'Husin, Azlan', 'Gan, Siew Hua', 'Aziz, Baba Abdul', 'Ankathil, Ravindran']","['Maddin N', 'Husin A', 'Gan SH', 'Aziz BA', 'Ankathil R']","['Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan Malaysia.', 'Haemato-Oncology Unit and Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan Malaysia.', 'Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan Malaysia.', 'International Medical University Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, 57000 Bukit Jalil, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur Malaysia.', 'Human Genome Centre, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 16150 Kubang Kerian, Kelantan Malaysia.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Oncol Ther,Oncology and therapy,101677510,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CYP3A4*18', 'CYP3A5*3', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib mesylate', 'Single-nucleotide polymorphisms']",2016/01/01 00:00,2016/01/01 00:01,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2016/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40487-016-0035-x [doi]', '35 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncol Ther. 2016;4(2):303-314. doi: 10.1007/s40487-016-0035-x.

Published literature has reported many AML signs and symptoms, as well as their impact on patients. However, there are no publications on the experience of living with AML from the patient's perspective. In this study, we performed qualitative interviews with patients with AML to understand their experience. METHODS: Participants were recruited from the US and Japan. All patients were screened to assess eligibility, and were divided into four subgroups (i.e., newly-diagnosed, high-intensity chemotherapy; newly-diagnosed, low-intensity chemotherapy; relapse/refractory; and post-transplant). Patients were interviewed over the phone by a trained researcher and asked about their day-to-day experience with AML. Signs/symptoms and impacts were coded, analyzed using Atlas.ti software, and reported as frequencies, with the medians of patient-reported disturbance levels (0-10) computed for each symptom and impact. RESULTS: The most commonly reported sign/symptom in the US was fatigue (95.7%), followed by bruising and weakness (both 78.3%), and in Japan, nausea (94.4%), followed by fatigue and headache (both 88.9%). The most commonly reported impact in the US was a decreased ability to maintain social/familial roles (91.3%), followed by anxiety and a decreased ability to function (both 87.0%), and most commonly reported in Japan was anxiety, a decreased ability to function, and remission uncertainty (94.4%). CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of signs/symptoms and their level of disturbance varied between the US and Japan, there was remarkable consistency in the types of signs/symptoms and impacts reported across all patients. The consistency in the experience of the disease across patients suggests that measurement of AML experience can be achieved by using the same tool for most, if not all, of these patients.

However, much debate remains about the regulatory framework of tissue banks. OBJECTIVE: This study explored the views of haematological cancer patients regarding tissue banking and how tissue banks should operate. METHODS: Haematological cancer patients from three outpatient clinics in Australia completed a questionnaire examining their preferences for tissue banking as well as items about their sociodemographic characteristics, disease and treatment history. RESULTS: The majority of participants (95%) reported being willing to allow their leftover tissue to be used for medical research. Three quarters (76%) supported the idea of their medical record being linked to their tissue sample, and 77% preferred a blanket (one-off) consent model for future research use of their tissue sample. Only 57 (27%) participants had been asked to give a tissue sample for research, 98% of whom gave permission. CONCLUSION: The majority of haematological cancer patients are willing to donate their leftover tissue to a tissue bank and have their medical records linked to tissue samples and prefer a one-off consent process. These novel data from potential donors inform the debate about how tissue banks might operate.

One of the key epigenetic changes in AML is gene silencing by DNA methylation. The importance of this alteration is illustrated by the induction of remissions in AML by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR, decitabine), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation. However, most patients induced into remission by 5-AZA-CdR will relapse, suggesting that a second agent should be sought to increase the efficacy of this epigenetic therapy. An interesting candidate for this purpose is 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep). This analog inhibits EZH2, a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates lysine 27 histone H3 (H3K27me3), a marker for gene silencing. This second epigenetic silencing mechanism also plays an important role in leukemogenesis as shown in preclinical studies where DZNep exhibits potent inhibition of colony formation by AML cells. We reported previously that 5-AZA-CdR in combination with DZNep exhibits a synergistic antineoplastic action against human HL-60 AML cells and the synergistic activation of several tumor suppressor genes. In this report, we showed that this combination also induced a synergistic activation of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. The synergistic antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR plus DZNep was also observed on a second human myeloid leukemia cell line, AML-3. In addition, 5-AZA-CdR in combination with the specific inhibitors of EZH2, GSK-126, or GSK-343, also exhibited a synergistic antineoplastic action on both HL-60 and AML-3. The combined action of 5-AZA-CdR and DZNep on global gene expression in HL-60 cells was investigated in greater depth using RNA sequencing analysis. We observed that this combination of epigenetic agents exhibited a synergistic activation of hundreds of genes. The synergistic activation of so many genes that suppress malignancy by 5-AZA-CdR plus DZNep suggests that epigenetic gene silencing by DNA and histone methylation plays a major role in leukemogenesis. Targeting DNA and histone methylation is a promising approach that merits clinical investigation for the treatment of AML.",,"['Momparler, Richard L', 'Cote, Sylvie', 'Momparler, Louise F', 'Idaghdour, Youssef']","['Momparler RL', 'Cote S', 'Momparler LF', 'Idaghdour Y']","[""Departement de Pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada; Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine , Montreal, QC , Canada."", ""Centre de recherche, Service d'hematologie/oncologie, CHU-Saint-Justine , Montreal, QC , Canada."", 'Department of Biology, New York University Abu Dhabi , Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,['NOTNLM'],"['3-deazaneplanocin A', '5-aza-2-deoxycytidine', 'chemotherapy', 'epigenetics', 'gene expression', 'myeloid leukemia']",2017/03/07 06:00,2017/03/07 06:01,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2016/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2017.00019 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2017 Feb 15;7:19. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2017.00019. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5309231,,20170215,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to detect the pattern of NKD2 expression in 113 AML patients and 24 controls. Real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) and bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP) were carried out to detect NKD2 promoter methylation in 101 AML patients and 24 controls with available DNA. RESULTS: The level of NKD2 transcript in AML patients was significantly down-regulated as compared with controls (P=0.039). NKD2 methylation level in AML patients was significantly higher than controls (P=0.044). Moreover, NKD2 methylation negatively correlated with NKD2 expression in AML patients (R=-0.218, P=0.029). Furthermore, demethylation of NKD2 could increase NKD2 expression in the leukemic cell line THP1 (P<0.05). NKD2 low-expressed and high-expressed patients showed no statistical significance in complete remission (CR) rate among cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). However, low NKD2 expression was associated with shorter overall survival (OS) time and acted as independent risk factor in CN-AML according to Kaplan-Meier (P=0.029) and Cox regression analyses (P=0.022). Furthermore, gene expression (GEP) data also confirmed the prognostic value of NKD2 expression in CN-AML patients. Moreover, NKD2 showed significantly increased level in post-CR than initial diagnosis in follow-up AML patients (P=0.024).

RAF-1 kinase and pancreas duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX-1) are major factors that promote survival of cells and maintain normal insulin functions. In this study we investigated the effect of a beta-adrenergic receptor agonist and antagonist on RAF-1 and PDX-1, and their respective effects on apoptosis and insulin release in RIN-m5F cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: RIN-m5F cells were cultured in normal (5 mM) and high (25 mM) glucose to mimic diabetic conditions, followed by treatment with 5 microM, 10 microM and 20 microM of isoproterenol and isoproterenol + propranolol for 6, 12 and 24 h. Western blotting and reverse transcription analysis were performed to examine the expression of RAF-1 and PDX-1. Annexin-V-FITC and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assays were used to investigate apoptosis. ELISA was used to measure insulin levels. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was conducted to investigate the expression of genes. RESULTS: Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol significantly induced RAF-1 and PDX-1 genes in a concentration-dependent and time-independent manner. Changes were significant both at protein and mRNA levels. Up-regulation of RAF-1 and PDX-1 was accompanied by improved insulin levels and reduced apoptosis. Concentrations of 10 microM and 20 microM for 12 and 24 h were more effective in achieving significant differences in the experimental and control groups. Propranolol reversed the effect of isoproterenol mostly at maximum concentrations and time periods.

Since its discovery, AML1-ETO has served as a prototype to understand how leukemia fusion proteins deregulate transcription to promote leukemogenesis. Another leukemia fusion protein, E2A-Pbx1, generated by the t(1;19) translocation, is involved in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs). While AML1-ETO and E2A-Pbx1 are structurally unrelated fusion proteins, we have recently shown that a common axis, the ETO/E-protein interaction, is involved in the regulation of both fusion proteins, underscoring the importance of studying protein-protein interactions in elucidating the mechanisms of leukemia fusion proteins. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we aim to summarize these new developments while also providing a historic overview of the related early studies. METHODS: A total of 218 publications were reviewed in this article, a majority of which were published after 2004.We also downloaded 3D structures of AML1-ETO domains from Protein Data Bank and provided a systematic summary of their structures. RESULTS: By reviewing the literature, we summarized early and recent findings on AML1-ETO, including its protein-protein interactions, transcriptional and leukemogenic mechanisms, as well as the recently reported involvement of ETO family corepressors in regulating the function of E2A-Pbx1. CONCLUSION: While the recent development in genomic and structural studies has clearly demonstrated that the fusion proteins function by directly regulating transcription, a further understanding of the underlying mechanisms, including crosstalk with other transcription factors and cofactors, and the protein-protein interactions in the context of native proteins, may be necessary for the development of highly targeted drugs for leukemia therapy.",,"['Li, Jian', 'Guo, Chun', 'Steinauer, Nickolas', 'Zhang, Jinsong']","['Li J', 'Guo C', 'Steinauer N', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Physiology, Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63104, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Front Biol (Beijing),Frontiers in biology,101541748,,,['NOTNLM'],"['AML1-ETO', 'E-proteins', 'E2A-Pbx1', 'chromosomal translocation', 'leukemia', 'transcription']",2017/03/07 06:00,2017/03/07 06:01,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11515-016-1415-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Front Biol (Beijing). 2016 Aug;11(4):285-304. doi: 10.1007/s11515-016-1415-1.

A functional FAS -670 polymorphism in an interferon (IFN)-regulated STAT1-binding site has been associated to both ATL and HAM/TSP susceptibility. Fas(hi) T stem cell memory (Tscm) cells have been identified as the hierarchical apex of ATL, but have not been investigated in HAM/TSP. In addition, both FAS and STAT1 have been identified in an IFN-inducible HAM/TSP gene signature, but its pathobiological significance remains unclear. We comprehensively explored Fas expression (protein/mRNA) and function in lymphocyte activation, apoptosis, proliferation, and transcriptome, in PBMC from a total of 47 HAM/TSP patients, 40 asymptomatic HTLV-1-infected individuals (AC), and 58 HTLV-1 -uninfected healthy controls. Fas surface expression followed a two-step increase from HC to AC and from AC to HAM/TSP. In HAM/TSP, Fas levels correlated positively to lymphocyte activation markers, but negatively to age of onset, linking Fas(hi) cells to earlier, more aggressive disease. Surprisingly, increased lymphocyte Fas expression in HAM/TSP was linked to decreased apoptosis and increased lymphoproliferation upon in vitro culture, but not to proviral load. This Fas(hi) phenotype is HAM/TSP-specific, since both ex vivo and in vitro Fas expression was increased as compared to multiple sclerosis (MS), another neuroinflammatory disorder. To elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying non-apoptotic Fas signaling in HAM/TSP, we combined transcriptome analysis with functional assays, i.e., blocking vs. triggering Fas receptor in vitro with antagonist and agonist-, anti-Fas mAb, respectively. Treatment with agonist anti-Fas mAb restored apoptosis, indicating biased, but not defective Fas signaling in HAM/TSP. In silico analysis revealed biased Fas signaling toward proliferation and inflammation, driven by RelA/NF-kappaB. Correlation of Fas transcript levels with proliferation (but not apoptosis) was confirmed in HAM/TSP ex vivo transcriptomes. In conclusion, we demonstrated a two-step increase in Fas expression, revealing a unique Fas(hi) lymphocyte phenotype in HAM/TSP, distinguishable from MS. Non-apoptotic Fas signaling might fuel HAM/TSP pathogenesis, through increased lymphoproliferation, inflammation, and early age of onset.",,"['Menezes, Soraya Maria', 'Leal, Fabio E', 'Dierckx, Tim', 'Khouri, Ricardo', 'Decanine, Daniele', 'Silva-Santos, Gilvaneia', 'Schnitman, Saul V', 'Kruschewsky, Ramon', 'Lopez, Giovanni', 'Alvarez, Carolina', 'Talledo, Michael', 'Gotuzzo, Eduardo', 'Nixon, Douglas F', 'Vercauteren, Jurgen', 'Brassat, David', 'Liblau, Roland', 'Vandamme, Anne Mieke', 'Galvao-Castro, Bernardo', 'Van Weyenbergh, Johan']","['Menezes SM', 'Leal FE', 'Dierckx T', 'Khouri R', 'Decanine D', 'Silva-Santos G', 'Schnitman SV', 'Kruschewsky R', 'Lopez G', 'Alvarez C', 'Talledo M', 'Gotuzzo E', 'Nixon DF', 'Vercauteren J', 'Brassat D', 'Liblau R', 'Vandamme AM', 'Galvao-Castro B', 'Van Weyenbergh J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven , Leuven , Belgium.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University , Washington, DC , USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven , Leuven , Belgium.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; LIMI, Goncalo Moniz Research Center (CPqGM), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador, Brazil.', 'LIMI, Goncalo Moniz Research Center (CPqGM), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) , Salvador , Brazil.', 'LIMI, Goncalo Moniz Research Center (CPqGM), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) , Salvador , Brazil.', 'LIMI, Goncalo Moniz Research Center (CPqGM), Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ) , Salvador , Brazil.', 'Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health , Salvador , Brazil.', 'Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia , Lima , Peru.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia , Lima , Peru.', 'Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru; Departamento de Enfermedades Infecciosas, Tropicales y Dermatologicas, Hospital Cayetano Heredia, Lima, Peru.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology & Tropical Medicine, The George Washington University , Washington, DC , USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven , Leuven , Belgium.', 'INSERM UMR1043 and Pole des Neurosciences, Hopital Purpan, Universite de Toulouse , Toulouse , France.', 'INSERM UMR1043 and Pole des Neurosciences, Hopital Purpan, Universite de Toulouse , Toulouse , France.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Center for Global Health and Tropical Medicine, Unidade de Microbiologia, Instituto de Higiene e Medicina Tropical, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Bahiana School of Medicine and Public Health , Salvador , Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, Clinical and Epidemiological Virology, KU Leuven , Leuven , Belgium.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Fas/CD95', 'HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis', 'NF-kappaB', 'apoptosis', 'interferon', 'lymphoproliferative disease', 'multiple sclerosis', 'proliferation']",2017/03/07 06:00,2017/03/07 06:01,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2016/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2017.00097 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2017 Feb 14;8:97. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2017.00097. eCollection 2017.,,,PMC5306374,,20170214,,,,,,,,,,,

Its etiological factors and clinicohematological profile in the Indian population are quite diverse. The information regarding its prognostic factors and cytogenetics is very scarce. OBJECTIVES: (1) To assess the clinicohematological profile, cytogenetics, prognostic factors, and outcome of MDS and (2) to study its progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the selected patients over the study period. METHODS: A prospective observational study was performed with patients from Department of Medicine and Hematology, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, who were diagnosed with MDS within the study period (from 1 January 2014 to 31 July 2015). Secondary causes of dysplasia were excluded. In possible cases, the international prognostic scoring system was followed. These patients were followed up for an additional 6 months to assess the progression of MDS to AML based on symptoms, signs, hemogram, or repeat peripheral smear/bone marrow studies. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 73% were aged >60 years. Disease was common in males, with a male:female ratio of 7:3. Thirty-five percent of the patients were working in agricultural and allied fields and had pesticide exposure. Patients with prior radiation exposure had significant association with adverse outcome. Fatigue was the prominent symptom and was reported by 90% of the patients. Blasts were >5% in peripheral smear; bone marrow cytopenia and dysplasia at the time of diagnosis had significant association with risk of transforming to AML. Refractory anemia (RA), observed in 22 patients, was the most common type of MDS. Most of the patients with RA with excess blasts type-1 and RA with excess blasts type-2 transformed to AML, and the association was statistically significant. Deletion of short arm of fifth chromosome (5q deletion) was detected in 11 patients. All of them showed good response to treatment with lenalidomide and had a favorable outcome. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the various etiological factors, and the clinical profile of MDS seen in the Indian population. Cytogenetic analysis and application of the international prognostic scoring system has a significant bearing on the outcome, as exemplified by the response to lenalidomide in patients with 5q deletion.

HBZ deregulates gene expression within the host cell by interacting with several cellular partners. Through its C-terminal ZIP domain, HBZ is able to contact and activate JunD, a transcription factor of the AP-1 family. JunD mRNA is intronless but can generate two protein isoforms by alternative translation initiation: JunD full-length and Delta JunD, an N-terminal truncated form unresponsive to the tumor suppressor menin. Using various cell lines and primary T-lymphocytes, we show that after serum deprivation HBZ induces the expression of Delta JunD isoform. We demonstrate that, unlike JunD, Delta JunD induces proliferation and transformation of cells. To decipher the mechanisms for Delta JunD production, we looked into the translational machinery and observed that HBZ induces nuclear retention of RPS25 mRNA and loss of RPS25 protein expression, a component of the small ribosomal subunit.

Although most cancer-causing mutations have been detected in the protein-coding regions of the cancer genome; driver mutations have recently also been discovered within noncoding genomic sequences. Thus, a current challenge is to gain precise understanding of how these unique genomic elements function in cancer pathogenesis, while clarifying mechanisms of gene regulation and identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention. Here we report a C-to-T single nucleotide transition that occurs as a somatic mutation in noncoding sequences 4 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the LMO1 oncogene in primary samples from patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This single nucleotide alteration conforms to an APOBEC-like cytidine deaminase mutational signature, and generates a new binding site for the MYB transcription factor, leading to the formation of an aberrant transcriptional enhancer complex that drives high levels of expression of the LMO1 oncogene. Since APOBEC-signature mutations are common in a broad spectrum of human cancers, we suggest that noncoding nucleotide transitions such as the one described here may activate potent oncogenic enhancers not only in T-lymphoid cells but in other cell lineages as well.",,"['Li, Z', 'Abraham, B J', 'Berezovskaya, A', 'Farah, N', 'Liu, Y', 'Leon, T', 'Fielding, A', 'Tan, S H', 'Sanda, T', 'Weintraub, A S', 'Li, B', 'Shen, S', 'Zhang, J', 'Mansour, M R', 'Young, R A', 'Look, A T']","['Li Z', 'Abraham BJ', 'Berezovskaya A', 'Farah N', 'Liu Y', 'Leon T', 'Fielding A', 'Tan SH', 'Sanda T', 'Weintraub AS', 'Li B', 'Shen S', 'Zhang J', 'Mansour MR', 'Young RA', 'Look AT']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', ""Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Ministry of Health, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."", 'Pediatric Translational Medicine Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA."", 'Department of Haematology, UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, UK.', 'Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"[""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'APOBEC Deaminases/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Genes, myb', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'LIM Domain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptome']",,,2017/03/07 06:00,2017/10/25 06:00,['2017/03/07 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu201775 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2017.75 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Oct;31(10):2057-2064. doi: 10.1038/leu.2017.75.

Inhibin-alpha gene mutations differed significantly between lymphoid (heterozygote) and myeloid (homozygote) leukemia cells. LOH in the inhibin-alpha gene was detected in lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells, with the exception of Jurkat cells. Treatment with 5-AzaC, a demethylating agent, resulted in increased inhibin-alpha mRNA and protein levels in most of the cell lines. Also, 5-AzaC treatment inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis.

Previous studies have indicated that cancers with increased levels of aerobic glycolysis are insensitive to numerous forms of chemotherapy and respond poorly to radiotherapy. Whether glycolysis serves a key role in drug resistance of leukaemia cells remains unclear. The present study systematically investigated aerobic glycolytic alterations and regulation in K562/adriamycin (ADM) multidrugresistant (MDR) and ADMsensitive K562 leukaemia cells in normoxia, and the association between drug resistance and improper glycometabolism. The cell proliferating activity was assessed with an MTT colorimetric assay, glycolysis, including glucose consumption, lactate export and keyenzyme activity was determined by corresponding commercial testing kits. The expression levels of hexokinaseII (HKII), lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), glucose transporter4 (GLUT4), AKT, pAKT473/308, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), pmTOR, cMyc and hypoxiainducible factor1alpha (HIF1alpha) were analyzed by western blot or reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR). K562/ADM cells exhibited increased glucose consumption and lactate accumulation, increased lactate dehydrogenase, hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activities, and reduced phosphofructokinase activity. In addition, K562/ADM cells expressed significantly more HKII and GLUT4. Notably, inhibition of glycolysis effectively killed sensitive and resistant leukaemia cells and potently restored the sensitivity of MDR cells to the anticancer agent ADM. The AKT serine/threonine kinase (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, a crucial regulator of glycometabolic homeostasis, mediated overactivation and upregulation of cMyc expression levels in K562/ADM cells, which directly stimulated glucose consumption and enhanced glycolysis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that MDR leukaemia cells exhibit increased aerobic glycolytic activity and that this may be responsible for resistance to chemotherapeutics in leukaemia MDR cells via activation of the AKTmTORcMyc signalling pathway.

In particular, the presence of residual telomere sequences at the site of translocation in 3 of the 4 cases makes a compelling case for telomere fusion. This is the first description of a recurrent telomere fusion event in any malignant condition. The 20q subtelomeric region was retained in all 4 examples despite deletion of the 20q12 region closer to the centromere. The original dicentric chromosome in all 4 cases contained nucleolus organiser region material from the short arm of chromosome 22 and had also undergone secondary rearrangements that produced amplification of the common gained region on 20q. We propose that the sequence of events producing this chromosome abnormality is: degradation of the telomeres, formation of an unstable dicentric chromosome by 20q and 22p telomere fusion, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles causing copy number aberration between the centromeres, selection of cells with 20q12 deletion, and further selection of cells with 20q11.2 gain. The last 2 steps are driver events responsible for the abnormal chromosomes found in the malignant cells. Finding recurrent patterns in the complex genome reorganisation events that characterise poor-prognosis, complex-karyotype AML and MDS will help us understand the mechanisms and oncogenic driver mutations in these poorly understood malignancies.","['(c) 2017 S.

In those cases, discontinuation of treatment is usually needed and anti-asparaginase antibody production may also attenuate asparaginase activity, compromising its antileukemic effect. Till now, six pharmacogenetic studies have been performed in order to elucidate possible genetic predisposition for inter-individual differences in asparaginase hypersensitivity. In this review we have summarized the results of those studies which describe the involvement of four different genes, being polymorphisms in the glutamate receptor, ionotropic, AMPA 1 (GRIA1) the most frequently associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity.

DESIGN: We assembled a retrospective cohort of patients with CML (chronic phase, no prior cancer history, and confirmed to be Philadelphia chromosome positive) using data from electronic health records and chart reviews. Medication possession ratio (MPR) was used to measure drug adherence. SETTING: A large, community-based, integrated health plan in Southern California. PARTICIPANTS: The cohort consisted of 245 adult patients (>/=18 years old) with Philadelphia positive chronic phase CML diagnosed from 2001 to 2012 and followed through 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In survival analyses, we examined the association of TKI adherence (MPR) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring test frequency with the composite clinical outcome, progression to accelerated phase disease-blast crisis or mortality (progression-free survival). The cohort was followed for a maximum of 13 years (median 4.6 years). RESULTS: Over 90% of the cohort initiated TKI therapy within 3 months of diagnosis, and the mean MPR was 88% (SD 18%). Virtually all patients (96%) started on imatinib. The rates of progression to accelerated phase-blast crisis and mortality were lower in patients with greater TKI adherence (20.4/1000 person-years) versus lower adherence (27.0/1000 person-years). Patients who underwent PCR monitoring had a significantly reduced risk of progression or mortality, which was seen in patients with high and low TKI adherence status from both the groups (hazard ratio [HR] 0.07 [95% CI 0.03-0.19 if MPR >90%] and HR 0.70 [95% CI 0.02-0.21 if MPR<90%]). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that close clinical monitoring, which includes PCR monitoring in patients with high and low TKI drug adherence, is associated with a lower risk of progression or mortality.","['Copyright (c) 2017 American Pharmacists Association(R).

Cytotoxicity is primarily mediated by DNA-incorporated thioguanine nucleotides (DNA-TGN). The aim of this study was to establish whether DNA-TGN concentrations in blood leucocytes during maintenance therapy are associated with relapse-free survival. METHODS: In this substudy of the NOPHO ALL2008 phase 3 trial done in 23 hospitals in seven European countries (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania, Norway, and Sweden), we analysed data from centralised and blinded analyses of 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate metabolites in blood samples from patients with non-high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Eligible patients were aged 1.0-17.9 years; had been diagnosed with non-high-risk precursor B-cell or T-cell leukaemia; had been treated according to the Nordic Society of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology ALL2008 protocol; and had reached maintenance therapy in first remission. Maintenance therapy was (mercaptopurine 75 mg/m(2) once per day and methotrexate 20 mg/m(2) once per week, targeted to a leucocyte count of 1.5-3.0 x 10(9) cells per L). We measured DNA-TGN and erythrocyte concentrations of TGN nucleotides, methylated mercaptopurine metabolites, and methotrexate polyglutamates. The primary objective was the association of DNA-TGN concentrations and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate metabolites with relapse-free survival. The secondary endpoint was the assessment of DNA-TGN concentration and 6-mercaptopurine and methotrexate metabolites during maintenance therapy phase 2. FINDINGS: Between Nov 26, 2008 and June 14, 2016, 1509 patients from the NOPHO ALL2008 study were assessed for eligibility in the DNA-TGN substudy, of which 918 (89%) of 1026 eligible patients had at least one DNA-TGN measurement and were included in the analyses. Median follow-up was 4.6 years (IQR 3.1-6.1). Relapse-free survival was significantly associated with DNA-TGN concentration (adjusted hazard ratio 0.81 per 100 fmol/mug DNA increase, 95% CI 0.67-0.98; p=0.029). In patients with at least five blood samples, erythrocyte concentrations of TGN, methylated mercaptopurine metabolites, and methotrexate polyglutamates were associated with DNA-TGN concentration (all p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest the need for intervention trials to identify clinically applicable strategies for individualised drug dosing to increase DNA-TGN concentration, and randomised studies to investigate whether such strategies improve cure rates compared with current dose adjustments based on white blood cell counts.

We assessed adolescent predictors of AML in adults, with a main focus on adolescent BMI. METHODS: The study included 2,310,922 16-19-year-old Jewish Israeli adolescents (mean age 17.3 +/- 0.4, 59.5% male), called up for an obligatory health examination. Sociodemographic and health data, including measured weight and height, were gathered. Body mass index (BMI) was examined both as a continuous variable and grouped according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification and US-CDC percentiles. Bone-marrow-biopsy-verified AML cases diagnosed up to 31 December 2012 were identified by linkage to the Israel national cancer registry. Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards models were used to model time to diagnosis. RESULTS: During 47 million person years of follow-up, 568 AML cases were identified (crude incidence rate 1.21/100,000 person years). There was a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.041 (95% CI 1.015-1.068, p = 0.002) per unit BMI. The association was evident in those of Middle Eastern, North African, and European origin. A graded association was evident across the overweight and obese WHO grouping. With the US-CDC grouping, excess risk was evident in overweight but not in obese adolescents, although a test for trend in percentiles was significant (p = 0.004). Borderline associations were noted for origin (p = 0.065) (higher in the predominantly Ashkenazi European origin), sex (higher in women: HR = 1.24 (95% CI 0.99-1.55), and stature (HR = 1.013, 95% CI 1.000-1.026, per cm).

We have shown that PBX1-d expression in CD4(+) T cells is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in a mouse model as well as in human subjects. More specifically, PBX1-d expression leads to the production of autoreactive activated CD4+ T cells, a reduced frequency and function of Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells and an expansion of follicular helper T (Tfh) cells. Very little is known about the function of PBX1 in T cells, except that it directly regulates the expression of miRNAs associated with Treg and Tfh homeostasis. In the present study, we show that PBX1 directly regulated the expression of CD44, a marker of T cell activation. Two PBX1 binding sites in the promoter directly regulated CD44 expression, with PBX1-d driving a higher expression than the normal isoform PBX1-b. In addition, mutations in each of the two binding sites had different effects of PBX1-b and PBX1-d. Finally, we showed that an enhanced recruitment of co-factor MEIS by PBX1-d over PBX1-b, while there was no difference for co-factor PREP1 recruitment. Therefore, this study demonstrates that the lupus-associated PBX1-d isoform directly transactivates CD44, a marker of CD44 activation and memory, and that it has different DNA binding and co-factor recruitment relative to the normal isoform. Taken together, these results confirm that PBX1 directly regulates genes related to T cell activation and shows that the lupus-associated isoform PBX1-d has unique molecular functions.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Most success has been achieved for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells where CAR T-cells targeting CD19 show very high complete response rates for patients with refractory acute B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are close to approval for this indication. CD19 CAR T-cells are also effective against B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell lymphomas. Although encouraging, CAR T-cells have not yet proven clinically effective for solid tumors. This is mainly due to the lack of specific and homogenously expressed targets to direct the T-cells against and a hostile immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in solid tumors. Cancer vaccines based on dendritic cells (DC) are also making progress although clinical efficacy is still lacking. The likelihood of success is however increasing now when individual tumors can be sequences and patient-specific neoepitopes identified. Neoepitopes and/or neoantigens can then be included in patient-based DC vaccines. This review discusses recent advancements of DC vaccines and CAR T-cells with emphasis on the cancer-immunity cycle, and current efforts to design novel cell therapies.","['Copyright (c) 2017 The Author(s).

We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of idelalisib in combination with a second-generation anti-CD20 antibody, ofatumumab, in a similar patient population. METHODS: In this global, open-label, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients with relapsed CLL progressing less than 24 months from last therapy. Patients refractory to ofatumumab were excluded. Patients were stratified by relapsed versus refractory disease, presence or absence of del(17p) or TP53 mutation, or both, and IGHV mutated versus unmutated. We randomised patients in a 2:1 ratio using a web-based interactive system that generated a unique treatment code, and assigned patients to receive either idelalisib plus ofatumumab (oral idelalisib 150 mg twice daily continuously plus ofatumumab 300 mg intravenously in week 1, then 1000 mg intravenously weekly for 7 weeks, and every 4 weeks for 16 weeks) or ofatumumab alone (ofatumumab dosing as per the combination group, except 2000 mg was substituted for the 1000 mg dose). An independent review committee assessed response, including progressive disease, based on imaging using modified International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia 2008 criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by an independent review committee in the intention-to-treat population. We did a primary analysis (data cutoff Jan 15, 2015) and an updated analysis (data cutoff Sept 1, 2015). This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT01659021. FINDINGS: Between Dec 17, 2012, and March 31, 2014, we enrolled 261 patients (median age 68 years [IQR 61-74], median previous therapies three [IQR 2-4]). At the primary analysis, median progression-free survival was 16.3 months (95% CI 13.6-17.8) in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group and 8.0 months (5.7-8.2) in the ofatumumab group (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.27, 95% CI 0.19-0.39, p<0.0001). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group were neutropenia (59 [34%] patients vs 14 [16%] in the ofatumumab group), diarrhoea (34 [20%] vs one [1%]), and pneumonia (25 [14%] vs seven [8%]). The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events in the ofatumumab group were neutropenia (14 [16%]), pneumonia (seven [8%]), and thrombocytopenia (six [7%] vs 19 [11%] in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group). Serious infections were more common in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group and included pneumonia (23 [13%] patients in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group vs nine [10%] in the ofatumumab group), sepsis (11 [6%] vs one [1%]), and Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (eight [5%] vs one [1%]). 22 treatment-related deaths occurred in the idelalisib plus ofatumumab group (the most common being sepsis, septic shock, viral sepsis, and pneumonia). Six treatment-related deaths occurred in the ofatumumab group (the most common being progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and pneumonia). INTERPRETATION: The idelalisib plus ofatumumab combination resulted in better progression-free survival compared with ofatumumab alone in patients with relapsed CLL, including in those with high-risk disease, and thus might represent a new treatment alternative for this patient population.

Betulonic acid (BA), a pentacyclic lupane-type triterpenoid, was reported to exhibit cytotoxicity toward various cancer cells and to be capable of inducing intrinsic apoptosis in solid tumours. However, the in vitro and in vivo apoptotic effects of BA against LSC remain unknown. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: We aimed to determine whether BA isolated from bark of Walsura pinnata Hassk (Meliaceae) has pro-apoptotic effects on LSC in in vitro and in vivo models. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: The population of high purity LSC was isolated from the Kasumi-1 cell line using magnetic sorting and characterised by flow cytometry. Cell viability was assessed using the MTS assay to examine dose- and time-dependent effects. The colony formation assay was performed in MethoCult(R) H4435 enriched media. Apoptosis was analysed using Annexin-V and propidium iodide staining, mitochondrial transmembrane potential was studied using JC-1 staining, and expression of apoptosis related genes (BAX, Bcl-2 and survivin) was evaluated by real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Caspase 3/7 and 9 activities were monitored through Promega Caspase-Glo(R) over a period of 24h. The in vivo antileukaemia activity was evaluated using LSC xenotransplanted zebrafish, observed for DNA fragmentation from apoptosis by TUNEL assay. RESULTS: BA maintained its potency against the LSC population in comparison to parental Kasumi-1 cells (fold differences </= 1.94) over various treatment time points and significantly inhibited the formation of colonies by LSC. Apoptosis was triggered by BA through the upregulation of BAX and suppression of Bcl-2 and survivin genes with the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, leading to the activation of caspase 9 followed by downstream caspase 3/7. BA was able to suppressed leukaemia formation and induced apoptosis in LSC xenotransplanted zebrafish. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that BA inhibited the proliferative and colonogenic properties of LSC. BA induced apoptosis in LSC through the mitochondria pathway and was effective in the in vivo zebrafish model. Therefore, BA could be a lead compound for further development into a chemotherapy agent against LSC.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier GmbH.

However, little is known about the effects of specialist treatment centres on survival outcomes especially for teenagers and young adults. This population-based study aimed to describe access to PTC and the associated trends in survival for 0-24 year olds accounting for stage of disease at presentation and treatment. METHODS: Patients diagnosed from 1998-2009 aged 0-24 years were extracted from the Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People, including information on all treating hospitals, followed-up until 31st December 2014. The six commonest cancer types were included: leukaemia (n = 684), lymphoma (n = 558), CNS tumours (n = 547), germ cell tumours (n = 364), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 171) and bone tumours (n = 163). Treatment was categorised into three groups: 'all', 'some' or 'no' treatment received at a PTC. Treatment at PTC was examined by diagnostic group and patient characteristics. Overall survival was modelled using Cox regression adjusting for case-mix including stage, treatment and other socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: Overall 72% of patients received all their treatment at PTC whilst 13% had no treatment at PTC. This differed by diagnostic group and age at diagnosis. Leukaemia patients who received no treatment at PTC had an increased risk of death which was partially explained by differences in patient case-mix (adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) = 1.73 (95%CI 0.98-3.04)). Soft tissue sarcoma patients who had some or no treatment at PTC had better survival outcomes, which remained after adjustment for patient case-mix (adjusted HR = 0.48 (95%CI 0.23-0.99)). There were no significant differences in outcomes for other diagnostic groups (lymphoma, CNS tumours, bone tumours and germ cell tumours). For leukaemia patients survival outcomes for low risk patients receiving no treatment at PTC were similar to high risk patients who received all treatment at PTC, implying a benefit for care at the PTC. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that for leukaemia patients receiving treatment at a PTC is associated with improved survival that may compensate for a poorer prognosis presentation.

Among these pathways, the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway is likely to play a major role. HO catalyzes the enzymatic degradation of heme with the simultaneous release of carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron (Fe(2+)), and biliverdin. This review focuses on the role of HO-1 in various hematological malignancies and the possibility of exploiting such targets to improve the outcome of well-established chemotherapeutic regimens. Recent Advances and Critical Issues: Interestingly, the inhibition of the expression of HO-1 (e.g., with siRNA) or HO activity (with competitive inhibitors) contributes to the increased efficacy of chemotherapy and improves the outcome in animal models. Furthermore, some hematological malignancies (e.g., chronic myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma) have served to explore the non-canonical functions of HO-1, such as the association between nuclear compartmentalization and genetic instability and/or chemoresistance. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The HO system may serve as an important tool in the field of hematological malignancies because it can be exploited to counteract chemoresistance and to monitor the outcome of bone marrow transplants and may be an additional target for combined therapies.

We examined the association between paternal age and specific types of childhood cancer in offspring in a large nationwide cohort of 1,904,363 children born in Denmark from 1978 through 2010. The children were identified in the Danish Medical Birth Registry and were linked to information from other national registers, including the Danish Cancer Registry. In total, 3,492 children were diagnosed with cancer before the age of 15 years. The adjusted hazard ratio of childhood cancer according to paternal age was estimated using Cox proportional hazards regressions. We found a 13% (95% confidence interval: 4-23%) higher hazard rate for every 5 years advantage in paternal age for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while no clear association was found for acute myeloid leukemia (hazard ratio pr. 5 years = 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-1.30). The estimates for neoplasms in the central nervous system suggested a lower hazard rate with higher paternal age (hazard ratio pr. 5 years = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.01).

Activated CLL cells are found within the lymphoid tumor micro-environment and overcoming immuno-suppression induced by these cells may improve anti-CLL immune responses. However, the mechanisms by which activated CLL cells inhibit T cell responses, and reagents targeting such mechanisms have not been identified. Here we demonstrate that the ability of in vitro activated CLL cells to suppress T cell proliferation is not reversed by the presence of ecto-nuclease inhibitors or blockade of IL-10, PD-1 and CTLA-4 pathways. Caffeine is both an adenosine receptor antagonist and a phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, p110delta (PI3Kdelta) inhibitor and, at physiologically relevant levels, significantly reversed suppression. Significant reversal of suppression was also observed with the PI3Kdelta specific inhibitor Idelalisib but not with adenosine receptor specific antagonists. Furthermore, addition of caffeine or Idelalisib to activated CLL cells significantly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT, a downstream kinase of PI3K, but did not affect CLL viability. These results suggest that caffeine, in common with Idelalisib, reduces the immuno-suppressive activity of activated CLL cells by inhibiting PI3Kdelta. These findings raise the possibility that these compounds may provide a useful therapeutic adjunct by reducing immuno-suppression within the tumor micro-environment of CLL.",,"['Hock, Barry D', 'MacPherson, Sean A', 'McKenzie, Judith L']","['Hock BD', 'MacPherson SA', 'McKenzie JL']","['Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Pathology Department, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Pathology Department, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Haematology Department, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand.', 'Pathology Department, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Caffeine/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Purines/*administration & dosage', 'Quinazolinones/*administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects']",,,2017/03/04 06:00,2017/08/23 06:00,['2017/03/04 06:00'],"['2016/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0172858 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-46402 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 3;12(3):e0172858. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172858. eCollection 2017.,,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",PMC5336221,,20170303,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein Bcr-Abl, which promotes the malignant transformation of CML cells, is mainly located in the cytoplasm, while the c-Abl protein which is expressed in the nucleus can induce apoptosis. Based on the hetero-dimerization of FKBP (the 12-kDa FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein) and FRB (the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of the protein kinase, mTOR) mediated by AP21967, we constructed a nuclear transport system to induce cytoplasmic Bcr-Abl into nuclear. In this study, we reported the construction of the nuclear transport system, and we demonstrated that FN3R (three nuclear localization signals were fused to FRBT2098L with a FLAG tag), HF2S (two FKBP domains were in tandem and fused to the SH2 domain of Grb2 with an HA tag) and Bcr-Abl form a complexus upon AP21967. Bcr-Abl was imported into the nucleus successfully by the nuclear transport system. The nuclear transport system inhibited CML cell proliferation through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) pathways mainly by HF2S. It was proven that nuclear located Bcr-Abl induced CML cell (including imatinib-resistant K562G01 cells) apoptosis by activation of p73 and its downstream molecules.

Exclusion criteria consisted of the following: previous anthracycline therapy, previous radiotherapy, history of heart failure or chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, and pregnancy. In all patients, in fasting state, a blood sample was drawn for the assessment of TLR2 and TLR4 gene expression. Gene expression was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) using blood collection, RNA isolation, cDNA reverse transcription, qRT-PCR and quantification of the relative expression.

Genome-wide association studies have demonstrated association at 10q21.2. Here, we sought to determine how this region influences HD-ALL risk. We impute genotypes across the locus, finding the single nucleotide polymorphism rs7090445 highly associated with HD-ALL (P=1.54 x 10(-38)), and residing in a predicted enhancer element. We show this region physically interacts with the transcription start site of ARID5B, that alleles of rs7090445 have differential enhancer activity and influence RUNX3 binding.

This study was done to investigate the prevalence and clinical manifestations of this infection among hematologic malignancies. Methodology:This cross-sectional study (descriptive-analytical) was performed while investigating medical records of 30 patients with hematologic malignancy affected by Mucormycosis in Imam Reza Hospital between 2001 and 2013. After collecting the data, it was entered in SPSS 19 Software with a provided checklist that included demographic characteristics, clinical manifestations, and it was analyzed by using descriptive (mean, frequency) and inferential (chi- square and independent -t-test) statistical methods (p-value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant). Findings:Overall, the prevalence of Mucormycosis was 4.29 per 100 patient hematologic malignancies. The infection proportion among men and women was 72. 2, 27.6%, respectively. The maximum cases of Mucormycosis were observed among AML patients (62.1%). The most common place of involvement was lung (89.4%) and fever was the most popular sign of the infection (100%). The most considerable and effective factor in the prognosis of infection was using combined therapy of Amphotericin Band surgery (debridement) that has statistically significant correlation (p<0.05).

Patients in whom the onset is early may have distinct molecular and clinical features or reflect a demographic continuum. The identification of differences between ""early onset"" patients and those diagnosed at a traditional age has the potential to advance understanding of the pathogenesis of myelodysplasia and may lead to formation of distinct morphological subcategories. We studied a cohort of 634 patients with various subcategories of myelodysplastic syndrome and secondary acute myeloid leukemia, stratifying them based on age at presentation and clinical parameters. We then characterized molecular abnormalities detected by next-generation deep sequencing of 60 genes that are commonly mutated in myeloid malignancies. The number of mutations increased linearly with age and on average, patients >50 years of age had more mutations. TET2, SRSF2, and DNMT3A were more commonly mutated in patients >50 years old compared to patients </=50 years old. In general, patients >50 years of age also had more mutations in spliceosomal, epigenetic modifier, and RAS gene families.

The impact of ABO mismatch on outcome following transplantation remains controversial and there are no published data regarding the impact of ABO mismatch in acute myeloid leukemia patients receiving haploidentical transplants. Using the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Acute Leukemia Working Group registry we identified 837 patients who underwent haploidentical transplantation. Comparative analysis was performed between patients who received ABO-matched versus ABO-mismatched haploidentical transplants for common clinical outcome variables. Our cohort consisted of 522 ABO-matched patients and 315 ABO-mismatched patients including 150 with minor, 127 with major, and 38 with bi-directional ABO mismatching. There were no significant differences between ABO matched and mismatched patients in terms of baseline disease and clinical characteristics. Major ABO mismatching was associated with inferior day 100 engraftment rate whereas multivariate analysis showed that bi-directional mismatching was associated with increased risk of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease [hazard ratio (HR) 2.387; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-4.66; P=0.01). Non-relapse mortality, relapse incidence, leukemia-free survival, overall survival, and chronic graft-versus-host disease rates were comparable between ABO-matched and -mismatched patients. Focused analysis on stem cell source showed that patients with minor mismatching transplanted with bone marrow grafts experienced increased grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease rates (HR 2.03; 95% CI: 1.00-4.10; P=0.04). Patients with major ABO mismatching and bone marrow grafts had decreased survival (HR=1.82; CI 95%: 1.048 - 3.18; P=0.033).

The classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) divides the disease into cutaneous mastocytosis, systemic mastocytosis, and localized mast cell tumors. On the basis of histomorphologic criteria, clinical parameters, and organ involvement, systemic mastocytosis is further divided into indolent systemic mastocytosis and advanced systemic mastocytosis variants, including aggressive systemic mastocytosis and mast cell leukemia. The clinical impact and prognostic value of this classification has been confirmed in numerous studies, and its basic concept remains valid. However, refinements have recently been proposed by the consensus group, the WHO, and the European Competence Network on Mastocytosis. In addition, new treatment options are available for patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and multikinase inhibitors directed against KIT D816V and other key signaling molecules. Our current article provides an overview of recent advances in the field of mastocytosis, with emphasis on classification, prognostication, and emerging new treatment options in advanced systemic mastocytosis.

This study aimed to investigate anti-cancer effects of Idelalisib, a potent PI3K-delta inhibitor, in a panel of hematological cell lines. The resulting data showed that Idelalisib decreased cell survival in all the tested cell lines; however, as compared to NB4, viability of other cell lines, irrespective of their molecular characteristics or even the compensatory activation of MEK/ERK pathway, was inhibited at higher concentrations. This study suggests for the first time that there is a significant correlation between relative response to Idelalisib and basal expression levels of anti-apoptotic genes, in particular survivin and MCL-1. Intriguingly, we found that Idelalisib-induced apoptosis in NB4, as the most sensitive cell line with the lowest expression level of the aforementioned genes, is executed probably via alteration in the transcriptional level of apoptosis-related genes coupled with p21-mediated caspase-3 activation. Moreover, the lower concentrations of Idelalisib combined with arsenic trioxide (ATO) produced synergistic anti-cancer effect in APL-derived NB4 cells. Overall, due to the pharmacologic safety of Idelalisib and its broad clinical effectiveness in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, our study suggests that this inhibitor is a promising agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, either as single agent or in a combined-modality strategy.",['Copyright (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

We sent a follow-up questionnaire to 15,445 donors of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) or bone marrow (BM) within a retrospective study design. The return rate was 91.3%, resulting in 37,287 observation years for PBSC donors and 25,656 for BM donors. Most donors assessed their health conditions as very good or good and had not been hospitalized or received long-term medical treatment including prescribed medication for more than 4 weeks since donation. Although there were no differences in the frequency of reported health events, BM donors more often rated their general health as very good or good. Ninety-five percent of donors after BM or PBSC donation would consider a second stem cell donation. In total, 93 malignancies were reported. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for a diagnosis of any type of cancer after PBSC donation was .94 (95% CI, .70 to 1.24) with a SIR below 1 indicating a lower risk than in the age- and sex-matched population. The SIR for a diagnosis of leukemia was 0 (95% CI, 0 to 1.88).

Cryo-SEM data of cells undergoing EV blebbing and shedding is presented here for the first time. The high-resolution images show good agreement with models describing the membrane processes of shedding. Cells that underwent a 48-h starvation treatment exhibited differing morphological features, including shrunken nucleus and elongated membrane protrusions. LPS treated cells, however, showed extensive blebbing originating from the cell membrane, in good agreement with the sizes of EVs imaged by cryo-TEM. EVs isolated from both types of stimulations were measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NanoSight), by which LPS-EVs samples exhibited higher concentration and smaller mean diameter, as compared to starvation-EVs. Our results suggest a difference in the effects of the two stimulation types on the shedding process and possibly on the type of EVs shed.

We selected two pediatric ALL patients who experienced testicular relapse and interrogated their leukemic cells with exome sequencing. The sequencing results and clonality analyses suggest that relapse of patient D483 directly evolved from the leukemic clone at diagnosis which survived chemotherapy. In contrast, relapse leukemia cells (both bone marrow and testis) of patient D727 were likely derived from a common ancestral clone, and testicular relapse likely arose independently from the bone marrow relapsed leukemia.

However, its association with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) remains poorly understood. METHODS: The expression of miR-21 was detected by real-time quantitative PCR in 75 children with de novo B-ALL as well as in 50 healthy controls. This study was conducted to evaluate the miR-21 as a biomarker for risk assessment, diagnosis and prognosis. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Compared with normal controls, miR-21 expression was significantly upregulated in childhood B-ALL patients. Using the receiver operating characteristic curve 3.23 was selected as the cut-off value of miR-21 expression in distinguishing patients from controls. Patients group with High miR-21 expression was significantly associated with those aged <2 and >10 years, lower platelets count, more incidence of CNS infiltration and poorer treatment outcome also, they showed a significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those with low miR-21 expression group. Its expression was an independent prognostic marker according to multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: This is the first report demonstrating the upregulation of miR-21 in childhood B-ALL, and its association with poor response to induction therapy, shorter DFS and OS. These results suggest that miR-21 upregulation represent an unfavorable prognostic marker in Childhood B-ALL.",,"['Labib, Hany Abedelmalik', 'Elantouny, Neveen G', 'Ibrahim, Nevin F', 'Alnagar, Ahmed A']","['Labib HA', 'Elantouny NG', 'Ibrahim NF', 'Alnagar AA']","['a Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Zagazig University , Zagazig , Egypt.', 'b Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine , Zagazig University , Zagazig , Egypt.', 'b Internal Medicine Department, Faculty of Medicine , Zagazig University , Zagazig , Egypt.', 'c Medical Oncology Department, Faculty of Medicine , Zagazig University , Zagazig , Egypt.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'ROC Curve', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'Childhood', 'miR-21']",2017/03/04 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2017/03/04 06:00'],"['2017/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2017.1292204 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2017 Aug;22(7):392-397. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2017.1292204.

Additional chromosomal abnormalities confer an adverse prognosis and are particularly common in the blast phase of CML (CML-BP). CBFB rearrangement, particularly CBFB-MYH11 fusion resulting from inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22), is an acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-defining alteration that is associated with a favorable outcome. The co-occurrence of BCR-ABL1 and CBFB rearrangement is extremely rare, and the significance of this finding remains unclear. We identified 10 patients with myeloid neoplasms harboring BCR-ABL1 and CBFB rearrangement. The study group included six men and four women with a median age of 51 years (range, 20-71 years). The sequence of molecular alterations could be determined in nine cases: BCR-ABL1 preceded CBFB rearrangement in seven, CBFB rearrangement preceded BCR-ABL1 in one, and both alterations were discovered simultaneously in one patient. BCR-ABL1 encoded for p210 kD in all cases in which BCR-ABL1 preceded CBFB rearrangement; a p190 kD was identified in the other three cases. Two patients were treated with the FLAG-IDA regimen (fludarabine, cytarabine, idarubicin, and G-CSF) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI); seven with other cytarabine-based regimens and TKIs, and one with ponatinib alone. At last follow up (median, 16 months; range 2-85), 7 of 10 patients had died. The co-existence of BCR-ABL1 and CBFB rearrangement is associated with poor outcome and a clinical course similar to that of CML-BP, and unlike de novo AML with CBFB rearrangement, suggesting that high-intensity chemotherapy with TKI should be considered in these patients.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Salem, Alireza', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Huh, Yang O', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Wang, Wei', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Salem A', 'Loghavi S', 'Tang G', 'Huh YO', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Wang W', 'Hu S', 'Luthra R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Khoury JD']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5492-1962', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/03/03 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2017/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.24710 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2017 Jun;92(6):520-528. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24710.

Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcripts and BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutation analysis were carried out in this study. Conventional and molecular cytogenetic analysis on metaphase chromosomes confirmed the presence of ider(22) chromosomes in both patients. Molecular characterization revealed the presence of a 210-kDa BCR-ABL1 type b3a2 and lack of mutations at the kinase domain region on the fusion product in both patients.

METHODS: Haematological cancer survivors were identified via 1 of 5 state-based cancer registries and invited to take part in a survey. Those who agreed were asked to pass on a questionnaire package to their support person. Measures included the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale, Support Persons' Unmet Need Survey, and sociodemographic questions. RESULTS: Nine-hundred and eighty-nine (66%) participating survivors had a participating support person. There were no significant differences in the proportion of urban versus rural support persons who reported elevated levels of depression (21% vs 23%), anxiety (16% vs 17%), or stress (16% vs 20%), P > .05. Odds of reporting at least 1 indicator of psychological morbidity increased by 10% to 17% for each additional high or very high unmet need and by 2% for those who had relocated from their usual place of residence for the survivor to receive treatment and was decreased by 5% to 54% for those support persons who reported that they had no chronic health conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological outcomes for rural and urban support persons are similar. Those who have poor health, have had to relocate, and who have multiple unmet needs are particularly vulnerable to poor psychological outcomes. These factors should be assessed to enable early intervention for those at risk of poor outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Carey, Mariko', 'Sanson-Fisher, Rob', 'Paul, Christine', 'Bradstock, Kenneth', 'Williamson, Anna', 'Campbell, H Sharon']","['Carey M', 'Sanson-Fisher R', 'Paul C', 'Bradstock K', 'Williamson A', 'Campbell HS']","['Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Priority Research Centre for Health Behaviour, Faculty of Health and Medicine, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, New Lambton, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Haematology Department, Westmead Hospital, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'The Leukaemia Foundation, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0549-1115'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Depression/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/ethnology/psychology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Racial Groups/psychology', 'Residence Characteristics', '*Rural Population', '*Social Support', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', '*Urban Population', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['anxiety', 'blood cancer', 'cancer', 'caregiver', 'carer', 'depression', 'haematological cancer', 'oncology', 'rural', 'support person', 'survivors']",2017/03/03 06:00,2018/10/03 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/03 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.4411 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2017 Nov;26(11):1952-1958. doi: 10.1002/pon.4411.

Objective: To assess the efficacy of cladribine (2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine) in the treatment of ECD. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study was a single-institution retrospective medical record review from January 1, 1998, to April 6, 2016, at a tertiary academic medical center. In all eligible cases, the diagnosis of ECD was made using clinical criteria in conjunction with histopathologic findings. Exposure: Cladribine therapy in first-line treatment or later. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two response criteria were used, clinical and radiological. For clinical response, the following criteria were used: complete response (complete resolution of symptoms attributed to ECD), partial response (partial resolution of symptoms attributed to ECD), stable disease (no change in symptoms attributed to ECD), and progressive disease (worsening of symptoms attributed to ECD). For radiological response, the following categories were used: complete response (complete resolution of proven or suspected lesion due to ECD), partial response (partial resolution of proven or suspected lesion due to ECD), stable disease (no significant change in proven or suspected lesion due to ECD for >/=3 months), and progressive disease (progression or worsening of proven or suspected lesion due to ECD). Results: A total of 63 adult patients with confirmed ECD were identified. Their median age at diagnosis of ECD was 54 years (age range, 18-80 years), and 67% (42 of 63) were male. Cladribine was the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent and was administered in 21 of 63 patients (33%). Their median age at the time of cladribine therapy was 62 years (age range, 40-78 years). Cladribine was used as the first-line treatment in 9 patients and as later-line treatment in the remaining 12 patients. The median number of cycles of cladribine administered was 2.5 (range, 1-6). The overall clinical response rate was 52% (9 of 17) (6% [1 of 17] complete response and 46% [8 of 17] partial response), with 18% (3 of 17) stable disease and 30% (5 of 17) progressive disease. Among patients who responded to cladribine therapy, the median duration of clinical response was 9 months (range, 6-129 months), with ongoing response in 2 patients. The overall radiological response rate was 54% (8 of 15) (all partial response), with 26% (4 of 15) stable disease and 20% (2 of 15) progressive disease. Treatment-related adverse effects included 2 infectious complications (pneumonia and central line infection, both requiring hospitalization) and 2 hematologic adverse effects (grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and grade 3 neutropenia, both requiring therapy discontinuation). Conclusions and Relevance: Cladribine has moderate clinical efficacy in the treatment of ECD and can be considered a treatment option in cases without the BRAF V600E mutation. It is generally well tolerated and may result in a durable response.",,"['Goyal, Gaurav', 'Shah, Mithun V', 'Call, Timothy G', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Hogan, William J', 'Go, Ronald S']","['Goyal G', 'Shah MV', 'Call TG', 'Litzow MR', 'Hogan WJ', 'Go RS']","['Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,JAMA Oncol,JAMA oncology,101652861,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Erdheim-Chester Disease/diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,,2017/03/03 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['2606436 [pii]', '10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0041 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA Oncol. 2017 Sep 1;3(9):1253-1256. doi: 10.1001/jamaoncol.2017.0041.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",PMC5824289,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate their application, we conducted a genome-wide insertion site profiling of the piggyBac (PB), Tol2 and Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons and the murine leukemia virus (MLV) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). PB and MLV preferred highly expressed genes, whereas Tol2 and SB preferred weakly expressed genes. However, correlations with DNase I hypersensitive sites were different for all vectors, indicating that chromatin accessibility is not the sole determinant. Therefore, we analysed various chromatin states. PB and MLV highly correlated with Cohesin, Mediator and ESC-specific transcription factors. Notably, CTCF sites were correlated with PB but not with MLV, suggesting MLV prefers smaller promoter-enhancer loops, whereas PB insertion encompasses larger chromatin loops termed topologically associating domains. Tol2 also correlated with Cohesin and CTCF. However, correlations with ESC-specific transcription factors were weaker, suggesting that Tol2 prefers transcriptionally weak chromatin loops. Consistently, Tol2 insertions were associated with bivalent histone modifications characteristic of silent and inducible loci. SB showed minimum preference to all chromatin states, suggesting the least adverse effect on adjacent genes.

Mismatches between donor and patient in these alleles are associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, HLA-DRB3, 4 and 5, HLA-DQ and HLA-DP are usually assumed to be low expression loci with limited relevance, although mismatches in HLA-DQ and HLA-DP can result in alloimmune responses. Mismatches in HLA-DRB3, 4, and 5 are usually not taken into account in donor selection. METHODS: Conversion of chimerism in the presence of GVHD after CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion was observed in a patient, HLA 10/10 matched, but mismatched for HLA-DRB3 and HLA-DPB1 compared with the donor. Alloreactive CD4 T cells were isolated from peripheral blood after CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion and recognition of donor-derived target cells transduced with the mismatched patient variant HLA-DRB3 and HLA-DPB1 molecule was tested. RESULTS: A dominant polyclonal CD4 T cell response against patient's mismatched HLA-DRB3 molecule was found in addition to an immune response against patient's mismatched HLA-DPB1 molecule. CD4 T cells specific for these HLA class II molecules recognized both hematopoietic target cells as well as GVHD target cells. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the assumption that mismatches in HLA-DRB3, 4, and 5 are not of immunogenic significance after HLA 10/10 matched allogeneic stem cell transplantation, we show that in this matched setting not only mismatches in HLA-DPB1, but also mismatches in HLA-DRB3 may induce a polyclonal allo-immune response associated with conversion of chimerism and severe GVHD.",,"['van Balen, Peter', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs, Simone A P', 'van de Meent, Marian', 'van Bergen, Cornelis A M', 'Halkes, Constantijn J M', 'Jedema, Inge', 'Falkenburg, J H Frederik']","['van Balen P', 'van Luxemburg-Heijs SAP', 'van de Meent M', 'van Bergen CAM', 'Halkes CJM', 'Jedema I', 'Falkenburg JHF']","['Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Alleles', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Chimerism', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-DP Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/immunology', 'HLA-DRB3 Chains/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2017/03/03 06:00,2017/12/27 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/TP.0000000000001713 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2017 Dec;101(12):2850-2854. doi: 10.1097/TP.0000000000001713.,,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DRB3 Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A high proviral load (PVL; more than four copies per 100 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) or 1.6 copies per 100 blood leukocytes) and being male are risk factors for ATL development. Whether anti-HTLV-1 antibody level is related to such risk is unknown. Here, PVL and antibody levels were examined using real-time PCR and other tests in 600 HTLV-1 positive screened Japanese blood donors to understand the relationship between PVL and antibody level in asymptomatic carriers and to gain insights toward better antibody testing for HTLV-1 infection. The 430 donors in whom proviral DNA was detected were considered as true positives for HTLV-1 infection. Among donors aged 40 years or older, more males than females had a PVL corresponding to more than 1.6% infected leukocytes, and an antibody titer below the median (P = 0.0018). In antibody tests using an HTLV-1 positive cell line or Env antigens there was a large discrepancy in antibody titer among 13 provirus-positive samples, probably suggesting that antibody-based screening tests should incorporate multiple HTLV-1 antigens, such as Gag and Env antigens.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Matsumoto, Chieko', 'Sagara, Yasuko', 'Sobata, Rieko', 'Inoue, Yukiko', 'Morita, Maiko', 'Uchida, Shigeharu', 'Kiyokawa, Hiroyuki', 'Satake, Masahiro', 'Tadokoro, Kenji']","['Matsumoto C', 'Sagara Y', 'Sobata R', 'Inoue Y', 'Morita M', 'Uchida S', 'Kiyokawa H', 'Satake M', 'Tadokoro K']","['Japanese Red Cross Society Blood Service Headquarters, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Blood Service Headquarters, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Blood Service Headquarters, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Kyushu Block Blood Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Blood Service Headquarters, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Japanese Red Cross Society Blood Service Headquarters, Tokyo, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4032-6465'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Virol,Journal of medical virology,7705876,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', '*Blood Donors', 'Carrier State/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification', '*Viral Load', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*Japanese blood donors', '*antibody titer', '*proviral DNA load']",2017/03/03 06:00,2018/02/01 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/01 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jmv.24802 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Virol. 2017 Aug;89(8):1469-1476. doi: 10.1002/jmv.24802.

However, the role of ANRIL in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore whether, and how, ANRIL affects the progression of RCC. First, the expression of ANRIL in clinical tumor tissues and four kinds of RCC cell lines was evaluated. After transfection, cell viability, colony number, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were assessed. The expression of proteins related to apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the beta-catenin signaling pathway was then assessed. In addition, the effect of IWR-endo (beta-catenin inhibitor) on cell viability, migration, and invasion, as well as beta-catenin expression, was also evaluated. The results showed that ANRIL was highly expressed in RCC tissues and RCC cell lines. ANRIL significantly promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT but inhibited cell apoptosis. Additionally, the expression levels of beta-catenin, Ki-67, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), phosphorylated GSK-3beta, T-cell transcription factor 4 (TCF-4), and leukemia enhancer factor 1 (LEF-1) were all markedly upregulated by ANRIL. The effect of ARNIL silencing was opposite to that of ANRIL overexpression. The effect of ARNIL on proliferation, migration, and invasion of RCC cells was found to be reversed by IWR-endo.

Herein, the molecular mechanisms by which quercetin exerts its anticancer effects against HL-60 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells were investigated. Results showed that quercetin suppressed cell proliferation in the HL-60 cell line in vitro and in vivo. Quercetin-induced G0 /G1 -phase arrest occurred when expressions of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2/4 were inhibited and the CDK inhibitors, p16 and p21, were induced. Moreover, quercetin treatment not only activated proapoptotic signaling like poly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 cleavage and caspase activation but also triggered autophagy events as shown by the increased expression of light chain 3 (LC3)-II, decreased expression of p62, and formation of acidic vesicular organelles. Interestingly, it was found that use of the autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, significantly enhanced quercetin-mediated apoptotic cell death as analyzed by MTS and DNA fragmentation assays. Moreover, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, dramatically reversed quercetin-mediated apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Although apoptosis and autophagy are two independent cell death pathways, our findings indicated that quercetin can activate caspases to trigger these two pathways, and both pathways played contrary roles in quercetin-mediated HL-60 cell death. In conclusion, besides promoting apoptosis, quercetin also induced cytoprotective autophagy in HL-60 cells, and inhibition of autophagy may be a novel strategy to enhance the anticancer activity of quercetin in AML.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Chang, Junn-Liang', 'Chow, Jyh-Ming', 'Chang, Jer-Hwa', 'Wen, Yu-Ching', 'Lin, Yung-Wei', 'Yang, Shun-Fa', 'Lee, Wei-Jiunn', 'Chien, Ming-Hsien']","['Chang JL', 'Chow JM', 'Chang JH', 'Wen YC', 'Lin YW', 'Yang SF', 'Lee WJ', 'Chien MH']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Taoyuan Armed Forces General Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Biomedical Engineering Department, Ming Chuan University, Taoyuan, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Pulmonary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'School of Respiratory Therapy, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Chung Shan Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Urology, School of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Toxicol,Environmental toxicology,100885357,IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Signal Transduction']",['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'cell cycle arrest', 'quercetin']",2017/03/03 06:00,2017/10/06 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/10/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2017/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/06 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/tox.22408 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Toxicol. 2017 Jul;32(7):1857-1868. doi: 10.1002/tox.22408.

As HTLV-1 is endemic in native ethnics in South America, and its infection leads to several chronic diseases as ATLL with poor prognosis, we aimed to present three ATLL cases and to review current literature. CASE REPORTS: Two cases were from the mountains of Peru, while one was from an endemic harbor of the country. An acute ATLL patient presented with multipapular infiltration of the skin and died 2 weeks after admission because of septic shock. The two chronic ATLL patients presented with erythematous plaques and erythroderma. They had swollen lymph nodes, lymphocytosis, and atypical lymphocytes on blood smear, with normal biochemical results. They both passed away a few months after diagnosis. COMMENTS: ATLL is developed after years of HTLV-1 carrier status; therefore, physicians should know the principal clinical and laboratory findings in order to make prompt diagnosis. Prognosis is still poor in aggressive and indolent variants, with survival rates from months to a few years.

Indeed, it has been observed that this type of cells is unable to divide, survive and develop new tumors when BRG1 is down-regulated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed BRG1 and miR-155 expression in 23 leukemia cell lines, and two no pathological lymphocyte samples using qPCR. MiR-155 transfection and western blot were used to analyze the relationship between miR-155 and its validated target, BRG1, by measuring protein expression levels. The effect of miR-155 on cell proliferation and prednisolone sensitivity were studied with resazurin assay. RESULTS: BRG1 expression levels could correlate negatively with miR-155 expression levels, at least in Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines. To clarify the role of miR-155 in the regulation of BRG1 expression, we administrated miR-155 mimics in different leukemia/lymphoma cell lines. Our results suggest that miR-155 regulate negatively and significantly the BRG1 expression at least in the MOLT4 cell line. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed a previously unknown miR-155 heterogeneity that could result in differences in the treatment with miRNAs in our attempt to inhibit BRG1. However, the expression levels of BRG1 and miR-155, before prednisolone treatment were not statistically significantly associated prednisolone sensitive leukemia cells.",,"['Cuadros, M', 'Sanchez-Martin, V', 'Herrera, A', 'Balinas, C', 'Martin-Padron, J', 'Boyero, L', 'Peinado, P', 'Medina, P P']","['Cuadros M', 'Sanchez-Martin V', 'Herrera A', 'Balinas C', 'Martin-Padron J', 'Boyero L', 'Peinado P', 'Medina PP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology III and Immunology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology III and Immunology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology III and Immunology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology III and Immunology, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.', 'GENYO, Centre for Genomics and Oncological Research, Granada, Spain. pedromedina@ugr.es.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology I, University of Granada, Granada, Spain. pedromedina@ugr.es.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1501-6681'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Helicases/genetics/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['BRG1', 'Leukemia', 'Prednisolone', 'miR-155']",2017/03/03 06:00,2018/04/27 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12094-017-1633-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12094-017-1633-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2017 Aug;19(8):1010-1017. doi: 10.1007/s12094-017-1633-2.

METHODS: Across-sectional questionnaire was distributed to adults with chronic phase CML and answered anonymously. SF-36 Health Survey was used to measure HRQoL. Our focus was on the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) components. RESULTS: Data from 819 respondents receiving TKI-therapy >/=3 months and achieving a complete cytogenetic response were analyzed. Median age was 42 years (range 18-88 years). 652 (80%) were receiving imatinib. Median TKI-therapy duration was 36 months (range 3-178 months). 629 (77%) paid some or all of their TKI costs. In multivariate analyses, female sex, increasing age, lower education level, increasing co-morbidities, concomitant medication, >/=3 symptoms, moderate or severe symptom, switch from imatinib to a second-generation TKI, and higher annual out-of-pocket expense of TKI were significantly associated with lower PCS and/or MCS. However, TKI-therapy duration 3-7 years was significantly associated with better well-being. Higher PCS or MCS score was significantly associated with higher satisfaction level with TKI-therapy and less impact of TKI-therapy on subject's daily life and work. In addition, adverse impact on daily life and work was significantly associated with more interests in TKI-therapy-related issues.

Nanoformulation of this drug could potentially increase its bioavailability to specific target cells. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to formulate TQ into polymer micelle, Pluronic F127 (5.0 wt %) and Pluronic F68 (0.1 wt %), as a drug carrier to enhance its solubility and instability in aqueous media. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Polymeric micelles encapsulated TQ were prepared by the microwave-assisted solvent evaporation technique. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer were utilized for qualitative confirmation of micelles encapsulation. The surface morphology and mean particle size of the prepared micelles were determined by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cytotoxicity effect was studied using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. RESULTS: Dynamic laser light scattering (DLS) technique showed hydrodynamic size distribution of optimized micelles of 50 nm, which was in close agreement with the mean particle size obtained from TEM of about 51 nm. Drug release study showed the maximum percentage of TQ release at 61% after 72 h, while the entrapment efficiency of TQ obtained was 46% using PF127. The cytotoxic effect of PF127-encapsulated TQ was considerably higher compared to PF68-encapsulated TQ against MCF7 cells, as they exhibited IC50value of 8 muM and 18 muM, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study suggests higher molecular weight Pluronic polymer micelles (F127) with hydrophilic-hydrophobic segments which could be used as a suitable candidate for sustainable delivery of TQ. However, comprehensive studies should be carried out to establish the suitability of Pluronic F127 as a carrier for other drugs with similar challenges as TQ. SUMMARY: There is a rising interest in integrating nanotechnology with medicine, creating a nanomedicine aiming for high efficiency and efficacy of disease diagnosis and treatment. In drug delivery, the term nanomedicine describes the nanometer-sized range (1-1000 nm) of a multi-component drug for disease treatments. As such, liposome-based nanoparticulate delivery vehicles have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical applications. The main purpose of introducing nanoscale drug delivery is to improve the pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profiles of therapeutic molecules. Drug or therapeutic molecules can be either released through the cleavage of a covalent linkage between drug molecules and polymers (conjugation) or through the diffusion from a drug and polymer blended matrix (physical encapsulation). Polymers play an important role in the design of nanocarriers for therapeutic deliveries. In Asia, Nigella sativa seed oil has been used traditionally for its various medicinal benefits. One of its most potent compound which is thymoquinone has been intensively investigated for its anti-cancer effects in colorectal carcinoma, breast adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, ovarian carcinoma, myeloblastic leukemia, and pancreatic carcinoma. In addition, it is reported to show anti-inflammatory potential, antidiabetic, antihistaminic effects, as well as the ability to alleviate respiratory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. This study aims to formulate and characterize different pluronic-based thymoquinone nanocarrier and investigate its effect against breast cancer cells Abbreviations Used: ATR-IR: Attenuated Total Reflectance-Infrared Spectroscopy, CH3CN: Acetonitrile, DLS: Dynamic Light Scattering, MTS: [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium, NPs: Nanoparticles, PF127/TQ: Pluronic F127 encapsulated TQ, PF68/TQ: Pluronic F68 encapsulated TQ, PLGA: Poly-(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), PVA: Poly-vinylalcohol, TQ: Thymoquinone, UV/VIS: Ultravioletvisible spectrophotometry.",,"['Shaarani, Salwa', 'Hamid, Shahrul Sahul', 'Mohd Kaus, Noor Haida']","['Shaarani S', 'Hamid SS', 'Mohd Kaus NH']","['Department of Physical Chemistry, School of Chemical Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 13200 Bertam, Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.', 'Oncological and Radiological Sciences Cluster, Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 13200 Bertam, Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.', 'Department of Physical Chemistry, School of Chemical Science, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 13200 Bertam, Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Pharmacognosy Res,Pharmacognosy research,101558769,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Cytotoxicity', 'MCF-7 cell line', 'pluronic F68', 'thymoquinone-nanoparticle']",2017/03/03 06:00,2017/03/03 06:01,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0974-8490.199774 [doi]', 'PR-9-12 [pii]']",ppublish,Pharmacognosy Res. 2017 Jan-Mar;9(1):12-20. doi: 10.4103/0974-8490.199774.,,,PMC5330097,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,

It seems likely that the MLV preintegration complex (PIC) interacts with cellular proteins to perform these tasks. We recently published that the microtubule motor cytoplasmic dynein complex and its regulator proteins interact with the MLV PIC at early times of infection, suggesting a functional interaction between the incoming viral particles, the dynein complex, and dynein regulators. To better understand the role of the dynein complex in MLV infection, we performed short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening of the dynein light chains on MLV infection. We found that silencing of a specific light chain of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, DYNLRB2, reduced the efficiency of infection by MLV reporter viruses without affecting HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, the overexpression of DYNLRB2 increased infection by MLV. We conclude that the DYNLRB2 light chain of the cytoplasmic dynein complex is an important and specific piece of the host machinery needed for MLV infection.IMPORTANCE Retroviruses must reach the chromatin of their host to integrate their viral DNA, but first they must get into the nucleus. The cytoplasm is a crowded environment in which simple diffusion is slow, and thus viruses utilize retrograde transport along the microtubule network, mediated by the dynein complex. Different viruses use different components of this multisubunit complex. We have found that murine leukemia virus (MLV) associates functionally and specifically with the dynein light chain DYNLRB2, which is required for infection. Our study provides more insight into the molecular requirements for retrograde transport of the MLV preintegration complex and demonstrates, for the first time, a role for DYNLRB2 in viral infection.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Opazo, Tatiana', 'Garces, Andrea', 'Tapia, Diego', 'Barraza, Felipe', 'Bravo, Angelica', 'Schwenke, Tomas', 'Cancino, Jorge', 'Arriagada, Gloria']","['Opazo T', 'Garces A', 'Tapia D', 'Barraza F', 'Bravo A', 'Schwenke T', 'Cancino J', 'Arriagada G']","['Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile.', 'Departamento de Ciencias Biologicas, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad Andres Bello, Vina del Mar, Chile gloria.arriagada@unab.cl.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/virology', 'Cytoplasmic Dyneins/*genetics/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/physiology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/virology', 'NIH 3T3 Cells']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DYNLRB2', '*MLV', '*dynein', '*dynein light chain']",2017/03/03 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2017/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00129-17 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00129-17 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Apr 28;91(10). pii: JVI.00129-17. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00129-17.

This antiviral function of ND10, however, is antagonized by viral effector proteins like IE1p72, which induces dispersal of ND10. Furthermore, we have shown that both major immediate early proteins of HCMV, IE1p72 and IE2p86, transiently colocalize with ND10 subnuclear structures and undergo modification by the covalent attachment of SUMO. Since recent reports indicate that PML acts as a SUMO E3 ligase, we asked whether the SUMOylation of IE1p72 and IE2p86 is regulated by PML. To address this, PML-depleted fibroblasts, as well as cells overexpressing individual PML isoforms, were infected with HCMV. Western blot experiments revealed a clear correlation between the degree of IE1p72 SUMO conjugation and the abundance of PML. On the other hand, the SUMOylation of IE2p86 was not affected by PML. By performing in vitro SUMOylation assays, we were able to provide direct evidence that IE1p72 is a substrate for PML-mediated SUMOylation. Interestingly, disruption of the RING finger domain of PML, which is proposed to confer SUMO E3 ligase activity, abolished PML-induced SUMOylation of IE1p72. In contrast, IE1p72 was still efficiently SUMO modified by a SUMOylation-defective PML mutant, indicating that intact ND10 bodies are not necessary for this effect. Thus, this is the first report that the E3 ligase PML is capable of stimulating the SUMOylation of a viral protein which is supposed to serve as a cellular mechanism to compromise specific functions of IE1p72.IMPORTANCE The major immediate early proteins of human cytomegalovirus, termed IE1p72 and IE2p86, have previously been shown to undergo posttranslational modification by covalent coupling to SUMO moieties at specific lysine residues. However, the enzymatic activities that are responsible for this modification have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that the PML protein, which mediates an intrinsic immune response against HCMV, specifically serves as an E3 ligase for SUMO modification of IE1p72. Since SUMO modification of IE1p72 has previously been shown to interfere with STAT factor binding, thus compromising the interferon-antagonistic function of this viral effector protein, our finding highlights an additional mechanism through which PML is able to restrict viral infections.",['Copyright (c) 2017 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Reuter, Nina', 'Schilling, Eva-Maria', 'Scherer, Myriam', 'Muller, Regina', 'Stamminger, Thomas']","['Reuter N', 'Schilling EM', 'Scherer M', 'Muller R', 'Stamminger T']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany thomas.stamminger@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Cytomegalovirus/enzymology/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/virology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', '*Sumoylation', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",['NOTNLM'],"['*human cytomegalovirus', '*immediate early protein IE1', '*nuclear domain 10', '*promyelocytic leukemia protein PML', '*sumoylation']",2017/03/03 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2016/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02335-16 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02335-16 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2017 Apr 28;91(10). pii: JVI.02335-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02335-16.

A large variability in serum concentrations has been observed after intravenous Erwinia asparaginase. Currently, Dutch Childhood Oncology Group protocols dose alterations are based on trough concentrations to ensure adequate asparaginase activity (>/=100 IU/L). The aim of this study was to describe the population pharmacokinetics of intravenous Erwinia asparaginase to quantify and gather insight into inter-individual and inter-occasion variability. The starting dose was evaluated on the basis of the derived population pharmacokinetic parameters. In a multicenter prospective observational study, a total of 714 blood samples were collected from 51 children (age 1-17 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The starting dose was 20,000 IU/m(2) three times a week and adjusted according to trough levels from week three onwards. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using NONMEM((R)) A 2-compartment linear model with allometric scaling best described the data. Inter-individual and inter-occasion variability of clearance were 33% and 13%, respectively. Clearance in the first month of treatment was 14% higher (P<0.01). Monte Carlo simulations with our pharmacokinetic model demonstrated that patients with a low weight might require higher doses to achieve similar concentrations compared to patients with high weight. The current starting dose of 20,000 IU/m(2) might result in inadequate concentrations, especially for smaller, lower weight patients, hence dose adjustments based on individual clearance are recommended.

CEBPA-double-mutated cases usually bear biallelic N- and C-terminal mutations and are associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Identification of CEBPA mutants is challenging because of the variety of mutations, intrinsic characteristics of the gene and technical issues. Several screening methods (fragment-length analysis, gene expression array) have been proposed especially for large-scale clinical use; although efficient, they are limited by specific concerns. We investigated the phenotypic profile of blast and maturing bone marrow cell compartments at diagnosis in 251 cases of acute myeloid leukemia. In this cohort, 16 (6.4%) patients had two CEBPA mutations, whereas ten (4.0%) had a single mutation. First, we highlighted that the CEBPA-double-mutated subset displays recurrent phenotypic abnormalities in all cell compartments. By mutational analysis after cell sorting, we demonstrated that this common phenotypic signature depends on CEBPA-double-mutated multi-lineage involvement. From a multidimensional study of phenotypic data, we developed a classifier including ten core and widely available parameters. The selected markers on blasts (CD34, CD117, CD7, CD15, CD65), neutrophil (SSC, CD64), monocytic (CD14, CD64) and erythroid (CD117) compartments were able to cluster CEBPA-double-mutated cases. In a validation set of 259 AML cases from three independent centers, our classifier showed excellent performance with 100% specificity and 100% sensitivity. We have, therefore, established a reliable screening method, based upon multidimensional analysis of widely available phenotypic parameters.

In this study, we applied morphoproteomics to a representative spectrum of cases of newly diagnosed B-cell ALL in order to identify pathways that are known to be associated with the maintenance of the undifferentiated state while promoting proliferation. Our results showed nuclear expression in a majority of the lymphoblasts from bone marrow clot preparations of each of the study cases for both silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+ histone deacetylase and enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase.

Data mining of the National Library of Medicine's MEDLINE Database and Ingenuity Pathway analysis revealed agents of relatively low toxicity-melatonin, metformin, curcumin and sulforaphane-that are capable of inhibiting directly or pharmacogenomically one or both of the SIRT1 and EZH2 pathways and should, in a combinatorial fashion, remove the block in differentiation and decrease the proliferation of the B-cell ALL lymphoblasts.","['(c) 2017 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Brown, Robert E', 'Konopka, Kristine E', 'Weerasinghe, Priya', 'Jaitly, Vanya', 'Dasgupta, Amitava', 'McGuire, Mary F', 'Nguyen, Nghia D']","['Brown RE', 'Konopka KE', 'Weerasinghe P', 'Jaitly V', 'Dasgupta A', 'McGuire MF', 'Nguyen ND']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UTHealth, McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA Robert.Brown@uth.tmc.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UTHealth, McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UTHealth, McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UTHealth, McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Biomedical Analytics, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UTHealth, McGovern Medical School, Houston, Texas, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sirtuin 1/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell ALL', 'EZH2', 'SIRT1', 'morphoproteomics']",2017/03/03 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2017/03/03 06:00'],"['2017/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']",['47/1/3 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2017 Jan;47(1):3-9.,,"['EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although PLB demonstrates anticancer activity in multiple types of malignant cells, the cellular targets of PLB have not been well defined and remained only partially understood. We reported here that PLB selectively inhibits TrxR and elicits reactive oxygen species in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells, which leads to elevation of GSSG/GSH ratio and decrease of cellular thiol pool. As a consequence, PLB disturbs the cellular redox homeostasis, induces oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis and eventually selectively kills HL-60 cells.

METHODS: We performed a mutational analysis to identify AML somatic mutations using the whole-exome sequencing data of 36 tumor-normal sample pairs from Korean patients with de novo AML. We explored the functional impact of the genes identified in the mutational analyses through an integrated Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analysis. RESULTS: A total of 11 genes, including NEFH (p = 6.27 x 10(-13) and q = 1.18 x 10(-8)) and TMPRSS13 (p = 1.40 x 10(-10) and q = 1.32 x 10(-6)), also demonstrated q values less than 0.1 in 36 Korean AML patients. Five out of the 11 novel genes have previously been reported to be associated with other cancers. Two gene mutations, CEBPA (p = 5.22 x 10(-5)) and ATXN3 (p = 9.75 x 10(-4)), showed statistical significance exclusively in the M2 and M3 subtypes of the French-American-British classifications, respectively. A total of 501 genes harbored 478 missense, 22 nonsense, 93 frameshift indels, and/or three stop codon deletions and these gene mutations significantly enriched GO terms for signal transduction (GO:0007165, p = 1.77 x 10(-3)), plasma membrane (GO:0005886, p = 3.07 x 10(-4)), and scaffold protein binding (GO:0097110, p = 8.65 x 10(-4)). The mitogen-activated protein kinase (hsa04010, 7.67 x 10(-4)) was the most enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Morphological AML subtypes may in part reflect subtype specific patterns of genomic alterations.

This translocation was shown to form a fusion gene between NUP98 at 11p15 and TOP1 at 20q12. Here, we describe a new case of de novo AML M2 with t(11;20) which was associated with another balanced translocation. An 81-year-old man was admitted to undergo salvage therapy for relapsed AML. G-banding and spectral karyotyping showed 46,XY,t(2;5)(q33;q31),t(11;20)(p15;q12)[20]. Expression of the NUP98/TOP1 fusion transcript was confirmed: NUP98 exon 13 was in-frame fused with TOP1 exon 8. The reciprocal TOP1/NUP98 fusion transcript was also detected: TOP1 exon 7 was fused with NUP98 exon 14. After achieving hematological complete remission, the karyotype converted to 46,XY,t(2;5)(q33;q31)[19]/46,sl,t(11;20)(p15;q12)[1]. FISH analysis demonstrated that the 5q31 breakpoint of t(2;5) was centromeric to EGR1. In all 10 cases described in the literature, the NUP98 exon 13/TOP1 exon 8 fusion transcript was expressed, indicating that it may be responsible for the pathogenesis of MDS/AML with t(11;20). On the other hand, the TOP1/NUP98 transcript was coexpressed in 4 cases of de novo AML, but not in 3 cases of therapy-related MDS.

We analyzed the therapeutic potential of S6K1 inhibitors in PTEN-deficient T cell leukemia and glioblastoma. Results revealed that the S6K1 inhibitor LY-2779964 was relatively ineffective as a single agent, while S6K1-targeting AD80 induced cytotoxicity selectively in PTEN-deficient cells. In vivo, AD80 rescued 50% of mice transplanted with PTEN-deficient leukemia cells. Cells surviving LY-2779964 treatment exhibited inhibitor-induced S6K1 phosphorylation due to increased mTOR-S6K1 co-association, which primed the rapid recovery of S6K1 signaling. In contrast, AD80 avoided S6K1 phosphorylation and mTOR co-association, resulting in durable suppression of S6K1-induced signaling and protein synthesis. Kinome analysis revealed that AD80 coordinately inhibits S6K1 together with the TAM family tyrosine kinase AXL. TAM suppression by BMS-777607 or genetic knockdown potentiated cytotoxic responses to LY-2779964 in PTEN-deficient glioblastoma cells.

METHODS: In this multi-institutional phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with heavily pretreated B-cell precursor ALL, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either blinatumomab or standard-of-care chemotherapy. The primary end point was overall survival. RESULTS: Of the 405 patients who were randomly assigned to receive blinatumomab (271 patients) or chemotherapy (134 patients), 376 patients received at least one dose. Overall survival was significantly longer in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group. The median overall survival was 7.7 months in the blinatumomab group and 4.0 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death with blinatumomab vs. chemotherapy, 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.93; P=0.01). Remission rates within 12 weeks after treatment initiation were significantly higher in the blinatumomab group than in the chemotherapy group, both with respect to complete remission with full hematologic recovery (34% vs. 16%, P<0.001) and with respect to complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery (44% vs. 25%, P<0.001). Treatment with blinatumomab resulted in a higher rate of event-free survival than that with chemotherapy (6-month estimates, 31% vs. 12%; hazard ratio for an event of relapse after achieving a complete remission with full, partial, or incomplete hematologic recovery, or death, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.71; P<0.001), as well as a longer median duration of remission (7.3 vs. 4.6 months). A total of 24% of the patients in each treatment group underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation.

Recently, genome-wide association studies have found 6p21.3, where the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is coded, to be a susceptibility risk region for CLL. Previous studies have produced discrepant results regarding the association between HLA and CLL development and outcome, but no studies have been performed on hiMBL. AIMS: We evaluated the role of HLA class I (-A, -B and -C) and class II (-DRB1 and -DQB1) in hiMBL/CLL susceptibility, hiMBL progression to CLL, and treatment requirement in a large series of 263 patients diagnosed in our center with hiMBL (n = 156) or Binet A CLL (n = 107). RESULTS: No consistent association between HLA specificities and hiMBL or CLL susceptibility was found. With a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 48/156 hiMBLs (33%) evolved to asymptomatic CLLs, while 16 hiMBLs (10%) and 44 CLLs (41%) required treatment. No HLA specificities were found to be significantly associated with hiMBL progression or treatment in the whole cohort. However, within antigen-experienced immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGHV)-mutated hiMBLs, which represents the highest proportion of hiMBL cases (81%), the presence of HLA-DQB1*03 showed a trend to a higher risk of progression to CLL (60% vs. 26%, P = 0.062). Moreover, HLA-DQB1*02 specificity was associated with a lesser requirement for 15-year treatment (10% vs. 36%, P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our results suggest a role for HLA in IGHV-mutated hiMBL prognosis, and are consistent with the growing evidence of the influence of 6p21 on predisposition to CLL. Larger non-biased series are required to enable definitive conclusions to be drawn.",,"['Garcia-Alvarez, Maria', 'Alcoceba, Miguel', 'Lopez-Parra, Miriam', 'Puig, Noemi', 'Anton, Alicia', 'Balanzategui, Ana', 'Prieto-Conde, Isabel', 'Jimenez, Cristina', 'Sarasquete, Maria E', 'Chillon, M Carmen', 'Gutierrez, Maria Laura', 'Corral, Rocio', 'Alonso, Jose Maria', 'Queizan, Jose Antonio', 'Vidan, Julia', 'Pardal, Emilia', 'Penarrubia, Maria Jesus', 'Bastida, Jose M', 'Garcia-Sanz, Ramon', 'Marin, Luis', 'Gonzalez, Marcos']","['Garcia-Alvarez M', 'Alcoceba M', 'Lopez-Parra M', 'Puig N', 'Anton A', 'Balanzategui A', 'Prieto-Conde I', 'Jimenez C', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Chillon MC', 'Gutierrez ML', 'Corral R', 'Alonso JM', 'Queizan JA', 'Vidan J', 'Pardal E', 'Penarrubia MJ', 'Bastida JM', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Marin L', 'Gonzalez M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Cytometry Service-NUCLEUS, Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Center (IBMCC-CSIC/USAL) and IBSAL (University of Salamanca), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Salamanca (HUS-IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain.', 'Cooperative Working Group on Lymphomas and Lymphoproliferative Disorders of the Castilla y Leon Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy (SCLHH), Castilla y Leon, Spain.', 'CIBERONC, Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis']",,,2017/03/02 06:00,2017/08/18 06:00,['2017/03/02 06:00'],"['2016/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0172978 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-36806 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2017 Mar 1;12(3):e0172978. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0172978. eCollection 2017.,,['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)'],PMC5332061,,20170301,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed numerous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive cells, which may raise concern for lymphoblastic lymphoma. Thus, we further characterized a group of pediatric kidneys with inflammation. TdT-positive nuclei were quantitated, and dual immunostains for TdT/CD79a, TdT/CD3, and TdT/CD43 were performed in a subset of cases; flow cytometry was performed in 1 case. TdT-positive nuclei were present in inflamed pediatric kidneys in 40 of 42 patients. TdT counts (average of 3 maximal high-power fields) ranged from 1 to >200, with a mean of 47. The presence and number of TdT-positive nuclei showed a strong association with younger patient age. Extramedullary hematopoiesis was identified in 11/42 patients, all under the age of 1. The presence of extramedullary hematopoiesis did not correlate with TdT count (P=0.158). Dual immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis in 1 case showed weak expression of B-cell markers and favored normal precursor B cells. Although TdT is a common marker of lymphoblastic lymphoma, we have demonstrated that TdT-positive cells may be part of the inflammatory milieu in infant kidneys.

Among the 207 cases of ESFT of the bone and soft tissue, diagnosed at Asan Medical Center during a 20-year period, 25 (12.1%) involved the head and neck region.

Primary sites included the cranial area (6 cases, 31.6%), sinonasal tract (6 cases, 31.6%), paraspinal space (4 cases, 21.0%), and other spaces (3 cases, 15.8%). The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates for all cases were 69.7% and 33.6%, respectively. A large tumor size (>5 cm) correlated significantly with overall survival (P=0.009), but not with disease-free survival (P=0.210). Microscopically, 8 cases (42.1%) showed nested growth pattern.

Several members of the E-twenty six (ETS) family of transcription factors are important regulators of the gene network governing endothelial homeostasis, and their aberrant expression is associated with pathological angiogenesis. The goal of this study was to determine whether deficiencies of the ETS family member, Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (FLI1), and its closest homolog, ETS-related gene (ERG), are associated with PAH. We found that endothelial ERG was significantly reduced in the lung samples from patients with PAH, as well as in chronically hypoxic mice. Functional studies revealed that depletion of ERG or FLI1 in human pulmonary ECs led to increased expression of inflammatory genes, including IFN genes, whereas genes regulating endothelial homeostasis and cell-cell adhesion were down-regulated. Simultaneous knockdown of both ERG and FLI1 had synergistic or additive effects on the expression of these genes, suggesting that ERG and FLI1 coregulate at least a subset of their target genes. Functionally, knockdown of ERG and FLI1 induced cell monolayer permeability with a potency similar to that of vascular endothelial growth factor. Notably, stimulation of ECs with Toll-like receptor 3 ligand poly(I:C) suppressed ERG expression and induced ERG dissociation from the IFNB1 promoter, while promoting signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) recruitment.

However, the risk assessment for developing ML after exposure to space radiation remains uncertain. To reduce the uncertainty in risk prediction for ML, a much increased understanding of space radiation-induced changes in the target cells, i.e., hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), is critically important. We used the label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (LFQMS) proteomic approach to determine the expression of protein in HSPC-derived myeloid colonies obtained at an early time-point (one week) and a late time-point (six months) after an acute whole body exposure of CBA/CaJ mice to a total dose of 0, 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5 Gy of heavy-ion titanium ((48)Ti ions), which are the important component of radiation found in the space environment. Mice exposed to 0 Gy of (48)Ti ions served as non-irradiated sham controls. There were five mice per treatment groups at each harvest time. The Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP) was used to assign a probability of a particular protein being in the sample. A proof-of-concept based Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) was used to characterize the functions, pathways, and networks of the identified proteins. Alterations of expression levels of proteins detected in samples collected at one week (wk) post-irradiation reflects acute effects of exposure to (48)Ti ions, while those detected in samples collected at six months (mos) post-irradiation represent protein expression profiles involved in the induction of late-occurring damage (normally referred to as genomic instability). Our results obtained by using the IPA analyses indicate a wide array of signaling pathways involved in response to 1 GeV/n (48)Ti ions at both harvest times. Our data also demonstrate that the patterns of protein expression profiles are dose and time dependent. The majority of proteins with altered expression levels are involved in cell cycle control, cellular growth and proliferation, cell death and survival, cell-to-cell signaling and interaction. The IPA analyses indicate several important processes involved in responses to exposure to (48)Ti ions. These include the proteosme/ubiquination, protein synthesis, post-translation modification, and lipid metabolism. The IPA analyses also indicate that exposure to 1 GeV/n (48)Ti ions affects the development and function of hematological system, immune cell trafficking, including the cytoskeleton. Further, the IPA analyses strongly demonstrate that the NF-kappaB and MAPKs (ERKs, JNKs, and p38MAPK) pathways play an essential role in signal transduction after exposure to 1 GeV/n (48)Ti ions. At an early time-point (1 week), the top networks identified by the IPA analyses are related to metabolic disease, lipid metabolism, small molecule biochemistry, and development disorder. In contrast, the top networks identified in samples collected at a late time-point (6 mos post-irradiation) by the IPA analyses are related to cancer, hematological disorders, and immunological diseases. In summary, the proteomic findings from our study provide a foundation to uncover compounds potentially be highly effective in radiation countermeasures.",,"['Rithidech, Kanokporn Noy', 'Tungjai, Montree', 'Jangiam, Witawat', 'Honikel, Louise', 'Gordon, Chris', 'Lai, Xianyin', 'Witzmann, Frank']","['Rithidech KN', 'Tungjai M', 'Jangiam W', 'Honikel L', 'Gordon C', 'Lai X', 'Witzmann F']","['Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. kanokporn.rithidech@stonybrookmedicine.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. mtungjai@gmail.com.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Center of Excellence for Molecular Imaging, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand. mtungjai@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. witawat.jangiam@stonybrookmedicine.edu.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering, Burapha University, Chonburi 20131, Thailand. witawat.jangiam@stonybrookmedicine.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. lmhonikel@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA. chris.gordon@stonybrookmedicine.edu.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Room 0044, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. xlai@iu.edu.', 'Department of Cellular & Integrative Physiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 635 Barnhill Drive, Room 362A, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. fwitzmann@iupui.edu.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Proteomes,Proteomes,101621966,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells', 'mice', 'proteomics', 'space radiation']",2015/07/21 00:00,2015/07/21 00:01,['2017/03/02 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2015/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/07/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 00:01 [medline]']","['proteomes3030132 [pii]', '10.3390/proteomes3030132 [doi]']",epublish,Proteomes. 2015 Jul 21;3(3):132-159. doi: 10.3390/proteomes3030132.,,,PMC5217378,,20150721,,,,,,,,,,,

MS-based studies require optimal and reproducible workflows that allow a satisfactory coverage of the proteome and its modifications. Preparation of samples for global MS analysis is a crucial step and it usually requires method testing, tuning and optimization. Different proteomic workflows that have been used to prepare AML patient samples for global MS analysis usually include a standard protein in-solution digestion procedure with a urea-based lysis buffer. The enrichment of phosphopeptides from AML patient samples has previously been carried out either with immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) or metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC). We have recently tested several methods of sample preparation for MS analysis of the AML proteome and phosphoproteome and introduced filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) as a superior methodology for the sensitive and reproducible generation of peptides from patient samples. FASP-prepared peptides can be further fractionated or IMAC-enriched for proteome or phosphoproteome analyses.

Chordoma patients have a long life expectancy with high mortality from the disease. Cancer stem cells, which are known to exist in chordomas, have extensive proliferative and self-renewal potential and are responsible for maintaining tumor heterogeneity along with chemotherapy and radiotherapy resistance. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) has multiple functions in stem cell biology, the immune response, and cancer, and is potentially a key molecule that allows cancer stem cells to self-renew. The purpose of this study was to determine whether LIF increases the aggressive traits of chordoma cells and leads to a poor prognosis in patients. Chordoma cell lines were treated with LIF, and functional tests were done. Twenty skull base chordoma samples were checked for levels of LIF and a correlation with clinicopathological features. The whole transcriptome microarray was used to observe changes in gene expression. We observed increased migration, invasion, tumorosphere formation, colony formation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and chemoresistance accompanied by a dramatic elevation in inflammatory gene networks and pathways in chordomas. The expression of LIF was associated with tumor size and a poorer overall survival. Microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assessments suggest that LIF can facilitate tumor-promoting inflammation.

Haploidentical HCT may induce more pronounced anti-leukemic effects and was evaluated at our center in 25 consecutive patients with disease relapse after preceding HCT receiving haploidentical grafts after in vitro T cell depletion. Overall survival at 1 and 2 years was 32 and 14%, respectively. Of note, patients with complete remission (CR) before haploidentical HCT had a very favorable overall survival of 41.7% at 2 years. Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality was 36 and 40% at 1 and 2 years, respectively. With a cumulative incidence for relapse of 36 and 45.6% at 1 and 2 years, disease-free survival (DFS) was 28 and 14.4%, respectively.

CYP2C19 mutations have been reported to cause variability in VCZ pharmacokinetics, and thus lead to undesirable effects of pharmacotherapy. We observed four Caucasian patients who underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, treated with voriconazole for prevention of fungal infections, to establish the impact of CYP2C19*2/*17 genotype on side effect occurrence. METHODS: Genetic testing for CYP2C19 allele*2 and*17 was performed using two PCR-RFLP methods established by Goldstein and Blaisdell, and Sim et al. All four patients presented CYP2C19*2/*17 genotype. RESULTS: The patients suffered from gastrointestinal, dermatological, neurological, hepatobiliary and renal adverse drug reactions (ADR). ADR could be best described by the use of VCZ. Other drugs potentially causing side effects were also taken into consideration. The presented complications were temporary and did not force dosage regimen adjustments or discontinuation of pharmacotherapy. After 2 months, the patients were discharged from hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Drug-drug interactions and ADR may occur even if an agent is used for prophylaxis only. We, therefore, should use any available tools for pharmacotherapy optimization-also genetic testing.",,"['Beata, Sienkiewicz', 'Donata, Urbaniak-Kujda', 'Jaroslaw, Dybko', 'Tomasz, Wrobel', 'Anna, Wiela-Hojenska']","['Beata S', 'Donata UK', 'Jaroslaw D', 'Tomasz W', 'Anna WH']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Wroclaw Medical University, 211a Borowska St., 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland. beata.sienkiewicz@gmail.com.', 'Department and Clinic of Haematology, Blood Neoplasms, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, 4 Wybrzeze Pasteura St., 50-367, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Haematology, Blood Neoplasms, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, 4 Wybrzeze Pasteura St., 50-367, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department and Clinic of Haematology, Blood Neoplasms, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Wroclaw Medical University, 4 Wybrzeze Pasteura St., 50-367, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Wroclaw Medical University, 211a Borowska St., 50-556, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1912-0873'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Cytochrome P-450 CYP2C19/*genetics', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genotype', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Transplantation Conditioning/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Voriconazole/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",['NOTNLM'],"['Adverse drug reactions', 'CYP2C19*2/*17', 'Genotype', 'Hematology', 'Voriconazole']",2017/03/02 06:00,2017/09/25 06:00,['2017/03/02 06:00'],"['2017/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00432-017-2357-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00432-017-2357-y [pii]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2017 Jun;143(6):1103-1106. doi: 10.1007/s00432-017-2357-y.

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate their prognostic value.Experimental Design: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Chinese databases were searched to identify studies exploring how IDH gene aberrations affected AML outcome. Pooled HRs and relative risks (RR) were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: Thirty-three reports were included. IDH mutations seemed not to affect overall survival (OS: HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.89-1.23) and event-free survival (EFS: HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.80-1.18) when considered as a single factor, but improved accumulative incidence of relapse (CIR: HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.18-1.76) in patients with intermediate-risk karyotypes (IR-AML). However, IDH1 mutation conferred worse OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31) and EFS (HR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.07-1.56), especially in patients with normal cytogenetics (OS: HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.01-1.46; EFS: HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.23-1.98). Prognosis of the IDH1 single-nucleotide polymorphism rs11554137 was also poor (OS: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.03-1.75). IDH2 mutation improved OS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.93), particularly in IR-AML patients (OS: HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.49-0.86). The IDH2 (R140) mutation was associated with better OS among younger cases (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.49-0.82). Treatment outcome was poor [RR for complete remission rates in IDH1 mutation: 1.21; 95% CI, 1.02-1.44; IDH2 (R172) mutation: 2.14; 95% CI, 1.61-2.85].Conclusions: Various subtypes of IDH mutations might contribute to different prognosis and be allowed to stratify IR-AML further.

This observation raises concern for potential myeloablation in patients with AML treated with CD123-redirected CAR T cells and mandates novel approaches for toxicity mitigation. We hypothesized that CAR T-cell depletion with optimal timing after AML eradication would preserve leukemia remission and allow subsequent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. To test this hypothesis, we compared 3 CAR T-cell termination strategies: (1) transiently active anti-CD123 messenger RNA-electroporated CART (RNA-CART123); (2) T-cell ablation with alemtuzumab after treatment with lentivirally transduced anti-CD123-4-1BB-CD3zeta T cells (CART123); and (3) T-cell ablation with rituximab after treatment with CD20-coexpressing CART123 (CART123-CD20). All approaches led to rapid leukemia elimination in murine xenograft models of human AML. Subsequent antibody-mediated depletion of CART123 or CART123-CD20 did not impair leukemia remission. Time-course studies demonstrated that durable leukemia remission required CAR T-cell persistence for 4 weeks prior to ablation. Upon CAR T-cell termination, we further demonstrated successful hematopoietic engraftment with a normal human donor to model allogeneic stem cell rescue. Results from these studies will facilitate development of T-cell depletion strategies to augment the feasibility of CAR T-cell therapy for patients with AML.",['(c) 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Tasian, Sarah K', 'Kenderian, Saad S', 'Shen, Feng', 'Ruella, Marco', 'Shestova, Olga', 'Kozlowski, Miroslaw', 'Li, Yong', 'Schrank-Hacker, April', 'Morrissette, Jennifer J D', 'Carroll, Martin', 'June, Carl H', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Gill, Saar']","['Tasian SK', 'Kenderian SS', 'Shen F', 'Ruella M', 'Shestova O', 'Kozlowski M', 'Li Y', 'Schrank-Hacker A', 'Morrissette JJD', 'Carroll M', 'June CH', 'Grupp SA', 'Gill S']","['Division of Oncology and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Translational Research Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.', 'Division of Oncology and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Translational Research Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Translational Research Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Translational Research Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Oncology and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Translational Research Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Oncology and.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Department of Pediatrics and.', 'Center for Cellular Immunotherapies, Translational Research Program, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Abramson Cancer Center, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1327-1662'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD20/genetics/immunology', 'CD3 Complex/genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/chemistry/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'Lentivirus/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/genetics/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,2017/03/02 06:00,2017/08/10 06:00,['2017/03/02 06:00'],"['2016/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/10 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)33440-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-08-736041 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2017 Apr 27;129(17):2395-2407. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-08-736041.

The mechanism of toxicity of toluene, a highly-prevalent and volatile organic compound, is largely unknown. To examine the role of miRNAs in toluene-induced toxicity, we investigated miRNAs and toluene-induced gene expression in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and exosomes using microarrays. A total of 54 miRNAs were differentially expressed in HL-60 cell lines exposed to toluene and exosomes from the cells. Four out of the 54 miRNAs (hsa-miR-1290, hsa-miR-718, hsa-miR-3663-3p, and hsa-miR-320c) were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR. Integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression profiles identified 8 miRNA-mRNA correlations. By performing Comparative Toxicogenomics Database analysis, we found that the eight putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs under toluene exposure (EXOSC6, RHOH, GFER, HERC2, GOLGA4, SLC7A11, GCLM, and BACH1) are related to diverse disease categories such as nervous system disease, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory tract disease.

However, the vast majority of data regarding microbiome stability are derived from healthy subjects. Herein, we sought to determine intra-patient temporal microbiota variability, the factors driving such variability, and its clinical impact in an extensive longitudinal cohort of hospitalized cancer patients during chemotherapy. METHODS: The stool (n = 365) and oral (n = 483) samples of 59 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) undergoing induction chemotherapy (IC) were sampled from initiation of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery. Microbiome characterization was performed via analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Temporal variability was determined using coefficients of variation (CV) of the Shannon diversity index (SDI) and unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances per patient, per site. Measurements of intra-patient temporal variability and patient stability categories were analyzed for their correlations with genera abundances. Groups of patients were analyzed to determine if patients with adverse outcomes had significantly different levels of microbiome temporal variability. Potential clinical drivers of microbiome temporal instability were determined using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Our cohort evidenced a high degree of intra-patient temporal instability of stool and oral microbial diversity based on SDI CV. We identified statistically significant differences in the relative abundance of multiple taxa amongst individuals with different levels of microbiota temporal stability. Increased intra-patient temporal variability of the oral SDI was correlated with increased risk of infection during IC (P = 0.02), and higher stool SDI CVs were correlated with increased risk of infection 90 days post-IC (P = 0.04). Total days on antibiotics was significantly associated with increased temporal variability of both oral microbial diversity (P = 0.03) and community structure (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: These data quantify the longitudinal variability of the oral and gut microbiota in AML patients, show that increased variability was correlated with adverse clinical outcomes, and offer the possibility of using stabilizing taxa as a method of focused microbiome repletion. Furthermore, these results support the importance of longitudinal microbiome sampling and analyses, rather than one time measurements, in research and future clinical practice.",,"['Galloway-Pena, Jessica R', 'Smith, Daniel P', 'Sahasrabhojane, Pranoti', 'Wadsworth, W Duncan', 'Fellman, Bryan M', 'Ajami, Nadim J', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Daver, Naval', 'Guindani, Michele', 'Petrosino, Joseph F', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Shelburne, Samuel A']","['Galloway-Pena JR', 'Smith DP', 'Sahasrabhojane P', 'Wadsworth WD', 'Fellman BM', 'Ajami NJ', 'Shpall EJ', 'Daver N', 'Guindani M', 'Petrosino JF', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Shelburne SA']","['Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Statistics, Rice University, Houston, TX, 77005, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'The Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Statistics, University of California, Irvine, CA, 92697, USA.', 'The Alkek Center for Metagenomics and Microbiome Research, Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. sshelburne@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. sshelburne@mdanderson.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Genome Med,Genome medicine,101475844,IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bacteria/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S', 'Saliva/microbiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Antibiotics', '*Chemotherapy', '*Leukemia', '*Microbiome', '*Temporal variability']",2017/03/02 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2017/03/02 06:00'],"['2016/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2017/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13073-017-0409-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s13073-017-0409-1 [pii]']",epublish,Genome Med. 2017 Feb 28;9(1):21. doi: 10.1186/s13073-017-0409-1.,"['L30 CA209245/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA096520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",PMC5331640,,20170228,,,,,,,,,,,

Contemporary techniques, using clinical and cytogenetic variables are incomplete for prognosis prediction. METHODS: To improve the classification of adult patients diagnosed with B-ALL into prognosis groups, two strategies were examined and combined: the expression of the ID1/ID3/IGJ gene signature by RT-PCR and the immunophenotypic profile of 19 markers proposed in the EuroFlow protocol by Flow Cytometry in bone marrow samples. RESULTS: Both techniques were correlated to stratify patients into prognostic groups. An inverse relationship between survival and expression of the three-genes signature was observed and an immunophenotypic profile associated with clinical outcome was identified. Markers CD10 and CD20 were correlated with simultaneous overexpression of ID1, ID3 and IGJ. Patients with simultaneous expression of the poor prognosis gene signature and overexpression of CD10 or CD20, had worse Event Free Survival and Overall Survival than patients who had either the poor prognosis gene expression signature or only CD20 or CD10 overexpressed.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review was to present the current status of knowledge on the possible role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in the development and progression of several human cancers. Moreover, we discuss briefly the formation and decomposition of oxygen and nitrogen species within cells and their physiological and damaging influences. Given that some antitumor treatments are based on the formation of ROS, we also summarize what is currently known about supplementing the diet with antioxidants. METHODS: We conducted literature searches to review the recent progress toward the potential role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and associated oxidative stress in carcinogenesis. RESULTS: The epidemiological and laboratory studies showed that excessive production of reactive oxygen/ nitrogen species may lead to consequent alteration in the intracellular homeostasis and cause damage to all important cellular components when the excess of oxidants is not balanced by antioxidant defence and/or DNA repair mechanisms. Chronic oxidative stress can drive carcinogenesis by altering expression of cancer-related genes causing mutation and transformation. CONCLUSION: There is now common agreement that reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are involved in the development and progression of several human cancers like breast, prostate, colorectal, gynecological, cervical, eye, skin, leukemia, gastric. Antioxidant supplements at low doses can promote health, while excess supplementation can be harmful and even carcinogenic.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.org.']","['Kruk, Joanna', 'Aboul-Enein, Hassan Y']","['Kruk J', 'Aboul-Enein HY']","['Department of Prevention and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Physical Culture and Health Promotion, University of Szczecin, Szczecin.

PF-0444913 (PF-913) is a novel inhibitor that selectively targets Smoothened (SMO), which regulates the Hh pathway. Treatment with PF-913 has shown promising results in an early phase study of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, a detailed mode of action for PF-913 and relevant biomarkers remain to be elucidated. In this study, we examined bone marrow samples derived from AML patients under PF-913 monotherapy. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that PF-913 treatment affected the self-renewal signature and cell-cycle regulation associated with LSC-like properties. We then focused on the expression of a pluripotency factor, NANOG, because previous reports showed that a downstream effector in the Hh pathway, GLI, directly binds to the NANOG promoter and that the GLI-NANOG axis promotes stemness and growth in several cancers. In this study, we found that a change in NANOG transcripts was closely associated with GLI-target genes and NANOG transcripts can be a responsive biomarker during PF-913 therapy.

METHODS: A total of 11 patients with AML (5 low and 6 intermediate risk patients) treated with auto-PBHSCT with IBu precondition regimen (IDA 20 mg/m(2), continuous i.v. from d-13 to d-11, Bu 0.8 mg/kg/q6h i.v. for 2h, from d-5 to d-2) from March 2011 to July 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. Adverse effects and transplantation-related mortality (TRM) were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to calculate the overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and cumulative relapse rate (RR). Cox regression was performed for univariate analysis for DFS. RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, 10 patients obtained hematopoietic reconstitution, 1 patient died during transplantation, thus the TRM was 9.1%. The adverse effects were well tolerated. With median follow-up of 31.6 (8.7-52.5) months, 7 patients (63.3%) were alive, including 6 patients (54.5%) in continuous complete remission (CR). Median OS and DFS were not reached. The 3-year OS, DFS and RR were (57.7+/-16.3)%, (52.5+/-17.6)% and 47.5%, respectively. Univartiate analysis indicated that the age, sex, interval between diagnosis and transplantation, white blood cell count at diagnosis, risk-grouping (low or intermediate risk), disease status before transplantation (CR1 or CR2), and count of mononuclear cells for infusion all can not influence DFS(P>0.05, respectively).

METHODS: HL-60 cells at logarithmic growth phase exposed to TRAM-34 at the final concentration of 25, 50, 75 and 100 nmol/L were used as experimental group. The HL-60 cells of control group was cultured in 10% fetal bovine serum-RPMI 1640. The proliferation inhibition rate of TRAM-34 on HL-60 cells was detected by adding MTT solution after 24, 48 and 72 h culture. The cell apoptotic rate and cell cycle distribution of HL-60 cells treated with TRAM-34 were evaluated by flow cytometry with Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide(PI) double staining or PI single staining. The number of transmembrane cells was detected by Transwell at 24 and 48 h after treatment with TRAM-34. The effect of TRAM-34 on CDK6, P53 and MMP-2 mRNA level was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Compared with the control group (0 nmol/L), the inhibition rate, apoptosis rate, G0/G1 phase cell proportion and P53 mRNA level all increased, but the percentages of cells in S phase, cell number penetrating the membrane and mRNA levels of CDK6 and MMP-2 in the TRAM-34-treated group decreased (P<0.05) except for 24 h proliferation rate of TRAM-34 at low concentration (25 nmol/L).

METHODS: human CML cell line K562 cells were cultured in vitro, and were treated with different concentrations of ATO; MTT was used to detect the cell proliferation; flow cytometry(FCM) was used to determine cell apoptosis, cell cycle and the expression of CD44; Transcriptional levels of beta-catenin and cyclin D1 were assayed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: 2 micromol/L ATO could inhibit the cell proliferation obviously in a time-and-dose-dependent manner. With drug concentration increasing and time prolonging, the expression rate of CD44 was declined gradrually. FCM with AnnexinV/PI double staining showed that K562 cells were induced to apoptosis after exposure to 2.5-10 micromol/L ATO for 48 hours and in dose-dependent manner. Treating with different concentration ATO for 48 hours, cell ratio of G0/G1 phase increased and cell ratio in S phase decreased gradually. RT-PCR showed that the expression of beta-catenin and CyclinD1 decreased with increasing of drug concentration.

METHODS: RS4;11 and Sup-B15 cells were treated with PCI-32765 and Dasatinib, the cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected by CCK-8, the Btk and other apoptotic proteins were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: PCI-32765 could inhibit the proliferation of RS4;11 and Sup-B15 cells in a dose-dependent manner, Sup-B15 cells were more sensitive to PCI-32765 than RS4;11 cells, their IC50 were 3 micromol/L and 8 micromol/L respectively, the difference between them was statistically significant (P<0.05). Dasatinib also could inhibit the proliferation of RS4;11 cells and Sup-B15 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The IC50 was 5 micromol/L and 5 nmol/L, respectively, the difference between them was statistically very significant (P<0.01), and the inhibitory effect was enhanced by the combination of Damatinib with the PCI-32765(P<0.05). The cell survival rate decreased gradually in PCI-32765 or Dasatinib alone group and the combination group at the different time-point (8, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h), the 2 drugs showed a synergistic effect on cells in a time-dependent manner. After being treated with PCI-32765 and Dasatinib, the RS4;11 and Sup-B15 cells showed that cell shrinkage, increase of cytoplasmic density, nuclear pyknosis, deviation and karyorrhexis, and increase of the apoptotic cells in the combination group, while the promotive effect of low dosage dasatinib on apoptosis of RS4;11 cells was not strong.

METHODS: Eighty-eight children diagnosed with ALL were included in the study. miR-210 was quantitatively detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RQ-PCR) in 88 ALL patients. The average Ct value of samples obtained from 5 pediatric ALL patients with long-term complete continuous remission (CCR>5 years) was used as a calibrator. The expression levels of miR-210 in newly diagnosed patients was calculated by the 2(-DeltaDeltaCt) method and presented as multiple changes compared with that of the 5 CCR patients. RESULTS: The expression of miR-210 in the favorable prognosis group was significantly higher than that in the unfavorable prognosis group (10.64+/-1.5 vs 3.27+/-0.68)(P<0.05). Compared with the miR-210 high-expression group, poorer relapse-free survival(RFS), event-free survival(EFS) and overall survival(OS) (P all <0.001) were found in the low-expression group. Based on the expression of miR-210 and MRD, the 88 cases were divided into 3 groups. The relapse rate of miR-210-MRD high-risk group (70%) was significantly higher than that of the miR-210-MRD middle-risk group(6.25%) and miR-210-MRD low-risk group (2.1%). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the miR-210-MRD high-risk group had poorer RFS, EFS and OS than those in other 2 groups (P all <0.01). CONCLUSION: The expression level of miR-210 is an independent prognostic factor for pediatric ALL, and the miR-210 is a good useful indicator for predicting the relapse and induction failure of childhood ALL. Joint detection of miR-210 and MRD can help predict outcomes more precisely, thus may be used as an effective mean of determining prognosis, monitoring recurrence, and guiding treatment.",,"['Mei, Yan-Yan', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Zhang, Yi', 'Zhang, Wei-Ling', 'Zhang, Pin-Wei', 'Wang, Nan', 'Huang, Dong-Sheng']","['Mei YY', 'Li ZG', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang WL', 'Zhang PW', 'Wang N', 'Huang DS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.', ""Hematologic of Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100045, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100730, China.

Moreover, the colocalization of BCR-ABL and c-CBL was further evaluated by using immunofluorescent(IF) assay in transfected HeLa cells. RESULTS: Co-IP demonstrated that the TyrKC domain of BCR-ABL was primarily involved in the interaction with c-CBL, while both the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL and the RF domain of c-CBL also participated in the interaction to a certain degree, which were consistent with the structure-based simulation. IF elucidated that the colocalization of BCR-ABL and c-CBL was almost entirely vanished when the deleted TyrKC domain of BCR-ABL was co-transfected with c-CBL, which were elegantly coincident with the results from Co-IP. CONCLUSION: The TyrKC domain of BCR-ABL is sufficient and necessary to mediate the interaction between BCR-ABL and c-CBL, the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL and the RF domain of c-CBL are also involved in the association between the two proteins. It suggests that the association of BCR-ABL and c-CBL can modulate the stability and degradation of BCR-ABL, thus illustrating the molecular mechanisms of the targeting therapy for CML by arsenic.",,"['Mao, Jian-Hua', 'Huang, Qiu-Hua', 'Liu, Ping', 'Luo, Cheng', 'Xi, Xiao-Dong']","['Mao JH', 'Huang QH', 'Liu P', 'Luo C', 'Xi XD']","['State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Drug Research, Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201203, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.

METHODS: Acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1a was labeled with red fluorescent dye-MitoRed, then the labeled cells were injected into the yolk sac of zebrafish embryos. Morphological observation, cell count and histopathological detection were used to analyse the infiltration and metastasis of KG-1a cells in zebrafish. RESULTS: KG1a cells could proliferate and gradually spread to the entire abdominal cavity of the zebrafish after KG-1a cells were injected into the yolk sac during 1-7, the results of cell counting in vitro also proved a significant proliferation of KG-1a cells in zebrafish, suggesting that the implanted leukemia stem cells could survive, proliferate and spread in zebrafish. Further study showed that the implanted cells could be transfered to the liver of zebrafish, these cells displayed the signature of KG-1a cells by hematoxylin-eosin(HE) staining.

METHODS: The relevant references of this relationship in English or Chinese were extensively searched through PubMed, Embase, China National Knowledge Internet(CNKI) and Wanfang Database up to August 2015 based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. GST polymorphism-specific odd ratios(OR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals(CI) were calculated with the STATA statistical package. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed, and funnel plots were constructed to test the publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 27 studies concerning the GST polymorphisms and the risk of ALL were evaluated, which included 3736 cases of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 5549 controls. Significant summary OR of ALL were obtained for GSTM1 (OR=1.41, 95% CI=1.21-1.65) and GSTT1 (OR=1.26, 95% CI=1.05-1.50). Subgroup analysis showed that GSTM1 variant was associated with increased susceptibility to ALL in group of Blacks, Asians, PB (Population-based controls), HB (Hospital-based controls) '>/= 100 cases' and '< 100 cases'. Regarding GSTT1 polymorphism, significant relation with ALL risk was found in subgroup of Asians, PB and '>/= 100 cases'.

METHODS: Peripheral blood and bone marrow cytomorphologic and immunophenotypic examination, and T-cell receptor(TCR) gene rearrangement detection were used to verify the diagnosis for 2 patients with lymphocytosis. Two patients were treated with combined chemotherapeutic protocol based on fludarabine. RESULTS: At diagnosis of case 1, the main lymphocytes of peripheral blood smear were the small mature lymphocytes without nucleoli. The immunophenotype of the cells was CD3(+)CD5(+)CD7(+)CD4(+)CD8(+)TCRalpha/beta(+). The patient achieved complete remission after treatment with combined with CTX of fludarabine. The disease relapsed at 32 months after diagnosis. The abnormal lymphocytes were medium-sized ones with a visible nucleolus.

Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in rates of subsequent neoplasms over time were mediated by treatment variable modifications. Results: Among 23603 survivors of childhood cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and astrocytoma. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 years (374638 person-years at risk), 1639 survivors experienced 3115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1026 malignancies, 233 benign meningiomas, and 1856 nonmelanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Proportions of individuals receiving radiation decreased (77% for 1970s vs 33% for 1990s), as did median dose (30 Gy [interquartile range, 24-44] for 1970s vs 26 Gy [interquartile range, 18-45] for 1990s). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%] for 1970s, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.0%] for 1980s, 1.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%] for 1990s). Reference absolute rates per 1000 person-years were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.41) for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI, 0.88-3.33) for nonmelanoma skin cancers for survivors with reference characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy, or radiation therapy; male; attained age 28 years). Standardized incidence ratios declined for subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]; P < .001), meningiomas (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P = .03), and nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P < .001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Conclusions and Relevance: Among survivors of childhood cancer, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s. This lower risk was associated with reduction in therapeutic radiation dose.",,"['Turcotte, Lucie M', 'Liu, Qi', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Arnold, Michael A', 'Hammond, Sue', 'Howell, Rebecca M', 'Smith, Susan A', 'Weathers, Rita E', 'Henderson, Tara O', 'Gibson, Todd M', 'Leisenring, Wendy', 'Armstrong, Gregory T', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Neglia, Joseph P']","['Turcotte LM', 'Liu Q', 'Yasui Y', 'Arnold MA', 'Hammond S', 'Howell RM', 'Smith SA', 'Weathers RE', 'Henderson TO', 'Gibson TM', 'Leisenring W', 'Armstrong GT', 'Robison LL', 'Neglia JP']","['University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.', 'School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', ""School of Public Health, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada3Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Ohio State University, Columbus.', 'Ohio State University, Columbus.', 'Department of Radiation Physics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Radiation Physics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Radiation Physics, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",,,2017/03/01 06:00,2017/04/08 06:00,['2017/03/01 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['2605800 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.2017.0693 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2017 Feb 28;317(8):814-824. doi: 10.1001/jama.2017.0693.,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000114/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],PMC5473951,['NIHMS866301'],,,,,,['JAMA. 2017 Jun 20;317(23 ):2451.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) enables precise and sensitive detection of multiple Ag receptor rearrangements, thus providing a more specific readout compared to qPCR. We investigated two cohorts of children with ALL who underwent SCT (30 patients and 228 samples). The first cohort consisted of 17 patients who remained in long-term CR after SCT despite having low MRD positivity (<0.01%) at least once during post-SCT monitoring using qPCR. Only one of 27 qPCR-positive samples was confirmed to be positive by NGS. Conversely, 10 of 15 samples with low qPCR-detected MRD positivity from 13 patients who subsequently relapsed were also confirmed to be positive by NGS (P=0.002).

Although data suggest that durable remissions can be achieved in approximately 30% of patients with refractory or relapsed AML after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), only a small fraction of those patients are offered this therapeutic option. Importantly, patients with primary refractory AML have distinctly better outcomes following allogeneic HCT than those with refractory relapse. Access to suitable donors could be one of the main barriers in these situations. However, with recent developments in the field of allogeneic HCT, such as alternative donor sources, high-resolution HLA-typing, reduced intensity conditioning regimens and improvements in supportive care, this approach has the potential to offer long-term survival for patients with refractory and relapsed AML and should be considered as early after diagnosis as possible. Incorporating novel agents into the conditioning regimen or as post-transplant maintenance therapy could further improve outcomes and render older or medically infirm patients with refractory or relapsed AML eligible for allogeneic HCT.

This report presents the findings of independent research commissioned to inform this appraisal and the deliberations of a panel convened by NICE to evaluate the mock appraisal. METHODS: Our research included reviews to identify issues, analysis methods and conceptual differences and the relevance of alternative decision frameworks, alongside the development of an exemplar case study of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: An assessment of previous evaluations of regenerative medicines found that, although there were a number of evidential challenges, none was unique to regenerative medicines or was beyond the scope of existing methods used to conceptualise decision uncertainty. Regarding the clinical evidence for regenerative medicines, the issues were those associated with a limited evidence base but were not unique to regenerative medicines: small non-randomised studies, high variation in response and the intervention subject to continuing development. The relative treatment effects generated from single-arm trials are likely to be optimistic unless it is certain that the historical data have accurately estimated the efficacy of the control agent. Pivotal trials may use surrogate end points, which, on average, overestimate treatment effects. To reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta-analysis of all available data should be considered. Incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (more mature) data into the analysis can also be considered; such data may become available as a result of the evolving regulatory pathways being developed by the European Medicines Agency. For the exemplar case of CAR T-cell therapy, target product profiles (TPPs) were developed, which considered the 'curative' and 'bridging to stem-cell transplantation' treatment approaches separately. Within each TPP, three 'hypothetical' evidence sets (minimum, intermediate and mature) were generated to simulate the impact of alternative levels of precision and maturity in the clinical evidence. Subsequent assessments of cost-effectiveness were undertaken, employing the existing NICE reference case alongside additional analyses suggested within alternative frameworks. The additional exploratory analyses were undertaken to demonstrate how assessments of cost-effectiveness and uncertainty could be impacted by alternative managed entry agreements (MEAs), including price discounts, performance-related schemes and technology leasing. The panel deliberated on the range of TPPs, evidence sets and MEAs, commenting on the likely recommendations for each scenario. The panel discussed the challenges associated with the exemplar and regenerative medicines more broadly, focusing on the need for a robust quantification of the level of uncertainty in the cost-effective estimates and the potential value of MEAs in limiting the exposure of the NHS to high upfront costs and loss associated with a wrong decision. CONCLUSIONS: It is to be expected that there will be a significant level of uncertainty in determining the clinical effectiveness of regenerative medicines and their long-term costs and benefits, but the existing methods available to estimate the implications of this uncertainty are sufficient. The use of risk sharing and MEAs between the NHS and manufacturers of regenerative medicines should be investigated further.

PROCEDURE: Eligible patients were in remission and had developed allergy to Escherichia coli asparaginase. Erwina asparaginase was intramuscularly administrated on days 2, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. To measure the plasma l-asparagine concentration (PAC), amino acids were derivatized with N(alpha) -(5-fluoro-2,4-dinitrophenyl)-l-leucinamide. RESULTS: Six consecutive patients completed the phase I study with 25,000 IU/m(2) per dose without dose-limiting toxicity and 18 patients completed the phase II study with 25,000 IU/m(2) per dose. Median age of 24 patients was 7.5 (range 2-16) years. The half-life of plasma asparaginase activity (PAA) was 16.9 +/- 7.5 hr and the maximum PAA was 3.10 +/- 1.47 IU/ml (n = 23, noncompartment model). PAA of 0.1 IU/ml or more was achieved in all 23 patients (100%) 48 hr and in 18 of 23 patients (78.3%) 72 hr after the first administration. During the 2-week study, 94.2% (65 of 69) of the 48-hr samples and 80.4% (37 of 46) of the 72-hr samples had PAA of 0.1 IU/ml or more. PAC less than 1.0 muM was achieved in 95.7% patients 48 and 72 hr after administration. PAC values in all the samples were greater than the limit of quantitation (0.0625 muM).

We have discovered that the copy number gain of the mutant allele is an additional possible cause of blastic transformation in JMML.","['(c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Osumi, Tomoo', 'Kato, Motohiro', 'Ouchi-Uchiyama, Meri', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Fujii, Yoichi', 'Seki, Masafumi', 'Takita, Junko', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Uchiyama, Toru', 'Ohki, Kentaro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka']","['Osumi T', 'Kato M', 'Ouchi-Uchiyama M', 'Tomizawa D', 'Kataoka K', 'Fujii Y', 'Seki M', 'Takita J', 'Ogawa S', 'Uchiyama T', 'Ohki K', 'Kiyokawa N']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['CNG', 'JMML', 'KRAS', 'blast crisis', 'duplication']",2017/03/01 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2017/03/01 06:00'],"['2016/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2017/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2017/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.26496 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2017 Sep;64(9). doi: 10.1002/pbc.26496.

Here, we show that an RBP, QKI5, activates the processing of primary miR-124-1 (pri-124-1) during erythropoiesis. QKI5 recognizes a distal QKI response element and recruits Microprocessor through interaction with DGCR8. Furthermore, the recruited Microprocessor is brought to pri-124-1 stem loops by a spatial RNA-RNA interaction between two complementary sequences. Thus, mutations disrupting their base-pairing affect the strength of QKI5 activation. When erythropoiesis proceeds, the concomitant decrease of QKI5 releases Microprocessor from pri-124-1 and reduces mature miR-124 levels to facilitate erythrocyte maturation. Mechanistically, miR-124 targets TAL1 and c-MYB, two transcription factors involved in normal erythropoiesis. Importantly, this QKI5-mediated regulation also gives rise to a unique miRNA signature, which is required for erythroid differentiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the pivotal role of QKI5 in primary miRNA processing during erythropoiesis and provide new insights into how a distal element on primary transcripts affects miRNA biogenesis.",,"['Wang, Fang', 'Song, Wei', 'Zhao, Hongmei', 'Ma, Yanni', 'Li, Yuxia', 'Zhai, Di', 'Pi, Jingnan', 'Si, Yanmin', 'Xu, Jiayue', 'Dong, Lei', 'Su, Rui', 'Zhang, Mengmeng', 'Zhu,

Immunophenotyping is a routine practice for classification and lineage assignment of acute leukemia. In the present study, our aim is to identify the role of a single 5 color, CD45, myeloperoxidase (MPO), cCD79a, cCD3, and Tdt, cytoplasmic markers combination as a primary tube. We compared with final diagnosis on the basis of morphology, cytochemistry, and primary and secondary panels of immunophenotyping and also with other study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have included 455 new cases of acute leukemias with applied primary and secondary panels of markers for immunophenotyping. We analyzed sensitivity and specificity of different subsets with combination of positive and negative markers. RESULTS: MPO was positive in 61.4% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. All 184 (100%) cases of the AML were negative for cCD3 and cCD79a co-expression. cCD79a expression was highly sensitive as 98.5% B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) expressed it. cCD3 expression was detected in 100% cases of T-ALL, and its co-expression was not seen in B-ALL and AML. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that there was very good correlation of 5-color cytoplasmic tube-based diagnosis versus final diagnosis based on morphology, cytochemistry, and flow cytometry. We can use this 5-color cytoplasmic tube method to make immunophenotyping cost-effective.",,"['Parikh, B P', 'Patel, S P', 'Raiya, B N', 'Vora, H H', 'Jetly, D H']","['Parikh BP', 'Patel SP', 'Raiya BN', 'Vora HH', 'Jetly DH']","['Department of Pathology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology']",,,2017/03/01 06:00,2017/04/19 06:00,['2017/03/01 06:00'],"['2017/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2016_53_3_349_200659 [pii]', '10.4103/0019-509X.200659 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2016 Jul-Sep;53(3):349-352. doi: 10.4103/0019-509X.200659.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
