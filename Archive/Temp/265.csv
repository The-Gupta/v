Subsequently two children in advanced stages of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (cALL) were transplanted with their own cryopreserved marrow cells, after intensive combination chemotherapy and high doses of radiation therapy. Before grafting, the marrow cells were treated with purified heterologous antibodies prepared against cALL antigens, to remove any residual tumour cells. The antibodies showed high cytotoxic activity against leukaemic cells of cALL type without interfering with normal haemopoietic stem cells. Evidence of take was obtained in one patient, who died on day 7 with cardiac failure. In the other patient the dose of nucleated marrow cells grafted was 1.9 x 10(8)/kg (86 000 CFU-C/kg). The patient achieved complete haematological recovery on day 27 and a normal platelet count after day 50 and is now in complete remission. Marrow cells collected during remission and treated with antileukaemic antibodies can repopulate bone marrow after conditioning of the recipient with high doses of radiation.","['Netzel, B', 'Haas, R J', 'Rodt, H', 'Kolb, H J', 'Thierfelder, S']","['Netzel B', 'Haas RJ', 'Rodt H', 'Kolb HJ', 'Thierfelder S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/therapy', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1980/06/21 00:00,1980/06/21 00:01,['1980/06/21 00:00'],"['1980/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1980/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0140-6736(80)91787-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(80)91787-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1980 Jun 21;1(8182):1330-2. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(80)91787-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report, various inhibitors of AA metabolism were compared with regard to their effects on SRS formation and incorporation of radioactivity from [1-14C]-AA into known metabolites of the lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. An apparently close parallel between lipoxygenase product formation and SRS synthesis is demonstrated. In addition, exogenous 5-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) has been shown to markedly enhance SRS synthesis, even when A23187 is absent.

Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gas/liquid chromatography indicated that the C3d-binding glycoprotein consisted of a single polypeptide chain with extensive intrachain disulfide bonds, a molecular weight of 72,000, and several different bound carbohydrates. Several lines of evidence indicated that this medium-derived C3d-binding protein originated from membrane complement receptor type two (CR2, the C3d receptor), presumably shed during membrane turnover. The C3d-binding protein bound to sheep erythrocytes coated with C3d (EC3d) but not to sheep erythrocytes coated with C3b (EC3b). Antisera, prepared by immunization with the purified C3d-binding glycoprotein, inhibited lymphocyte rosette formation with EC3d but not with EC3b. Analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis of the radiolabeled and solubilized lymphocyte antigens reactive with the anti-C3d-binding protein sera revealed a single-chain cell-surface protein of molecular weight 72,000 that was apparently identical to the isolated C3d-binding protein. Parallel assay of lymphocytes for Cr2 by direct immunofluorescence with F(ab')2 anti-C3d-binding protein (anti-CR2) and rosette formation with EC3d indicated that both assays had the same specificity and nearly the same sensitivity.

We have observed that certain rodent cell lines, including some Balb/c/3T3 sublines, do not maintain stable transformation following infection. Within three to four weeks of infection of these cell lines a large fraction of the cells is not recoverable upon serial passage and appear to be killed. The residual population of cells displays a flat, nontransformed phenotype. Concomitant with this reversion is the loss of the integrated provirus and loss of expression of the Abelson virus transforming protein. This loss of the integrated provirus is specific to transformation-competent viral strains. The effect of Abelson virus on these cells appears to be, in part, due to a lethal effect of the transforming protein on the cells. We have selectively isolated mutants of Abelson virus that stably transform these rodent cell lines without expressing a lethal effect. Analysis of the nucleic acid and protein structure of these mutant virus strains showed that the transforming proteins are shorter, having lost expression of the carboxy-terminal one third of the protein. We suspect that the carboxy-terminal portion of the wild-type Abelson protein may modulate the in vivo expression of the protein kinase activity and that this may cause the transforming protein to have a deleterious effect on certain cell lines.","['Ziegler, S F', 'Whitlock, C A', 'Goff, S P', 'Gifford, A', 'Witte, O N']","['Ziegler SF', 'Whitlock CA', 'Goff SP', 'Gifford A', 'Witte ON']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/*genetics']",1981/12/01 00:00,1981/12/01 00:01,['1981/12/01 00:00'],"['1981/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1981/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1981/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(81)90389-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(81)90389-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1981 Dec;27(3 Pt 2):477-86. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(81)90389-5.,,,,"['Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles 90024.']",,,,,,,,

As summarized here, clinical and epidemiologic studies have documented the close association of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) to a particular form of T-cell malignancy, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). Yet to be understood is the process involved in translating virus infection into malignant lymphoproliferation. Epidemiologic data suggest that this may involve a relatively long latent period between primary HTLV-I infection and subsequent malignancy risk. Presumably, identifiable co-factors will emerge to explain the trigger for malignant transformation. However, the restricted pattern of tumor phenotype suggest that this process is tightly linked to cells for which HTLV-I has a particularly strong infectious trophism. Interdisciplinary studies are currently under way in a number of laboratories to elucidate the molecular interactions in the HTLV-I associated malignant transformation process in order to correlate these with the epidemiologic data. Thus, lessons are likely to be learned from these molecular and epidemiologic studies which may provide new and important etiologic insights applicable to the prevention and therapy of cancer. Furthermore, with the recent discovery of HTLV-III, a cytopathic form of this class of human retrovirus, the likely cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been discovered. This has enormous public health implications for the detection, treatment, and prevention of this major medical epidemic. Epidemiologic studies are currently under way to identify what factors associated with virus exposure result in the full-blown AIDS syndrome. In addition, the malignancy potential of this new type of retrovirus is currently the subject of intensive investigation.","['Blattner, W A', 'Clark, J W', 'Gibbs, W N', 'Williams, C K', 'Nomura, A', 'Mann, D', 'Saxinger, C', 'Robert-Guroff, M', 'Gallo, R C']","['Blattner WA', 'Clark JW', 'Gibbs WN', 'Williams CK', 'Nomura A', 'Mann D', 'Saxinger C', 'Robert-Guroff M', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Adult', 'Africa', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'HIV Antibodies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1984;15:93-108.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty-two % of 45 NHL patients diagnosed consecutively between 2/1/82 and 1/31/84 and studied prospectively were HTLV-I-antibody positive. Skin involvement (38%), hypercalcemia (44%), and leukemia (40%) were unusually prevalent and there was a strong association (p less than 0.05) with HTLV-I-antibody positivity. Fifty-two % of the patients had bone marrow infiltration, and 74% of these patients were HTLV-I-antibody positive (p = 0.06). Lymphadenopathy (96%), hepatomegaly (60%), and splenomegaly (25%) were detected with about the same frequency as in other series of NHL patients with advanced disease, and 61-88% of these patients were HTLV-I-antibody positive. Patients were classified into those with ""typical ATL"" (NHL associated with 2 of the 4 features i) hypercalcemia; ii) histologically proven skin infiltration; iii) leukemia; and iv) bone marrow infiltration, providing that the morphology of infiltrating or leukemic cells was characteristic of ATL; those ""consistent with ATL"" (NHL associated with 1 of these 4 features); and ""non-ATL"" (NHL without any of these 4 additional features). Thirty-two (71%) of the NHL patients were ATL patients, i.e., had features typical of or consistent with ATL, and 78% of these were HTLV-I-antibody positive. HTLV-I provirus was detected in tumour cells of all HTLV-I-antibody positive patients tested. Three (23%) of the non-ATL patients were HTLV-I-antibody positive. There was no correlation between histopathological features and the clinical classification or HTLV-I-antibody positivity. Median survival of ATL and non-ATL patients was 16 and 53 weeks. Although the disease was usually fulminant, 34% of the ATL patients had a subacute or chronic course. Skin involvement and leukemia were prominent in these patients. Hypercalcemia was the chief prognostic determinant. Median survival of hypercalcemic and normocalcemic ATL patients was 13 and 86 weeks (p less than 0.05). Hypercalcemia caused 10 deaths, infections 12, and death was due to tumour progression in 4 patients.

Total nucleotide sequence of the provirus genome was determined and the HTLV was distinguished from other retroviruses by a unique gene pX and also by its extremely long R sequence in the long terminal repeat (LTR). HTLV was demonstrated to be a causative agent of ATL by monoclonal integration of the proviruses in ATL cells. However, nonspecific provirus integration in ATL cells disproved the direct insertional activation of a specific cellular onc gene, eventually suggesting that a transacting viral function was involved in the leukemogenesis. A gene product of the unique gene pX and trans-activation of the transcription by the product was identified. This pX gene function might explain the leukemogenesis in ATL. The mass-production of the env gene products and their identified function provided information useful for developing the systems for diagnosis and prevention of HTLV infection and ATL.","['Yoshida, M', 'Kiyokawa, T', 'Watanabe, T', 'Hattori, S', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Seiki, M']","['Yoshida M', 'Kiyokawa T', 'Watanabe T', 'Hattori S', 'Fujisawa J', 'Seiki M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1984;15:39-47.,,,,,24,,,,,,,

It was isolated from the lymph node lymphocytes of a French homosexual patient with generalized hyperplasic lymphadenopathy. Subsequently LAV was isolated from patients with frank acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) coming from all the different high-risk groups, while anti-LAV antibodies were detected equally in individuals from all ""at-risk"" groups. Such a profile is consistent with the virus being the major etiological agent of AIDS. Furthermore its biological properties, namely its cytopathic effect in vitro, its T4-cell tropism as well as the role of the T4 molecule in virus infection explain, at least in part, the pathophysiology of AIDS. The major core (gag) proteins are p18, p25, and p13 which are products of a Pr55 precursor. The major envelope (env) glycoprotein is unusually large (gp110) for a retrovirus and comparable to those of the lentiviruses. Recently the virus has been molecularly cloned. The genome is 9.2 kb long, longer than any other known replication competent retrovirus apart from the lentiviruses.

We used indirect membrane immunofluorescence (IMI) to screen patient and control sera for antibodies to human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) specific cell membrane antigens (HTLV-MA) of HTLV-I and HTLV-III. Representative sera were screened for antibodies to specific HTLV-encoded proteins using radioimmunoprecipitation (RIP) with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Essentially all Japanese patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) from Miyazaki, Japan had detectable antibodies to HTLV-I-MA, further supporting the evidence for the probable etiologic relationship of HTLV-I and ATLL. While 16% of the healthy adults from this endemic region had antibodies to HTLV-I-MA, such antibodies were also found in 42% of the adults hospitalized in Miyazaki with severe infections diseases. Other studies have demonstrated HTLV-I antibodies in 12% of asymptomatic hemophiliacs examined from various U.S. cities. We have previously shown that HTLV-I status positive antibody in hemophiliacs is accompanied by a decrease in the number of T helper cells. Patients seropositive for antibodies to HTLV-I-MA regularly demonstrated antibodies to the env gene encoded gp61 proteins, while lower but significant proportions had antibodies to the gag and lor gene proteins. These and other observations suggest that infection with at least some strains of HTLV-I may be associated with mild or transient immunosuppression, in the absence of leukemia. Analysis by RIP indicated that gp61 and gp45, both encoded by the env gene of HTLV-I, are the most immunogenic proteins of the virus. The gp61 HTLV-I is highly crossreactive with gp67, the major env protein of HTLV-II. Patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) were also examined for antibodies to HTLV-I-MA and antibodies to the gag, env, and lor gene proteins by RIP. Antibodies were detected in 38-75% of the patients, the higher percentage reflecting the presence of at least one positive sample in those individuals where more than three serial serum samples were tested. Numerous control groups were essentially seronegative for antibodies to HTLV-I proteins. When AIDS patient sera were examined for antibodies to HTLV-III, 95-100% were seropositive.

Since then three types of human T-lymphotropic viruses (HTLVs) have been discovered and are under intensive study. Further types may well come to light. HTLV-I is etiologically associated with adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL), HTLV-II has been isolated from a patient with hairy T-cell leukemia, and HTLV-III is the cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Viruses related to HTLVs occur in several species of macaque monkeys. It appears that only a small minority of infected subjects develop the associated malignancy or immunodeficiency. Little is known of HTLV transmission, although it is clear that the viruses can be transmitted sexually and also iatrogenically through blood. HTLV-I and HTLV-II appear to be highly conserved across different human host populations, whereas HTLV-III shows greater polymorphism and elicits different immune responses. HTLVs have a tropism for T-helper/inducer cells. While HTLV-I and HTLV-II can penetrate many cell types and the T-cell tropism may reside in the activity of the X gene product following infection, initial infection of HTLV-III is restricted to cells bearing the T4 cell surface antigen. The T4 antigen is an essential component of the receptor for the virus, which is consistent with its tropism and the nature of the immunodeficiency it causes.","['Weiss, R A']",['Weiss RA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Virus/analysis', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1984;15:3-12.,,,,,20,,,,,,,

Analyses of these clones show that the HTLV-III genome is similar in size to those of HTLV-I and HTLV-II and contains a gene that functions as a transcriptional activator. Different isolates of HTLV-III display greater polymorphism than different isolates of HTLV-I among each other, possibly due to the highly replicative nature of HTLV-III.

These results suggest that expression of IL-2R may be induced by HTLV in HTLV-transformed cells, where the IL-2R plays an important role in transduction of continuous cell growth signal.","['Sugamura, K', 'Fujii, M', 'Sakitani, M', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Nakai, S', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Hinuma, Y']","['Sugamura K', 'Fujii M', 'Sakitani M', 'Kobayashi N', 'Nakai S', 'Hatanaka M', 'Hinuma Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Deltaretrovirus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'ErbB Receptors', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1984;15:269-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resting T cells do not express IL-2 receptors but receptors are rapidly expressed on T cells following the interaction of antigens, mitogens, or monoclonal antibodies with the antigen specific T-cell receptor complex. Using anti-Tac a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the IL-2 receptor, the receptor has been purified. The receptor is a 33 kdalton peptide that is post-translationally glycosylated to a 55 kdalton mature form. Mature receptors contain both N-linked and O-linked sugars and are both sulfated and phosphorylated. Using an oligonucleotide probe, based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, cDNAs encoding this receptor have been cloned, sequenced and expressed. The addition of anti-Tac to in vitro culture systems blocks the IL-2 induced DNA synthesis of IL-2 dependent T-cell lines and inhibits soluble auto- and alloantigen induced T-cell proliferation. Furthermore, it prevents the generation of cytotoxic and suppressor effector T cells. The anti-receptor antibody also inhibits lectin stimulated immunoglobulin synthesis and the sequential expression of late appearing activation antigens on T cells. Normal resting T cells and most leukemic T-cell populations do not express IL-2 receptors however the leukemic cells of all patients with human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV-I) associated, adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) examined expressed the Tac antigen. In HTLV-I infected cells the 42 kdalton long open reading frame (LOR) protein encoded in part, by the pX region of HTLV-I may act as a transacting transcriptional activator that induces transcription of the IL-2 receptor gene thus providing an explanation for the constant association of HTLV-I infection of lymphoid cells and IL-2 receptor expression. The constant display of large numbers of IL-2 receptors which may be aberrant in the ATL cells may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of these leukemic T cells. Patients with the Tac positive ATL are being treated with an anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed towards this growth factor receptor.","['Waldmann, T A', 'Leonard, W J', 'Depper, J M', 'Kronke, M', 'Goldman, C K', 'Oh, T', 'Greene, W C']","['Waldmann TA', 'Leonard WJ', 'Depper JM', 'Kronke M', 'Goldman CK', 'Oh T', 'Greene WC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/analysis', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1984;15:259-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since our previous report that leukemic cells from patients with ATL expressed Tac antigen (Ag) (interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor) on their cell surface, we have been studying IL-2 receptors on ATL leukemic cells to see whether they are different from normal IL-2 receptors and whether they play a role in the neoplastic growth of ATL cells. Peripheral blood leukemic cells from 35 patients with ATL expressed IL-2 receptors which were detected by anti-Tac monoclonal antibody when examined immediately after the separation of cells or after culture for 24 or 48 hr. The number of anti-Tac binding sites ranged from 4,300 to 11,400 in fresh cells and from 6,100 to 96,000/cell in short term cultured leukemic cells, whereas phytohemagglutinin-P(PHA-P)-stimulated normal T cells exhibited 7,000 to 35,000 anti-Tac binding sites/cell. HTLV-I-infected cell lines such as MT-1 and HUT-102 expressed a markedly enhanced number of Tac Ag molecules. Leukemic cells from 15 ATL patients showed no or very poor proliferative response to various concentrations of IL-2, although they expressed Tac Ag. Radiolabeled IL-2 binding experiments revealed that ATL leukemic cells could bind IL-2 although the number of IL-2 binding sites was much less than that of anti-Tac binding sites.

Monkeys of several species were found to have antibodies reactive with HTLV-I antigens and thus infection with HTLV-I like retroviruses was suspected. The retroviruses in several species of monkeys were characterized by Southern hybridization, molecular cloning and sequencing. These monkey retroviruses, tentatively called simian T-cell leukemia viruses (STLV), have a genome structure of LTR-gag-pol-env-pX-LTR and are highly homologous with HTLV-I in all regions. A DNA clone of the STLV was isolated from a pig-tailed monkey and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The STLV showed 90% homology in the nucleotide sequence with that of HTLV-I in env-pX-LTR region. This highly homologous sequence indicates that the STLV is a member of the HTLV family but apparently different from HTLV-I. This result excluded the possibility of recent interspecies viral transmission from monkeys to humans, and suggested that STLV can be useful as an animal model in studies on HTLV-I transmission and leukemogenesis in humans. Supporting this suggestion, an African green monkey which was naturally infected with STLV was found to have developed T-cell leukemia that was very similar to human ATL.","['Seiki, M', 'Watanabe, T', 'Komuro, A', 'Miyoshi, I', 'Hayami, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Seiki M', 'Watanabe T', 'Komuro A', 'Miyoshi I', 'Hayami M', 'Yoshida M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops/microbiology', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Haplorhini/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1984;15:241-9.,,,,,29,,,,,,,

Hinuma and his coworkers isolated independently a similar virus from a cell line derived from adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patient. The occurrence of ATL correlates with the formation of antibody to ATL associated antigens or ATLA. To understand the etiological relationship between ATL and HTLV, we analyzed the antigens termed ATLA and found that they are polypeptides encoded by HTLV genome. We further studied the genome of HTLV and its gene expression in cells as well as in a cell-free translation system. We focused on a defective type HTLV produced from a cell line MT-2 that transforms normal lymphocytes most efficiently. The 24S defective gene of HTLV consists of a fused gene of gag-pXs and is amplified at the proviral state. The in vitro translation experiments revealed that the 24S defective gene of HTLV directs the synthesis of p28 of ATLA. By the sequence analysis of the amplified gag-pXs fused genes, we found that a carboxy terminal portion of p28 is translated from a pX-0 region. We further investigated a function of the gag-pX-0 fusion protein, p28. The p28 has an associated protein kinase activity that requires manganese instead of magnesium and phosphorylates the serine residue specifically. Another defective HTLV with a genomic 32S RNA was analyzed. The 32S defective genomic RNA forms a subgenomic 20S RNA in cells. The 20S mRNA is a transcript of an env-pXs fused genome and directs the synthesis of a fused glycoprotein, gp68 of ATLA. The sequence analysis of a cloned cDNA derived from the subgenomic 20S mRNA revealed that a coding frame of the entire pX-IV region is translated. In fact, an antibody against synthetic polypeptides of the pX-IV, immunoprecipitated the gp68. These results demonstrate at the first time that the pX-0 and pX-IV of HTLV genome are expressed in human cells. The biological activities of the fused pXs proteins are also discussed.

Transfection studies with HTLV-II indicate that the virus can replicate in lymphoid cells, but not in fibroblasts. Transfection of recombinant constructs demonstrates that the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) can function as a promoter in lymphoid cells, but not in fibroblasts, suggesting a role for the viral LTR in conferring target cell specificity.

It is conceivable that these common regions have common biological function. Two previously unidentified proteins of BLV have also been purified and structurally characterized.

The human isolates adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV) or human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) are endemic among Japanese in the south-west of the country as well as Africans in both Africa and America. In these populations ATL and its lymphoma variant are also endemic and all these patients harbor the virus and have serum antibodies to viral env gene polypeptides gp68, gp46, p21 as well as core polypeptides p24, p19, and p15. ATLV and respective viral antibodies are very rare outside the endemic areas. Retroviruses structurally and serologically related have been found in various species of Old World monkeys especially in macaques. The human lymphadenopathy associated virus (LAV) later also known as HTLV-III most probably is the etiological agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in man and related syndromes. LAV/HTLV-III is highly endemic in certain parts of the population of America and Europe and apparently also in Africa. Human antisera react with viral envelope related gp120, gp100, gp46, and core related p24, p21, and p15 polypeptides.

For purine bases two different carrier proteins seem to exist. Purine bases are trapped intracellularly immediately after passage of the cell membrane by the action of purine phosphoribosyltransferases (PRTs). Comparison of kinetic data of transport and intracellular enzyme reactions shows that intracellular metabolism is rate limiting for the whole uptake process. Since phosphate stimulates the uptake of bases, limited availability of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) might play a regulatory role. Purine nucleosides apparently enter cells via a common carrier. Of the nucleosides under investigation, only adenosine was taken up in significant amounts. Uptake of adenosine is mainly determined by the ratio of adenosine deaminase (ADA) and adenosine kinase (AK) activities. For uptake of purine nucleotides sequential action of ecto-5'-nucleotidase (ecto-5'-NT), nucleoside carrier and intracellular metabolism is necessary. Cells without ecto-5'-NT activity did not accumulate radioactivity from nucleotides. Proliferating neoplastic cells (K 562 and HL 60 cells) showed enhanced uptake of purine bases and nucleosides, when compared to quiescent cells (erythrocytes and granulocytes). From initial rates of uptake and intracellular enzyme activities it could be concluded that this enhanced uptake was due to alterations of enzyme pattern in the neoplastic cells.","['Muller, M M', 'Kraupp, M', 'Chiba, P', 'Rumpold, H']","['Muller MM', 'Kraupp M', 'Chiba P', 'Rumpold H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Purines)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (purine phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.20 (Adenosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (Nucleotidases)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase"", 'Adenine/metabolism', 'Adenosine Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Nucleotidases/metabolism', 'Pentosyltransferases/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Purine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Purines/*metabolism']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(83)90017-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1983;21:239-56. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(83)90017-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,

New ecotropic proviral sequences were detected at three sites in the DNAs from eight Gross virus-accelerated thymomas following EcoRI restriction endonuclease digestion and at six sites following PvuII restriction endonuclease digestion.

Unexpectedly, we observed a high incidence of multiple integration of the provirus that also revealed a clonality and therefore occurred prior to the clonal origin of the ATL cells. Several ATL patients contained defective proviruses in fresh leukemic cells. These defective proviruses varied with respect to the deleted portions of the HTLV genome when a full genome of the HTLV provirus was present in the ATL tumor cells. In contrast, ATL cells harboring only a defective provirus invariably retained a common sequence of env-pX-LTR. This is consistent with a model that implies that the preserved env-pX-LTR region of HTLV must have played an important role(s) at a certain stage in ATL leukemogenesis after proviral integration.

On the other hand, lymphomas, leukaemias and immunodeficiencies, although of less immediate public health importance, constitute an area of outstanding interest for research and their association with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and the newly discovered human retroviruses merits world-wide attention. EBV-related malignancies in Africa include both Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Whether X-linked polyclonal lymphoproliferations exist in Africa remains an open question. The interrelationship between EBV, holoendemic malaria and genetic factors (oncogenes) has been deciphered in recent years, to make BL a kind of Rosetta stone for the understanding of multistage carcinogenesis. Although the role of EBV in the causation of NPC is not well understood, the viral capsid antigen (VCA) IgA test already allows both early detection of NPC in high-incidence areas and differential diagnosis in low-incidence areas. The question whether an EBV vaccine would be of value in African countries, in relation to EBV-associated malignancies, remains an open one. The diseases associated with the recently discovered human retroviruses (human T-lymphocyte leukaemia viruses: HTLVs) represent a new area for both research and public health assessment. Limited information is available today on the geographical distribution, age prevalence and association with disease in Africa of the different members of the retrovirus family (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, LAV/HTLV-3). The proportion of HTLV-related T-cell malignancies in different parts of Africa as well as the importance of immunodeficiencies caused by the different members of the retrovirus family remain to be determined. Typical acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) appears to exist in Central Africa, especially Zaire, and HTLVs could be of public health importance if they cause severe forms of viral, bacterial or parasitic diseases through impairment of cell-mediated immunity. Africa, is and will long remain a continent of crucial importance with regard to the role of viruses in human malignancies and especially in haematopoietic proliferative disorders.","['de-The, G']",['de-The G'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,,IM,"['Africa', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Deltaretrovirus', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*epidemiology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1984;(63):727-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sera from KS patients in Europe and America have higher anti-CMV antibodies than controls, in contrast to African patients, whose CMV antibody titres are not significantly different from those of controls.

The MMTV DNA sequences in AbMuLV B cell lines, based on restriction mapping with EcoRI, PstI, BglII, BamHI and SacI and molecular hybridization with cloned probes of the MMTV LTR, gag-pol or env gene regions, were identical to the germinally-transmitted MMTV DNA complement of BALB/c mice. Several AbMuLV B cell lines expressed MMTV poly(A+)-RNA at detectable levels. MMTV poly(A+)-RNA for the env gene, 3.8 kb, and the long terminally redundant (LTR) region, 1.7 kb, were detected in some AbMuLV B cell lines.

Analysis of RNA from cloned lines indicates that the 5' LTR promotes a high level of transcription which, as a result of differing RNA splicing and polyadenylation pathways, results in three large, abundant RNAs, two of which contain the entire tk coding region. The tk promoter itself initiates transcription of a smaller, relatively rare tk mRNA, of the same length and abundance as found in cells transformed with the tk gene alone. Assays indicate that there is little if any thymidine kinase (TK) enzymatic activity contributed by the abundant LTR-promoted transcripts. This is presumably due to inefficient initiation of tk translation from the longer LTR-initiated transcripts because of upstream AUG codons in the viral sequences. RNA blots indicate that the viral LTR is stronger as a promoter than the tk promoter. The results also indicate that about one-third of the LTR-initiated transcripts are polyadenylated at the tk poly(A) site, while the rest use the poly(A) site of the 3' LTR.","['Roach, A', 'Nicolson, M O', 'Davidson, N']","['Roach A', 'Nicolson MO', 'Davidson N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Viral', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Simplexvirus/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transformation, Genetic']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1119(84)90014-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(84)90014-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1984 Dec;32(3):389-98. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(84)90014-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

One end of this deletion occurred very close to the switch recombination point.

The size and nature of the c-myc mRNA precursors and processed transcripts depend on the position and orientation of the integrated proviruses.","['Selten, G', 'Cuypers, H T', 'Zijlstra, M', 'Melief, C', 'Berns, A']","['Selten G', 'Cuypers HT', 'Zijlstra M', 'Melief C', 'Berns A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Lysogeny', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Activation']",1984/12/20 00:00,1984/12/20 00:01,['1984/12/20 00:00'],"['1984/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1984 Dec 20;3(13):3215-22.,,PMC557840,,,,,,,,,,

The ev2- and ev3-negative semi-congenic chickens had much higher mortality from a unique non-neoplastic syndrome (NNS) than ev2- and ev3-positive semi-congenic chickens after inoculation with ALV strain RAV-1. The three other ALV strains induced little NNS. All four strains of ALV induced higher incidences of neutralizing antibody and lower incidences of viremia in ev2- and ev3-negative chickens than ev2- and ev3-positive chickens. The semi-congenic ev2- and ev3-negative chickens were only slightly less likely to shed ALV in the cloaca. Chickens of line 0, an unrelated line lacking ev genes, had a much higher rate of antibody production and lower rate of viremia and shedding than the semi-congenic chickens. Surprisingly, line 0 failed to get NNS after RAV-1 inoculation. There were major differences among strains of ALV in induction of antibody response, viremia, and shedding in the cloaca. The two field strains of ALV tended to be less immunogenic than the laboratory strains. We conclude that both the genetics of the host, including variation in ev gene expression, and the strain of ALV can influence the probability of ALV shedding and congenital transmission after horizontal infection.","['Crittenden, L B', 'Smith, E J', 'Fadly, A M']","['Crittenden LB', 'Smith EJ', 'Fadly AM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/*mortality', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Body Weight', 'Chickens/*genetics', 'Cloaca/microbiology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Female', '*Genes, Viral', 'Male', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Organ Size', 'Poultry Diseases/immunology/*mortality', 'Syndrome/veterinary']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Avian Dis. 1984 Oct-Dec;28(4):1037-56.,,,['CA29656/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The reactivity of each antibody with MT-2 cells was tested by the immunoperoxidase method at the light microscopic level. OKIal, anti-HLA-DR and -Leu-10 gave positive results.

These findings suggest that HLA-D region -associated antigens are common antigenic determinants shared by the surface of HTLV and the plasma membranes of MT-2 cells.

The influence of allogeneic BMT on the development of CMV pneumonia was investigated in comparison with that of autologous BMT. Data on 37 patients (23 allotransplants and 14 autotransplants) who survived for longer than one month were reviewed. All were conditioned for the transplant with marrow-lethal cytoreductive therapy. Interstitial pneumonia occurred in 15 allotransplant patients (65%) and in five autotransplant patients (36%), and was fatal in 10 allotransplant patients (67%) and in two autotransplant patients (40%), with no statistically significant difference between the two groups of patients. However, the high incidence of CMV pneumonia in allotransplant patients presented a striking contrast to that in autotransplant patients (13 of 23 versus one of 14, p less than 0.01). CMV pneumonia was closely associated with the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Moreover, the data inferred that both delayed posttransplant immunologic recovery and numerous transfusions of blood products from multiple random donors predispose allotransplant patients to CMV pneumonia. Though combination therapy with acyclovir, interferon-alpha (IFN) and prednisolone seemed to be somewhat effective further studies are needed to verify its benefit considering that all the patients (five allotransplants and one autotransplant) who survived CMV pneumonia showed a significant seroconversion to CMV. On the other hand, neither IFN nor nonspecific gamma-globulin proved to be effective in preventing CMV pneumonia. It is thus suggested that special attention be focused not only on the development of better methods to prevent GVHD and improve posttransplant immunologic recovery but also on reduced exposure to exogenous CMV.","['Funada, H', 'Harada, M', 'Yoshida, T', 'Hattori, K']","['Funada H', 'Harada M', 'Yoshida T', 'Hattori K']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Interferon Type I)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications', 'Granulocytes/transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1984 Dec;14 Suppl 1:519-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary tumors were acute lymphocytic leukemia in three, Wilms' tumor in two, and Hodgkin's disease, rhabdomyosarcoma, and ganglioneuroblastoma in one each. During this period, 174 long-term survivors with these five diagnoses were enrolled in our tumor registry, yielding a 4.6% incidence of secondary thyroid neoplasms. All eight patients received both radiation and chemotherapy. The mean radiation dose was 2,700 r with a calculated thyroid dose of 2,140 r (range, 5 to 4,200 r). Age of diagnosis of the primary tumors ranged from 1 to 8 2/12 years (mean, 5 years), and the latent period between treatment and development of the thyroid lesions averaged 6 1/2 years. Thyroid neoplasms presented at an average age of 11 4/12 years. Five patients developed solitary adenomas, one presented with multiple adenomas, and two had follicular carcinoma with regional lymph node metastases. Although thyroid neoplasms are rare in childhood, clinically apparent thyroid tumors have been observed in up to 2.5% of children following radiation exposure (mean follow-up, 24 years). The reported latent period before the development of thyroid neoplasms in irradiated patients is at least 10 years, with the peak incidence occurring 20 to 25 years after exposure. This study documents a 4.6% incidence of subsequent thyroid neoplasms in pediatric cancer patients within a relatively short follow-up period (mean, 11 years). These thyroid tumors occurred at an earlier age (mean, 11.5 years) and with a shorter latent period (mean, 6.5 years) than would be predicted from previous studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Vane, D', 'King, D R', 'Boles, E T Jr']","['Vane D', 'King DR', 'Boles ET Jr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/etiology', 'Adenoma/etiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Ganglioneuroma/therapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/therapy', 'Risk', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Wilms Tumor/therapy']",1984/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346884001391 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(84)80384-x [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1984 Dec;19(6):855-60. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(84)80384-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over 500 samples were tested and more than 30 substances with such activities were identified. Most, if not all, were plant diterpene esters derived from Euphorbiaceae and Thymelaeaceae families and a few were indole alkaloids of microbial origin. We attempted to link these laboratory findings with those of epidemiological field studies on three virus-associated diseases, Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which are known to have a peculiar geographical distribution. Our hypothesis was that EBV-activating/tumor-promoting substances might be present in the abundant areas where such diseases are endemic. We noticed that many active diterpene ester-containing plants are widely used as herbal medicaments in Africa and China and determined many plant species that had such activities. One example is Aleurites fordii, a plant commonly grown in Southern China for industrial purposes which yielded a potent promoter substance (12-O-hexadecanoyl-16-hydroxyphorbol-13-acetate, HHPA). The active diterpene esters were purified and their possible mechanism was studied from the view of receptor-binding, protein kinase C activation and transmembrane signaling.","['Ito, Y', 'Tokuda, H', 'Ohigashi, H', 'Koshimizu, K']","['Ito Y', 'Tokuda H', 'Ohigashi H', 'Koshimizu K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*analysis', 'Carrier Proteins', 'China', 'Diterpenes/analysis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Plants/analysis', 'Plants, Medicinal/analysis', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinases/analysis', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Virus Activation/*drug effects']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1983;14:125-37.,,,,,37,,,,,,,

To determine whether HTLV isolates with similar disease associations, but from different geographic locations, exhibit a conserved LTR structure, the nucleotide sequence of the LTR of an American HTLV isolate from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was obtained. Comparison of this LTR sequence to that of two Japanese HTLV isolates associated with a similar disease reveals a highly conserved organization of the U3, R, and U5 regions. The U. S. isolate differs from the Japanese viruses by only 15-16 bases out of 754 bases in the LTR region. These results show that Japanese HTLV isolates from patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma are members of the HTLV-I family and that LTRs of HTLV-I isolates are highly conserved. A 50-nucleotide imperfect direct repeat element is also identified in the U3 of the HTLV LTR distant from the cap site. The position and conserved nature of this sequence make it a likely candidate for a transcriptional enhancer.","['Josephs, S F', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Manzari, V', 'Gallo, R C', 'Sodroski, J G', 'Trus, M D', 'Perkins, D', 'Patarca, R', 'Haseltine, W A']","['Josephs SF', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Manzari V', 'Gallo RC', 'Sodroski JG', 'Trus MD', 'Perkins D', 'Patarca R', 'Haseltine WA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(84)90379-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1984 Dec;139(2):340-5. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(84)90379-9.,,,,,,['GENBANK/K02722'],,,,,,

The enhancers share the following properties. They stimulate transcription in an orientation-independent manner from the same startsites on the natural heterologous conalbumin (+62 to -102) or SV40 early promoter elements as well as on substitute promoter elements. The enhancers are most efficient when they are located directly upstream from the conalbumin (+62 to -102) promoter element, but they still stimulate transcription when they are either immediately downstream from the promoter element, or further upstream. Increasing the distance by interposing DNA sequences between the enhancers and the conalbumin promoter fragment results in decreased activation. Both enhancers show some cell-line specificity for activation of transcription. However, in all cell-lines and constructions tested the MLV enhancer was always less efficient than the SV40 enhancer.

Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) is epidemiologically associated with AIDS, especially in male homosexuals. A subset of T lymphocytes positive for the CD4 antigen (also termed T4 antigen), is depleted in AIDS and PGL patients. A retrovirus found in T-cell cultures from these patients is strongly implicated in the aetiology of AIDS because of the high frequency of isolation and the prevalence of specific antibodies in the patients. Here we have detected cell-surface receptors for the AIDS retrovirus (human T-cell leukaemia virus-III (HTLV-III) and lymphadenopathy-associated virus-1 (LAV-1) isolates) by testing the susceptibility of cells to infection with pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus bearing retroviral envelope antigens, and by the formation of multinucleated syncytia on mixing virus-producing cells with receptor-bearing cells. Receptors were present only on cells expressing CD4 antigen; among 155 monoclonal antibodies tested, each of the 14 anti-CD4 antibodies inhibited formation of syncytia and blocked pseudotypes. Productive infection of CD4+ cells with HTLV-III or LAV-1 markedly reduced cell-surface expression of CD4. In contrast, receptors for HTLV-I and HTLV-II were not restricted to CD4+ cells, were not blocked by anti-CD4 antibodies; cells productively infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II expressed surface CD4. Hence, we conclude that the CD4 antigen is an essential and specific component of the receptor for the causative agent of AIDS.","['Dalgleish, A G', 'Beverley, P C', 'Clapham, P R', 'Crawford, D H', 'Greaves, M F', 'Weiss, R A']","['Dalgleish AG', 'Beverley PC', 'Clapham PR', 'Crawford DH', 'Greaves MF', 'Weiss RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*microbiology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Deltaretrovirus/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/immunology']",1984/12/20 00:00,1984/12/20 00:01,['1984/12/20 00:00'],"['1984/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/312763a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Dec 20-1985 Jan 2;312(5996):763-7. doi: 10.1038/312763a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The virus is propagated on activated T lymphocytes and has a tropism for the T-cell subset OKT4 (ref. 6), in which it induces a cytopathic effect. The major core protein of LAV is antigenically unrelated to other known retroviral antigens. LAV-like viruses have more recently been independently isolated from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS. These viruses, called human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus type III (HTLV-III) and AIDS-associated retrovirus (ARV), seem to have many characteristics in common with LAV and probably represent independent isolates of the LAV prototype. We have sought to characterize LAV by the molecular cloning of its genome. A cloned LAV complementary DNA was used to screen a library of recombinant phages constructed from the genomic DNA of LAV-infected T lymphocytes.

We have now investigated this problem further by studying the rate of channel elimination at low temp, the osmotic fragility of the cells, and the effectiveness of the membrane-associated ion pumps. When complement channels were formed for 3 min at 37 degrees C, followed by prolonged incubation at 2 degrees C, the C6 lytic dose-response curves indicated that a single channel was required for lysis of a cell, whereas multiple channels were required when the entire process was carried out at 30 degrees C. The shift from multi- to one-hit lytic behavior can be explained by the drastic reduction in the rate of channel elimination at low temp. C6 lytic dose-response curves with puromycin-treated cells were also found to display one-hit behavior, but, in this case, the rate of channel elimination was reduced only about 35-40% (which would not suffice to explain the one-hit lytic characteristics). However, cell death was more extensive for puromycin-treated cells than normal cells after incubation in buffers of low ionic strength, suggesting that an increase in osmotic fragility may be a contributing factor in the shift from multi- to one-hit behavior. Blocking of the membrane-associated Na+/K+-ATPases with ouabain did not affect the multi-channel requirement. Presumably, this means that the ion pumping rate does not significantly influence the number of channels required for lysis.","['Ramm, L E', 'Whitlow, M B', 'Mayer, M M']","['Ramm LE', 'Whitlow MB', 'Mayer MM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Complement C6)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)']",IM,"['Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C6/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', '*Hemolysis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Osmotic Fragility/drug effects', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Puromycin/*pharmacology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Temperature']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(84)90110-x [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1984 Nov;21(11):1015-21. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(84)90110-x.,,,"['R01 AI02566-25/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI19622-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have examined the state of the HTLV provirus in the leukemic cells of ATL patients, primary cell lines established from these patients and normal seropositive people, and normal T-cells transformed in vitro. We found that, in all cases, the infected cells are monoclonal or oligoclonal. Furthermore, the populations of infected cells of fresh and long-term cultured cell lines from the same leukemic patient appear to be different. We propose that the latter represents normal T-cells transformed in vitro rather than the primary leukemic cells. It is of interest that the T-cells newly infected with HTLV have an in vitro growth advantage over the primary HTLV-containing tumor cells. The results also suggest that clonal selection of infected cells occurs in vitro, resulting in cells that are immortalized and exhibit some characteristics of the primary leukemic cells.

The cloned R-SFFV was compared to that of other viral components which are associated with RV-induced disease and also the cloned Friend SFFV (F-SFFV) and the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus (MPSV), both of which expand the erythroid (F-SFFV, MPSV) and myeloid (MPSV) compartment on infection of adult mice. The genome of R-SFFV differs, if analysed by restriction enzymes, from R-MuLV in the 3' end of the genome between the env gene and the long terminal repeat. The difference is most likely an alteration in the 3' part of the gp70-coding region of the env gene. Comparison with Rauscher mink cell focus-inducing virus (R-MCF) suggests that R-SFFV is derived from R-MCF by substitution of the 3' half of the env gene with a sequence of unknown origin. The molecularly cloned R-SFFV pseudotyped with Friend MuLV induces an increase in late erythroid precursor cells which still require erythropoietin for maturation. Host range studies of the molecularly cloned R-SFFV prove that the Fv-2r locus is required but not sufficient to restrict RV-induced haemopoiesis in adult mice, thus suggesting that R-SFFV has a different target cell range than F-SFFV and is similar to MPSV.","['Hess, N', 'Franz, T', 'Kollek, R', 'Ostertag, W']","['Hess N', 'Franz T', 'Kollek R', 'Ostertag W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Defective Viruses/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus/*genetics', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Transfection']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-65-12-2225 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1984 Dec;65 ( Pt 12):2225-35. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-65-12-2225.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this method, IL-2 was isolated by batch adsorption onto microparticulate silicic acid (SA) by stir-mixing the SA with SN (10 mg/ml; 30 min; 37 degrees C). Thereafter, the SA was pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The IL-2 was eluted by adding to the pelleted IL-2-binding SA 5 vols. of ethylene glycol (EG; 50%, v/v) in PBS (pH 7.2) with high salt (1.4 M NaCl). The lymphokine-rich concentrate was then dialyzed (6 kDa MWCO) against PBS to remove the EG and low molecular weight growth inhibitors. The application of the proposed procedure was further defined in experiments in which SA was successfully employed for recovering IL-2 from SN of cultures in which the medium had been supplemented with fetal calf (FCS) or human serum to achieve maximal lymphokine production. Also presented are the results of experiments defining the SA adsorption of proteins from whole sera (e.g., FCS, calf, human and horse) and the relative affinity of different purified proteins for this matrix (e.g., bovine serum albumin, human serum albumin, casein hydrolysate, bovine gamma-globulin and bovine beta-lactoglobulin). The proposed SA procedure may prove useful for isolating other hydrophobic immunoregulatory molecules, and a 2-step purification scheme is anticipated in which the SA adsorption procedure will be used as a preparative method preceding reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography.","['Pauly, J L', 'Ovak, G M', 'Russell, C W']","['Pauly JL', 'Ovak GM', 'Russell CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Ethylene Glycols)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '1343-98-2 (Silicic Acid)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Blood Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ethylene Glycols', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', '*Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', '*Silicic Acid', '*Silicon Dioxide', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1984/12/14 00:00,1984/12/14 00:01,['1984/12/14 00:00'],"['1984/12/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/14 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/14 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(84)90226-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(84)90226-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1984 Dec 14;75(1):73-84. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(84)90226-6.,,,['CA-29635/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Radioactivity labeled products were isolated by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fluorography. In vivo, myeloperoxidase was labeled initially as a 85-K glycosylated polypeptide (75 K after treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H). This polypeptide was soon processed to an 81-K intermediate and to smaller mature fragments of 60 K and 13 K within approximately 1 day. A minor portion of the precursor was converted to fragments of 40 K and 43 K. The pattern of labeled polypeptides of mature myeloperoxidase was similar to that of the enzyme purified from human leucocytes. The modifications of the polypeptide and of the oligosaccharide side chains in myeloperoxidase resembled those known to occur during the processing of lysosomal enzymes. In the absence or presence of dog pancreas membranes, myeloperoxidase was synthesized in vitro as a 76-K polypeptide or a 87-K glycosylated polypeptide, respectively. In HL-60 cells [32P]phosphate was incorporated into endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides. The presence of phosphorylated oligosaccharides was inferred from the fact that endocytosis of leucocyte myeloperoxidase in fibroblasts was sensitive to mannose 6-phosphate. It is suggested that myeloperoxidase is synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum as a precursor of larger molecular mass and that the oligosaccharide side chains in the precursor are modified to contain mannose 6-phosphate residues which may be involved in the segregation and transport of the precursor.","['Hasilik, A', 'Pohlmann, R', 'Olsen, R L', 'von Figura, K']","['Hasilik A', 'Pohlmann R', 'Olsen RL', 'von Figura K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Peroxidases/*genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rabbits', 'Reticulocytes/metabolism']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1984 Nov;3(11):2671-6.,,PMC557748,,,,,,,,,,

Upon superinfection with retroviruses carrying oncogenes of the src gene family, these myeloid cells acquire the ability to grow in the absence of exogenous cMGF. Conditioned medium prepared from superinfected E26 cells contains a growth-stimulating activity similar in biological and immunological properties to cMGF. This activity is reduced by more than 80% following absorption of conditioned media with antiserum against cMGF. Incubation of superinfected E26 cells with an immunoglobulin fraction of antiserum against cMGF inhibits their proliferation, indicating that the cells are dependent on the secreted factor. We conclude that viral oncogenes of the src family can induce chicken myeloid cells to produce a cMGF-like factor(s) that stimulates proliferation of these cells in an autocrine fashion.","['Adkins, B', 'Leutz, A', 'Graf, T']","['Adkins B', 'Leutz A', 'Graf T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Peptides)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chickens', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', '*Oncogenes', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Species Specificity', 'Transforming Growth Factors']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(84)90451-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(84)90451-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1984 Dec;39(3 Pt 2):439-45. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(84)90451-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

De novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, as measured by sodium [14C]bicarbonate incorporation into uracil nucleotides, was inhibited 40-85% at intracellular 3-deazauracil nucleotide concentrations of 1-6 nmoles/10(6) cells. The inhibition was not due to an increase in the size of the uracil nucleotide pool since this pool was only 97-66% of control level at 3-deazauracil nucleotide concentrations of 1-6 nmoles/10(6) cells. Furthermore, intracellular 3-deazauracil nucleotide concentrations of 0.5 to 5.2 nmoles/10(6) cells inhibited the salvage of [14C]uridine by 25-75%. The data indicate that 3-deazauridine may potentiate its own inhibition of CTP synthetase by reducing the concentration of competing uracil nucleotides by inhibiting de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis and pyrimidine salvage.

The identification of the radioactive polypeptides as different forms of myeloperoxidase was established also by the similarity in patterns generated by partial proteolysis with V8 proteinase from Staphylococcus aureus. Processing of myeloperoxidase in HL-60 was slow; mature polypeptides were significantly increased only after 6 h. Another myeloperoxidase chain of apparent Mr 82 000 was an intermediate precursor or degradation form. Pulse-chase experiments in combination with sucrose-density-gradient separations of homogenates showed that the Mr 90 000 precursor was located in light density organelles only and not in granule fractions, whereas the Mr 82 000 precursor was located only in intermediate density organelles, suggesting that the latter is a product of the former.

In an earlier study, we demonstrated that the major component of HTLV-MA is gp61, a glycoprotein encoded by the HTLV env gene. In the current study, we found that human antibodies that react with HTLV-MA on cells infected with HTLV-I react equally well with HTLV-MA on C3-44/MO, a target cell infected with type II HTLV. A glycoprotein with an approximate size of 67 kDa, gp67, was identified in C3-44/MO using immunoprecipitation and NaDodSO4/PAGE analysis. The positions of serine and cysteine residues were determined in the amino terminus of gp67 by radiolabel sequencing analysis. Comparison with the amino acid sequence deduced from the primary nucleotide sequence of HTLV-IIMO virus reveals that gp67 is also encoded, at least in part, by the env gene. The gp67 of HTLV-IIMO, like the env gene product of HTLV-ICR, gp61, is recognized both by antibodies from a HTLV-IIMO-infected patient with a variant form of hairy cell leukemia, and by antibodies from patients with HTLV-I-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

We have measured the binding of erythropoietin to these target cells; 62% of the binding was inhibited by excess unlabeled erythropoietin, but no inhibition occurred with albumin, serum, or a variety of growth factors and glycoproteins. Apparent equilibrium was reached by 2 hr at 37 degrees C and by 3.5-4 hr at 10 degrees C. The extent of specific binding increased linearly with cell concentration. In binding experiments at 10 degrees C, apparent saturation of specific binding occurred at approximately equal to 8.7 nM. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of binding sites. The dissociation constant is 5.2 nM with an average of 660 binding sites per cell. At 0.06 nM, where most of the cells are induced to terminally differentiate in vitro, an average of only 8 erythropoietin molecules bound per cell.

Culture supernatants of LA41 cells suppress the antigen-specific in vitro proliferation of Torpedo AcChoR-primed lymphocytes. This suppression is antigen-specific since the response induced by fetal calf AcChoR and by other antigens is not affected by addition of LA41 culture supernatant in the proliferative assay. LA41 culture supernatant injected in vivo at the time of antigen-priming suppresses also significantly the production of anti-AcChoR antibodies but not the synthesis of antibodies against other antigens--i.e., fetal calf AcChoR or alpha-bungarotoxin.

Because the expression of these markers characterizes the differentiation of immunologically activated T cells, we have now explored the possibility that HTLV- infected T cells might be primed to autologous or allogeneic Ia antigens expressed by the infecting cells. Our studies on the capacity of HTLV-infected T cells to display responses on mixed lymphocyte culture indicate that such T cells as well as single-cell clones derived from them, react non-discriminatively to all known allelic variants of human HLA-D/DR antigens, including those expressed by the responding cells. This reaction is inhibited by antibody to human Ia and is not triggered by Ia-negative T-leukaemia cells. The structure recognized seems to be a common epitope determinant of human Ia antigens, as (HTLV-infected) T cells primed in vitro to one HLA-D/DR specificity display amplified responses to all other HLA-D/DR antigens. We therefore believe that autostimulation by a self-Ia determinant may trigger the clonal expansion of HTLV-infected T cells and potentiate autoimmune processes.","['Suciu-Foca, N', 'Rubinstein, P', 'Popovic, M', 'Gallo, R C', 'King, D W']","['Suciu-Foca N', 'Rubinstein P', 'Popovic M', 'Gallo RC', 'King DW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/11/15 00:00,1984/11/15 00:01,['1984/11/15 00:00'],"['1984/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/312275a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Nov 15-21;312(5991):275-7. doi: 10.1038/312275a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recombinant viruses that contain the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the SL3-3 virus and the gag, pol and env genes of the Akv virus are also leukaemogenic. The cell-type specificity of leukaemias induced by viruses containing different LTR sequences is due in part to the ability of the virus to replicate in the appropriate cellular environment. One explanation of the role of the LTR in determination of both cell tropism and leukaemogenic potential is that the LTR encodes tissue-permissive transcriptional elements. We report here that there are differences in the transcriptional activity of the SL3-3 and Akv LTR sequences in different murine cell types, and that the sequences present in the LTR of SL3-3 exhibit significantly enhanced transcriptional activity in T cells compared with the corresponding region of the Akv LTR.

The ATLV genome consists of long terminal repeat (LTR), gag, pol, env and pX sequences and does not carry a typical v-onc gene. The function of the pX sequence is unknown. To search for the origin of ATLV, segments of the ATLV genome were hybridized to DNAs of various species. The sequences homologous to the pX region of ATLV are represented in the genomes of mouse and rat but not in other species including primates and the human. Neither the pol nor U3 sequence of LTR is conserved in any cellular DNA examined. Sequences slightly homologous to the U3R sequence are found in rabbit, chicken and Xenopus. The results suggest that the pX sequence of ATLV might have derived from rodents. Since ATLV can infect primates, rabbit and rat, ATLV might have been prevalent among a wide variety of mammals and exchanged genetic segments (zoonotic) like influenza virus. If we assume that the original host of ATLV is a rodent rather than man, the pX sequence is homologous to host cellular sequences and reminiscent of the v-onc gene although the function of the pX sequence is not clear.","['Fukui, K', 'Noma, T', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Kobayashi, N', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Honjo, T']","['Fukui K', 'Noma T', 'Takeuchi K', 'Kobayashi N', 'Hatanaka M', 'Honjo T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Biol Med,Molecular biology & medicine,8403879,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Female', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogenes', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pregnancy', 'Species Specificity']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol Med. 1983 Nov;1(4):447-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The formation of CLT-amphiphile complex leads to inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, a characteristic of promoter A elicited after thiol-reagents treatment. In all cases the interaction produces the maximum inhibitory effect above the critical micellar concentration of amphiphiles, although monomers of SDS show inhibition activity as well. The gangliosides appear to be capable of altering bilayer organization of membrane, similar to synthetic detergents. When CLT-ganglioside complexes were incubated with cell culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was completely restored both in cholera toxin and in promoter A. Some protein of FCS, which is avid of gangliosides, seems to be responsible for reversibility of inhibition. The results indicate that the active site of promoter A may be located in a hydrophobic pocket of the toxin structure. Furthermore, CLT was bound to reconstituted Sendai virus envelopes (RSVEs), containing a small amount of GM1. The RSVEs are made of membranous vesicles, capable of binding and fusing with host cell membrane. The incubation for 1 1hr of RSVE bearing CLT with Friend's erythroleukemic cells produced the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. This stimulation appears to be due to the translocation of the active subunit of CLT in the inner half of plasma membrane.","['Fiani, M L', 'Macioce, P', 'Gallina, A', 'Tomasi, M']","['Fiani ML', 'Macioce P', 'Gallina A', 'Tomasi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '9012-63-9 (Cholera Toxin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Cholera Toxin', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*G(M1) Ganglioside', '*Gangliosides', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.490120219 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1984;12(2-3):325-34. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490120219.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intracellular pathway of human transferrin in K562 cells, both in the presence and absence of 10(-5) M monensin, was localized by indirect immunofluorescence. Monensin blocks transferrin recycling by causing internalized ligand to accumulate in the perinuclear region of the cell. The effect of 10(-5) M monensin on human transferrin kinetics was quantitatively measured by radioimmunoassay and showed a positive correlation with immunofluorescent studies. Immunoelectron microscopic localization of human transferrin as it cycles through K562 cells reveals the appearance of perinuclear transferrin-positive multivesicular bodies within 3 min of internalization, with subsequent exocytic delivery of the ligand to the cell surface via transferrin-staining vesicles arising from these perinuclear structures within 5 min of internalization. Inhibition of ligand recycling with 10(-5) M monensin causes dilated transferrin-positive multivesicular bodies to accumulate within the cell with no evidence of recycling vesicles. A coordinated interaction between multivesicular bodies and the Golgi apparatus appears to be involved in the recycling of transferrin in K562 cells. Cell-surface-binding sites for transferrin were reduced by 50% with 10(-5) M monensin treatment; however, this effect was not attenuated by 80% protein synthesis inhibition with cycloheximide, supporting the idea that the transferrin receptor is also recycled through the Golgi.","['Stein, B S', 'Bensch, K G', 'Sussman, H H']","['Stein BS', 'Bensch KG', 'Sussman HH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Furans)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1984/12/10 00:00,1984/12/10 00:01,['1984/12/10 00:00'],"['1984/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)42668-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Dec 10;259(23):14762-72.,,,"['CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of action of these drugs appears to involve production of DNA single- and double-strand breaks by virtue of a temperature-sensitive interaction between drug and a heat-labile intranuclear component. We now report evidence indicating that type II topoisomerase is the likely intracellular target for the DNA strand-breaking effects of the epipodophyllotoxins. Both VM-26 and VP-16 stimulate site-specific DNA cleavage by a highly purified calf thymus type II topoisomerase. VM-26 is 5- to 10-fold more potent than VP-16 in this assay, a difference that is also seen when DNA strand breaks are assayed in isolated nuclei of mouse leukemia cells following drug exposure. Furthermore, a similar potency difference exists with respect to cytotoxicity. Equilibrium dialysis experiments using [3H]VP-16 indicate that the drug does not bind to DNA. Thus, we suggest that the epipodophyllotoxins exert their anti-cancer effects by ""poisoning"" type II topoisomerase without binding to DNA.

Indicators of early mortality in human acute leukemias and chronic myelogenous leukemias in blast crisis.,2927-35,"Human sera contain antigens and also circulating immune complexes that are related to the primate retroviral envelope glycoprotein gp70 of simian sarcoma/simian sarcoma associated virus (SiSV) and of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV). SiSVgp70 related antigens (AG) and immune complexes (IC) are detected both in leukemic and in nonleukemic sera. In a further analysis of these data, the prognostic significance of SiSVgp70 related AG and IC in leukemic patients was examined. The data show that the presence of SiSVgp70 related AG and IC indicates an unfavorable clinical course and a shorter survival time in acute leukemias (AL) and in chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC). Survival data of 56 of 64 patients tested were analyzed (38 patients with AL and 18 patients with CML-BC). Patients with AL whose sera were positive for SiSVgp70 related AG and IC had a median survival time of 9.5 months after diagnosis versus 16 months for patients negative for such AG and IC. This difference in survival time was more pronounced for patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (6.5 versus 19 months). The difference in survival between SiSVgp70 related AG- and IC-negative and positive groups as tested by life table analysis (log-rank test) is significant (P less than 0.05). Patients with AL of the AG- and/or IC-positive group had fewer complete remissions. Patients who had no remissions belong to the AG- and/or IC-positive group (P = 0.06). Patients with CML-BC whose sera were positive for SiSVgp70 related AG and/or IC had a median survival time of 2 months after diagnosis versus 7 months for patients with sera negative for such AG and IC. As tested by log-rank test, survival curves between the two groups are significantly different (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that SiSVgp70 related AG and IC may play an important role in the course of acute leukemia and can provide useful prognostic information.","['Hehlmann, R', 'Erfle, V', 'Schetters, H', 'Luz, A', 'Rohmer, H', 'Schreiber, M A', 'Pralle, H', 'Essers, U', 'Weber, W']","['Hehlmann R', 'Erfle V', 'Schetters H', 'Luz A', 'Rohmer H', 'Schreiber MA', 'Pralle H', 'Essers U', 'Weber W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/*analysis', 'Antigens, Viral/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Sarcoma Virus, Woolly Monkey/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*immunology']",1984/12/15 00:00,1984/12/15 00:01,['1984/12/15 00:00'],"['1984/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19841215)54:12<2927::aid-cncr2820541219>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Dec 15;54(12):2927-35. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19841215)54:12<2927::aid-cncr2820541219>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new method of fixation was employed to preserve platelet peroxidase activity. Monoclonal antibodies to platelet glycoproteins labelled exclusively platelet peroxidase (PPO) positive cells, i.e. platelets, megakaryocytes and promegakaryoblasts (PMKB). In acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, most PMKB possessed both markers while a few PMKB identified by PPO did not bind monoclonal antibodies. This result suggests that PPO appears earlier in maturation than platelet glycoproteins. Although all glycoproteins (GP) displayed fewer sites in PMKB than platelets, GP Ib was often observed in more mature megakaryocytes. Surface (glycophorin A) and intracytoplasmic markers including ferritin, intra-mitrochondrial iron and diffuse peroxidase activity due to haemoglobin of erythroid progenitors, appeared simultaneously. The number of glycophorin A sites increased with maturation. In leukaemia involving PMKB and proerythroblasts, the surface markers were coincident with the localization of peroxidase activity; glycophorin A was always absent from blasts which exhibited PPO activity localized in endoplasmic reticulum. Platelet glycoproteins were never expressed in any other cell lineage. The myeloid surface antigen was present on normal late neutrophilic promyelocytes after the cessation of myeloperoxidase synthesis. In some cases of M1 and M2 AML (FAB classification), labelling was identical to normal cells while in others the antigen appeared earlier than normal. Our findings show that the surface phenotype of blasts from non-lymphoid leukaemia and the intracellular peroxidase activity of a given cell type can be simultaneously demonstrated and analysed by electron microscopy.","['Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vanhaeke, D', 'Pryzwansky, K B', 'Guichard, J', 'Tabilio, A', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Carmel, R']","['Breton-Gorius J', 'Vanhaeke D', 'Pryzwansky KB', 'Guichard J', 'Tabilio A', 'Vainchenker W', 'Carmel R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Glycolipids/analysis', 'Glycophorins/analysis', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*analysis/enzymology', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Peroxidases/*metabolism', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/enzymology/metabolism/pathology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb03991.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 Nov;58(3):447-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb03991.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

One dermoid tumor and part of another displayed a very short T1 (less than that of white matter). Two hamartomas had T1s similar to that of gray matter and a small increase in T2. Four of the children did not show MR or computed tomographic (CT) evidence of intracranial tumors. Follow-up of these cases for 1-23 months after the MR and CT studies revealed no subsequent clinical evidence of tumor. MR scans showed more extensive abnormality than did third-generation CT scans in eight of 10 cases and more extensive abnormality than EMI CT 1010 scans in 10 of 11 cases. Mass effects were better demonstrated in 14 of the 16 patients in whom they were seen. CT demonstrated calcification better than did MR in all four cases in which it was identified. The tumor-edema interface was shown better on CT in each of the three cases with contrast enhancement on CT. MR is a sensitive method of evaluating intracranial tumors in children and adolescents.","['Peterman, S B', 'Steiner, R E', 'Bydder, G M']","['Peterman SB', 'Steiner RE', 'Bydder GM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,AJNR Am J Neuroradiol,AJNR.

More distant relatedness is also seen between BLV p30env and both murine leukemia virus p15E and Rous sarcoma virus gp36. The gp60s of BLV and HTLV are more distantly related than their p30envs, but their homology is nonetheless statistically significant. Between the presumptive terminator of the env gene and the beginning of the 3'-long terminal repeat is a region of 1817 base pairs of unknown function. Just as in the HTLV post-envelope sequence, there are at least two reading frames which are open for a significant fraction of this region. In neither the tumor-derived clone nor a clone from a virus-producing cell line, however, is there a continuous open reading frame throughout the region.

This fact was demonstrated by lymphomagenicity in five mouse strains SJL, C3Hf/Bi, C3H/HeJ, CBA/H, and NFS, and lymphoma acceleration in AKR mice. The incidence was higher and latent periods shorter than that found with the other retroviruses tested (SL3-1c, SL3-2c, MCFc, and GMuLVc). In addition, it was the only retrovirus found to be highly oncogenic in the C3H/HeJ and CBA/H strains. Lack of lymphomagenicity of MCFc in CBA/H strain was shown to be due to a block in viral replication. Addition of nononcogenic Akv ecotropic virus did not affect this lack of oncogenicity. The lymphomas developing in CBA/H and SJL mice after neonatal inoculation of SL3-3c virus only produced lymphomagenic ecotropic virus. Thus, SL3-3c lymphomagenesis is most likely due solely to the action of that virus.

The virus-related sequences in each clone show an organization similar to that of integrated proviruses; those clones with the greatest length of MuLV-related sequences also contain pol and env gene-related sequences. One clone appears to contain an intact endogenous provirus. Unique cellular DNA segments from three of these clones were subcloned and used as specific ""integration site"" hybridization probes. Restriction fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were observed for these integration sites in the DNA of a number of different inbred mouse strains. One provirus-containing fragment was observed only in Balb/c mice while two others were observed in some but not all of the inbred mouse strains tested. Further restriction enzyme mapping of these three loci in the genomic DNA of Balb/c and C3H/HeJ or C57BL/6 mice indicated that the observed RFLPs were due to the presence of proviral DNA sequences in the Balb/c strain at these three integration sites which were lacking in the other mouse strains.

In connection with the reduction of the pathological findings in the CT, an improvement in the neurological findings was determined. A change in the tumour absorption may occur under the radiotherapy. An important indicator for tumour growth or regression is the change in the tumour absorption in computed tomography with the contrast medium. If the enhancement remains inspite of the radiotherapy, it can prognostically be considered as a detrimental factor. In the case of 10 of the 33 patients undergoing radiotherapy the tumour became isodense. No more enhancement was detectable. Isodensity may not be seen as a complete normalization of the brain tissue as could be established by histological investigations. On the other hand if again hypodense areas are revealed, it does not necessarily mean recurrence of tumour. Such an hypodense region then implies a radiogenic tumour-necrosis. Only the renewed enhancement after administering of the contrast medium in the area of the tumour must be considered as recurrence.","['Berninger, T', 'Becker, H', 'Vitzthum, H G']","['Berninger T', 'Becker H', 'Vitzthum HG']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlentherapie,Strahlentherapie,1260024,['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Astrocytoma/radiotherapy', 'Brain Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*radiotherapy/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Bronchogenic/secondary', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/secondary', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glioma/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radioisotope Teletherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', '*Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Strahlentherapie. 1984 Sep;160(9):549-56.,Computertomographische Verlaufsuntersuchungen bei Strahlentherapie von Hirntumoren.,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report direct conductance measurements on planar lipid bilayers containing membrane components of rat basophils (RBL-2H3 line). These studies identify the Ca2+ channel-forming membrane component as the cromolyn binding protein [CBP, in which cromolyn is the anti-asthmatic drug 1,3-bis(2-carboxy-chromon-5-yloxy)-2-hydroxypropane]. Planar membranes were first formed from lipid vesicles containing unfractionated plasma membrane components prepared from RBL-2H3 cells. Conductance of these bilayers was induced by crosslinking IgE bound to the Fc epsilon receptors of this membrane by a specific polyvalent antigen. Channel conductance in the presence of only Ca2+ ions (2 mM) was 2 pS. When only sodium ions were present (150 mM), conductance was 10 pS. Upon addition of Ca2+ (2 mM) to the Na+ ion-containing solution, the conductance decreased from 10 pS to that of the Ca2+ ions--namely, 2pS. Open channel times were in the range of several hundred milliseconds. Conductance amplitudes and time characteristics were independent of the applied voltage. As our earlier studies revealed the essential role of the CBP in Ca2+ conductance of basophil membranes, we formed planar bilayers containing this isolated protein alone. Crosslinking of the CBP by a monoclonal antibody specific to it resulted in the appearance of channel conductances. All characteristics of these channels exhibited great similarity to those observed in planar membranes containing unfractionated RBL-2H3 membrane components. Moreover, in the latter membranes, the monoclonal anti-CBP antibody induced channel conductances that display an even closer similarity to those observed in membranes containing CBP alone. Conductances of both types of planar membranes, irrespective of the mode of activation used, were inhibited by cromolyn. Furthermore, the conductance induced in RBL membranes by polyvalent antigen was inhibited on dissociation of the crosslinked aggregates by a monovalent hapten. The detailed resemblance in channel behavior observed in experiments with the two types of planar bilayers provides compelling evidence that the CBP is the essential and sufficient component forming Ca2+ channels in basophil plasma membranes.","['Mazurek, N', 'Schindler, H', 'Schurholz, T', 'Pecht, I']","['Mazurek N', 'Schindler H', 'Schurholz T', 'Pecht I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (cromolyn binding protein, rat)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'Q13SKS21MN (2,4-Dinitrophenol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['2,4-Dinitrophenol', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Basophils/*immunology/physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', 'Electric Conductivity', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Ion Channels/*physiology', 'Leukemia', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/immunology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.21.6841 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Nov;81(21):6841-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.21.6841.,,PMC392028,,,,,,,,,,

Under the experimental conditions chosen, desensitization was accompanied by a minimal loss of beta-receptors. The cells tested included HeLa, S49 cyc- lymphoma, and rat glioma C6. The functional activity of the beta-receptors was determined by coupling them to a foreign adenylate cyclase by membrane fusion. The donor membranes were treated to inactivate the regulatory and catalytic components of adenylate cyclase. The acceptor membranes were from Friend erythroleukemic cells (Fr cells), which lack beta-receptors, and HeLa cells treated overnight with isoproterenol to eliminate their receptors. The fused membranes were assayed for agonist-stimulated activity, which was always reduced when the donor beta-receptors were from the desensitized membranes. The desensitization appeared to be specific for beta-receptors, as the activity of other receptors and cyclase components was not altered. By fusing HeLa membranes with intact Fr cells, we directly measure the intrinsic activity of native and desensitized beta-receptors.

This problem has been circumvented by segregating the viral genome into cis- and trans-acting components. By establishing helper cell lines that produce the trans-acting viral gene products, one can propagate the cis-acting component in them and harvest defective viral particles that contain only the cis-acting component. The cis-acting component can provide a useful vehicle for the highly efficient transfer of genes into target cells. The defective vector systems described to date, however, are restricted in host range to murine, avian, rat, and dog cells. We describe a helper-free vector system based entirely on an amphotropic murine virus with a wide mammalian host range, including the ability to carry out efficient gene transfer into human cells.

The possibility that cell-mediated immunity plays a significant role in this resistance was suggested by the observation that treatment of 10-day-old mice with antithymocyte serum rendered them susceptible to paralysis. By comparison, mice rendered incapable of generating a humoral immune response by treatment from birth to 1 month of age with anti-immunoglobulin M serum did not develop paralysis after challenge with virus at day 10. Transfer of unseparated and T-cell-enriched populations of Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus-immune spleen cells protected neonatally infected NFS recipients from paralysis; transfer of Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus-immune populations enriched for B cells delayed the onset but did not ultimately protect neonatally infected NFS mice from paralysis. Transfer of naive adult spleen cells had no protective effect in neonatally infected NFS mice. High-level virus replication occurred in the spleens and brains of all mice that developed paralysis regardless of treatment; low-level virus replication in spleen and barely detectable replication in brain occurred in mice that remained clinically normal. These studies suggest that the age-acquired resistance to the paralytic effect of Cas-Br-M murine leukemia virus infection is immunologically mediated and that T cells may play a major role.","['Hoffman, P M', 'Robbins, D S', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Hoffman PM', 'Robbins DS', 'Morse HC 3rd']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/*immunology/microbiology', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Brain/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Paralysis/*microbiology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Virus Replication']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.52.3.734-738.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Dec;52(3):734-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.52.3.734-738.1984.,,PMC254590,,,,,,,,,,

Infectious chimeric MuLVs were recovered by microinjection of recombinant DNA into NIH/3T3 cells and tested for their leukemogenic potential by inoculation into NIH/Swiss newborn mice. Parental Moloney MuLV and amphotropic 4070-A MuLV induced thymic and nonthymic leukemia, respectively, when inoculated intrathymically. With chimeric MuLVs, we found that the primary determinant of leukemogenicity of Moloney and amphotropic MuLVs lies within the 1.5-kilobase-pair ClaI-PvuI long terminal repeat (LTR)-containing fragment. The presence of additional Moloney env-pol sequences with the Moloney LTR enhanced the leukemogenic potential of a chimeric MuLV significantly, indicating that these sequences were also involved in tumor development. Since parental viruses induced different forms of leukemia, we could also map the viral sequences conferring this disease specificity. We found that the 1.5-kilobase-pair ClaI-PvuI LTR-containing fragment of Moloney MuLV was necessary and sufficient for a chimeric MuLV to induce thymic leukemia. Similarly, the same LTR-containing fragment of amphotropic MuLV was necessary and sufficient for a chimeric MuLV to induce nonthymic leukemia. Therefore, our results suggest that specific sequences within this short LTR-containing fragment determine two important viral functions: the ability to transform cells in vivo (leukemic transformation) and the selection of a specific population of cells to be transformed (disease specificity).","['DesGroseillers, L', 'Jolicoeur, P']","['DesGroseillers L', 'Jolicoeur P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Experimental/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Thymus Neoplasms/microbiology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.52.2.448-456.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Nov;52(2):448-56. doi: 10.1128/JVI.52.2.448-456.1984.,,PMC254545,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have further characterized ATLV and EBV in the cloned ATLB 2 cell line by biochemical techniques. The ATLA antigens in these clones, initially shown by immunofluorescence, were studied by immunoprecipitation with human sera from ATL patients and the Western blotting technique using a mouse monoclonal antibody (GIN-14). We identified ATLV core polypeptides 24K and 19K in the ATLB cell extracts. Furthermore, total cellular DNA and poly(A) RNA from the ATLB cell lines were analysed for the presence of viral genomes with molecularly cloned DNA probes containing the ATLV and EBV sequence, respectively. The results showed that all ATLB 2 clones contained highly conserved ATLV proviral DNA irrespective of whether or not they expressed ATLA. They also contained several copies of EB virus DNA and DNA-DNA reassociation kinetics studies clearly showed that most of the EBV DNA sequences were present in ATLB cells.

Furthermore, cloned Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cell lines derived from Tac-positive normal B cells continued to express the Tac antigen in long-term cultures and manifested high affinity IL-2 receptors identified in binding studies with purified radiolabeled IL-2. The line 5B4 developed in the present study could be induced with purified JURKAT-derived or recombinant IL-2 to express a larger number of IL-2 receptors. Furthermore, the addition of IL-2 to the 5B4 B cell line augmented IgM synthesis, which could be blocked by the addition of anti-Tac. The size of the IL-2 receptors expressed on the cloned normal B cell lines was similar (53,000-57,000 daltons) to that of receptors on phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cell lymphoblasts. Thus, certain malignant and activated normal B cells display the Tac antigen and manifest high affinity receptors for IL-2.

The coexistence of activated neutrophils with lymphocytes in tumor masses and inflammatory tissues suggests the possibility of interaction between secreted neutrophil products and nearby lymphocytes. We examined the susceptibility of lymphocyte NK activity to oxidative injury by the neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) system and H2O2 with the use of a cellfree model system. Exposure of human mononuclear leukocytes (MNL) to MPO, an H2O2-generating system (glucose + glucose oxidase), and a halide (C1- or I-) resulted in marked suppression of MNL-NK activity, as measured by 51Cr release from K562 tumor targets (p less than 0.001). This suppression was dependent on the presence and activity of each system component and was blocked by azide and catalase, but not by heated catalase. In spite of the marked functional suppression of NK activity, MNL viability was more than 95% and target binding frequency was not affected. NK suppression was reversible after 24 hr in culture. The mechanism of suppression was dependent on the amount and rate of H2O2 delivered, and on MNL number. MPO was essential when H2O2 flux was low or when MNL numbers were high. As H2O2 flux increased or MNL numbers decreased, NK suppression gradually became MPO-independent and was mediated by H2O2 alone. The ability of the MPO system to compromise lymphocyte NK function may explain the in vitro inhibition of NK activity of mixed cell populations by the tumor promoter phorbol esters, because these agents are potent stimulants for neutrophil secretion of MPO and H2O2. This study may also provide a possible mechanism for the reported in situ NK activity suppression by adherent phagocytic cells during carcinogenesis in both humans and animals.","['El-Hag, A', 'Clark, R A']","['El-Hag A', 'Clark RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Azides)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Iodides)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.1.3.4 (Glucose Oxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Azides/pharmacology', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Glucose Oxidase/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Iodides/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/*pharmacology', 'Peroxidases/*pharmacology']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Dec;133(6):3291-7.,,,"['R01 AI020866/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI20866/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The predominance of intracellular monomers in polymeric IgA-secreting cells suggested that the pathway of the assembly of human IgA molecules is analogous to that described for mouse IgA synthesis.","['Moldoveanu, Z', 'Egan, M L', 'Mestecky, J']","['Moldoveanu Z', 'Egan ML', 'Mestecky J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A, Secretory)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)']",IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin A, Secretory/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Dec;133(6):3156-62.,,,"['AI-10854/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-18745/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AM-03555/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have also shown that the 5'-triphosphate of ddThd, ddTTP, selectively inhibits cellular DNA polymerases beta and gamma and retroviral reverse transcriptases. Cellular DNA polymerase alpha is relatively resistant to ddTTP. We have extended these findings to show that the 5'-triphosphates of the other 3 ddNs (ddATP, ddCTP, and ddGTP) affect cellular DNA polymerases alpha, beta, and gamma in the same fashion as does ddTTP. We also show that all four ddNs in concentrations up to 100 microM have negligible effects on the growth of NIH Swiss 3T3 cells. These negligible effects may be due to inefficient intracellular phosphorylation of each nucleoside to the triphosphate. We have determined that, in several different cell lines, ddThd is phosphorylated only at a very slow rate to ddTTP, and in the one cell line tested (monkey CV-1 cells), ddAdo and ddGuo are also poorly phosphorylated. Both ddAdo and ddGuo, and probably ddThd, are converted by CV-1 cells to additional unknown compounds which may have biological activity. The four ddNs display effects of different magnitudes on certain virus infections. Although 30 microM ddThd inhibits herpes simplex I infection of CV-1 cells by 50%, 30 microM ddAdo has no effect.

To evaluate potential feedback effects of iron on this system, we exposed cells to iron chelators and monitored the activity of the transferrin receptor. In the present study, we found that chelation of extracellular iron by the hydrophilic chelators desferrioxamine B, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, or apolactoferrin enhanced the release from the cells of previously internalized 125I-transferrin. Presaturation of these compounds with iron blocked this effect. These chelators did not affect the uptake of iron from transferrin. In contrast, the hydrophobic chelator 2,2-bipyridine, which partitions into cell membranes, completely blocked iron uptake by chelating the iron during its transfer across the membrane. The 2,2-bipyridine did not, however, enhance the release of 125I-transferrin from the cells, indicating that extracellular iron chelation is the key to this effect. Desferrioxamine, unlike the other hydrophilic chelators, can enter the cell and chelate an intracellular pool of iron. This produced a parallel increase in surface and intracellular transferrin receptors, reaching 2-fold at 24 h and 3-fold at 48 h. This increase in receptor number required ongoing protein synthesis and could be blocked by cycloheximide. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid or desferrioxamine presaturated with iron did not induce new transferrin receptors. The new receptors were functionally active and produced an increase in 59Fe uptake from 59Fe-transferrin. We conclude that the transferrin receptor in the K562 cell is regulated in part by chelatable iron: chelation of extracellular iron enhances the release of apotransferrin from the cell, while chelation of an intracellular iron pool results in the biosynthesis of new receptors.","['Bridges, K R', 'Cudkowicz, A']","['Bridges KR', 'Cudkowicz A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Apoproteins)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Lactoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (apolactoferrin)', '7A314HQM0I (Pentetic Acid)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Apoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', '*Iron Chelating Agents', 'Kinetics', 'Lactoferrin/*pharmacology', 'Lactoglobulins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Pentetic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1984/11/10 00:00,1984/11/10 00:01,['1984/11/10 00:00'],"['1984/11/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)90642-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Nov 10;259(21):12970-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

For adult disease, there is striking bimodality in incidence with peaks in young adulthood and in older adulthood. On epidemiologic grounds, there appear to be three different diseases: childhood (0-14 years), young adult (15-34 years), and older adult Hodgkin's disease (55+ years). There are marked geographic variations in Hodgkin's disease incidence, but the variations are different for the three age groups. There are also interesting associations between Hodgkin's disease and markers of social class. For the young adult disease, the higher the socioeconomic status of a person, the greater the Hodgkin's disease risk. Additionally, Hodgkin's disease patients appear to have had fewer of the childhood infectious diseases or to have had these diseases at older ages than controls. These factors suggest an analogy between young adult Hodgkin's disease and Epstein-Barr virus, poliomyelitis, and tuberculosis infections. Thus, the descriptive epidemiology of Hodgkin's disease suggests an infectious disease process underlying its etiology in young adulthood and perhaps in childhood. There is a curious relationship between Hodgkin's disease and Epstein-Barr virus infection. Persons with Epstein-Barr virus infection have an increased risk of developing Hodgkin's disease, and the Epstein-Barr virus infection precedes the development of Hodgkin's disease. The virus has never been isolated from or identified in Hodgkin's disease tissue. The mechanisms underlying this association are unknown and may provide important clues to the etiology of Hodgkin's disease and other lymphomas. It is likely that there is no direct person-to-person spread of Hodgkin's disease. This is suggested by several negative studies of linkages between cases, time-space clustering, and aggregation of exposures at schools. Studies have shown that neither physicians nor nurses, groups with greater likelihood of encountering Hodgkin's disease patients than the general public, have an increased risk. There appears to be familial aggregation of Hodgkin's disease. Siblings of young adult cases are at increased risk, whereas siblings of older adult cases have no increase in risk. Among sibling pairs with Hodgkin's disease, there is a marked excess of like-sex pairs. Like-sex siblings have almost twice the risk of discordant-sex siblings, suggesting an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Thus, it would be of interest to known the risk to spouses of cases who share environments but who do not share genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Grufferman, S', 'Delzell, E']","['Grufferman S', 'Delzell E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Epidemiol Rev,Epidemiologic reviews,7910703,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infections/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Sclerosis/etiology', 'Poliomyelitis/etiology', 'Racial Groups', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Social Class', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'Time Factors', 'Tonsillectomy/adverse effects']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036276 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiol Rev. 1984;6:76-106. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a036276.,,,['KO7 CA00726/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,128,,,,,,,

In these mice, B6RV2 tumors regressed after initial growth, and after tumor regression the mice were resistant to repeated inocula of up to 10(8) B6RV2 cells. Serum from these mice reacted with B6RV2 in mixed hemadsorption or protein A assays, and absorption analysis indicated that the antigen was restricted to B6RV2; it could not be detected in normal thymocytes or spleen concanavalin A blasts from different inbred strains, nor in 16 C57BL/6 or BALB/c leukemias. Spleen cells from mice in which the tumor had regressed were cytotoxic to B6RV2 after in vitro stimulation with B6RV2, as shown by 51-chromium release assay. This cytotoxicity was eliminated by pretreatment of the cells with anti-Thy-1.2, anti-Lyt-2.2, anti-Lyt-3.2, and complement, indicating that the effector cells were T-cells. The specificity of T-cell killing of B6RV2 was examined by competitive inhibition assays with unlabeled cells; only B6RV2 inhibited killing, while eight other C57BL/6 leukemias did not inhibit. Thus, the antigen on B6RV2 defined serologically and by cytotoxic T-cells is a unique antigen. However, it was not revealed by antibody-blocking test whether the unique determinant defined serologically was related to that recognized by T-cells; B6RV2 antiserum did not block lytic activity in the absence of added complement, irrespective of whether the target cells were untreated or anti-H-2b-treated B6RV2. H-2Kb antisera, but not H-2Db antisera, blocked lysis. This indicated that the H-2Kb molecule was exclusively involved in recognition of B6RV2 by cytotoxic T-cell.","['Nakayama, E', 'Uenaka, A', 'Stockert, E', 'Obata, Y']","['Nakayama E', 'Uenaka A', 'Stockert E', 'Obata Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/immunology/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sex Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Nov;44(11):5138-44.,,,['CA 16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

These cells are capable of proliferating in the presence of 10(-6) M 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), a level achieved in the plasma of leukemic patients undergoing conventional-dose ara-C therapy. The cells share numerous biological and biochemical features with the parent line, including: morphology; rate of growth; cloning characteristics; karyotype; rates of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; and ability to undergo terminal differentiation in the presence of agents such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol acetate and dimethyl sulfoxide. In contrast, these cells display a great reduction in the total intracellular accumulation of ara-C following a 4-hr exposure to 10(-6) M ara-C (2.4 versus 99.0 pmol ara-C/10(6) cells). Resistant cells exposed to 10(-6) M ara-C for 1 hr also exhibited a reduction in the generation [1.2 versus 31.9 pmol 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP)/10(6) cells] and the 4-hr retention (0.30 versus 3.87 pmol ara-CTP/10(6) cells) of ara-CTP, the lethal ara-C metabolite, in comparison to parent cells. Incorporation of ara-C into resistant HL-60 cell DNA was also profoundly decreased. These biochemical alterations were associated with a 1000-fold decrease in the sensitivity of clonogenic cells to continuously administered ara-C (ara-C 50% inhibitory concentration: 1.8 X 10(-6) M for HL-60/ara-C; 3.0 X 10(-9) M for HL-60). A variety of antagonists of de novo pyrimidine synthesis inhibited the growth of ara-C-sensitive and -resistant cells to a similar extent. When HL-60 cells were exposed to a lethal concentration of thymidine (5 X 10(-3) M), coadministration of 5 X 10(-6) M deoxycytidine restored 90 +/- 4% (S.D.) of colony-forming capacity. Normal human bone marrow progenitor cells were protected to a similar degree by 3 X 10(-3) M deoxycytidine. In contrast, deoxycytidine concentrations as high as 5 X 10(-3) M were unable to confer any protection to HL-60/ara-C cells under identical conditions. These studies suggest that an enzymatic perturbation rendering human leukemic cells highly resistant to ara-C may be exploited to achieve a selective in vitro chemotherapeutic effect.","['Bhalla, K', 'Nayak, R', 'Grant, S']","['Bhalla K', 'Nayak R', 'Grant S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*deficiency/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', '*Mutation', 'Phosphotransferases/*deficiency', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Nov;44(11):5029-37.,,,"['CA-13696-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36501-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

TPA inhibited both cell growth and iron uptake by these cell lines. This effect was rapid, which is typical of phorbol esters which are biologically active, and it occurred at very low concentrations of TPA. This effect of TPA was dependent upon an inhibition of the transferrin-binding capacity as estimated on intact cells. However, experiments with transferrin binding on cell samples dissolved in 1% Triton X-100 showed that TPA-treated cells exhibited a transferrin-binding capacity similar to that of control cells. On the basis of this result, it is suggested that TPA modified a part of transferrin receptors present in the cells; as a result of this modification, these receptors became unavailable for binding transferrin, but they remained physically present in the cell. Other compounds capable of inducing the differentiation of leukemic cells, such as dimethyl sulfoxide, butyrate, retinoic acid, and 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, did not acutely inhibit iron uptake. We also investigated the effect of TPA on transferrin receptors in a cellular system in which phorbol esters stimulate cell proliferation. At 16 X 10(-9) M, TPA markedly stimulated the proliferation of T-lymphocytes. However, in spite of this marked stimulation of cell proliferation, TPA-stimulated lymphocytes exhibited a transferrin-binding capacity much inferior to cells stimulated by other mitogens, such as phytohemagglutinin.","['Testa, U', 'Titeux, M', 'Louache, F', 'Thomopoulos, P', 'Rochant, H']","['Testa U', 'Titeux M', 'Louache F', 'Thomopoulos P', 'Rochant H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'P6YZ13C99Q (Calcifediol)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Calcifediol/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Phorbol Esters/*pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Nov;44(11):4981-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The striking international variation (apparently a fivefold difference) can probably be explained on the basis of differential parity, differing classification measures, and differences in the underlying population age distribution. United States age-adjusted mortality has increased slightly in the past 30 years, and the cancer remains predominantly a disease of older adult white women of northern European extraction. The increases in age-specific mortality and age-adjusted mortality over time may be related to a decrease in average family size. Pregnancy, especially pregnancy before age 25 years, and use of oral contraceptives are protective; the risk of ovarian cancer increases with increasing years of ovulation. A positive family history is also associated with a substantial increase in ovarian cancer risk. Survivors of ovarian cancer are more susceptible to cancers of the breast, endometrium, and colon than are similarly-aged normal women, most probably because all four cancers share some common risk factor(s). Various alkylating agents are clearly leukemogenic in survivors of ovarian cancer, an observation that suggests caution in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in women at relatively low risk of relapse.","['Greene, M H', 'Clark, J W', 'Blayney, D W']","['Greene MH', 'Clark JW', 'Blayney DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Contraceptives, Oral)', '0 (Estrogens, Conjugated (USP))', '14807-96-6 (Talc)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Contraceptives, Oral/adverse effects', 'Estrogens, Conjugated (USP)/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Gallbladder Diseases/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/etiology', 'Obesity/complications', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/complications/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/mortality', 'Parity', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Talc/adverse effects', 'Thyroid Diseases/complications']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0093-7754(84)90127-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1984 Sep;11(3):209-26.,,,,,115,,,,,,,

The latter conclusion also is supported by the fact that adult T-cell leukemia patients and healthy HTLV carriers have antibodies to the env gene products.","['Kiyokawa, T', 'Yoshikura, H', 'Hattori, S', 'Seiki, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Kiyokawa T', 'Yoshikura H', 'Hattori S', 'Seiki M', 'Yoshida M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia/*microbiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.19.6202 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Oct;81(19):6202-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.19.6202.,,PMC391888,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation results in a short chromosome 22, termed the Philadelphia (Ph1 or 22q-) chromosome. Recently, the cellular oncogenes abl and sis were mapped to human chromosomes 9 and 22, respectively. Moreover, abl was shown to be translocated from chromosome 9 to 22 and sis from chromosome 22 to 9 in CML patients with t(9;22). These findings raised the possibility that one or both of these oncogenes is activated and directly involved in the development of the disease. We analyzed expression of the abl and sis oncogenes in leukemic cells from CML patients with t(9;22). We found that sis is not expressed but that abl is transcribed into an 8-kilobase RNA. This abl RNA is also present in two leukemic cell lines (EM2 and K562), which were derived from CML patients and contain the t(9;22). This 8-kilobase RNA is not detected in normal cells, in other human leukemias without t(9;22), or in human cell lines that lack t(9;22). The consistent presence of this abl RNA transcript in CML with t(9;22) suggests that it is a consequence of abl translocation and that it plays a role in the development of this leukemia.","['Gale, R P', 'Canaani, E']","['Gale RP', 'Canaani E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.18.5648 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Sep;81(18):5648-52. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.18.5648.,,PMC391767,,,,,,,,,,

This and the previous result of Chatis et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

To more precisely define this determinant, we have begun to construct recombinants in which smaller 3' end fragments of the Fr-MuLV and Mo-MuLV genomes are exchanged. Analysis of the first such recombinant showed that Fr-MuLV can be converted to a lymphoma-inducing virus in NFS mice by substitution of a 0.38-kilobase fragment encompassing the virus enhancers in U3 with the corresponding region of the Mo-MuLV genome.","['Chatis, P A', 'Holland, C A', 'Silver, J E', 'Frederickson, T N', 'Hopkins, N', 'Hartley, J W']","['Chatis PA', 'Holland CA', 'Silver JE', 'Frederickson TN', 'Hopkins N', 'Hartley JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Recombinant/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Plasmids']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.52.1.248-254.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Oct;52(1):248-54. doi: 10.1128/JVI.52.1.248-254.1984.,,PMC254512,"['CA14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA19308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

It is thought that Rev-T arose when a virus similar to Rev-A, the helper virus of Rev-T, infected a turkey and recombined with c-rel from that turkey. There is one large c-rel locus in the turkey genome which contains all of the sequences homologous to v-rel (K. C. Wilhelmsen and H. M. Temin, J. Virol. 49:521-529, 1984). We have sequenced v-rel and its flanking sequences, each of the regions of the c-rel locus from turkey that are homologous to v-rel and their flanking sequences, and the coding sequence for env and part of pol of Rev-A. The v-rel coding sequences can be translated into a 503-amino acid env-v-rel-out-of-frame-env fusion polypeptide. We have not detected any sequences in the Los Alamos or University of California-San Diego data bases that are more significantly related to the amino acid or nucleic acid sequence of v-rel than to the randomized sequence of v-rel. Comparison of Rev-A, Rev-T, and c-rel indicates that the v-rel sequences may have been transduced from the c-rel (turkey) locus by a novel mechanism. There are sequences in Rev-A and c-rel that are similar to splicing signals, indicating that the 5' virus-rel junction of Rev-T may have been formed by cellular RNA splicing machinery. Eight presumed introns have presumably been spliced out of c-rel to generate v-rel. There are also short imperfect regions of homology between sequences at the boundaries of v-rel and sequences in Rev-A and c-rel (turkey), indicating that c-rel may have been transduced by homologous recombination. There are many differences between the amino acid sequences of the predicted translational products of v-rel and c-rel which may account for their difference in transformation potential. These sequence differences between v-rel and c-rel include 10 missense transitions, four missense transversions, and three places where Rev-T has a small in-frame deletion of sequences relative to c-rel.

To examine the extent and character of genomic divergence of the RD-114 gene family as well as to assess their positional association within the cat genome, we have prepared a series of molecular clones of endogenous RD-114 DNA segments from a genomic library of cat cellular DNA. Their restriction endonuclease maps were compared with each other as well as to that of the prototype-inducible RD-114 which was molecularly cloned from a chronically infected human cell line. The endogenous sequences analyzed were similar to each other in that they were colinear with RD-114 proviral DNA, were bounded by long terminal redundancies, and conserved many restriction sites in the gag and pol regions. However, the env regions of many of the sequences examined were substantially deleted. Several of the endogenous RD-114 genomes contained a novel envelope sequence which was unrelated to the env gene of the prototype RD-114 env gene but which, like RD-114 and endogenous feline leukemia virus provirus, was found only in species of the genus Felis, and not in other closely related Felidae genera. The endogenous RD-114 sequences each had a distinct cellular flank which indicates that these sequences are not tandem but dispersed nonspecifically throughout the genome. Southern analysis of cat cellular DNA confirmed the conclusions about conserved restriction sites in endogenous sequences and indicated that a single locus may be responsible for the production of the major inducible form of RD-114.","['Reeves, R H', ""O'Brien, S J""]","['Reeves RH', ""O'Brien SJ""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cat Diseases/microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/isolation & purification', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/veterinary']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.52.1.164-171.1984 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Oct;52(1):164-71. doi: 10.1128/JVI.52.1.164-171.1984.,,PMC254502,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to isolate this factor from cultured leukemic promyelocytes. An extract from the promyelocytes reduced significantly (P less than 0.001) the ouabain-insensitive sodium efflux rate, from 0.096 +/- 0.009 to 0.056 +/- 0.003 SD. Using the inhibition of ouabain-insensitive sodium transport in erythrocytes as an assay to identify the factor, we ran the crude promyelocyte extract through Sephadex G-25 and G-10, with an intermediate ion-exchange step on DE-32, and finally subjected the active fraction to reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The specific inhibitory activity of the final fraction was 180-fold higher than that of the crude promyelocyte extract. The inhibitory activity could be destroyed by acid hydrolysis and by enzymatic digestion with several proteases but not by heating at 80 degrees C for 30 min; these characteristics suggest that the active factor, called inhibitin, is a peptide. Inhibitin is released by immature myeloid cells but not by differentiated white cells or by leukemic lymphocytes.

The characterization of the alpha and beta chains has been of particular interest because they may constitute the T cell receptor for antigen. Here we show that the T3 complex prepared by immunoprecipitation from T lymphocytes of a leukemic patient (Sezary syndrome) displays an unusually strong association of the alpha and beta chains with the 20/25-kDa T3 proteins. The alpha and beta chains (48 and 44 kDa) were co-precipitated by anti-20-kDa T3 monoclonal antibodies as a disulfide-linked 90-kDa heterodimer.

This multimer could be independently precipitated with a new monoclonal antibody WT-31, which detects the larger polypeptide chains of the T3 complex on all human T lymphocytes. After removal of N-linked oligosaccharides, both the alpha and beta chain were found to have 33-kDa peptide backbones with distinct isoelectric points. Using a monoclonal reagent T40/25, a 90-kDa heterodimer, consisting of 40- and 49-kDa chains with peptide backbones of 34 kDa was found to be T3-associated on the T leukemic cell line HPB-ALL. When the alpha and beta chains from the Sezary patient were compared with the corresponding chains from HPB-ALL by peptide mapping, large differences were observed.

During repeated tumor transfers anti-JNS development always accompanied tumor proliferation. In indirect immunofluorescence microscopy JNS were recognized by these antibodies not only in cultured cells of murine origin (normal as well as transformed cells), but also in cells of other mammalian species (rat, bat, hamster, dog, goat, cattle, horse) and even in cells of members of two further vertebrate classes: avian embryo fibroblasts and a fish-derived cell line. In the various cell lines tested, the morphology of the JNS differed, but they were always arranged close to the nucleus. The distinct perinuclear and juxtanuclear position is indicative for the Golgi region; the staining pattern after osmium impregnation and immunoelectron microscopy supported the localization of the recognized structures in this cellular compartment. Drugs like monensin or colcemid, which are known to influence Golgi morphology and function, altered the staining pattern of the antibodies drastically. The widespread occurrence of this antigenic determinant(s) in cultured cells from different species suggests that this Golgi component is highly conserved in evolution. According to immunoprecipitation studies four proteins with apparent molecular weights of 250,000, 96,000, 53,000, and 38,000 daltons were recognized by these antisera. It remains to be determined, if these molecules are involved in the described serological reaction.","['Weiland, E', 'Weiland, F', 'Thiel, H J']","['Weiland E', 'Weiland F', 'Thiel HJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Exp Cell Biol,Experimental cell biology,7701827,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Cattle', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chiroptera', 'Cricetinae', 'Dogs', 'Fishes', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Golgi Apparatus/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Phylogeny', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/*immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000163274 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Biol. 1984;52(5):300-10. doi: 10.1159/000163274.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction is accompanied by increased transferrin-binding activity which is necessary for the cellular acquisition of iron from transferrin for hemoglobin synthesis. There are Friend cell variants in which hemoglobin synthesis is not induced by DMSO unless exogenous hemin is also present. In this study we have compared the inducibility of transferrin receptors and iron incorporation in DMSO-inducible (745) and -uninducible (M-18 and TG-13) Friend cell lines. Cellular transferrin-binding sites were estimated by Scatchard analysis of data obtained from specific binding of [125I]transferrin by the cells. Our results show that unlike 745, DMSO treatment of the variant cell lines M-18 and TG-13 does not result in increased transferrin-binding activity. The number of transferrin-binding sites and the rate of iron uptake is similar in uninduced 745 and DMSO-treated M-18 and TG-13 cells. Although exposure of M-18 cells to DMSO and hemin induces hemoglobinization, this treatment does not cause induction of transferrin receptors. These results indicate that the primary defect in M-18 cells may be the uninducibility of transferrin receptors. We have also shown that exposure of 745 cells to hemin during DMSO treatment prevents the induction of transferrin receptors, suggesting that hemin may control the expression of transferrin receptors in erythroid cells.","['Wilczynska, A', 'Ponka, P', 'Schulman, H M']","['Wilczynska A', 'Ponka P', 'Schulman HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(84)90180-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1984 Oct;154(2):561-6. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(84)90180-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both cell types, exposure to fMet-Leu-Phe (100 nM) induced rapid lysosomal enzyme secretion (maximal release less than 30 s) and marked changes in the 32P-labelling of the inositol lipids phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns4P), phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] as well as phosphatidic acid (PtdA). Specifically, levels of [32P]PtdIns and [32P]PtdIns(4,5)P2 decreased rapidly (peak decrease at 10-15s), with a subsequent increase at 30 s and later. PtdIns4P and PtdA showed only an increase. In Me2SO-differentiated HL-60 cells prelabelled with [3H]inositol for 20 h, fMet-Leu-Phe caused a net increase in the cellular content of [3H]inositol phosphates, including a rapid increase in [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, suggesting that PtdIns(4,5)P2 breakdown occurs by a phospholipase C mechanism. Both lysosomal enzyme secretion and changes in phospholipid metabolism occur over the same agonist concentration range with a similar time course. Binding of [3H]fMet-Leu-Phe, although occurring over the same concentration range, exhibited markedly slower kinetics. Although depletion of extracellular Ca2+ had no effect on ligand-induced polyphosphoinositide turnover, PtdIns turnover, PtdA labelling and lysosomal enzyme secretion were severely curtailed. These studies demonstrate a receptor-mediated enhancement of phospholipid turnover that correlates with a specific biological response to fMet-Leu-Phe. Further, the results are consistent with the idea that phospholipase C-mediated degradation of PtdIns(4,5)P2, which results in the formation of inositol trisphosphate, is an early step in the stimulus-secretion coupling pathway of the neutrophil. The lack of correlation between these two responses and the equilibrium-binding condition suggests that either these parameters are responsive to the rate of ligand-receptor interaction or only fractional occupation is required for a full biological response.","['Dougherty, R W', 'Godfrey, P P', 'Hoyle, P C', 'Putney, J W Jr', 'Freer, R J']","['Dougherty RW', 'Godfrey PP', 'Hoyle PC', 'Putney JW Jr', 'Freer RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/enzymology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphates/blood', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*blood', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide']",1984/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2220307 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1984 Sep 1;222(2):307-14. doi: 10.1042/bj2220307.,,PMC1144180,['DE-05764/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This difference in mechanisms is expressed not only in effects of iron-chelating agents on enzyme activity and of L1210 cell growth in culture, but also in differences in responses to catalase and peroxidase. Further, these data suggest that the inhibition of reductase activity by IMPY and IMPY/iron-chelator occurs through different pathways. The same conclusion can be drawn for the inhibition of reductase by hydroxyurea and hydroxyurea/iron-chelator. It is clear that additional studies will be required to understand the exact mechanism by which hydroxyurea or IMPY and the thiosemicarbazones inhibit the non-heme iron component of ribonucleotide reductase. It will also be necessary to better define the pathways of inhibition of reductase activity by IMPY and the IMPY/iron-chelator combination (or hydroxyurea and hydroxyurea/iron-chelator combination).

While there are also distinct biochemical lesions associated with this phenotype, their role(s) in the expressions of resistance is not known at this time. More clear, however, is our understanding of the pharmacologic determinants of this resistance--apparent decreased drug uptake and decreased drug retention. This latter phenomenon has been attributed to the workings of an active efflux pump, but data presented here and elsewhere permit an alternative explanation--that of altered drug binding to an as yet unidentified target(s). Elucidation of the mechanism of multiple drug resistance is important in the design of new chemotherapeutic strategies to overcome it. In this regard, calcium channel blocking agents and calmodulin inhibitors can cause an apparent reversal of resistance by enhancing the cytotoxic effectiveness of the anticancer drugs, possibly by increasing the amount of drug retained by the tumor cells. The basis for this enhanced retention and cytotoxicity is not presently known, but it may be related to cellular calcium fluxes, calmodulin content or membrane fluidity and permeability. The meaning of these findings is unclear at the present time, but they may provide new insights into the mechanism of action and ultimate cellular target(s) for Vinca alkaloids. Whether these modifying drugs sensitize the cells to the action of the alkaloids or potentiate the oncolytic drug effect in the cell remains to be determined. Regardless of the mechanism, calcium channel blocking agents may have a role in the combination chemotherapy of the leukemias with Vinca alkaloids.","['Beck, W T']",['Beck WT'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'S79426A41Z (Fluphenazine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluphenazine/pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vinblastine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*pharmacology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(84)90015-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1984;22:207-27. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(84)90015-3.,,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Clonal lines of the infected GH4 cells contained copies of the recombinant provirus stably integrated via the long terminal repeats, and the expected RNA transcripts of proviral DNA accumulated in the cytoplasm, although no infectious virus was produced.

The results demonstrate that patients with primary malignant brain tumors have depressed levels of NK cell function in their PBMCs due to the suppressive actions of glass-adherent monocytes, whereas patients with low grade tumors have normal levels of function shown by this assay.","['Braun, D P', 'Penn, R D', 'Harris, J E']","['Braun DP', 'Penn RD', 'Harris JE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Astrocytoma/*immunology', 'Cerebral Ventricle Neoplasms/*immunology', '*Choroid Plexus', 'Glioblastoma/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Papilloma/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1227/00006123-198407000-00007 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurgery. 1984 Jul;15(1):29-33. doi: 10.1227/00006123-198407000-00007.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall cancer incidence was comparable in the two groups. However, 11 nervous-system tumors occurred in relatives of cases, whereas none occurred in relatives of controls (P = 0.0005). Nine relatives of cases but no relatives of controls had cancer of the hematopoietic-lymphatic system (P = 0.003). Nine siblings of cases but only one sibling of a control had cancer as children. Medulloblastoma and glioblastoma multiforme were overrepresented in the group of children whose relatives had central-nervous-system tumors. We compared the actual number of cancers of the central nervous system or hematopoietic-lymphatic system in relatives of cases with the number expected on the basis of known incidence rates and found a fivefold excess.

Sera were tested also from other homosexual men and heterosexual controls. Antibody to high titre to HTLV-III was present in the serum of all six subjects with ILS. In contrast, antibody to low titre was present in only one of six healthy homosexual men and in one of five homosexual men with immunodeficiency but no lymphadenopathy. Antibody to HTLV-III was not detected in serum in the one subject with AIDS who was tested, but was detected in his healthy sexual partner. Antibody to HTLV-I, earlier believed to be related to AIDS, was lacking in all subjects. These results suggest, in an Australian setting, that infection with HTLV-III is the cause of ILS and, by inference, may also be the cause of AIDS.

Exposure of these cells to 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) at 37 degrees C results in a 40% reduction of the specific binding of 125I-transferrin, which is apparent within 15 min. Half-maximal inhibition occurs at about 1 nM. Other tumor promoting phorbol esters also inhibit 125I-transferrin binding in a dose-dependent manner which parallels their known promoting activity in vivo. TPA reduces the number of transferrin receptors, and does not alter the degradation or the internalization of transferrin. In addition, TPA inhibits iron uptake by these cell lines. These effects are specific, since phorbol esters do not affect either cell growth or the binding of transferrin to Friend erythroleukemia cells and Raji cell line. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that the inhibition of transferrin binding may represent one of the mechanisms by which phorbol esters affect the growth and the differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines.","['Pelicci, P G', 'Testa, U', 'Thomopoulos, P', 'Tabilio, A', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Titeux, M', 'Gourdin, M F', 'Rochant, H']","['Pelicci PG', 'Testa U', 'Thomopoulos P', 'Tabilio A', 'Vainchenker W', 'Titeux M', 'Gourdin MF', 'Rochant H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects', 'Receptors, Transferrin', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transferrin/*metabolism']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90008-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(4):597-609. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90008-0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amphotropic clone 4070 (Ampho) is a murine retrovirus which does not cause leukemia in these animals. Mice inoculated with Ampho, an Fr-MCF/Ampho pseudotype, or F-MuLV developed leukemia in 0, 50, and 100% of animals, respectively. To identify the F-MuLV and Fr-MCF sequences responsible for leukemia, we constructed hybrid viral genomes between these viruses and Ampho, using subgenomic fragments of molecularly cloned viral DNA. Transfection of these hybrid viral DNAs into fibroblasts produces recombinant retroviruses. These new viruses are assayed in vivo for their ability to cause leukemia. Recombinant viruses constructed between the Ampho genome and the Fr-MCF envelope gene do not cause leukemia. Similarly, viruses constructed by using either the Fr-MCF long terminal repeat U3 region or the F-MuLV long terminal repeat U3 region and the remainder of the Ampho genome do not cause leukemia. However, if the Fr-MCF envelope gene plus the Fr-MCF U3 region are joined to Ampho, the resulting virus causes erythroleukemia in 14% of mice. Recombinant viruses made between the Fr-MCF envelope gene, the F-MuLV U3 region, and the remainder of the Ampho genome cause erythroleukemia in 38% of mice.

To better understand these diseases and the viral origins, we isolated a pathogenically active molecular clone of R-SFFV proviral DNA, sequenced its 3'-terminal 2,163-base-pair (bp) region, and compared these sequences with previously determined sequences of F-SFFV. The 516-bp R-SFFV long terminal repeat is highly homologous to those of F-SFFV and Friend murine leukemia virus, although only the latter contains a 65-bp direct repeat in its U3 region. The env gene of R-SFFV encodes a glycoprotein with 408 amino acids that is identical in its basic domain organization to the glycoprotein of F-SFFV. Thus, the junctions between the dual tropic-related and ecotropic sequences occur at the same nucleotide, and both SFFV env genes contain identical 585-bp deletions in their ecotropic domains and single-bp insertions which cause premature terminations at the same amino acid in their ecotropic p15E domains. Consistent with their independent origins, however, the env sequences of R- and F-SFFV are distinctive in both their 5' dual tropic-related and 3' ecotropic-related domains. Furthermore, there are several consistent amino acid differences between the polycythemic F-SFFV sequences and the anemia-inducing R-SFFV sequence.

Comparison between the in vitro altered P120 and wild-type P120 virus strains indicated that expression of L-v-abl did not increase the efficiency of lymphoid transformation.

Immunological and cytochemical characterization of the BXH-2 leukemias showed that they are of the myeloid lineage. To assess the oncogenicity of the BXH-2 viruses, newborn mice of several BXH RI strains were inoculated at birth with biologically cloned B-ecotropic or mink cell focus-forming murine leukemia virus. These studies demonstrated that the B-ecotropic virus can induce myeloid leukemias in other BXH RI strains, whereas the dualtropic mink cell focus-forming isolates were nononcogenic in the strains tested. DNA-DNA reassociation analysis indicated that the organotropism of the B-ecotropic murine leukemia virus is confined to lymphoid tissues. Southern analysis of tumor DNAs showed that there was amplification of ecotropic virus-specific sequences in BXH-2 myeloid tumors and in all leukemias induced in other BXH RI strains by inoculation of the BXH-2 B-ecotropic virus. Although B-ecotropic virus is expressed in central nervous tissues of paralyzed BXH-2 mice, we were unable to induce the disorder in several BXH RI strains inoculated intracranially at birth with either the B-ecotropic or dualtropic virus.

Purified or crude enzyme preparations from HeLa cells were electrophoresed in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels containing gapped DNA. After renaturation of the peptides in situ, the intact gel was incubated in a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase reaction mixture containing [32P]NAD. Autoradiograms of the gels consistently exhibited a major activity band at Mr = 116,000-120,000; in many runs, three minor distinct bands at Mr = 125,000, 135,000, and 145,000 were also seen. [32P]NAD appeared to be incorporated into poly(ADP-ribose) since: (i) the activity bands were not detectable when the enzyme-inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide was added to the gel incubation mixture; and (ii) the radioactive polymer, electroeluted from the bands, was completely digested by phosphodiesterase I. Preliminary activity gel analysis of extracts of HeLa cells treated with different DNA-damaging agents revealed that the apparent activity of the Mr = 116,000 form increased by about 10-fold in cells treated with 1 mM dimethyl sulfate and 10-20-fold in cells treated with 10 microM mitomycin C. Only a small increase was obtained in cells treated with 1 mM methyl methanesulfonate, and no change in the activity band pattern was observed after 50 and 100 J/m-2 of UV irradiation.","['Scovassi, A I', 'Stefanini, M', 'Bertazzoni, U']","['Scovassi AI', 'Stefanini M', 'Bertazzoni U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)']",IM,"['Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycoproteins/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/enzymology/radiation effects', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', '*Mutation', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1984/09/10 00:00,1984/09/10 00:01,['1984/09/10 00:00'],"['1984/09/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)90608-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Sep 10;259(17):10973-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in the absence of calcium ions, aggregation of the receptor causes depolarization of the plasma membrane (Kanner, B. I., and Metzger, H. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 80, 5744-5748), suggesting that other ions can traverse the putative channel. Direct evidence for this now has been obtained with measurements of increased 22Na+ fluxes in the absence of calcium ions, induced by aggregation of receptors. This reaction was optimally studied in the presence of ouabain. When aggregation of the receptor was induced by reacting the cell-bound IgE with a multivalent antigen, the sodium flux was completely inhibited by univalent hapten. The sodium flux was also completely inhibited by 2 mM calcium. Aggregation-induced 45Ca2+ fluxes were observed in the presence of millimolar concentrations of external Ca2+, but not in its absence. Depolarization of the plasma membrane potential by the addition of potassium to the medium in the presence of calcium did not itself induce degranulation. In fact, aggregation of the receptors for IgE in the presence of high external potassium resulted in a greatly diminished degranulation. These data indicate that the ion channel modulated by aggregation of receptor differs from the voltage-dependent type of calcium channels. We suggest that in the absence of calcium this channel is rather unspecific, but that calcium can modify it to become calcium selective.","['Kanner, B I', 'Metzger, H']","['Kanner BI', 'Metzger H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Onium Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'U9IF5Y5IND (tetraphenylphosphonium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Ion Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Onium Compounds', 'Organophosphorus Compounds', 'Potassium/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism']",1984/08/25 00:00,1984/08/25 00:01,['1984/08/25 00:00'],"['1984/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)90947-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Aug 25;259(16):10188-93.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weanling kittens infected with FeLV-A became permanently viraemic but remained haematologically normal over a period of 36 weeks. Similar kittens inoculated with FeLV-C, which produces erythroid hypoplasia when administered to newborn kittens, neither became viraemic nor developed the disease. However, weanling kittens inoculated with a mixture of FeLV-A and C became viraemic, first with FeLV-A and then additionally with FeLV-C, and the emergence of FeLV-C into the blood coincided with the advent of erythroid hypoplasia. When FeLV-C was inoculated into five older cats which had been viraemic with FeLV-A for several months previously, it appeared in the plasma of three of the cats and erythroid hypoplasia was diagnosed in two of these, 16-20 weeks after infection with FeLV-C. These results show that FeLV-A enhances the growth of FeLV-C in cats and overcomes their age-related resistance to FeLV-C. Also, the appearance of FeLV-C in the plasma of cats viraemic with FeLV-A indicates that erythroid hypoplasia will subsequently occur rapidly. These findings are relevant to the origin of FeLV-C isolates and their occurrence in nature.","['Jarrett, O', 'Golder, M C', 'Toth, S', 'Onions, D E', 'Stewart, M F']","['Jarrett O', 'Golder MC', 'Toth S', 'Onions DE', 'Stewart MF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Cats', 'Hematocrit', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*classification/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Serotyping']",1984/08/15 00:00,1984/08/15 00:01,['1984/08/15 00:00'],"['1984/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910340222 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1984 Aug 15;34(2):283-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910340222.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of the four combinations were also used to determine whether the AKR-15 duplication preference could be cancelled by MCF-viremia in permissive F1 hybrids. Chemically and virally induced 15-trisomic leukemias showed the same AKR-15 duplication preference, which was due to some autonomous property of AKR-15 itself. It was maintained in (C57BL 6;15 X C57BL) F1 leukemias, where 6;15 is the only AKR-derived chromosome propagated on the C57BL/background. In the (C57BL 6;15 X AKR) F1 hybrid cross where both chromosomes 15 are of AKR origin, duplication occurred at random.

Eight cell lines named TCL were obtained by transformation of peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of healthy donors or HTLV carriers in cocultures with HTLV-producer MT-2 cells. Nine cell lines named ILT were interleukin 2 (IL2)-dependent cell lines cloned from PBL of ATL patients and healthy HTLV-carriers. Tc-Kan9 cell line was also an IL2-dependent cell line clonally established from PBL culture stimulated with autologous TCL cells. Five cell lines named TL were established in vitro directly from PBL of an adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patient and from ILT cells of an ATL patient and three HTLV-carriers, respectively, to grow autonomously without IL2. All the TCLs, ILTs, TLs and Tc-Kan9 possessed Leu-I antigen, a pan-T-cell marker. Leu3a antigen, a helper/inducer T-cell marker, was expressed on five of eight TCLs and all of the ILTs and TLs. Leu-2a, a cytotoxic/suppressor T-cell marker, was detected only on Tc-Kan9 but not others. Fresh ATL leukemic cells of patients had a helper/inducer T-cell marker.

This minimal retroviral vector contains LTRs and other cis-acting signals required for infectious RNA virus propagation. We placed the SV40 early region within this DNA and after transfection of cells producing helper Moloney murine leukemia virus, SV40 retroviruses (MV40) could be rescued. Cytoplasmic spliced large T and small t transcripts, as well as unspliced transcripts, are packaged into virions with equal efficiency. Pure SV40 large T retroviruses can be cloned from these heterogeneous virus stocks by secondary transformation of rodent cells. The large T retrovirus stocks morphologically transform primary or established mouse and rat lines with high efficiency. There is little difference in transformation either by agar assay or focus formation between retroviruses carrying both SV40 genes or large T alone. We present quantitative data that demonstrate that abortive transformation of rodent cells by SV40, transient expression of the transformed phenotype after infection, is not manifested by MV40. Thus abortive transformation is not the result of a weakly dominant transforming gene, but rather of the normally inefficient mode of integration and early gene expression of SV40 upon infection of rodent cells.","['Kriegler, M', 'Perez, C F', 'Hardy, C', 'Botchan, M']","['Kriegler M', 'Perez CF', 'Hardy C', 'Botchan M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Antigens, Viral, Tumor)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral, Tumor/*genetics', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Genes', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics/immunology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(84)90503-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(84)90503-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1984 Sep;38(2):483-91. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(84)90503-8.,,,"['CA 06646/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30490/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Hybrid genes were constructed with human beta-globin DNA sequences from either 5' or 3' of the translation initiation site linked to the complementary parts of the gamma or H2Kbm1 genes. Both types of constructs were inducible during MEL differentiation. The relative rates of transcription of the 5' gamma-3' beta and 5'H2-3' beta hybrid genes show that induction of the hybrid gene transcripts results at least in part from transcriptional activation of the genes.

Tumor recurrences, in contrast to the parent tumor, lacked retroviral antigens and did not release infectious virus. When reinjected into syngeneic animals, cell lines derived from tumor recurrences grew progressively. Tumor recurrences could be infected with the homologous retrovirus. Tumor rejection and recurrence were modulated by host immunity. In guinea pigs immunized to virus-infected cells, tumor recurrences occurred earlier and in a higher proportion of animals than in nonimmune guinea pigs. In some immunosuppressed guinea pigs, retrovirus-infected tumor cells grew progressively. Progressively growing tumors of immunosuppressed guinea pigs contained large amounts of infectious virus and expressed viral antigens. To identify the source of tumor recurrences, the parent virus-infected tumor was cloned. Clones were heterogeneous in virus expression; some clones released large quantities of infectious virus; others did not. Two clones formed tumors in syngeneic animals. Injection of a virus producer clone into virus-immune animals was not followed by tumor recurrence. The data suggest that the reappearance of tumors at sites of injection of retrovirus-infected fibrosarcoma cells represents immune selection and rejection of retrovirus-expressing cells.

The MAF activity of this culture supernatant fluid was stable at 100 degrees for 2 min and was unaffected by treatment with human anti-gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) monoclonal antibody. Both treatments neutralized greater than 97% IFN-gamma activity from the supernatant fluid as measured by virus neutralization. Furthermore, this MAF activity was not due to contamination with endotoxins since the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay was negative (less than 0.125 ng/ml) and preincubation of the C10/MJ-2 supernatant fluid with polymyxin B did not diminish its activating potential. By contrast, human IFN-gamma rendered human monocytes tumoricidal only when combined with Salmonella typhosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at a minimum dose of 0.2 ng/ml. The concentrations of both LPS and IFN-gamma were crucial to achieve activation since IFN-gamma at doses less than 10 units/ml did not activate human monocytes even when combined with maximal doses of LPS (0.5 ng/ml). Finally, when human IFN-gamma admixed with LPS was preincubated with polymyxin B, its activating potential was completely abrogated. Collectively, these data suggest that the human T-cell line C10/MJ-2 constitutively produces a diffusable product distinct from IFN-gamma which activates human monocytes to lyse tumor cells.

A recent paper (Sun, A.S., Holland, J.F. and Ohnuma, T. (1983) Biochim. Biophys.

[3H]Adenosine derived from 5'-[3H]AMP hydrolysis was further transformed into [3H]inosine by the adenosine deaminase activity of the leukemic cell lines tested; [3H]inosine was precipitated with the excess substrate and was not taken into account in the ecto-5'-nucleotidase determination, which led the authors to confuse this adenosine deaminase activity with a 5'-nucleotidase inhibitor.

O., & Kohn, K.W. (1979) Nucleic Acids Res. 7, 793-804]. The three intercalators used were 4'-(9-acridinylamino)-methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), 5-iminodaunorubicin (5-ID), and ellipticine. These compounds differ in that they produced predominantly DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) (m-AMSA) or predominantly DNA double-strand breaks (ellipticine) or a mixture of both SSB and DSB (5-ID) in whole cells. In isolated nuclei, each intercalator produced DSB at a frequency comparable to that which is produced in whole cells. Moreover, these DNA breaks reversed within 30 min after drug removal. It thus appeared that neither ATP nor other nucleotides were necessary for intercalator-dependent DNA nicking-closing reactions. The formation of the intercalator-induced DSB was reduced at ice temperature. Break formation was also reduced in the absence of magnesium, at a pH above 6.4 and at NaCl concentrations above 200 mM. In the presence of ATP and ATP analogues, the intercalator-induced cleavage was enhanced. These results suggest that the intercalator-induced DSB are enzymatically mediated and that the enzymes involved in these reactions can catalyze DNA double-strand cleavage and rejoining in the absence of ATP, although the occupancy of an ATP binding site might convert the enzyme to a form more reactive to intercalators. Three inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II--novobiocin, nalidixic acid, and norfloxacin--reduced the formation of DNA strand breaks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Pommier, Y', 'Schwartz, R E', 'Kohn, K W', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Pommier Y', 'Schwartz RE', 'Kohn KW', 'Zwelling LA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Ellipticines)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '117VLW7484 (ellipticine)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'P910685S6G (5-iminodaunorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Aminoacridines/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/*metabolism', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ellipticines/pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics', 'Magnesium/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Sodium Chloride/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",1984/07/03 00:00,1984/07/03 00:01,['1984/07/03 00:00'],"['1984/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00309a013 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1984 Jul 3;23(14):3194-201. doi: 10.1021/bi00309a013.,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were no changes in the EPR parameters in diseased liver and the data support the hypothesis that the lowering in activity is due to lowered catalase levels rather than to catalase inhibition.

The only difference of significance in this transformation between diseased and normal livers was the greater percentage of total catalase present as catalase-formate (approximately + 15%) in aerobic diseased liver, which may indicate a lowered production of hydrogen peroxide, relative to formate, in these livers.

Pinter and E. deHarven, 1979, Virology 99, 103-110; Y. Yoshinaka and R. B. Luftig, 1982, Virology 118, 380-388). When Gz-MSV particles are disrupted in 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in the absence of reducing agents, such as beta-mercaptoethanol (beta-MSH) almost half of the Pr65gag Coomassie blue-stained band is detected as a band at a Mr of 130K. Electrophoretic blotting studies with monospecific antisera against MuLV p30, p15, p12, and p10 showed that the 130K band cross-reacted with all four antigens suggesting that it was a dimer of Pr65gag. Two-dimensional (2D) SDS-PAGE where the first dimension was run under nonreducing conditions and the second with beta-MSH, supported the contention that the 130K band was a dimeric complex of Pr65gag. One also saw minor amounts of a 260K and higher polymeric forms of Pr65gag on the SDS gels, suggesting that polymeric forms may exist as well. When 32P-labeled Gz-MSV particles obtained by in vivo labeling of infected HTG-2 cells with [32P]PPi were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, only 10% of the 32P label was detected at the 130K position. In contrast, 30% of the Coomassie blue-stained Pr65gag material was found at 130K on the 2D gels. This suggests that unphosphorylated Pr65gag is more likely to participate in dimer formation than phosphorylated Pr65gag. Pr65gag of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), which is present as a minor (5% of stain) protein band on SDS-PAGE also showed 130K dimers. Further, in beta-MSH-deficient SDS preparations of Gz-MSV, electrophoresed after trypsin treatment, a 32K band that stained with p15, but not p10, p12, nor p30, antisera was observed. If beta-MSH was added, this band was no longer present. Thus Pr65gag dimerization in immature MuLV particles appears to at least involve the p15 region of the polyprotein. Since p15 is an extremely hydrophobic protein, formation of Pr65gag dimers may occur when virion precursor proteins are brought to the cell membrane during virus assembly.","['Yoshinaka, Y', 'Katoh, I', 'Luftig, R B']","['Yoshinaka Y', 'Katoh I', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Disulfides/analysis/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/analysis', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/analysis', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1984/07/30 00:00,1984/07/30 00:01,['1984/07/30 00:00'],"['1984/07/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/30 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0042-6822(84)90164-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Virology. 1984 Jul 30;136(2):274-81. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(84)90164-8.,,,['CA-27707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The LTR consisted of 530 base pairs (bp) with an inverted repeat of 6 bp at its 5' and 3' ends, flanked by a direct repeat of 6 bp of host cell origin. A tRNAPro binding site for minus-strand DNA synthesis followed the 5' LTR. The U3 region contained putative transcriptional promoters, ""CAT"" box and ""TATA"" box, but they had peculiar sequences (C-C-A-A-C-T and G-A-T-A-A-A-T). The U3 region also contained a potential enhancer element, whose sequence partially resembled those of other viral and cellular, especially of immunoglobulin, enhancers. The most striking structural feature of the LTR was an exceptionally long R region (228 bp), which separated a poly(A) addition signal (A-A-T-A-A-A) from a poly(A) site as far apart as 260 bp. The long R region was suggested to form a large stable hairpin structure on a nascent RNA chain, making the two transcription termination signals close together and thus ensuring normal termination of the chain. This structural feature of the bovine leukemia virus LTR was analogous to that of human T-cell leukemia virus LTR and, in fact, slight sequence homology (at most 50%) was observed between the R regions of these two retroviruses, indicating their evolutionary relationship. The unique structural feature of bovine leukemia virus and human T-cell leukemia virus LTRs may thus bear some relation to the biological features commonly shared by these retroviruses.","['Sagata, N', 'Yasunaga, T', 'Ogawa, Y', 'Tsuzuku-Kawamura, J', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Sagata N', 'Yasunaga T', 'Ogawa Y', 'Tsuzuku-Kawamura J', 'Ikawa Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.15.4741 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Aug;81(15):4741-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.15.4741.,,PMC391566,,,,"['GENBANK/M12527', 'GENBANK/M19208']",,,,,,

By contrast, HTLV-II has been isolated from a patient with a relatively benign hairy T-cell leukemia. To characterize differences in the viral genomes that might contribute to these different pathologies, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of a HTLV-II provirus. Comparison with the type I HTLV LTR reveals that, whereas the overall structural features are similar, the two sequences differ markedly throughout most of the length of the LTR. Despite the overall differences, the sequences of several functional regions of the two LTRs are conserved. These include the 5' boundary of U3, the RNA cap site, and the tRNAPro-binding site immediately 3' to the LTR. Another point of similarity is a 21-base sequence that is repeated four times in the U3 region of HTLV-II and three times in the U3 region of HTLV-I. This sequence has a formal analogy to, but no common sequence with, viral transcriptional enhancers. The U3 region of HTLV-II possesses a series of imperfect tandem direct repeats, 42 bases long, 21 bases long, 19 bases long, and 7 bases long. These structures differ from those of HTLV-I except for the 21-base repeat sequence. Thus, the structure of HTLV-II differs substantially from that of HTLV-I in the region that governs transcriptional initiation and tissue specificity. Such differences may account for some of the differences in clinical presentation of HTLV-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas and hairy T-cell leukemia.","['Sodroski, J', 'Trus, M', 'Perkins, D', 'Patarca, R', 'Wong-Staal, F', 'Gelmann, E', 'Gallo, R', 'Haseltine, W A']","['Sodroski J', 'Trus M', 'Perkins D', 'Patarca R', 'Wong-Staal F', 'Gelmann E', 'Gallo R', 'Haseltine WA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/microbiology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.15.4617 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Aug;81(15):4617-21. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.15.4617.,,PMC391541,,,,"['GENBANK/M12524', 'GENBANK/M19203']",,,,,,

Previous studies have failed to detect significant nucleotide sequence homology between HTLV-I and HTLV-II even though these different members of the HTLV family share certain biologic properties such as T-cell tropism and transformation. To further test these viruses for conserved regions in their genomes, we examined hybridization between HTLV-I and HTLV-II by using Southern blotting and heteroduplex mapping at different melting points. These two techniques produced similar results, showing that HTLV-I and HTLV-II proviruses have, in fact, strongly conserved nucleotide sequences in the pX region and lesser although still substantial homology in the LTR, gag, pol, and env regions. These data provide experimental evidence that HTLV-II, like HTLV-I, contains pX sequences. Although the function of pX is unknown, its conservation in evolutionarily divergent human T-lymphotropic viruses implies a biologically important function.

HTLV is normally tropic for mature T lymphocytes, especially those expressing the helper-inducer surface antigen phenotype (OKT4 or Leu-3-positive), and the neoplastic T cells infected with HTLV generally express receptors for T-cell growth factor (detected by reactivity with anti-Tac antibody). However, we report here the isolation of a HTLV-infected B-lymphocyte clone from the peripheral blood of a patient with ATL. This clone is cytogenetically normal and is not infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Co-culture of cells from this clone with cord blood lymphocytes resulted in transmission of HTLV and the immortalization of either T or B lymphocytes. These results suggest that HTLV may be associated with a broader range of host cells than previously recognized.","['Longo, D L', 'Gelmann, E P', 'Cossman, J', 'Young, R A', 'Gallo, R C', ""O'Brien, S J"", 'Matis, L A']","['Longo DL', 'Gelmann EP', 'Cossman J', 'Young RA', 'Gallo RC', ""O'Brien SJ"", 'Matis LA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology']",1984/08/09 00:00,1984/08/09 00:01,['1984/08/09 00:00'],"['1984/08/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/09 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/310505a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Aug 9-15;310(5977):505-6. doi: 10.1038/310505a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the ATLV-positive cell lines tested that had cytoplasmic ATL-associated antigen (ATLA) detectable in acetone-fixed cell smears were also positive for ATLMA, but ATLMA was not detected in any ATLV-negative cell lines. The frequencies of ATLA- and ATLMA-bearing cells in seven cell lines tested were roughly parallel. The frequency of expression of both ATLMA and ATLA in cultures of MT-1 cells increased in the presence of 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine. All human sera having ATLA antibody had ATLMA antibody and the titers of the two were similar in most of the sera. The anti-ATLMA titers of human sera determined by using an ATLV-bound non-ATL T-cell line as antigen were also similar to the anti-ATLA titers. Absorption of anti-ATLMA-positive sera with living MT-2 cells, in which almost 100% of the cells express ATLA and ATLMA, caused parallel decreases in the anti-ATLA and anti-ATLMA titers. Analysis of the 125I-labeled surface of MT-2 cells by immunoprecipitation with anti-ATLMA-positive human serum followed by gel electrophoresis revealed that p19, p24, p28, and p46 polypeptides were specifically precipitated.

An examination of specificity.,429-34,"Advantages in the use of indirect immunofluorescence for the identification of terminal transferase (TdT) in single cells may be offset by lack of specificity, as compared to the biochemical assay of the enzyme, especially in analyses of lymphocyte populations. False positive results were obtained in 15/15 tonsillectomy samples and in 9/27 specimens from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission, perhaps due to antihuman lymphocyte activity in the rabbit heteroantisera which are used in the indirect immunofluorescence technique. This phenomenon may be more pronounced in 'activated' normal lymphocytes. Such reactions are not due to antibodies directed against adenovirus, papovavirus or EB virus antigens, although these are common constitutents of human tonsillar cells. Additional problems with TdT heteroantisera may result from immunization with non-TdT determinants in calf thymus extracts, as was manifest in human non-lymphoid (KB) cells cultured in fetal bovine serum.

Heteroduplexes of SFFVp X F-MuLV or F-MCF and SFFVa X F-MuLV or F-MCF showed several major deletions in the pol gene region and a single major deletion in the 3' half of the env gene region of SFFVp and SFFVa.

Such studies, reported herein, uncovered two major families of nonlinked genetic loci whose interactions underlie autoimmune abnormalities in NZB mice. One family of genes leads to antibodies to murine leukemia virus, ssDNA, and erythrocytes, as well as to defective tolerance to bovine gamma-globulin. The other group of genes leads to polyclonal B cell activation, stem cell abnormalities, endogenous murine leukemia virus expression, and NTA.

This reflects an internalization of receptors since no such reduction is observed when the total binding sites in soluble extracts of uninduced and differentiating cells are compared. The internalization of transferrin receptors has also been shown using lactoperoxidase-mediated radioiodination of cell surfaces and by immune precipitation of total and surface labeled receptors using an anti-receptor monoclonal antibody. Transferrin receptors from uninduced and differentiating cells were partially purified by affinity chromatography on transferrin-Sepharose and shown to be disulfide-bridged homodimers of a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 90,000. This protein is a phosphoprotein that can be resolved by isoelectric focusing into three major and two minor forms.

All lines contained, and were probably transformed by, AGM-EBV. Moreover, they expressed immunoglobulins but lacked the Leu l T-cell marker. Thus they were B cells. Since a high percentage of AGMs are naturally infected with a virus similar to adult T-cell leukemia virus (ATLV), we examined these cell lines for ATLV. With immunofluorescence tests we detected ATLV-related antigens (ATLA) in three of the eight cell lines. EBV membrane antigen was present in three out of four. The highest percentage (40%) of ATLA-positive cells was found in the AGM-13 line. After metabolic labelling of these cells, ATLV-specific polypeptides p24, p19, p15, and p10 were detected.

Me2SO induction of MEL cells has also been associated with increases in ADPRT activity in one study, but not in another. We have monitored the effects of Me2SO on DNA strand breaks in preformed and replicating MEL cell DNA. The results clearly demonstrate that DNA fragmentation is not detectable during Me2SO induction of MEL differentiation, even in the presence of 3-aminobenzamide, an inhibitor of ADPRT. Further, these results are consistent with an absence of detectable changes in both endogenous and total potential ADPRT activity during Me2SO-induced MEL differentiation.

To examine the order and regulation of their joining, we have developed assays that distinguish their various combinations and have used the assays to study tumor cell analogs of B-lymphoid cells as well as normal B-lymphoid cells. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) transformed fetal liver cells - the most primitive B-lymphoid cell analog available for analysis - generally had DJH rearrangements at both JH loci. These lines continued DNA rearrangement in culture, in most cases by joining a VH gene segment to an existing DJH complex with the concomitant deletion of intervening DNA sequences. None of these lines or their progeny showed evidence of VHD or DD rearrangements. Heavy chain-producing tumor lines, representing more mature stages of the B-cell pathway, and normal B-lymphocytes had either two VHDJH rearrangements or a VHDJH plus a DJH rearrangement at their two heavy chain loci; they also showed no evidence of VHD or DD rearrangements. These results support an ordered mechanism of variable gene assembly during B-cell differentiation in which D-to-JH rearrangements generally occur first and on both chromosomes followed by VH-to-DJH rearrangements, with both types of joining processes occurring by intrachromosomal deletion. The high percentage of JH alleles remaining in the DJH configuration in heavy chain-producing lines and, especially, in normal B-lymphocytes supports a regulated mechanism of heavy chain allelic exclusion in which a VHDJH rearrangement, if productive, prevents an additional VH-to-DJH rearrangement.","['Alt, F W', 'Yancopoulos, G D', 'Blackwell, T K', 'Wood, C', 'Thomas, E', 'Boss, M', 'Coffman, R', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Tonegawa, S', 'Baltimore, D']","['Alt FW', 'Yancopoulos GD', 'Blackwell TK', 'Wood C', 'Thomas E', 'Boss M', 'Coffman R', 'Rosenberg N', 'Tonegawa S', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1984 Jun;3(6):1209-19.,,PMC557501,"['AI-17879/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-22047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

It is concluded that lymphocyte 5' nucleotidase is functionally, abnormal in both primary hypogammaglobulinaemia and CLL and is deficient in the latter.

We have studied and correlated the prevalence of AIDS-associated retrovirus and retroviral antibodies in several groups of male homosexuals from Greenwich Village. Retrovirus was detected in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes by testing for reverse transcriptase (RT) and confirmed by establishment of virus-producer cell lines, and electron microscopy. Seventy-six percent of patients with AIDS, 93% with AIDS-related complex (ARC), 69% with generalized lymphadenopathy (LAS), and 35% of asymptomatic homosexuals were positive for virus in the RT assay. Transmission of the virus from RT-positive lymphocytes into the CEM cell line was successful in 10 of 11 randomly chosen cases. No virus isolates were obtained from lymphocytes of 8 heterosexual individuals. Serum antibodies against AIDS-associated virus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay and confirmed by Western blotting, using an LAV/HTLV-III-producer cell line, LAV-N1, which we established. LAV/N1 virus was purified by ultracentrifugation through sucrose gradient and the pattern of its proteins was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using sera from an AIDS patient. The major polypeptides of LAV/HTLV-III (19, 25-27, 32, 42 and 54 kilodalton) were present. These proteins did not react in Western blots with sera positive for Adult T cell leukemia virus (ATLV). thus, LAV-N1 and ATLV were not antigenically related. In our assay for LAV/HTLV-III antibodies, 18 (100%) of patients with AIDS, 13 (100%) of patients with ARC, 24 (69%) of 35 patients with LAS and 9 (39%) of 23 asymptomatic homosexuals were sero-positive. Heterosexual controls were negative. All IF-positive sera tested by Western blot contained antibodies against specific viral proteins. High titers (greater than or equal to 1:1280) of serum antibodies against LAV/HTLV-III virus were detected in 71% of AIDS patients, 62% with ARC, 38% LAS and 13% among asymptomatic homosexuals.

The 5' orf encodes a tyrosine-specific protein kinase while the 3' orf has the capacity to code for an 18,000 Mr protein. However, no 3' orf product has yet been identified. Using probes capable of distinguishing between the 5' and 3' orfs of v-abl, we have examined the abl-related transcripts present in human haematopoietic cells and leukaemia-derived cell lines, including the chronic myeloid leukaemia-derived cell line K562. Our results indicate that transcripts of 6 kb, 7 kb and 8 kb (kilobase, 10(3) base-pairs) show strong homology to v-abl 5' protein kinase-encoding orf sequences, but are devoid of any sequences from the v-abl 3' orf. In addition, transcripts of 5 kb, 3 kb, 1.6 kb and 1.4 kb, reacting with both 5' orf and 3' orf probes, were observed. The latter species, with coding sequences from both the tyrosine kinase and the putative 18,000 Mr protein, must be transcribed from the human c-abl gene as this is apparently the only human gene containing sequences homologous to the v-abl 3' orf. The 6 kb, 7 kb and 8 kb transcripts may arise either from the c-abl gene through differential splicing, or from one of the three other regions of the human genome with sequences homologous to the 5' orf of v-abl. Examination of genomic DNA from the K562 cell line revealed that the amplification of abl-related sequences, which is presumed to result in the elevated levels of the 8 kb transcript found in this cell line, does not involve sequences homologous to the v-abl 3' orf. This lends credence to the idea that the 8 kb transcript may derive from an abl-related gene other than c-abl. While the significance of the 3' orf of v-abl remains unknown, the data presented strongly suggest the existence of at least two distinct abl-related proteins in human haematopoietic cells.","['Savin, K W', 'Adams, F C', 'Devereux, L M', 'Jose, D G', 'de Kretser, T A']","['Savin KW', 'Adams FC', 'Devereux LM', 'Jose DG', 'de Kretser TA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Biol Med,Molecular biology & medicine,8403879,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Amplification', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hematopoietic System/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'RNA/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Biol Med. 1984 Dec;2(6):397-409.,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal drug delivery and, consequently, maximum therapeutic effect will be accomplished when all available information from diverse disciplines can be integrated. This review has attempted to point out some of the limitations of taking an optimistic view of the question of targeting drug delivery using macromolecule-drug conjugates. For example, a strategy for the development of macromolecular conjugates can be established based on characteristics of the targeted tumors and the drugs in prospect of great success. Biological and physiological features of the tumor such as a cell type, site, and the pharmacological and physicochemical properties of chemical agents such as site of action and chemical stability must be considered at the first step. Selection of the optimum carrier system will be accompanied when all these problems are carefully considered. Similarly, the optimum method of conjugation is likely to vary as a function of the carrier, the chemotherapeutic agent, and the delivery site or site of action of the agent. The stability of the bond must adopt itself to the mode and site of action of the agent, the necessity for release, and the availability of hydrolytic enzymes which break the linkage and release the agent. On the other hand, the success of such conjugates synthesized according to this strategy will depend on physicochemical properties of the conjugates such as molecular size, electric charge, and solubility; chemical and biological stability of active components of conjugates and linkages; interaction with the tumor cells; cytotoxicity in tissue culture system; pharmacokinetics in the body such as absorption profile, localization, and elimination manner; in vivo antitumor activity; and biodegradability and antigenicity of the conjugates. The practitioners of macromolecular conjugate research find themselves in the interesting, but difficult, position of being at the interface between basic information on the drugs and biological systems and an expanding clinical demand for more sophisticated therapeutic agents. Consequently, knowledge is demanded not only of the chemical, physical, and pharmaceutical properties of macromolecules, but also of pathophysiology of the condition being treated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Sezaki, H', 'Hashida, M']","['Sezaki H', 'Hashida M']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst,Critical reviews in therapeutic drug carrier systems,8511159,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Blood Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/therapeutic use', 'Dextrans/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin', 'Mitomycins/administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Peptides/therapeutic use', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin/therapeutic use']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst. 1984;1(1):1-38.,,,,,164,,,,,,,

These retroviruses appear to harbour a gag precursor-cleaving protease, a not yet experimentally identified viral protein, between their gag and pol genes. Most interestingly, the 3' end portion of the BLV genome (designated pXBL) contains a long open reading frame that has a typical protein-coding property. The product of this open reading frame has now been identified as a protein of 38,000 daltons, which is produced by a spliced mRNA. We note that its amino acid sequence shows appreciable homology, especially in its N-terminal quarter, to that of the HTLV-I counterpart (pX), and we thus suggest that BLV pXBL and HTLV-I pX has diverged from a common ancestral gene.

The differential susceptibility of two neoplastic cell lines to this enzyme was studied in detail. The growth of sarcoma 180 cells cultured in Fischer's medium was markedly inhibited by phospholipase C; whereas, in contrast, cultured L1210 leukemia cells were relatively resistant to the cytotoxic effects of this enzyme. The differential sensitivity of these two neoplastic cell lines to phospholipase C was corroborated by dye-exclusion tests. Thus, leukemia L1210 cells exposed to a concentration of 0.2 mg of phospholipase C per ml of Fischer's medium for 30 min at 37 degrees C were able to exclude Trypan Blue; whereas, only about 21% of sarcoma 180 cells treated under identical conditions were able to exclude the dye. That the cytotoxicity of phospholipase C to sarcoma 180 was the result of hydrolysis of phospholipids of the plasma membrane was supported by measurements of the rate of hydrolysis of radioactivity from the phospholipid of neoplastic cells prelabeled with [3H]choline. Eighty-two percent of incorporated radioactive choline was released from sarcoma 180 cells treated with phospholipase C in Fischer's medium, whereas, only 20% of the label from [3H]choline was solubilized from L1210 leukemia cells treated with the enzyme under similar conditions. Scanning electron microscopy revealed significant damage to sarcoma 180 cells exposed to phospholipase C in Fischer's medium, which was characterized by alterations in size and shape of cells, disappearance of microvilli, and appearance of fistulas in cell membranes; relatively resistant L1210 leukemic cells did not appear to be markedly damaged by comparable enzyme treatment. Exposure of leukemia L1210 cells to phospholipase C in Puck's saline A increased the sensitivity of these cells to enzymatic action. Under these conditions, a comparable amount of phospholipid was hydrolyzed from surface membranes of sarcoma 180 and leukemia L1210 cells, and the degree of membrane damage appeared to be similar, as measured by the capacity of the tumor cell lines to exclude Trypan Blue and by scanning electron microscopy. The extensive damage to membranes by hydrolysis of phospholipids was not accompanied by a change in the degree of specific binding of [3H]concanavalin A(ConA).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Lee, M H', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Lee MH', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Drug Deliv,Cancer drug delivery,8409965,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line', 'Choline/metabolism', 'Clostridium/*enzymology', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy', 'Type C Phospholipases/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cdd.1983.1.21 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Drug Deliv. 1983;1(1):21-36. doi: 10.1089/cdd.1983.1.21.,,,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

When Sendai virus was irradiated with UV-light for 300 sec, its abilities to infect chicken eggs and induce IFN were diminished, but its HA activity was unaffected. HANA spikes exposed on L-HVJ could not induce IFN in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, although they induced IFN in mouse spleen cells. These results suggest that the induction of IFN in human lymphoblastoid cells is closely related to viral nucleic acid. Poly I: C also induced IFN in some human lymphoblastoid cell lines in which IFN production is induced by Sendai virus. The antigenic types of IFN induced by poly I: C were the same as those induced by Sendai virus.

From this, it is clear that we have only begun to appreciate the biologic diversity, the geographic distribution, and the disease spectrum of this family of human T-lymphotropic retroviruses which we collectively term HTLV. At a basic level, HTLV provides a unique opportunity to study in vitro and in vivo mechanisms of cell transformation. Given its close association with adult T-cell leukemia and its ability to efficiently immortalize primary cells in vitro, we believe that HTLV will very likely harbor clues to the biology of cell growth, differentiation, and transformation. At a more clinical level, the close association between HTLV and a malignancy of clonally expanded (HTLV-containing) mature T-cells argues strongly for a causal relationship, although the mechanism for such is currently unknown. It is likely that further study of the molecular and cellular biology of this virus will bring together these basic and clinical findings and elucidate, at least in part, one mechanism for human leukemogenesis. From a more speculative viewpoint, the role of HTLV in the pathogenesis of human disease appears even broader. As discussed in this chapter, there are indications that all subtypes of HTLV may produce immunosuppression both in vitro and in vivo, and there is now exciting new data to suggest that a novel member of this family of viruses, HTLV-III, is causally linked to the AIDS syndrome. Moreover, the possibility has been raised that the immunosuppressive properties of HTLV could predispose patients to non-T-cell malignancies as occurs in patients with AIDS or chemically induced immunosuppression. Finally, by employing the experimental strategies which were successful in isolating HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-III, it may be possible in the future to identify still other human retroviruses.","['Shaw, G M', 'Broder, S', 'Essex, M', 'Gallo, R C']","['Shaw GM', 'Broder S', 'Essex M', 'Gallo RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Adv Intern Med,Advances in internal medicine,0370427,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/microbiology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', '*Deltaretrovirus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Interleukin-2/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia/immunology/*microbiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/immunology/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Adv Intern Med. 1984;30:1-27.,,,,,105,,,,,,,

A variety of agents, among them HMBA and Me2SO, induce MELC to terminal differentiation and expression of characteristics similar to that associated with normal erythropoiesis. During inducer-mediated terminal differentiation, modulation of expression of a number of genes occurs. Studies to date have characterized inducer-mediated alterations in chromatin structure associated with activation of alpha and beta maj globin genes. Inducer-mediated MELC terminal cell division is also associated with a decrease in the synthesis of the nuclear protein p53, a protein that has been implicated as a requirement for the progression from G1 to S in the cell cycle.

It is concluded that the apparently conflicting results using inhibitors of ADP-ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) can be explained by a working hypothesis. This hypothesis maintains that poly (ADP-ribose) is required for repair of radiation damage (presumably to facilitate ligation). In most cells the synthesis of poly (ADP-ribose) is not rate limiting for repair and therefore, an almost complete inhibition of ADPRT activity is required to potentiate the radiation response. In radiation-sensitive cells (e.g. resting lymphocytes, L5178Y-S cells) with a deficient poly (ADP-ribose) metabolism, its synthesis can become rate limiting for repair. In such cells even a partial inhibition of ADPRT activity may enhance radiation-induced cell killing. It is suggested that if such differences exist between normal and cancer cells, they can be utilized to improve the therapeutic ratio of radiotherapy.","['Ben-Hur, E']",['Ben-Hur E'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med,"International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine",0374725,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '26656-46-2 (Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '6X80438640 (benzamide)', '8J365YF1YH (3-aminobenzamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Nucleotidyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Bleomycin/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/*radiation effects', '*DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L5178/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Diphosphate Sugars/*metabolism', 'Nucleotidyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Poly Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553008414551891 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. 1984 Dec;46(6):659-71. doi: 10.1080/09553008414551891.,,,,,79,,,,,,,

They subsequently identified p35 to be the human homologue of murine Ii, an electrophoretically invariant protein associated with Ia molecules. Using related analytical techniques, we have studied leukemic cells of two blood and one splenic samples from three Japanese patients with hairy cell leukemia and have demonstrated abundance of p35 in the splenic and one of the blood samples. The second blood sample was negative for p35 by our method of analysis, but the same hairy cells became positive for p35 at 2 months in culture and negative again at 4 months in culture. All 3 samples of this patient (fresh hairy cells and cultured cells at 2 and 4 months) remained consistently positive for Ia and for light chain-restricted immunoglobulin. Control cells from one each of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and Burkitt's lymphoma were negative for abundant p35 expression after culture as well as in the fresh state. One can conclude that the Japanese form of hairy cell leukemia, while varying in several distinct clinical and laboratory features from hairy cell leukemia in caucasians, is characterized also by abundant expression of p35 as seen in a subset of white patients. In addition, this expression of p35 is developed by hairy leukemic cells in culture initially but is lost upon longer term culture, in parallel with the level of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase reactivity.","['Shibuya, A', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Sagawa, K', 'Katayama, I']","['Shibuya A', 'Matsuo Y', 'Sagawa K', 'Katayama I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (hairy cell leukemia antigen p35, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Staining and Labeling']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900020405 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1984 Oct-Dec;2(4):359-64. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900020405.,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the course of these investigations it was observed that DAC given as a single dose to mice bearing late L1210 tumor resulted in cell kills estimated to be close to 6 logs. Because of the potentially large antigen load released by such a cell kill, the immune modulator pyran copolymer was also tested in combination with DAC. Thymidine increased the cytotoxicity of DAC but not in a selective fashion. Doses of DAC in combination with thymidine were more toxic to host mice than equivalent doses of DAC alone, but no therapeutic benefit was apparent with this combination at maximally tolerated doses. A single dose of pyran copolymer and DAC appears to result in an adjuvant action that eliminates the few remaining L1210 cells refractory to DAC chemotherapy.

Under these circumstances plasma beta TG, but not PF4 or TSP, levels are elevated because of impaired renal catabolism, and the presence of a heparin-releasable reservoir of PF4 on the endothelium complicates the use of the PF4 assay.

They include structural haemoglobin variants, thalassaemias, which are conditions in which there is a reduced rate of globin chain production, and hereditary persistence of foetal haemoglobin (HPFH) in which there is an inherited abnormality in the switch from foetal to adult haemoglobin synthesis. The thalassaemias result from a diverse series of cis acting lesions of the globin genes which include deletions, insertions, frame shift mutations, and point mutations involving transcription, messenger RNA processing, initiation, termination, poly A addition and globin chain stability. Many forms of HPFH are due to deletions of the beta-like gene cluster; it has been suggested that they may involve regions of the cluster which are involved in the regulation of the foetal to adult globin chain switch. So far, however, no regions of this type have been identified with certainty. The varieties of HPFH not associated with major gene deletions, or those caused by genetic determinants that are not linked to the globin gene clusters, and some of the acquired forms of alpha thalassaemia associated with mental retardation or leukaemia, may be more useful models for studying the regulation of the globin genes, particularly their developmental control.","['Weatherall, D J', 'Higgs, D H', 'Wood, W G', 'Clegg, J B']","['Weatherall DJ', 'Higgs DH', 'Wood WG', 'Clegg JB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

We have investigated the expression of this antigen with six different well-characterized murine IgM MoAbs on normal, leukaemic, and cultured cells by immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscope cytochemistry. The cells were studied before and after neuraminidase treatment since epitopes recognized by these MoAbs may be masked by sialic acid. Among the recognizable normal marrow or blood cells, all these MoAbs specifically labelled the granulocytic lineage from the promyelocyte to the polymorph. After neuraminidase treatment, monocytes became labelled. All the other lineages remained unstained. Several cell lines were studied. Six of eight lymphoblastoid cell lines were stained by these MoABs; reactivity was increased by neuraminidase. One Burkitt cell line and two T cell lines were also found to be positive. These antibodies were tested on leukaemic cells. In acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia they usually labelled promyelocytes, more mature granulocytic and monocytic precursors but did not label myeloblasts; after neuraminidase treatment, these myeloblasts became stained. No labelling was observed on leukaemic proerythroblasts and promegakaryoblast before and after neuraminidase treatment except in one case of promegakaryoblastic leukaemia in which the SSEA-I antigen and platelet peroxidase were expressed in the same cell. In addition, six cases of common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were studied; the blasts became positive after desialylation. Two examples of T cell acute leukaemia were essentially negative. We conclude, therefore, that the reactivity of haemopoietic cells with these MoAbs alone does not represent a criterion sufficient to sustain their myeloid origin since the SSEA-I antigen may be expressed at the surface of all cell lineages in the early phases of haemopoietic differentiation.","['Tabilio, A', 'Del Canizo, M C', 'Henri, A', 'Guichard, J', 'Mannoni, P', 'Civin, C I', 'Testa, U', 'Rochant, H', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Breton-Gorius, J']","['Tabilio A', 'Del Canizo MC', 'Henri A', 'Guichard J', 'Mannoni P', 'Civin CI', 'Testa U', 'Rochant H', 'Vainchenker W', 'Breton-Gorius J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Glycolipids/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Oligosaccharides/*analysis']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb06117.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 Dec;58(4):697-710. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb06117.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV) is a human lymphotropic retrovirus isolated from patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or related syndromes, that displays selective tropism for a subset of T lymphocytes defined by the expression of a surface glycoprotein of relative molecular mass 62,000 (62K) termed T4 (refs 6-8). This glycoprotein delineates a subset of T lymphocytes with mainly helper/inducer functions, while T lymphocytes of the reciprocal subset express a glycoprotein termed T8, have mainly cytotoxic/suppressor activities, and are unable to replicate LAV. Such a tropism may be controlled at the genomic level by regulatory sequences, as described for the human T-cell leukaemia viruses HTLV-I and -II (refs 2, 3). Alternatively or concomitantly, productive cell infection may be controlled at the membrane level, requiring the interaction of a specific cellular receptor with the virus envelope, as demonstrated recently for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Therefore, we have investigated whether the T4 molecule itself is related to the receptor for LAV. We report here that preincubation of T4+ lymphocytes with three individual monoclonal antibodies directed at the T4 glycoprotein blocked cell infection by LAV. This blocking effect was specific, as other monoclonal antibodies--such as antibody to histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA) class II or anti-T-cell natural killer (TNK) target--directed at other surface structures strongly expressed on activated cultured T4+ cells, did not prevent LAV infection. Direct virus neutralization by monoclonal antibodies was also ruled out. These results strongly support the view that a surface molecule directly involved in cellular functions acts as, or is related to, the receptor for a human retrovirus.","['Klatzmann, D', 'Champagne, E', 'Chamaret, S', 'Gruest, J', 'Guetard, D', 'Hercend, T', 'Gluckman, J C', 'Montagnier, L']","['Klatzmann D', 'Champagne E', 'Chamaret S', 'Gruest J', 'Guetard D', 'Hercend T', 'Gluckman JC', 'Montagnier L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Glycoproteins/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Retroviridae/immunology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology']",1984/12/20 00:00,1984/12/20 00:01,['1984/12/20 00:00'],"['1984/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/312767a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Dec 20-1985 Jan 2;312(5996):767-8. doi: 10.1038/312767a0.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane immunofluorescence assay showed that HIEI, like the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, reacted preferentially with activated normal human T-cells and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) virus (ATLV)-carrying human T- and B-cell lines. However, an interesting difference between HIEI and anti-Tac antibody was that HIEI did not react with ATLV-transformed simian cell lines or those cultured with interleukin-2 (IL-2), whereas the anti-Tac antibody did. The immunoprecipitation assay showed that both HIEI and anti-Tac antibody precipitated a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 60,000 daltons (gp60) from activated normal T-cells and ATLV-positive T- and B-cells, and also gp53 from MT-2 and MT-2-related T-cell lines transformed with ATLV in vitro by the MT-2 cocultivation method. HIEI inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferation of normal T-cells, but its inhibitory effect was much weaker than that of the anti-Tac antibody. The anti-Tac antibody interfered with the binding of HIEI to target cells, but HIEI did not block binding of the anti-Tac antibody to the cells.

The estimates of rates of cell progress showed that the rates from G(1) to S and from G(2) to M were affected in the early stationary phase. The main cause of cessation of increase in cell number in the early stationary phase is resulted from the decline in mitotic index, which is caused by prolongation of the G(2) period.

Preliminary data for 1955-59 suggest that the upward trend is leveling off. A smaller absolute increase in five-year survival rates occurred among patients with lymphomas and leukemia.

Using available therapeutic agents, complete clinical and hematological remission can be achieved regularly in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The choice of chemotherapeutic agent, management of complications of hemorrhage and infection, and recognition of prognostic factors are important for the induction of a hematological remission. While patients in complete hematological remission are free of evidence of disease they still have residual leukemic cells, but in our present state of knowledge and with available techniques, we are unable to detect these. For this reason it is important to treat patients while in remission. The importance of dosage schedule for remission maintenance chemotherapy is stressed.In patients studied to date, regardless of the treatment used, the disease has recurred eventually. Available therapeutic agents are highly effective and highly selective, but they still fall short of providing ideal control of the disease. The continuing search for new chemotherapeutic agents is aided by the knowledge gained and techniques developed with current agents.","['Freireich, E J']",['Freireich EJ'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Can Med Assoc J,Canadian Medical Association journal,0414110,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', '*Infections/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/*administration & dosage', '*Prognosis', 'Uric Acid/urine', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage']",1967/06/24 00:00,1967/06/24 00:01,['1967/06/24 00:00'],"['1967/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1967/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1967/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can Med Assoc J. 1967 Jun 24;96(25):1605-10.,,PMC1923083,,,,,,,,,,

In the past 10 years, freezing techniques have opened new avenues in this field; it is now possible to store blood for periods of five years or more. Several techniques have been developed, either using liquid nitrogen and the rapid-freezing principle or using ""cryophylactic agents"" such as glycerol, where the rate of freezing is unimportant and the blood is kept at -85 degrees C. The latter methods require washing of the blood before transfusion to remove the intracellular glycerol and thus avoid post-transfusion osmotic hemolysis. At the National Defence Medical Centre in Ottawa, the Huggins' technique of freeze-preservation of blood has been adopted. This novel method of deglycerolization is based on the ""reversible agglomeration"" of erythrocytes in electrolyte-free sugar solutions. The in vitro and in vivo studies have yielded satisfactory results, and certain applications of the method are discussed.","['Perrault, R', 'Jackson, J R', 'Martin-Villar, J', 'Smiley, R K']","['Perrault R', 'Jackson JR', 'Martin-Villar J', 'Smiley RK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Can Med Assoc J,Canadian Medical Association journal,0414110,['PDC6A3C0OX (Glycerol)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/therapy', '*Blood Preservation', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Female', '*Freezing', 'Glycerol', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Preoperative Care']",1967/06/10 00:00,1967/06/10 00:01,['1967/06/10 00:00'],"['1967/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1967/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1967/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can Med Assoc J. 1967 Jun 10;96(23):1504-9.,,PMC1923033,,,,,,,,,,

H-2 and TL. 1, 2, 3 activities were measured by inhibition of the cytotoxic effect of the corresponding isoantibodies. TL activity was associated with the H-2 active fraction obtained by solubilization and fractionation by gel filtration. TL specificity was largely separated from H-2 antigen by subsequent chromatography on DEAE Sephadex as an adjacent component in a series of fractions. The soluble H-2 antigen prepared from the leukemia cells was tested for most of the specificities determined by H-2(a) with no exceptional results. TL. 1, 2, 3 activities, measured as each component separately, were located in approximately the same position; there is no clear indication yet whether the three TL specificities are separable from one another.
