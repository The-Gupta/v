Thirteen ANLL and 9 ALL patients were followed until relapse and during reinduction therapy. T- and B-cells were detected by specific membrane marker. The pre- and posttreatment pattern of lymphocyte subpopulations was analyzed to determine their prognostic significance for remission incidence, remission duration, and survival. It was observed that in both types of leukemia, T-cells are more affected by the leukemic process and cytostatic drugs than B-cells. Nonresponding patients possibly have a reduced potential for recruiting precursor T- and B-cells. At first diagnosis, no significant correlation was found between pre- or posttreatment variables and prognosis. At relapse, ANLL patients had a longer second remission when a high proportion of B-cells was found; ALL patients with a high lymphocyte count before and after treatment, experienced longer survival.","['Jehn, U', 'Wachholz, K', 'Kern, D', 'Holzel, D']","['Jehn U', 'Wachholz K', 'Kern D', 'Holzel D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes, Null/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950110207 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1983;11(2):106-15. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950110207.,,,,,,,

Activity against all three targets was found in Percoll gradient fractions enriched for large granular lymphocytes, which suggests that these effector cells have a common morphology. In competition studies between 51Cr-labeled targets and unlabeled targets, both the infected and the uninfected fibroblasts competed for lysis of NK(HSV-1) and NK(FS) activity, whereas K562 cells competed poorly. In contrast, when 51Cr-labeled K562 cells were used, the unlabeled K562 cells competed well, but HSV-1-infected and uninfected fibroblasts competed poorly. Panning studies and complement elimination experiments using monoclonal antibodies were performed to describe cell surface markers on the NK cell populations. Treatment with an antibody to an la framework antigen reduced NK(HSV-1) but not NK(K562) activity. In contrast, the majority of NK(K562) effectors were recognized by antibodies to the E-rosette receptor (Lyt-3 and OKT11A), whereas NK(HSV-1) activity was much less sensitive to this antibody. OKM1, OKT10, and Leu-7 (HNK-1) markers were found on a portion, but not all, of the cells that lysed both the HSV-FS and K562 targets, while treatment with HLA plus complement totally abrogated both NK activities. Taken together, these data are consistent with the concept that human NK cells are heterogeneous and that we are dealing with at least three subpopulations of effector cells--one that kills the infected or uninfected fibroblasts; one that kills K562 cells; and a third population that may be able to kill all three targets. Patient studies provide additional evidence for heterogeneity within the NK cells that lyse the fibroblasts and K562 cells. We have studied a number of individuals who have normal NK activity with one target (HSV-FS or K562) but have low or no activity against the other.

It is expressed only in the thymus and in some bone marrow cells, suggesting that it acts selectively in immature lymphoid cells, especially T cells. We investigated the extent to which de novo synthesis of TdT is correlated with the clonal expansion that T cell precursors undergo in the thymus. Using biosynthetic pulse-labeling and immune precipitation, we found that thymocytes from late-fetal and neonatal mice make TdT at considerably lower levels than weanling or adult mouse thymocytes. Adult levels of TdT synthesis are only reached a week after birth. Thus, the high proportion of proliferating cells in the perinatal thymus does not entail a correspondingly high production' of TdT synthesis is blocked by cytolytic treatment with anti-Lyt-2 and complement, suggesting that the inducible cells are already Lyt-2+ like most adult TdT+ thymocytes. These observations imply that the stroma of the perinatal thymus either suppresses or fails to trigger high-level TdT synthesis. At the same time, it is in this microenvironment that maximum proliferation and export of functional T cell precursors take place. In contrast, the conditions that stimulate high TdT synthesis in vitro are not associated with mitogenesis but rather with growth arrest. High-level TdT synthesis in general is not regulated so as to precede or coincide with clonal expansion, either in perinatal or in adult thymocyte populations. The possibility remains that in many cells it is linked with a commitment to die.","['Rothenberg, E', 'Triglia, D']","['Rothenberg E', 'Triglia D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peanut Agglutinin)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['*Aging', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Clone Cells/enzymology/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Isoantigens/analysis', 'Lectins/immunology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Peanut Agglutinin', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/enzymology/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*embryology/immunology']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Apr;130(4):1627-33.,"['AI 16769/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 19752/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31667/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

SAK cells were fused with a receptor-defective (and therefore resistant) variant of a well-characterized murine thymoma line, W7. The resulting hybrids are glucocorticoid sensitive, demonstrating complementation of the receptor defect in W7 cells by the functional glucocorticoid receptor of SAK. This fusion shows that SAK cells are resistant to the hormone due to the absence of another function designated ""I"" for lysis. SAK cells were also fused with glucocorticoid-sensitive W7 cells (containing wild-type receptor), generating glucocorticoid-sensitive hybrids, which demonstrate that the dexamethasone-resistant phenotype of the SAK cells is recessive. Resistant derivatives of this hybrid were found which still contain the full amount of receptor. Chromosome analysis revealed that, on the average, the resistant derivatives had lost two chromosomes, suggesting segregation of chromosomes carrying genetic material necessary for the ""lysis"" function.

This phenomenon was studied with B6(H-2b) responder cells and a series of H-2Kb-mutant responder cells. Thus, B6 Moloney-specific CTL lysed noninfected Kb-mutant cells, but not B6 cells, whereas Kb-mutant Moloney-specific CTL lysed noninfected B6 cells and not noninfected cells of the same mutant. Cold-target-inhibition studies showed that the CTL reactions against different allogeneic cells were mediated by different subpopulations of virus-specific CTL: lysis of allogeneic target cells was fully inhibited only by the same allogeneic and by syngeneic virus-infected cells, but not by another allogeneic cell, also lysed by the same effector-cell population. Lysis of syngeneic virus-infected cells could not be inhibited by allogeneic target cells. These data imply that a minority of virus-specific CTL shows cross-reactivity with a given allogeneic target cell. It is concluded that limited amino acid substitutions in the Kb molecule alter the repertoire of Moloney virus-specific CTL, as reflected in alloreactive CTL populations, even though the virus-specific CTL response of B6 and all Kb mutants is mainly Db-restricted.

It is shown that the murine antigen recognized by W6/32.1 is on an H-2-like molecule which also carries the determinant recognized by the monoclonal antibody B22-249 R1, specific for the H-2Db antigen. Unlike B22-249 R1, however, W6/32.1 does not bind to normal H-2b lymphocytes, nor to a variety of tumor cell lines of the H-2b haplotype. This cross-reaction is specific to W6/32.1, and is not shared by other monoclonal antibodies of similar anti-HLA specificities. Moreover, the affinity of W6/32.1 for its human antigen is substantially higher than for its mouse antigen.

This activity was correlated with ability to support leukemia colony growth in methylcellulose, and [3H]thymidine incorporation in liquid culture by normal bone marrow cells, leukemia cells, and the KG-1 myeloid leukemia cell line. For normal cells, growth and liquid culture responses were highly correlated for various sources of CSA (r = 0.92), and addition of data using PHA-LCM changed results only slightly (r = 0.89). [3H]thymidine incorporation by leukemia cells from patients without a prior history of a myeloproliferative disorder was also highly correlated with normal CSA (r = 0.97) for sources other than PHA-LCM. Responses of leukemia blasts and KG-1 cells in liquid culture to PHA-LCM appeared in excess of its CSA for normal cells. Colony growth by leukemia cells was not clearly correlated with either liquid culture activity for leukemia cells or CSA for normal cells. PHA-LCM was also not statistically superior to placenta-conditioned medium as stimulus for leukemia colony growth, but was superior to placenta-conditioned medium for some patients. Differentiation in culture did not appear to depend on CSA source. We conclude that normal myeloid cells respond to CSA in a highly correlated fashion in both colony and liquid cultures. The majority of myeloid leukemia cells respond to either PHA-LCM or CSA, but the ability of PHA-LCM to support leukemia cell growth is greater than its CSA content.

IL-2 is a powerful factor controlling proliferation of normal T cells. We report that acute lymphoblastic leukemias of T and non-B, non-T phenotypes produce a growth factor after mitogen stimulation. This factor is able to support the proliferation of human and murine IL-2-dependent cytotoxic cells, has a mol wt of 26,000 daltons by gel filtration, an isoelectric point of 6.6, and its biologic activity is inhibited by an anti IL-2 monoclonal antibody. This factor is, therefore, by all parameters studied very similar to IL-2 produced by normal lymphocytes. A recently developed monoclonal antibody, Pan T2, binds to normal T cells, renders T cells responsive to IL-2, and induces the release of IL-2, which in turn provides the second signal for T-cell proliferation. Mononuclear cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia do not respond to the addition of this monoclonal antibody unless cocultured with irradiated Daudi cells. Since normal T cells do not require Daudi to produce IL-2 and since Daudi cells do not produce IL-2 under any conditions, we conclude that the cell responsible for IL-2 production in acute lymphatic leukemia is a leukemic T cell with an altered mechanism of IL-2 production at the level of the Pan T2 binding site.","['Venuta, S', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Welte, K', 'Feldman, S P', 'Wang, C Y', 'Moore, M A']","['Venuta S', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Welte K', 'Feldman SP', 'Wang CY', 'Moore MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1983/04/01 00:00,1983/04/01 00:01,['1983/04/01 00:00'],"['1983/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85640-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1983 Apr;61(4):781-9.,"['A1-18321-01/PHS HHS/United States', 'P01-CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This antibody was generated by using a human leukemia antigen preparation isolated from cell membranes of MOLT-4, a leukemia T-cell line derived from a patient with T-cell-type acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). SN1 was characterized by a sensitive microscale radioimmunoassay using a variety of cultured and uncultured human cells. In selected cases, the cell specimens were further tested by immunoperoxidase staining and an immunofluorescence staining test. The results of the radioimmunoassay were in agreement with those of the two other tests. Among the various cultured malignant and nonmalignant cell lines, SN1 reacted only with leukemia T-cell lines derived from patients with T-ALL; it reacted with all six T-ALL cell lines tested-i.e., JM, CCRF-CEM, CCRF-H-SB2, RPMI 8402, PEER, and MOLT-4.

SN1 did not react with any normal human cell specimens tested, both cultured and uncultured. These specimens include normal lymphoblastoid cell lines, thymocytes, bone marrow cells, spleen cells, lymph node cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymphocytes containing B and T cells, purified T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets. Furthermore, SN1 did not react with phytohemagglutinin-activated T cells nor with concanavalin A-activated T cells. The results show that monoclonal antibody SN1 defines a type of human leukemia antigen that is expressed on the cell surface of T-cell-type ALL cells. The results further show the usefulness of SN1 in the diagnosis of cancer patients and suggest its therapeutic potential.

The subtype can be recognized by light and by electron microscopic investigation. Cytochemistry (APh and ANAE) may be helpful to delimit T-CLL from B-CLL, and acid phosphatase to recognize the subtype characterized by abundant cytoplasm and granules. Membrane marker investigations support the diagnosis of T-type CLL. When functional properties of the leukemic cells were tested, cells of one patient (T-PLL) were shown to help in B-lymphocyte differentiation and Ig-secretion, whilst the cells of a second patient (lymphocytic, abundant cytoplasm and granules) were proven to act as effectors in natural killing and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity. The T-helper lymphocyte nature of some of the leukemic cells was supported by demonstration of the Fc mu-receptor in three cases. In one of these patients, monoclonal IgM was detected in the serum.

Several viral transforming proteins, including the src protein of Rous sarcoma virus, the p120 protein of Abelson leukaemia virus and the middle T antigen of polyoma virus, are phosphorylated by associated tyrosine kinases. The levels of kinase activity correlate with the transforming efficiency of the virus. The receptors for epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin are also phosphorylated by associated tyrosine kinase activities, which are stimulated by EGF, PDGF and insulin, respectively. The EGF-stimulated kinase and the src protein share similar substrate specificity for tyrosines immediately C-terminal to a sequence of acidic amino acids. Such a sequence is also found adjacent to the phosphotyrosine of middle T antigen, and in the homologous region of the hormone gastrin, adjacent to a tyrosine which is sulphated in approximately half the gastrin isolated from gastric mucosa. Reports that gastrin acts as a growth factor for cells of the gastrointestinal tract suggested that phosphorylation of this tyrosine might be physiologically more relevant than sulphation.

Thirteen of the cell lines were of the T-lymphoid type, 15 B-derived, and eight were defined as non-B non-T in nature. All the lines derived from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had similar surface topographies and generally displayed relatively smooth surfaces with few microvilli, while in some a proportion of moderately villous cells was evident. Burkitt's lymphoma cells tended to show more villous surfaces but, similar to circulating B-ALL cells, variable numbers of microvilli were frequently seen making consistent distinctions between this and other lymphoid leukemias difficult in individual cases. Two of the non-B non-T lines are known to be of erythroid (K-562) and myeloid origin (HL-60), respectively.

Antibodies that identify B cells (BA-1 and anti-B1) and leukemia-associated antigens (BA-2, BA-3, and J5) reacted with renal glomerular and tubular epithelium at characteristic stages of nephron development. BA-1 and BA-2 identified primitive epithelium of the glomerulus, and ureteral bud and nephron development was characterized by loss of BA-1 and BA-2 binding by visceral glomerular and proximal tubular epithelium. In contrast, J5 and BA-3 did not react with primitive epithelium but identified visceral and proximal tubular epithelium after appearance of the glomerular basement membrane and throughout subsequent nephron differentiation. Anti-B1 reacted with ureteral bud and distal nephron epithelium in more mature fetal tissues. Monoclonal antibodies that identify populations of T cells and thymocytes did not react with parenchymal cells of fetal or adult kidneys. They did identify interstitial mononuclear cells whose size and relative numbers appeared gestationally related. Monoclonal antibodies that recognize a human monomorphic HLA-DR determinant reacted with glomerular and peritubular capillaries as early as 11 wk of gestation. The distribution and density of HLA-DR expression appeared more related to gestation than nephron development. The relationship between renal parenchymal expression of lymphohemopoietic antigens and glomerular acquisition of C3b receptor activity was determined using C3b-coated fluoresceinated Escherichia coli. In fetal tissues, C3b receptor activity appeared developmentally related to the loss of determinants recognized by BA-1 and BA-2 and to the appearance of J5 and BA-3 reactivity with visceral glomerular epithelium.

As tumor cells appeared in the blood, anti-idiotype was consumed, but the cells displayed little or no surface Ig and could not be killed in vitro by anti-idiotype and C. However, as serum antibody levels fell, the cells displayed increasing amounts of surface IgM lambda of the same idiotype and regained their susceptibility to the antibody and C in vitro.

It is hoped that they are a useful addition to the presently available relatively small panel of well studied myeloid surface markers which are displayed by immature malignant blast cells.,"['Knapp, W', 'Majdic, O', 'Stockinger, H', 'Bettelheim, P', 'Liszka, K', 'Koller, U', 'Peschel, C']","['Knapp W', 'Majdic O', 'Stockinger H', 'Bettelheim P', 'Liszka K', 'Koller U', 'Peschel C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02934532 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1984;1(4):257-62. doi: 10.1007/BF02934532.,,,,,,,

The time of CT-scan examination varied from 1 year and 1 month to 10 years and 1 month after diagnosis of ALL. The age of the children ranged from 3 years and 11 months to 14 years and 5 months. Six children had normal CT scans, 12 children had slight atrophy-like changes, and nine had severe cerebral atrophy. Two patients in the latter group presented an enlarged ventricular system as well. In one patient intracerebral calcification was the only pathologic finding. The severe changes were seen in children of all age groups, but predominantly in children with a short duration of their disease, severe symptoms, and frequent marrow relapse. Changes induced by steroid therapy may be reversible. No satisfactory explanation of the demonstrated cerebral pathologic findings can be given, except that they are the consequences of the combination of total therapy and severity of disease in the individual patient. Measurement of attenuation coefficients in grey and white matter shows increasing values with age during childhood. A combination of decreasing attenuation coefficients, especially in the white matter, and the finding of severe atrophy seems to be a bad prognostic sign.","['Lund, E', 'Hamborg-Pedersen, B']","['Lund E', 'Hamborg-Pedersen B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Neuroradiology,Neuroradiology,1302751,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain/*diagnostic imaging/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*prevention & control', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00327486 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuroradiology. 1984;26(5):351-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00327486.,,,,,,,

The biological and epidemiological features of leukaemia subtypes were determined in 146 patients who were seen prospectively between July 1978 and June 1982. There were 44 cases of chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML), 34 of ALL, 33 of AML and 31 of CLL. The age distribution and incidence of CML in Ibadan was similar to those of the Black and White populations of the United States. The incidence of ALL in 0-4 year-old Ibadan children was estimated to be less than one-third and one-tenth of those of Black and White children in the United States, respectively, but the incidence of the disease was similar for the 3 populations in the third quinquennium. AML appeared to be more prevalent in 5-9-year-old Nigerian children than in children in the United States and was associated with chloroma in 5 of 9 (55.6%) children in the age-group. As a group, children with ALL were of significantly higher socio-economic status than those with AML. CLL occurred below 50 years predominantly in women (male:female = 1:6) who were significantly of lower socioeconomic status than their CML counterparts. Male patients predominated (male:female = 5.3) at and above 50 years. Numerous factors indicating a poor prognosis co-existed in all ALL patients, including male sex (25/34), WBC greater than 10(10)/litre (31/34, greater than 10(11)/litre (10/34), L2 or L3 morphology (21/25), periodic acid Schiff (PAS) negativity (15/19) and tissue invasion (15/34), thus giving the impression that ALL in young Nigerians is predominantly of an aggressive and hyperproliferative type. The epidemiological features of ALL and CLL in Africans suggest a role for the influence of life-style in leukaemogenesis while the clinical patterns of these disorders suggest that the biological characteristics differ from those of similar diseases in developed countries.","['Williams, C K']",['Williams CK'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nigeria', 'Prospective Studies']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1984;(63):687-712.,,,,,,,

Following the first report by Ludwig Gross in 1951 of the transmission of mouse leukaemia by cell-free filtrates inoculated into newborn mice and the subsequent identification of many tumour-inducing type-C viruses in animals, attention was focused on the RNA retroviruses. However, it was work in Africa which led to the recognition of Burkitt's lymphoma as an entity and to the discovery of the Epstein-Barr virus. Many refer to this DNA virus as the first recognized human tumour virus. The research that these early studies stimulated has resulted in enormous progress in our understanding of human carcinogenesis and in highly significant advances in therapy. More recently, the first human retrovirus was identified and characterized in the laboratory of Dr Robert Gallo. There is increasing evidence that this virus, isolated from a patient with a T-cell lymphoma, is etiologically associated with a specific type of T-cell neoplasm first described in Japan. Africa may be considered the cradle of geographical pathology and the potential for generating unique information on cancer etiology and cancer control is still enormous. Lymphoid neoplasms are excellent models for the study of human cancer, particularly in Africa, since as tumours of the immune system, their induction and evolution is strongly influenced by those environmental factors, such as infection and nutrition, which have a profound effect on the immune response. In addition, there is good evidence that at least some of the tumours in this group are associated with specific transforming viruses. There is an immediate need to collect accurate, reproducible and comparable data on the incidence and characteristics of the different types of lymphoid neoplasia and on the populations in which they occur in the various African countries. Such data will provide the basis for undertaking simultaneous or subsequent etiological and therapeutic studies. Realistic approaches to these goals are considered and specific studies relating to questions posed by available information discussed.","[""O'Conor, G T""]","[""O'Conor GT""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Middle Aged']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1984;(63):629-46.,,,,,,,

This factor, phorbol ester binding inhibitory factor (PEBIF), is sensitive to pepsin, but resistant to trypsin, heat and acid (pH 3) treatments and can be precipitated by 80% ethanol with no loss of activity. Inhibition occurs both at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C and is rapid and reversible. Inhibition on human epithelial cells (FL), on mouse erythroleukaemia cells (FELC clone 19-10) and on rat liver cells (IAR clone 6-1 and clone 20) is non-competitive, whereas on IAR clone 6 and clone 6-7 it is competitive. Differentiation of FELC induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) can be inhibited by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) only if TPA-sensitive cells are used, and no inhibition was observed with TPA-resistant cells. PEBIF can also inhibit the differentiation induced by HMBA of TPA-sensitive cells and has no effect on the differentiation of TPA-resistant cells. The extent of inhibition of PDBu binding by PEBIF was similar in these two clones. Like TPA, PEBIF can increase 2-deoxyglucose uptake in mouse fibroblasts (BALB/3T3 cells). Thus, TPA and PEBIF share two biological responses; however, PEBIF failed to mimic other TPA effects, such as induction of Epstein-Barr virus from Raji cells, inhibition of intercellular communication and induction of differentiation of human promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL-60).","['Hamel, E', 'Yamasaki, H', 'Tayot, J L']","['Hamel E', 'Yamasaki H', 'Tayot JL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', 'Epithelium/metabolism', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phorbol Esters/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phorbols/*metabolism', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*isolation & purification/pharmacology/physiology', '*Protein Kinase C', 'Rats', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1984;(56):157-64.,,,,,,,

The incorporation was inhibited 85-97% by 20 micrograms/ml actinomycin D and the reaction product was completely hydrolyzed by 0.1 M KOH. UMP incorporation was nearly linear for 60 min at 23 degrees C; however, at 37 degrees C it ceased after 15-20 min of rapid incorporation. The inhibition of UMP incorporation by 2 micrograms/ml alpha-amanitin was much greater at 23 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. The molecular weight of the RNA synthesized in permeabilized cells is broadly distributed with about 83% larger than 18 S. In vitro transcription of the mouse beta-major globin gene was studied by hybridizing 32P-labeled nascent RNA to filter-bound DNA sequences representing this gene and its flanking regions. After induction by hexamethylene-bisacetamide, Friend cells exhibited more than fivefold increases in the rate of transcription for the beta-major globin gene as compared to the uninduced control cells. Induction also caused an increase in the transcription rate of the 3'-flanking region located downstream from the poly(A) addition site. Thus, the primary transcription unit of beta-major globin gene is essentially the same in permeabilized cells as that previously reported for nuclei isolated from the same cell line.

Simultaneously, three granulocyte functions, i.e. capillary tube random migration, particle ingestion activity and nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction were studied. This investigation was carried out in 47 patients presenting with chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD): chronic granulocytic leukemia (18 cases), polycythemia vera (18 cases), myelofibrosis (6 cases) and essential thrombocythemia (5 cases). The results of the present study indicate that functional abnormalities are more frequent and more strongly marked in platelets than in phagocytes.

As a first step in the application of this model, experiments were designed to determine the relative contribution of some of the component terms to the value of KappM. Methods were developed that allow for experimental determination of the rate constants for both lytic programming and killer-cell-independent lysis (KCIL) steps in the cytolytic process. The results obtained support lytic programming as the rate-determining step in natural cytotoxicity reactions and demonstrate that terms related to nonlytic target-binding lymphocytes contribute significantly to experimentally determined values for KappM.

Matrix-associated DNA was obtained by two methods, differing in the order of treatment of the nuclei with high salt and DNase I. By using a cloned alpha-globin probe, no enrichment in alpha-globin sequences was found in the matrix-associated DNA after DNase I digestion of high-salt treated nuclei from Ehrlich ascites and uninduced Friend cells. In induced Friend cells, a high enrichment (up to 20 times) of alpha-globin sequences was detected in the DNA left with the nuclear matrix structures. The size of the DNA fragments obtained by this procedure indicated a random attack and did not correspond to a progressive top-to-bottom cleavage model. No enrichment in alpha-globin sequences was found in induced Friend cells if nuclear matrices were obtained by DNase I digestion of the nuclei before the treatment with high salt. Our data suggest that the enrichment in actively transcribed genes of matrices from nuclei treated with high salt does not reflect a localization of these genes close to the attachment sites of the chromatin loops but rather their artefactual association with some high salt-insoluble proteins of the transcriptional complexes.","['Kirov, N', 'Djondjurov, L', 'Tsanev, R']","['Kirov N', 'Djondjurov L', 'Tsanev R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*analysis', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Genes', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1984/12/15 00:00,1984/12/15 00:01,['1984/12/15 00:00'],"['1984/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-2836(84)90029-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-2836(84)90029-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1984 Dec 15;180(3):601-14. doi: 10.1016/0022-2836(84)90029-9.,,,,,,,

These monocytes released soluble cytotoxic factors, termed monocyte cytotoxic factors (MCF), when cultured with target cells. In contrast, blood monocytes obtained by adherence to fetal calf serum-coated plastic surfaces failed to kill K562 cells and to produce MCF. Although some lysis could be detected at 18 h, optimal lysis of K562 cells by MCF was observed after 48 h incubation in a microcytotoxicity assay using trypan blue dye exclusion. The addition of actinomycin D to the cytotoxicity assay enhanced the sensitivity and then NCF activity was detectable in a 18-h Cr release assay. Neither supernatants produced by culture of monocytes alone nor lysates of monocytes were cytotoxic. In addition, cytochalasin A inhibited both direct cell-mediated lysis and generation of MCF. Optimal production of MCF occurred after 6-24 h of interaction with K562 cells, although significant activity was already present by 3 h. Treatment of monocytes with OKM1 monoclonal antibody plus complement abrogated both cell-mediated lysis and MCF generation, whereas Leu-11b plus complement were ineffective. These results indicate that human blood monocytes can release MCF during interaction with tumor cells and that this may be involved in the lytic mechanism of monocyte-mediated natural cytotoxicity.","['Uchida, A', 'Yanagawa, E']","['Uchida A', 'Yanagawa E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Immunol Lett,Immunology letters,7910006,['0 (Cytotoxins)'],IM,"['Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-2478(84)90016-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2478(84)90016-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Lett. 1984;8(6):311-6. doi: 10.1016/0165-2478(84)90016-6.,,,,,,,

The terminally TPA-differentiated cells continued to synthesize histones at a low rate even though DNA replication had ceased. The pattern of synthesis of histone variants in differentiated cells differed from that in undifferentiated cells and resembled that of quiescent or density-arrested cells. In undifferentiated cells, all three histone-H3 variants are synthesized, while in quiescent cells, only the H3.3 variant is synthesized. When TPA-differentiated macrophages were placed in normal medium, the pattern of histone synthesis was not altered, thus substantiating previous findings that the differentiation is irreversible. Further, TPA-differentiated macrophages and macrophages isolated from a normal human donor exhibited identical pattern of histone synthesis. Altogether, the results indicate that changes in the synthetic rates of histones during the TPA-induced maturation of human leukemic cells is not directly due to TPA or terminal cell differentiation per se but is due to the cessation of cell proliferation and DNA replication.","['Pantazis, P', 'Bonner, W M']","['Pantazis P', 'Bonner WM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Histones)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Histones/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(11)60661-0 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.1984.tb00282.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 1984;28(2):186-90. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.1984.tb00282.x.,,,,,,,

Induction treatment consisted of 80 mg/m2 of ACR iv daily for 3 days, followed by 80 mg/m2 iv daily for 2 days in patients not obtaining a complete remission (CR) after 2-4 weeks. CR was observed in eight patients (18%) and partial remission was observed in six (14%). On monthly maintenance chemotherapy with ACR and cytarabine, the duration of CRs varied between 10 and 58 weeks. Achievement of remission was not related to age, presence or absence of Auer bodies, cytogenetic characteristics, or previous response to daunorubicin and cytarabine. Side effects were nausea and vomiting observed in 86% and diarrhea in 34% of the patients, whereas mucositis and alopecia were uncommon. Disturbances of cardiac function arousing suspicion of acute ACR toxicity were observed in seven patients. No case of chronic cardiotoxicity was observed, despite the fact that 20 patients received ACR doses greater than 400 mg/m2, with seven of the 20 having had a previous daunorubicin dose greater than 400 mg/m2. As CR was obtained in four of 14 patients with primary therapy-resistant leukemia and in two of 16 patients with relapse and no response to re-treatment with daunorubicin and cytarabine, ACR does not seem to show clinical cross-resistance to daunorubicin.

Heat treatment at 39.0-40.5 degrees C during a 7-day-incubation period, for differentiation in the presence of DMSO, resulted in the inhibition of hemoglobin induction. Also, acute heat treatments at 41.5-46.0 degrees C before or after the addition of DMSO resulted in the inhibition of DMSO induction. This effect was greatest when DMSO was present during heating.

We revealed the vascular changes, such as fibrinoid degeneration, hyalinized thickening of the vascular wall, dilatation of lumen and stenosis due to swelling of the endothelial cells and exsudation in the wall, particularly prominent in venules and capillaries of venous side in the territory of the superficial medullary veins. There were no remarkable changes in the arteries, except for the moderate endothelial swelling of arteriolar capillaries. The parenchymal lesions were topographically associated with these vascular changes, and the small necrotic foci confluented each other and formed large irregular necrotic foci. We considered that the DNL may be ascribed to dyshoric damage of the veins and capillaries of the venous side and that the mechanism of vascular injury was probably due to the prolonged direct action of intrathecal MTX on the vessels.","['Suzuki, K', 'Takemura, T', 'Okeda, R', 'Hatakeyama, S']","['Suzuki K', 'Takemura T', 'Okeda R', 'Hatakeyama S']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Acta Neuropathol,Acta neuropathologica,0412041,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Arteries/pathology', 'Axons/ultrastructure', 'Brain/blood supply/pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Necrosis', 'Veins/pathology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00690468 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Neuropathol. 1984;65(2):145-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00690468.,,,,,,,

Consequently plasma amino acids of patients with neoplastic and non-neoplastic internal diseases were studied during phases of anorexia; special regard was given to the precursors of dopamine and serotonin. Anorectic patients were compared to non-anorectic patients with neoplasia. During anorexia, plasma levels of valine and leucine and hence the ratio of the molar concentrations of Val + Leu + Ile/Phe + Tyr were significantly decreased in each anorectic patient as compared to non-anorectic patients whose ratios were always within the normal ranges. As aromatic and branched-chain amino acids compete for penetration of the blood brain barrier, the decrease of the amino acid ratio may induce a raised flux of phenylalanine and tyrosine into the CNS which results in an increased activation of dopaminergic neurons--known to cause anorexia.","['Ollenschlager, G', 'Lang, R', 'Fekl, W', 'Schindler, J']","['Ollenschlager G', 'Lang R', 'Fekl W', 'Schindler J']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,"['0 (Amino Acids, Branched-Chain)', '0 (Receptors, Dopamine)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids, Branched-Chain/*blood', 'Anorexia/*blood', 'Feeding and Eating Disorders/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leucine/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Receptors, Dopamine/metabolism', 'Tryptophan/blood', 'Valine/blood']",1984/12/03 00:00,1984/12/03 00:01,['1984/12/03 00:00'],"['1984/12/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/03 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/03 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01782466 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1984 Dec 3;62(23):1102-7. doi: 10.1007/BF01782466.,,,Imbalanzen neutraler Plasma-Aminosauren als pathogenetischer Faktor der Anorexie.,,,,

Optimal lysis is obtained when the antibody cocktail at 10 micrograms/ml for each antibody and baby rabbit complement at a final dilution of 1:6 are used.

This study reports the use of the chromogenic tripeptide substrate D-Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide (S-2251) and an automated microtiter plate reader spectrophotometer for the determination of PA activity in cells and fluids. There was a linear relationship between the time of incubation at 37 degrees C and the square root of the absorbance measured at 405 nm when urokinase was incubated with the substrate in the presence of plasminogen. There was no activity in the absence of plasminogen. The slopes of the lines (square root A 405/time) were directly related to the concentrations of urokinase, up through 0.05 CTA units. Using this assay, we determined the cellular activity of PA in human promyelocytic cells HL-60 (1.33 +/- 0.12 CTA units/mg), human monocytoid cells U937 (1.27 +/- 0.12 CTA units/mg), mouse myeloid leukemia cells RFM/UN (0.70 +/- 0.07 CTA units/mg), freshly isolated normal human monocytes (0.00 +/- 0.00 CTA units/mg), and human monocytes after 7 days in culture (5.66 +/- 0.38 CTA units/mg). There was a variable amount of activity expressed in freshly isolated cells or cell lysates of peritoneal macrophages from normal mice, or mice that had gotten intraperitoneal injections of peptone, thioglycollate, or NaIO4, but after 24 or 48 h of culture, these activities, in general, increased. Using this assay, PA levels in the euglobulin precipitates from human plasma prepared without venous occlusion (0.03 +/- 0.02 CTA units/mg protein) or after 5 min of venous occlusion of the arm (0.18 +/- 0.01 CTA units/mg) were comparable to those reported by others using different assays. Thus, this represents a simple, rapid, accurate assay of PA that should be useful to those in immunology, cell biology, and clinical medicine.","['Weinberg, J B', 'Hobbs, M M', 'Pizzo, S V']","['Weinberg JB', 'Hobbs MM', 'Pizzo SV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Chromogenic Compounds)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '63589-93-5 (valyl-leucyl-lysine 4-nitroanilide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromogenic Compounds', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Microchemistry', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Oligopeptides', 'Plasminogen Activators/*analysis', 'Spectrophotometry/methods']",1984/12/31 00:00,1984/12/31 00:01,['1984/12/31 00:00'],"['1984/12/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/31 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(84)90112-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(84)90112-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1984 Dec 31;75(2):289-94. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(84)90112-1.,"['CA 11265/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 24066/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The present studies describe the effect of deprivation of glucose or glutamine on mouse bone marrow cell or HL-60 cell colony formation in soft agar. The mouse bone marrow cells were induced to undergo granulocyte/macrophage type differentiation by colony-stimulating factor. Glutamine, but not glucose, was found to be an indispensable metabolite for the cloning of HL-60 cells or differentiated mouse bone marrow cells. In addition, the effect of glucose or glutamine on the rate of differentiation of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-induced HL-60 cells in liquid culture was studied. Glutamine was found to be superior to glucose in its ability to support the proliferation and myeloid differentiation of HL-60 cells. When an optimal concentration of DMSO was used, the rate of differentiation of induced HL-60 cells was found to be a function of the concentration of glutamine. In addition to these studies glutamine utilization and product formation was studied in induced and uninduced HL-60 cells after 60 min incubation with 1 mM initial glutamine concentration. The fractional distribution of the glutamine carbon into its metabolic products remained unchanged in induced versus uninduced HL-60 cells. However, the rate of utilization of glutamine and product formation by terminally differentiated HL-60 cells was less than the rate of utilization of glutamine by undifferentiated HL-60 cells. The data do not explain the role of glutamine in the complex process of differentiation but establish the critical requirements for glutamine, but not glucose, in myelopoiesis.","['Dass, P D', 'Murdoch, F E', 'Wu, M C']","['Dass PD', 'Murdoch FE', 'Wu MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,In Vitro,In vitro,0063733,"['0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Glutamine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02619633 [doi]'],ppublish,In Vitro. 1984 Nov;20(11):869-75. doi: 10.1007/BF02619633.,"['AM 31624/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 00859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The absolute catabolic rate for fibrinogen was elevated in six cases. This shortened fibrinogen half-life together with the correcting effect of heparinisation on the fibrinogen turnover indicated that fibrinogen was consumed by chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation. Inhibition of the fibrinolytic system with epsilon-aminocaproic acid in five patients had no influence on the fibrinogen half-life in three of them but resulted in its prolongation in two patients. All except two children in complete remission had normal fibrinogen levels. Six patients had elevated plasma fibrinogen pools and in all of the cases survival and fractional catabolic rate of fibrinogen were normal.

To elucidate the role of butyrate-induced histone acetylation in the regulation of gene expression in K562 cells, we isolated 20 variants resistant to the growth inhibitory effect of butyrate. Four variants having different degrees of resistance were selected for detailed study. All four were found to be resistant to the hemoglobin-inducing effect of butyrate, suggesting that the two aspects of butyrate response, restriction of growth and induction of hemoglobin synthesis, are coupled. Further, after (5 days) culture with butyrate, two of the four variants exhibit less acetylation of H3 and H4 histones than does the butyrate-treated parent. Analysis of histone deacetylases from the variants indicated that each variant was distinct and that butyrate resistance may be accounted for by decreased affinity of the variant enzymes for butyrate, increased affinity of the enzymes for acetylated histone, or both. The fact that variants selected for resistance to growth inhibition by butyrate are also deficient in butyrate-induced hemoglobin synthesis and have abnormal histone deacetylase activity argues for butyrate inducing K562 cells to synthesize hemoglobin and restrict growth via histone acetylation.","['Ohlsson-Wilhelm, B M', 'Farley, B A', 'Kosciolek, B', 'La Bella, S', 'Rowley, P T']","['Ohlsson-Wilhelm BM', 'Farley BA', 'Kosciolek B', 'La Bella S', 'Rowley PT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Histones)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Benzidines/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Histones/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/analysis/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1984 Nov;36(6):1225-38.,,PMC1684660,,,,,

Using this approach we have found three different mutations in codon 61 of the N-ras gene of various human tumor cell lines. In the fibrosarcoma line HT1080 the first nucleotide of the codon is mutated; in the promyelocytic line HL60 the second and in the rhabdomyosarcoma line RD301 the third nucleotide. For RD301 this implies that the normal glutamine residue at position 61 is replaced by histidine.

By comparing a continuous Ara-C infusion during 24 h with two Ara-C injections at the same total dosage given 12 h apart, it was found that the tumor load was significantly more reduced in the latter group. For the drug combination Ara-C/Adriamycin, maximal LCFU-S reduction of one log was observed when Adriamycin (7.7 mg/kg) was given 12 h after Ara-C. From the increase in survival time after the schedule of 6 X Ara-C plus 1 X Adriamycin (all injections given at 12 h intervals), it could be extrapolated that the tumor load was reduced by 6.7 logs; this was in agreement with the theoretically expected reduction of 6.2 logs based on the LCFU-S experiments. The schedule of 6 X Ara-C plus 1 X Adriamycin reduced the normal haemopoietic stem cell compartment by 2.5 logs.

Flow cytometric analysis showed an initial decrease of cells in S phase from 26 to 13% and a subsequent accumulation of up to 50% at 10-14 h after injection. The low number of S phase cells during the first 8 h might be due to a combination of cell kill in S phase and a block at the G1/S boundary. The results make it very likely that the origin of the accumulated S phase cells is the resting compartment and that these recruited cells enter the proliferation phase as a synchronized cell population. By repeating the Ara-C injection at the time of accumulation of cells in S phase, a similar synchronized wave of recruited cells to that after the first Ara-C injection was observed. Flow cytometric analysis after Adriamycin (7.7 mg/kg i.v.) treatment, which has been shown to be cytotoxic for BNML cells, showed no changes in cell cycle distribution.

A good or partial clinical response to vincristine or vindesine was seen in patients whose leukemic cells incorporated less than 50% 35SO4 when exposed to vincristine or vindesine in vitro, compared with control saline-treated cells. No clinical response was observed following treatment with vincristine or vindesine if the 35SO4 incorporation of drug treated leukemic cells was greater than 50% of saline-treated cells. These data suggest that the in vitro effects of vincristine or vindesine on 35SO4 incorporation into leukemic cells of patients in blast crisis may parallel the clinical outcome of patients treated with these agents in vivo.","['Theodorakis, M E', 'Goldberg, J']","['Theodorakis ME', 'Goldberg J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Sulfates)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Sulfates/*metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'Vindesine']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90062-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(6):1065-71. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90062-6.,,,,,,,

AML was induced in C57B1 mice by i.v. inoculation of the C1498 cell line. There was a direct correlation between the marrow leukemic load and the degree of marrow stromal deficiency. This was expressed by reduced in vitro fibroblastoid colony formation. In co-cultures of normal mouse bone marrow and leukemic cells, and also in cultures of normal marrow with added conditioned medium (CM) of leukemic cells, marked inhibition of fibroblast-colony-forming units (CFU-F) from normal marrow was observed. In additional experiments, leukemic mice were treated with two consecutive injections of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (2 X 200mg/kg) and sacrificed 48 h later. Bone marrow samples of treated animals formed in vitro an increased number of fibroblastoid colonies despite relatively high levels of marrow leukemia. It is concluded that: (a) there is a direct correlation between the incidence of marrow leukemic cells and the degree of stromal deficiency; (b) leukemic cells produce in vitro--and probably in vivo CFU-F inhibitory factors and (c) administration of restricted doses of cytosine arabinoside to leukemic mice reduces the marrow leukemic cell content to some extent and increases the capacity of CFU-F to form fibroblastoid colonies in vitro.","['Ben-Ishay, Z', 'Prindull, G', 'Borenstein, A', 'Sharon, S']","['Ben-Ishay Z', 'Prindull G', 'Borenstein A', 'Sharon S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Culture Media)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Culture Media', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90061-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(6):1057-64. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90061-4.,,,,,,,

The mononuclear cells were examined for TdT by indirect immunofluorescence using an unpurified anti-calf thymus TdT as the primary antibody. This analysis failed to distinguish those children who were destined to relapse (n = 9) from those who remained in continuous complete remission. Rather, the exhibition of fluorescence was linked to the co-existence of infection, with a negative predictive value of 0.91. Putative 'TdT-positive' cells were concentrated in the T-lymphocyte fraction and the very process of E-rosette formation seemed to contribute to this phenomenon.

Busulfan had a pronounced cytoreductive effect on circulating leukemic cells in the late, pre-blast crisis stage of this disease but all treated animals, succumbed to the leukemia with only a marginal increase in survival time relative to that of untreated controls. In this respect the guinea pig model resembles human CML. Survival time was moderately increased with early busulfan treatment but, as in the late treatment group, all animals succumbed to the leukemia. A pronounced cytoreductive action on leukemic cells was also observed in guinea pigs treated with cyclophosphamide. Late treatment with this drug produced highly variable effects on the survival time of leukemic guinea pigs; of the nine animals treated, no effect was observe in five, three showed a significant increase in survival time and one animal was still in remission without treatment when the experiment was concluded. Early treatment with cyclophosphamide produced the most striking finding of this study. Two treatments with this drug produced a complete remission in all of the treated guinea pigs. This remission lasted without further treatment for the duration of the study (greater than 200 days) while all untreated controls died within 27-37 days after receiving leukemic cell transplants. The relevance of these findings to the treatment of human CML is discussed.","['Evans, W H', 'Miller, D A', 'Pearson, J W', 'Smalley, R V', 'Moore, D E', 'Terebelo, H K']","['Evans WH', 'Miller DA', 'Pearson JW', 'Smalley RV', 'Moore DE', 'Terebelo HK']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Busulfan/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90058-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(6):1037-42. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90058-4.,"['N01-CO-2390/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Epidemiologic studies done by a number of different investigators similarly show a reduction in risk with increases in ingestion of vitamin A-containing diets. These reductions in risk are primarily of the squamous cell types of cancer: lung, larynx, mouth, cervix, and bladder cancers. Retinoids, particularly beta-carotene, may have a risk-reducing function for such sites. However, evidence has also been found that retinoids under certain conditions may increase the risk of prostate cancer as well as of Hodgkin's disease and leukemia. It is not an impossibility that, although beta-carotene could reduce risk under most circumstances, under certain other circumstances it could increase risk for different cancers.

Of the children studied, 33 were randomized to treatment with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate alone, 36 to IT methotrexate plus 2,400 rad cranial irradiation, and 35 to IT methotrexate plus intravenous intermediate dose methotrexate. All patients were in their first (complete) continuous remission, were a minimum of one year post-CNS prophylaxis and had no evidence of CNS disease at the time of evaluation. In contrast to the other two treatment groups, children whose CNS prophylaxis included cranial irradiation attained significantly lower mean Full Scale IQs (P less than .001), performed more poorly on the Wide Range Achievement Test, a measure of school abilities, and exhibited a greater number of difficulties on a variety of other neuropsychologic measures. The poorer performance of the irradiated group was independent of sex of the patient, time since treatment and age at diagnosis. These data suggest that the addition of 2,400 rad cranial irradiation to CNS prophylaxis in ALL puts these children at greater risk for mild global loss in intellectual and neuropsychologic ability.","['Rowland, J H', 'Glidewell, O J', 'Sibley, R F', 'Holland, J C', 'Tull, R', 'Berman, A', 'Brecher, M L', 'Harris, M', 'Glicksman, A S', 'Forman, E']","['Rowland JH', 'Glidewell OJ', 'Sibley RF', 'Holland JC', 'Tull R', 'Berman A', 'Brecher ML', 'Harris M', 'Glicksman AS', 'Forman E', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Behavior', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intelligence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Radiation Injuries/*physiopathology', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1984.2.12.1327 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1984 Dec;2(12):1327-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1984.2.12.1327.,"['79-CA1106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25402/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The reduction correlated significantly with the level of differentiation, irrespective of the inducer and the proliferative status.

Upon exposing the monocytes to either lymphokines or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) the amount of CF released was increased approximately fivefold compared to the amount released from unexposed monocytes. With sequential lymphokine and LPS treatment CF release increased nearly 10-fold. Even 10 min lymphokine activation before LPS exposure enhanced CF production significantly. The enhanced CF production was detected between 5 and 10 hr after lymphokine activation. The RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide reduced the lymphokine-induced CF production in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that lymphokines augment both CF mRNA and CF protein synthesis. When monocytes were exposed to LPS on both Day 2 and Day 4 of culture, the amount of CF obtained on Day 4 was reduced compared to that obtained on Day 2. A significant increase in CF production, however, was observed when the monocytes were activated with lymphokines before the second exposure to LPS on Day 4, supporting the view that lymphokines initiate synthesis of CF in monocytes. Upon ion exchange chromatography, chromatofocusing, and gel filtration the same elution profiles of CF were obtained irrespectively of whether the monocytes had been activated with lymphokines or not. This indicates that lymphokines induce an increased production of the same factor(s) which was obtained in the absence of lymphokines.","['Kildahl-Andersen, O', 'Nissen-Meyer, J']","['Kildahl-Andersen O', 'Nissen-Meyer J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/*immunology', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/isolation & purification/pharmacology']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(84)90338-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(84)90338-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1984 Dec;89(2):365-75. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(84)90338-1.,,,,,,,

Negligible incorporation of [14C]choline into sphingomyelin was observed and phospholipase inhibitor (U10029A) studies indicated that PC was the major source of sphingomyelin choline.

Clinical and haematological features are different in preleukemic syndromes terminating with acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL). We describe two cases of preleukemia--the first evolving into ALL and the second into ANLL. Our first patient had developed pancytopenia and hypocellular bone marrow five months before overt ALL. In the moment the diagnosis was made clinical examination revealed enlarged lymph glands, liver and spleen. Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia and bone marrow infiltrated with blasts L1 morphology (F. A. B. classification). Preleukemic phase terminating with ANLL featured pancytopenia and hypercellular bone marrow infiltrated with histiocytes, some showing signs of erythrocyte-, leukocyte- and platelet-ingestion. Diagnosis of acute monoblastic leukemia M5 (F. A. B.) was made three months after the illness onset, according to bone marrow infiltration with monoblasts.

A morphometric evaluation with special emphasis on primary thrombocythemia.,155-67,"Morphometry was employed on different entities of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (CMPD) and reactive lesions in addition to normal control specimens. The entities studied included: (1) inflammatory reactions of the bone marrow (so-called myelitis in chronic rheumatoid arthritis), (2) chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), (3) agnogenic myeloid metaplasia in an early hypercellular stage (so-called chronic megakaryocytic-granulocytic myelosis, CMGM), (4) agnogenic myeloid metaplasia in an advanced fibrosclerotic stage or osteomyelofibrosis/sclerosis (MF/OMS), (5) polycythemia vera (P. vera), (6) reactive thrombocytosis (TH, as a sequel of miscellaneous conditions) and (7) primary (idiopathic, essential) thrombocythemia (PTH). Evaluation was done on plastic-embedded semithin sections with a constant thickness of 3 micron in approximately 20 cases of each group of CMPD. The following parameters were determined: (1) density distributions of the megakaryocyte and non-megakaryocyte compartments, (2) arrangement of megakaryopoiesis in the bone marrow space (i.e., inhomogeneity or clustering) and (3) the fine structure of megakaryocytes in PTH, with a quantitative analysis of the nuclear morphology by circular deviation and contour factors. The megakaryocyte morphology was closely related to a facultative or obligatory increase of the platelet count in these various entities of CMPD and was separable into two major categories: (1) controls, CGL and myelitis versus (2) CMGM, MF/OMS, P. vera, TH and PTH. These two categories were distinguishable by the prominence of megakaryopoiesis in the bone marrow as well as the elevated platelet counts in the periphery. Moreover, in comparison with CMGM and MF/OMS, PTH was characterized by an apparently normal maturation and a conspicuous polyploidization of megakaryocytes according to the nuclear morphology, which was similar to that of P. vera. Our results suggest that PTH presents a monolinear growth of the megakaryopoiesis in the same way as CGL exhibits a monolinear proliferation of the neutrophilic granulopoiesis. This is in contrast to the mixed cellularity of both the megakaryocyte and granulocyte lineage in CMGM and MF/OMS.","['Thiele, J', 'Funke, S', 'Holgado, S', 'Choritz, H', 'Georgii, A']","['Thiele J', 'Funke S', 'Holgado S', 'Choritz H', 'Georgii A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anal Quant Cytol,Analytical and quantitative cytology,7911206,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Platelet Count', 'Polycythemia Vera/pathology', 'Thrombocytosis/*pathology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol. 1984 Sep;6(3):155-67.,,,,,,,

All boys were under 14 years of age and they were treated with protocols D.74 and pethema 7/78. Seven patients (10.3%) presented an isolated testicular relapse (ITR) during the chemotherapy period. In 13 out of the 43 testicular biopsies (31%) leukemic infiltrates were found and in other 2 findings were controversial. Three boys, two of them whose previous biopsy was negative, had an ITR, 6 to 18 months after stopping therapy. Finally, other 3 had simultaneous relapses in testes and bone-marrow: one during chemotherapy and two after suppression. In total, 23 patients (33.8%) in first remission had overt or occult ITR. Overall incidence of testes leukemia, is calculated to be 40% in all the group. Incidence of early and occult ITR was higher in boys with initial WBC counts over 20 X 10 9/l. Therapy in ITR generally consisted in local radiotherapy (20-25 Gy), a new induction treatment followed by 2 year maintenance treatment; in 3 patients with early ITR, orchidectomy was also performed and six were given a new preventive SNC treatment. Clinical course in the 7 patients with early ITR was unfavourable in 5 with subsequent hematological relapses and death; one had a long-term disease-free survival (78 + months) and the other was a recent case. 10 out of the 13 patients with occult infiltrates followed in remission and four were of treatment with a follow-up over 64 months. The 3 patients with late ITR were in second remission at 8-14 months after a new cessation of therapy. It may be concluded from this study that prognosis in ITR is related to the phase of presentation: It is unfavourable in cases of early ITR but in cases of occult infiltrates detected by routine biopsies and in late ITR the combined therapy is effective in most cases.","['Ortega, J J', 'Javier, G', 'Toran, N']","['Ortega JJ', 'Javier G', 'Toran N']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'CCG-141 protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Spain', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Testis/pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1984/09/15 00:00,1984/09/15 00:01,['1984/09/15 00:00'],"['1984/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 1984 Sep 15;21(3):199-214.,,,Recaidas testiculares clinicas y ocultas en ninos con leucemia aguda linfoblastica.

Eight months later, the patient developed pleural effusion on the right, which soon was followed by blood and bone marrow pictures consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia. In vitro culture of pleural effusion cells unexpectedly gave rise to a continuously growing peroxidase-positive myeloid cell line. Autopsy revealed the recurrent mediastinal tumor to be positive for intracytoplasmic naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase and lysozyme activity.

Samples were treated in the following manner: (1) cold synchronization (exposure to 4 C for eight hours, then incubation at 37 C for 14.5 hours [CML] or 16.5 hours [AML]); (2) cold synchronization plus Hoechst 33258 (as first treatment, with Hoechst 33258 added to a final concentration of 50 micrograms/ml for the last five hours of incubation; (3) methotrexate synchronization (methotrexate added to a final concentration of 10(-7) M, incubation at 37 C for 17 hours, then washing of cells and addition of thymidine to a final concentration of 10(-5) M for an additional 5 hours 15 minutes of incubation); and (4) controls (untreated, incubation at 37 C). All cultures were harvested simultaneously in the usual manner. Our results suggest that cold synchronization provides improvement in mitotic yield and chromosome length as well as in chromosomal morphology, as compared to the results obtained with cold synchronization plus addition of the fluorochrome Hoechst 33258, with methotrexate synchronization or with standard direct culture techniques. Cold synchronization can readily be applied to the routine laboratory culture of hematologic cells for cytogenetic analysis.","['Rapoza, P A', 'Testa, J R', 'Egues, M C', 'Rowley, J D']","['Rapoza PA', 'Testa JR', 'Egues MC', 'Rowley JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, 1-3', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mitosis', 'Mitotic Index']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1984 Nov-Dec;28(6):740-6.,['CA16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The total content of GAG in healthy persons was 97.7 +/- 3.9 micrograms of uronic acid per 100 mg of dry cells, in CML and IMF it was 2-4-fold increased, in PV it was elevated by 20%, in AML it was diminished 3-5-fold. The elevated level of GAG in CML and IMF was due to presence of basophils and considerable quantity of immature cell forms: promyelocytes and myelocytes. In these cells changes in GAGs composition and their properties were shown: an increase of chondroitins deficient in sulfate groups and of heparan sulfate content, especially in basophils. The observed changes in GAG content and composition may be important for biological activity of the leukemic cells.","['Kharchenko, M F', 'Shatskaia, T L', 'Ostroumova, S S', 'Rybakova, L P', 'Shcherbakova, E G']","['Kharchenko MF', 'Shatskaia TL', 'Ostroumova SS', 'Rybakova LP', 'Shcherbakova EG']",['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Med Khim,Voprosy meditsinskoi khimii,0416601,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Uronic Acids)', '9007-27-6 (Chondroitin)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)']",IM,"['Chondroitin/blood', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*blood', 'Heparitin Sulfate/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Polycythemia/blood', 'Uronic Acids/blood']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vopr Med Khim. 1984 Jul-Aug;30(4):86-91.,,,Glikozaminoglikany leikotsitov pri mieloproliferativnykh zabolevaniiakh.,,,,

The occurrence of spectrin during normal and malignant erythropoiesis was investigated by immunofluorescence using a monospecific rabbit anti-human spectrin antiserum. The expression of spectrin was correlated to the presence of glycophorin A, which is an early and specific marker for erythroid cells. The expression of spectrin during normal erythroid differentiation coincided with that of glycophorin A. Both markers were already present in the proerythroblasts. Spectrin was also found in leukaemic cells from patients with acute erythroleukaemia and erythroid blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukaemia. In a large panel of human haematopoietic cell lines only those with erythroid phenotype (K 562 and HEL) stained positively for spectrin. It is concluded that spectrin appears early in the erythroid maturation. It is expressed both in normal and malignant erythroid precursors.

The endonuclease activity was demonstrated in isolated nuclei within 6 hr after the addition of inducer, reached maximum levels between 24 and 48 hr, and returned to control levels within 72 hr. The activity caused single strand breaks in high molecular weight native DNA, which could be labeled at exposed 3'-OH termini with Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and radiolabeled nucleotides. Alkaline elution studies revealed DNA fragmentation that appeared coincident with the presence of the endonuclease activity. The detection and levels of single strand DNA breakage correlated with induction of terminal differentiation by Me2SO or HMBA. Induction of the endonuclease activity was reversible: depletion of Me2SO from the growth medium after treatment for 6 and 18 hr led to a rapid decrease in the level of activity. Removal of the inducer prevented terminal differentiation, a finding that strongly suggests the endonuclease activity is present during the precommitment phase of differentiation. DNA fragmentation was not observed in cells incubated with hemin, which has been shown previously to increase the cytoplasmic level of globin mRNA without causing commitment to terminal maturation.

Our survey included normal human embryonic fibroblasts as well as transformed human cells of various origins: cervix carcinoma (HeLa), breast carcinoma (MCF7), Burkitt lymphoma (Daudi), and promyelocytic leukemia (HL60). All these cells revealed an extreme instability of myc mRNA (half-life, approximately equal to 10 min), suggesting that the control of myc mRNA degradation might be a general means (although not necessarily exclusive) of regulating both the level and the timing of myc gene expression. Inhibition of protein synthesis resulted in a dramatic stabilization of myc mRNA in HeLa, MCF7, and HL60 cells, suggesting that the controlling element might itself be, at least in these cells, a protein of rapid turnover. This finding opens the way to studying the mechanism of myc mRNA inactivation in these different cell types. However, protein synthesis inhibition had no effect on myc mRNA instability in other transformed (Daudi) cell lines as well as normal embryonic human fibroblasts. These different types of behavior suggest that the post-transcriptional control of myc gene expression might involve multiple factors that would be differently affected in various cell types.","['Dani, C', 'Blanchard, J M', 'Piechaczyk, M', 'El Sabouty, S', 'Marty, L', 'Jeanteur, P']","['Dani C', 'Blanchard JM', 'Piechaczyk M', 'El Sabouty S', 'Marty L', 'Jeanteur P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.22.7046 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Nov;81(22):7046-50. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.22.7046.,,PMC392073,,,,,

All boys were under 14 years of age and they were treated with protocols D.74 and Pethema 7/78. Seven patients (10.3%) presented an isolated testicular relapse (ITR) during the chemotherapy period. In 13 of the 43 testicular biopsies (31%) leukemic infiltrates were found, and in another two findings were controversial. Three boys, two with previous negative biopsies, had an ITR 6 to 18 months after therapy was stopped. Finally, three others had simultaneous relapses in testes and bone marrow, one during chemotherapy and two after suppression. In all, 23 patients (33.8%) in first remission had overt or occult ITR. Overall estimated incidence rate of testes leukemia is 40% in all the groups. Incidence of early and occult ITR was higher in boys with initial WBC counts over 20 X 10(9)/1. Therapy in ITR generally consisted of local radiotherapy (20-25 Gy), a new induction treatment followed by 2-year maintenance treatment; in three patients with early ITR, orchidectomy was also performed and six were given a new CNS preventive treatment. Clinical course in the seven patients with early ITR was unfavourable in five, with subsequent hematological relapses and death; one had a long-term disease-free survival (80 + months) and the other was a recent case. Ten of the 13 patients with occult infiltrates continued in remission and four were off treatment with a follow-up of over 66 months. The three patients with late ITR were in 2nd remission at 8-18 months after a new cessation of therapy. It may be concluded from this study that prognosis in ITR is related to the phase of presentation: it is unfavourable in cases of early ITR, but in occult infiltrates, detected by routine biopsy, and in late ITR combined therapy is effective in most cases.","['Ortega, J J', 'Javier, G', 'Toran, N']","['Ortega JJ', 'Javier G', 'Toran N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Prospective Studies', 'Testis/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.2950120606 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1984;12(6):386-93. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950120606.,,,,,,,

After lymphocytes were removed at flow rates between 10 and 11 ml/min with 500 ml of buffer, the flow rate was increased by 0.5 ml/min/fraction to collect 100-ml fractions. Highly enriched monocytes as judged by nonspecific esterase staining and morphology (70-95%) were found in each of eight fractions collected with flow rates between 11.5 to 15.0 ml/min. When stimulated with phorbol myristic acetate, these fractions mediated equivalent levels of cytotoxicity against 51Cr-labeled Chang liver cell line. Similarly, each monocyte-containing fraction was found to mediate the same level of cytotoxicity against antibody-sensitized 51Cr-labeled Chang liver cells. In contrast, cytotoxicity against the natural killer cell-sensitive K-562 cell line was found in only those fractions that contained a high percentage of lymphocytes. The fractions that were enriched in monocytes were found to differ in their ability to ingest latex. Those monocyte fractions that were collected between 11.0-12.0 ml/min consisted primarily of low numbers of latex-ingesting monocytes (less than 30%). Those monocyte fractions that were collected between 12.5 and 15.0 ml/min consisted primarily of latex-ingesting monocytes (50-70%).

ATP (1 mM) also caused changes in the permeability of MEL cells to ions. There was an increased influx of 45Ca2+ from a basal level of 5 pmol/min to 18 pmol/min/10(6) cells to achieve a 2-fold increase in steady-state Ca2+ as measured at isotopic equilibration. Ca2+ influx was blocked by diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonate (DIDS), an inhibitor of anion transport. ATP also stimulated Cl- uptake, and this flux was inhibited by DIDS. The ratio of ATP stimulated Cl- to Ca2+ uptake was 1.6:1. K+ and Na+ influx were also stimulated by ATP, but phosphate uptake was inhibited; the Na+ influx dissipated the Na+ gradient and thus inhibited nutrient uptake. ATP-stimulated K+ influx was ouabain inhibitable; however, the total cellular K+ decreased due to an ATP-stimulated ouabain-resistant K+ efflux. Na+ influx and Ca2+ influx occurred by separate independent routes, since Na+ influx was not inhibited by DIDS.

The myeloblastic leukemia of the RFM/Un mouse (the RF.AML line) was studied here to determine its ability to differentiate after in vitro and in vivo treatment. The RF.AML cells were passed in vivo by i.v. or i.p. injection of freshly harvested leukemic spleen cells or in vitro-passaged leukemia cells. The cells proliferated in the spleen and peritoneal cavity. The RF.AML cells had the appearance of myeloblasts or myelomonoblasts on Wright's stain, had slight positivity for peroxidase, and lacked staining for nonspecific esterase. The cells grew in suspension in vitro with a doubling time of 48 hr. Various phorbol diester tumor promotors inhibited proliferation and incorporation of thymidine into the RF.AML cells. Phorbol myristate acetate (10 to 100 nM) caused the cells to adhere to plastic, and enhanced the phagocytic ability of the cells for Candida albicans. The RF.AML cells had specific receptors for phorbol dibutyrate, binding 0.37 +/- 0.03 (S.E.) pmol of [3H]phorbol dibutyrate/10(6) cells after a 2-hr incubation at 4 degrees with 50 nM [3H]phorbol dibutyrate. Thirty-three to 300 nM dexamethasone caused 19 to 37% of the cells to become nonspecific esterase positive and enhanced their phagocytosis of C. albicans.

In vivo treatment of mice with RF.AML present with phorbol myristate acetate or dexamethasone did not induce differentiation of the RF.AML cells or alter the survival of the animals.

When examined with the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, which can penetrate the plasma membrane and intercalate in the lipids of both leaflets of the plasma membrane, as well as in organellar membranes, R-55 cells were found to have higher fluorescence anisotropy values, indicative of decreased lipid fluidity, as compared to HL-60 cells. In contrast, when HL-60 and R-55 cells were compared using a series of membrane-impermeant fluorophores (stachyose derivatives of anthroyloxystearate and pyrenebutyryl hydrazide) that incorporate only into the outer hemileaflet of the plasma membrane, no difference was observed in membrane lipid fluidity. Exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10 ng/ml) for 24 hr decreased the fluorescence anisotropy of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene in both HL-60 and R-55 cells, whereas by 48 hr only the HL-60 cells displayed the reduction. No effect on the fluorescence anisotropy of 1-(4'-trimethylammonium phenyl)-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene, which is believed to localize in the plasma membrane, was observed in R-55 cells exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10 or 100 ng/ml), whereas HL-60 cells treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10 ng/ml) showed a marked reduction in the fluorescence anisotropy. These observations suggest that the ability of HL-60 cells to respond to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate may be affected by the physical state of the plasma membrane lipids and that the resistant phenotype is associated with decreased fluidity of either the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and/or of the cytosolic organellar membranes.","['Fisher, P B', 'Schachter, D', 'Abbott, R E', 'Callaham, M F', 'Huberman, E']","['Fisher PB', 'Schachter D', 'Abbott RE', 'Callaham MF', 'Huberman E']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluorescence Polarization/methods', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Membrane Lipids/*physiology', 'Muramidase/analysis', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Dec;44(12 Pt 1):5550-4.,"['AM 21238/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 16891/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The Ph1-positive clone had been shown previously to have arisen from a cell of the 45,X lineage. At the time of the present study, the patient was five years post-diagnosis and had been off chemotherapy for two months following a year of treatment for lymphoid blast crisis. All analyzed unstimulated marrow metaphases and each of 23 individually analyzed erythroid and granulocyte colonies produced in assays of the starting marrow were 45,X,Ph1. Pooled granulocyte colonies from the same assays yielded four metaphases that were 45,X,Ph1 and one that was 46,XX. Very few hemopoietic progenitors were detected in long-term cultures at any time; however, all of four individually analyzed large granulocyte colonies and a pooled granulocyte colony preparation obtained from assays of 4- to 6-week-old adherent layers yielded exclusively 46,XX metaphases. These results provide evidence that non-clonal progenitors can persist in patients with CML, even after the onset and treatment of blast crisis, and that the long-term marrow culture system provides a sensitive method for detecting such cells.","['Dube, I D', 'Arlin, Z A', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Dube ID', 'Arlin ZA', 'Kalousek DK', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Culture Techniques', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mosaicism', 'Turner Syndrome/*complications/genetics/pathology']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)62775-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Dec;64(6):1284-7.,,,,,,,

Nucleated haemopoietic cells were incubated at temperatures in the range 41.5 degrees C to 44.0 degrees C for various periods before culture in agar. The results of these experiments showed that CFU-GM from normal blood were consistently less sensitive to damage by heat than normal marrow CFU-GM. There was no comparable difference in the relative heat sensitivities of CFU-GM from blood and marrow of patients with CGL and no significant difference between the heat sensitivities of CFU-GM derived from marrow from normal individuals and patients with CGL. The observed difference in heat sensitivity of CFU-GM from normal blood and marrow accords with other data suggesting that the two progenitor cell compartments are distinct: the blood CFU-GM may represent a more primitive population of committed progenitor cells. In CGL, CFU-GM in the blood may much more closely resemble those in the marrow.

Both drugs are used in the oral maintenance therapy of ALL in children. The very low serum-concentrations after oral administration of 6MP and the short serum-half-life-times after intravenous administration point to more efficacy after prolonged intravenous infusion. The penetration of 6MP in the cerebrospinal fluid after intravenous administration could account for (prophylactic) treatment of the CNS in ALL. Pretreatment of leukemic lymphoblasts with MTX results in an increase of intracellular PRPP due to inhibition of purine de novo synthesis. This can be used for an increased incorporation and conversion of 6MP. Thus, increased incorporation and conversion of 6MP can be obtained when 6MP is added to MTX-pretreated leukemic lymphoblasts at that point of time where MTX causes maximal PRPP accumulation. This will result in increased incorporation of 6MP into nucleic acids and thus in enhanced cytotoxicity.

The 5 HT uptake was analysed according to the Lineweaver-Burk and the Eadie-Hofstee methods. With the two methods, the patient's platelets exhibited a dramatic reduction of the Vi max and of the Km; in some patients the Eadie-Hofstee analysis revealed that a passive diffusion phenomenon is superimposed on the active 5 HT uptake at least for the higher concentration used. The binding data were analysed with the Scatchard method. Two classes of binding sites (high affinity - low capacity, low affinity - high capacity) were found in normal subjects and patients. Pharmacological studies with imipramine, a specific inhibitor of 5 HT uptake, suggested that both the sites are involved in 5 HT uptake. The number of both binding sites was significantly decreased in patient's platelets while the affinity constants of these binding sites were not significantly reduced in comparison with those of the control subjects. No correlations were found between Vi max, Km and the number of binding sites. These results suggest that a reduction in the number of platelet membrane acceptors for 5 HT commonly occurs in myeloproliferative disorders but does not provide a full explanation of the uptake defect.","['Caranobe, C', 'Sie, P', 'Fernandez, F', 'Pris, J', 'Moatti, S', 'Boneu, B']","['Caranobe C', 'Sie P', 'Fernandez F', 'Pris J', 'Moatti S', 'Boneu B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['0 (Receptors, Serotonin)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'Receptors, Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Serotonin/*blood', 'Thrombocytosis/blood']",1984/07/29 00:00,1984/07/29 00:01,['1984/07/29 00:00'],"['1984/07/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/29 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/29 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1984 Jul 29;51(3):349-53.,,,,,,,

The fluid phase C1q-binding test (C1q-BT) served to analyze 92 sera from 24 patients with AML. In a first study the C1q-BT as modified by Carpentier [2] was compared to the universally accepted C1q-BT as described by Zubler [3]. Binding of C1q to heat aggregated human IgG, to tetanus toxoid (Te)/anti-Te complexes, and to serum containing heparin or fibrinogen was to a similar extent concentration-dependent; however, the binding values obtained with the method of Carpentier were always higher than with the method of Zubler. The same was found for the binding of C1q to sera from patients suffering from various diseases: using Carpentier's method approximately a 20% higher C1q-binding activity was found for all samples compared to binding activities found with Zubler's original method. The higher C1q binding did not depend on higher sensitivity of Carpentier's assay system, as the binding to sera from 60 healthy individuals was also elevated (8.1 +/- 6.0% vs 1.2 +/- 1.0% with the method of ZUBLER). In a second study AML sera were analyzed by the ""extended"" C1q-BT [4]. The ""extended"" C1q-BT uses two different C1q preparations and the assay follows the procedure described by ZUBLER.

Retrospectively, the in vitro data were compared to the clinical response of the patients to polychemotherapy. In the majority of patients, in vitro cytotoxic effectiveness of doxorubicin and ara-C reflected the in vivo situation. The levels of in vitro inhibition that could distinguish between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant diseases appeared to be 30% for doxorubicin and 20% for ara-C. No correlation was found between the doxorubicin effect in vitro and the proliferative state of the leukemic cell populations.

When added directly to cultures, PGE inhibits growth of normal 7 and 14 day bone marrow CFU-GM in a dose-dependent manner, while CML CFU-GM are refractory to PGE inhibition. The plant diterpene forskalin, a potent activator of intracellular cyclic AMP, inhibited normal and CML CFU-GM, indicating that the response of CML cells to increased intracellular cyclic AMP is normal. Low dose forskalin, which potentiates activators of adenyl cyclase, showed additive effects with PGE on normal CFU-GM cells, however, showed no additive effects of PGE and forskalin, suggesting that PGE failed to activate adenyl cyclase. Normal CFU-GM incubated with PGE for two hours showed a significant increase in CFU-GM growth, and removal of adherent cells prior to exposure to PGE abrogated this effect. CML cells did not respond to a 2-h exposure to PGE, and removal of adherent cells from these cultures had no effect. Normal and CML CFU-GM showed dose-dependent increases in proliferation in the presence of PGF2. These studies confirm that CML CFC-GM are refractory to inhibition by PGE, and show that these cells respond normally to increased levels of intracellular cyclic AMP.

In the cells from the AML patient this treatment induced differentiation to metamyelocytes and a decrease in the number of blasts, so that there was an 11-fold increase in the ratio of differentiated myeloid cells to blasts. In the patient with AMoL there was differentiation to monocytes and macrophages and only a 3-fold increase in the ratio of differentiated myeloid cells to blasts. In the latter patient actinomycin D was a more potent inducer of differentiation than cytosine arabinoside, daunomycin was similar to cytosine arabinoside and adriamycin showed the lowest response. Four courses of low dose treatment with cytosine arabinoside produced remission in the patient with AML and in another patient with AMoL whose cells were not tested in culture. No remission was induced by this low dose treatment in the patient with AMoL whose cells showed only a small decrease in blast cells in culture with cytosine arabinoside. It is suggested that prescreening for effective compounds in patients with myeloid leukemias and the use of low dose therapy can be of help in obtaining remission without serious side effects.

At low ionic strength, the complex from all sources was detected as a species with a sedimentation coefficient of 9.1-9.6S and a Stokes radius of 5.70-5.80 nm (form I); this form is believed to represent the non-transformed, undegraded complex. Exposure to 0.4 M KCl in the presence of molybdate resulted, in all cases, in the generation of a smaller form (form II) with a sedimentation coefficient of 4.5-4.8S and a Stokes radius of 4.70-4.77 nm. Form II has been shown to possess properties characteristic of the transformed (activated) state.

A significant number of lymphocytes in these mixed two-target conjugates lysed both autologous tumor cells and K562 cells after 6 hours' incubation, although overall lysis of K562 cells was higher than that of autologous tumor cells.

It remains to be seen whether more intensive chemotherapy, including high-dose chemoradiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, will improve the prognosis in this group of patients.","['Chessells, J', 'Leiper, A', 'Rogers, D']","['Chessells J', 'Leiper A', 'Rogers D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*therapy', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/prevention & control/therapy', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Spinal Cord/radiation effects', 'Testicular Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Time Factors']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1984.2.10.1088 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1984 Oct;2(10):1088-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1984.2.10.1088.,,,,,,,

These cells exhibited markedly decreased sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of 6-thioguanine (TG) and, in contrast to parental HL-60 cells, had the capacity to undergo terminal granulocytic differentiation after treatment with this purine antimetabolite. Analysis of extracellular and intracellular metabolites of TG revealed negligible metabolism of TG in these HGPRT- HL-60 cells. These findings are consistent with the concept that inhibition of cellular replication requires generation of analog nucleotide and suggest that TG itself is capable of initiation of differentiation. 6-Thioguanosine (TGuo) had limited activity, while beta-2'-deoxythioguanosine (dTGuo) was inactive, as an inducer of maturation of HGPRT- HL-60 cells. These cells converted relatively large amounts of the nucleosides to the free base TG; the simultaneous exposure of cells to 8-aminoguanosine (AGuo), an inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity, decreased the degradation of TGuo and dTGuo to TG and promoted the intracellular accumulation of TG nucleotides, presumably through the action of nucleoside kinase activities. In a double mutant deficient in both HGPRT and deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) activities, dTGuo was devoid of cytotoxicity and was an effective inducer of maturation. The potency of dTGuo as an inducer in this system was not significantly affected by the presence of AGuo. These results suggested that dTGuo itself was also an active initiator of maturation. Thus, induction of differentiation appeared to be due to the free base, TG, as well as its deoxynucleoside form, dTGuo, whereas the formation of TG nucleotides appeared to antagonize maturation and produce cytotoxicity.","['Ishiguro, K', 'Schwartz, E L', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ishiguro K', 'Schwartz EL', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mutation', 'Thioguanine/metabolism/*toxicity']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041210216 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1984 Nov;121(2):383-90. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041210216.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Both mRNA types were translated in vitro and the 35S-labeled translation products examined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Among the most abundant untranslated mRNA species was the mRNA coding for eucaryotic elongation factor Tu (eEF-Tu). In addition, the mRNA for eucaryotic elongation factor Ts was also present in Friend cells in untranslated form. Calculations based on translation assays indicate that eEF-Tu represents about 15% of the translation products of RNP mRNA and that approximately 40% of the eEF-Tu synthesized in vitro is encoded by translationally repressed mRNA. This repressed mRNA can be activated by addition of cycloheximide to cell cultures. At the level of 0.1 micrograms/ml, cycloheximide was found to inhibit cellular protein synthesis by about 50% while augmenting the relative rate of eEF-Tu synthesis 1.6-fold. This result suggested that eEF-Tu mRNA might initiate poorly. However, addition of supersaturating levels of mRNA to a reticulocyte lysate augmented eEF-Tu synthesis about twofold, while generally depressing the synthesis of other proteins by about 40%. Thus the storage of large amounts of eEF-Tu mRNA in vivo is unlikely to be due directly to the ineffectiveness of the mRNA in competing for the initiation machinery of the cell. The results presented in this report suggest that the supply of active eEF-Tu in erythroleukemic cells is controlled, at least in part, by a translational mechanism.","['Slobin, L I', 'Jordan, P']","['Slobin LI', 'Jordan P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (elongation factor Ts)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Peptide Elongation Factor Tu)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Peptide Elongation Factor Tu', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/*genetics', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleoproteins/metabolism']",1984/11/15 00:00,1984/11/15 00:01,['1984/11/15 00:00'],"['1984/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08533.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1984 Nov 15;145(1):143-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb08533.x.,['GM25434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

We have previously reported that the PMA-induced growth arrest and differentiation in leukemic cells are associated with a rapid increase in phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of two cytosolic proteins, phosphoprotein with molecular weights of 17,000 to 20,000 (pp 17-20) and phosphoprotein with a molecular weight of 27,000 (pla approximately 5.5). The phosphorylation of these proteins was found to be catalyzed directly by cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase. To elucidate whether these phosphorylation events are specific to certain cellular functions induced by PMA, we compared the effect of PMA on phosphorylation of proteins in several cell systems. We found that, in cells where PMA accelerates growth (NIH/3T3 mouse fibroblasts, JB-6 mouse epidermal cells, and human peripheral lymphocytes) as well as in human platelets, the phosphorylation of pp 17-20 was only slightly affected by PMA, while phosphorylation of other proteins at Mr approximately 80,000 (pl approximately 5) and Mr 20,000 (pl approximately 5.2) was markedly increased. We provide evidence to suggest that the Mr 20,000/pl 5.2 protein might be myosin light chain (Mr 20,000). In contrast to these cell systems, in the human malignant cell A431 epidermoid carcinoma, the growth of which is inhibited by PMA, the pattern of protein phosphorylation by PMA exhibited striking similarity to that of leukemic cells; phosphorylation of pp 17-20 was dramatically increased while the phosphorylation of the putative myosin light chain (Mr 20,000/pl 5.2) was not affected. The identity of pp 17-20 in A431 and HL-60 leukemic cells was demonstrated by the unique stability of its phosphoester bond to alkali treatment. These results suggest that phosphorylation of different proteins and possibly activation of different protein kinases mediate the effects of PMA on inhibition versus acceleration of growth. Specifically, phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of pp 17-20 emerges as a signal which might be preferentially involved in PMA effect in certain neoplastic cells.","['Feuerstein, N', 'Sahai, A', 'Anderson, W B', 'Salomon, D S', 'Cooper, H L']","['Feuerstein N', 'Sahai A', 'Anderson WB', 'Salomon DS', 'Cooper HL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Skin/cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Nov;44(11):5227-33.,,,,,,,

In diseases exhibiting dyserythropoiesis, such as refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) and juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia (JCML), glycogen particles remarkably increased. In diseases showing hypererythropoiesis such as iron deficiency anemia, hemolytic anemia, or in cells obtained from very small premature infants, an increase in glycogen particles was observed in most cases. Compared to the PAS staining technique, which also utilizes the periodic acid reaction, the PA-TCH-SP technique appears to be more sensitive for visualizing glycogen particles in PAS negative cells, in addition to its capability of demonstrating the distribution of periodate reactive substance at the fine structural level.","['Sugiyama, S', 'Eguchi, M']","['Sugiyama S', 'Eguchi M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Silver Proteins)', '1IZ2H82NWU (thiocarbohydrazide)', '9005-79-2 (Glycogen)']",IM,"['Anemia, Hypochromic/blood', 'Erythrocytes/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Glycogen/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/analysis/ultrastructure', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction/methods', 'Silver Proteins']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00320204 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1984 Oct;49(4):307-14. doi: 10.1007/BF00320204.,,,,,,,

Lactoferrin biosynthesis was absent from leukemic myeloblasts and promyelocytes but abundant in normal bone marrow and both the bone marrow and peripheral blood of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CGL) if the samples contained substantial numbers of myelocytes and metamyelocytes. Lactoferrin was present in the steady state in normal or CGL bands and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but no lactoferrin biosynthesis was detectable in these samples. Taken together, these results suggest that lactoferrin accumulation begins with the onset of biosynthesis at the myelocyte stage and is largely complete by the beginning of the band stage of maturation. HL-60 cells, a permanent promyelocytic leukemia cell line, synthesized no lactoferrin. Translation of messenger RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed that mRNA from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and abundant myelocytes and metamyelocytes directed the synthesis of readily detectable amounts of lactoferrin, whereas HL-60 cells contained no translatable lactoferrin mRNA. We thus hypothesize that lactoferrin is a useful marker of gene expression restricted to the terminal stages of granulocyte maturation. Biosynthesis of this protein appears to be mediated by appearance of translatable mRNA at the myelocyte stage, coincident with development of secondary granules. Absence of lactoferrin production by HL-60 cells is due to absence of translatable lactoferrin mRNA, either because of lineage infidelity of these transformed cells or because of arrest before the developmental stage at which secondary granules appear.","['Rado, T A', 'Bollekens, J', 'St Laurent, G', 'Parker, L', 'Benz, E J Jr']","['Rado TA', 'Bollekens J', 'St Laurent G', 'Parker L', 'Benz EJ Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lactoglobulins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Lactoferrin/*biosynthesis', 'Lactoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/metabolism', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/physiology', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Xenopus']",1984/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84717-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Nov;64(5):1103-9.,"['AM 28076/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 07213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL/AM01098/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Canavalmine exerted an inhibition on murine erythroleukemia cell growth at concentrations over 50 microM. The cell proliferation was, however, restored when canavalmine was removed from the culture medium after 24 h. Treatment of the cells with 500 microM canavalmine blocked the accumulation of intracellular polyamines. Especially, both spermine and spermidine levels were reduced below 50% of those in control cells after 48 h and below 30% after 96 h. The decreased contents of spermine and spermidine were compensated for by the increased content of canavalmine incorporated within the cells. In these cells, RNA and protein contents also decreased. The degree of growth inhibition by canavalmine during the cell cycle was examined using synchronized cells. Serum-induced growth stimulation was inhibited by canavalmine most effectively in the cells at G1 phase prior to DNA synthesis. The antiproliferative effect decreased when canavalmine was added to the cells after commencement of DNA synthesis. The results suggest that the growth-inhibitory action of canavalmine on murine erythroleukemia cells is most likely due to an inhibition of early events of the cell cycle, possibly due to the interference of a structure-specific function of spermidine and/or spermine on DNA replication.","['Fujihara, S', 'Nakashima, T', 'Kurogochi, Y']","['Fujihara S', 'Nakashima T', 'Kurogochi Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Polyamines)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Canavanine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Polyamines/metabolism']",1984/11/13 00:00,1984/11/13 00:01,['1984/11/13 00:00'],"['1984/11/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/13 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(84)90083-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(84)90083-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1984 Nov 13;805(3):277-84. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(84)90083-1.,,,,,,,

Thus, there is a rapid increase in the relative amounts of the variants H2A.1 and H2B.2 in parallel with the increase in the number of hemoglobin-producing cells and the sharp decrease in the growth rate. We show that the changes in variant proportions are not associated with slower growth per se but are most likely due to differential changes in the rates of variant synthesis as a result of commitment to terminal differentiation. In addition, we observed an inducer-specific increase in the rate of synthesis and the relative amount of the minor H2A variant 4, well before hemoglobin accumulation. We also present evidence that H2A and H2B histones are synthesized and incorporated into chromatin at a significant rate even when DNA synthesis is inhibited, suggesting turnover of these histones. H2A and H2B turnover can be detected directly even in exponentially growing cells. H2A.1 and H2B.2 have higher turnover rates than H2A.2 and H2B.1, respectively, in exponentially growing cells, a difference which is even more pronounced in induced cells. The magnitude of the differential turnover is not sufficient to account for the changes in the histone variant proportions in the short life of induced MEL cells but could explain the slow accumulation of H2A.2, H2B.1, and H3.3 in nondividing adult tissues of the mouse.","['Grove, G W', 'Zweidler, A']","['Grove GW', 'Zweidler A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nucleosomes/*metabolism']",1984/09/11 00:00,1984/09/11 00:01,['1984/09/11 00:00'],"['1984/09/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/11 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00314a030 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1984 Sep 11;23(19):4436-43. doi: 10.1021/bi00314a030.,"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

Eighteen patients who had detectable levels of TdT in their leukaemic cells (greater than or equal to 0.1 unit microgram-1 DNA), had a higher complete remission rate than patients with low TdT activity. Patients below 60 years with increased TdT activity also had longer survival as compared to those with low TdT levels. By combining cytochemical analysis of peroxidase and immunocytochemical staining for TdT it was possible to show that the enzyme was located in leukaemic cells of myeloid origin. Leukemias of monocytic origin had no detectable TdT activity in 10/11 cases. The cellular content of the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor varied from 0 to 2.8 fmol micrograms-1 DNA. There was no difference in receptor content between the different FAB subgroups. High levels of the receptor (greater than or equal to 0.22 fmol microgram-1 DNA) were positively correlated with the remission rate. Patients with TdT levels of greater than or equal to 0.1 unit microgram-1 DNA and a glucocorticoid receptor concentration of greater than or equal to 0.22 fmol microgram-1 DNA had significantly higher remission (P = 0.001) and survival rates (P = 0.007) compared with those with undectectable levels of both TdT and low receptor content.

Nine patients with APL, between a day and 12 years old, were studied. Diagnosis was based on cytomorphological classification FAB. Eight presented with haemorrhages and DIC were found. Five received Daunorubicin and 4 DATOP. Patients with DIC also were given substitution therapy with platelets and heparin. RESULTS: two died during the first two weeks, of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and sepsis respectively. Three in initial remission relapsed after 3 to 21 months and two died of ICH; the third one attained a new remission but presented a new relapse and finally died 61 months after onset. The other 4 patients are at present in their first remission of 1 to 12 months. IN CONCLUSION: APL must receive, besides specific chemotherapy, early DIC therapy; with present polychemotherapy a high remission rate and prolonged disease-free survivals can be obtained.","['Fernandez, M J', 'Javier, G', 'Tusell, J', 'Ortega, J J']","['Fernandez MJ', 'Javier G', 'Tusell J', 'Ortega JJ']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Esp Pediatr,Anales espanoles de pediatria,0420463,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,An Esp Pediatr. 1984 Jun;20(9):869-75.,,,Tratamiento de las leucemias agudas promielociticas en el nino.,,,,

Increase of crypt mitotic activity, decrease of intraepithelial lymphocytes and IgA-cells.",680-4,"Nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in remission were studied at the end of their three years' maintenance therapy. In the jejunal biopsy specimens significantly fewer intraepithelial lymphocytes and IgA-cells were observed in the patients than in the controls. However, the crypts were deeper than normal, and the mitotic activity of the crypt cells was markedly increased in all of the patients. Three children presented with decreased epithelial disaccharidase activities. One had abnormal D-xylose test and two abnormal lactose tolerance test. Although weight gain did not differ from the normal, height increase was retarded in all but one of the patients.

With the outbreak of their illness they often experience an additional imperilment of their ego loundaries. By introjection of the art therapist (or the physician) whom the patients frequently perceive as their double they are able to make an attempt at reconstructing an intact image of themselves and thus to restore intact ego functions. The double, on the one hand, becomes a source of help and, on the other, an exponent of the patient's own nonexistence because he continuously represents the non-ego as well. Pictures painted by leukemia patients in the course of an art psychotherapy illustrate this phenomenon. The confrontation with the double, exhibited in these pictures, allows the working-through of the relationship between the patient and the therapist which is always ambiguous.

Neither monocyte depletion nor the addition of interferon-alpha improved the decreased NK activity of the patients. According to the results of the single cell assay, conjugate-forming cells (effector cells that form conjugates with target cells), lytic conjugate-forming cells (fractions of conjugate-forming cells that actually go on to kill target cells) and the recycling activity of NK cells were all decreased in the patients. Thus, it is apparent that there were defects in several steps of NK activity in the patients. The NK activity of 19 patients was further studied successively to investigate the correlation between NK activity and clinical course. The longest observation period was 38 months. Six bone marrow relapses of leukemia occurred, but the NK activity of these patients at the time of relapse or at the previous test was not necessarily depressed as compared to that of the other patients.","['Inada, M', 'Okawa, H', 'Suzuki, M', 'Yata, J']","['Inada M', 'Okawa H', 'Suzuki M', 'Yata J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Reference Values']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1984 Sep;14(3):335-45.,,,,,,,

Bone marrow mononuclear cells from myeloma patients expressed considerable levels of cytotoxicity against K562 in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay, which was comparable to that of blood lymphocytes. In contrast, NK-cell activity was markedly low or absent in bone marrow of normal donors and control patients. Fractionation of bone marrow cells from myeloma patients on linear bovine serum albumin gradients enriched NK effector cells in the upper, lymphocyte-enriched fraction, with no reactivity in the middle fraction containing mainly myeloma cells. Treatment with either Leu-7 or OKMI monoclonal antibody plus complement reduced or abrogated bone marrow NK-cell activity of myeloma patients as well as blood NK-cell activity. However, OKMI plus complement failed to reduce control bone marrow NK-cell activity, although the activity was reduced by Leu-7 plus complement. Overnight exposure to interferon (IFN) of bone marrow cells resulted in an augmentation of NK-cell activity in myeloma patients, but not in controls. Furthermore, adherent bone marrow cells from controls suppressed IFN-induced enhancement of NK-cell activity of blood lymphocytes, whereas bone marrow of myeloma patients did not contain such suppressor cells. No cytotoxicity was induced in control bone marrow cells by cocultivation with bone marrow myeloma cells. Bone marrow NK cells from myeloma patients were able to lyse control bone marrow cells in a 18 h assay and their lytic activity was augmented by IFN treatment. However, neither bone marrow cells nor blood lymphocytes were cytotoxic to autologous and allogeneic fresh myeloma cells even after activation with IFN. These results suggest that NK precursor cells differentiate into HNK-I- and OKMI-positive mature NK cells in bone marrow of myeloma patients, but not in control bone marrow, and that these functional bone marrow NK cells may interact with other bone marrow elements.","['Uchida, A', 'Yagita, M', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Hoshino, T', 'Moore, M']","['Uchida A', 'Yagita M', 'Sugiyama H', 'Hoshino T', 'Moore M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/pathology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine']",1984/09/15 00:00,1984/09/15 00:01,['1984/09/15 00:00'],"['1984/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910340314 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1984 Sep 15;34(3):375-81. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910340314.,,,,,,,

The classical myeloses consisted of 40 per cent CGL and 60 per cent CMGM whereas the atypical consisted of CMGM only including all stages of fibrosis. Fibrosis was at the time of bone marrow biopsy found in 20 per cent of classical CML and in about 50 per cent of atypical myeloses. In classical CML Philadelphia chromosome could be detected in all the patients with CGL and in 50 per cent of those with myelofibrosis. Atypical myeloses did not exhibit Philadelphia chromosome. In 70 per cent of the cases it was possible to distinguish between CGL and CMGM by peripheral blood findings and bone marrow cytology.","['Seewann, H L', 'Lehnert, M', 'Juttner, F']","['Seewann HL', 'Lehnert M', 'Juttner F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Haematologia (Budap),Haematologia,0130266,,IM,"['Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Examination', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologia (Budap). 1983;16(1-4):67-72.,,,,,,,

The present studies describe the effects of TPA on the phosphorylation of HL-60 cell proteins. A rapid decrease in the phosphorylation of a 75 kD protein was observed within a few minutes after treatment with TPA. On the other hand, TPA treatment of HL-60 cells caused rapid increase in the phosphorylation of a 67 kD protein and other minor proteins. Phorbol and 4 alpha-phorbol-12,13-dodecanoate, both of which are biologically inactive derivatives of TPA, failed to cause any changes in protein phosphorylation in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that changes in protein phosphorylation are involved in mechanisms of the differentiation in HL-60 cells induced by TPA. Cell fractionation experiments revealed that 67K protein was located in cytosol. Though 75K protein also seemed to be located in cytosol, the phosphate moiety of 75K protein was almost lost during cell fractionation, suggesting that the phosphorylation of 75K protein was specifically regulated in HL-60 cells. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), retinoic acid (RA) and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, all of which induce the differentiation in HL-60 cells, did not cause any changes in protein phosphorylation.

The continuous exposure to ARA-C was shown to be more cytotoxic than the intermittent exposures at identical concentrations or under conditions where the concentrations multiplied by time of exposure were the same. In a comparison of exposures, as the intervals between drug exposures were reduced, the cytotoxicity of ARA-C increased. Flow microfluorometric analysis of DNA content showed that a 3-hour exposure to ARA-C every 6 hours produced a greater accumulation of cells in S phase than the same exposure repeated every 12 hours. After a 3-hour exposure to 20 micrograms/ml of ARA-C, the cells recovered 38% and 85% of their capacity to synthesize DNA within 4 and 8 hours, respectively. These findings can be explained in part by the short half-life of the intracellular nucleotide pool of ARA-CTP in these cells (about 60 minutes). These data indicate that when there is a prolongation of the interval between exposures to ARA-C, a greater fraction of cells recover from the inhibitory effects of this drug and escape its cytotoxic action. These observations may be important with respect to the design of more optimal schedules of high-dose ARA-C therapy for the treatment of patients with acute leukemia.","['Leclerc, J M', 'Momparler, R L']","['Leclerc JM', 'Momparler RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1984 Sep;68(9):1143-8.,,,,,,,

A large proportion of deoxycytosine residues were methylated in EC cells (4.6%) and this proportion dropped significantly (4.1%) following differentiation. The alpha-1 globin genes were heavily methylated at HpaII sites in EC cells and in differentiated derivatives of these EC cells. The MEL cells had only 3.3% of their genomic deoxycytidine methylated and no significant change occurred following differentiation. The alpha-1 globin genes of MEL cells were much less methylated than the same genes in EC cells and no change in this methylation pattern accompanied the induction of hemoglobin synthesis. In EC X MEL cell hybrids which express the alpha-1 globin genes from both parents, the EC-derived genes had become demethylated. These results are consistent with the general model that DNA hypomethylation is correlated with expression of that DNA and that gene activation is accompanied by DNA demethylation. We have also measured the 5MC content of DNA isolated from nuclease-treated EC nuclei. Unexpectedly, the DNase I sensitive chromatin contained a large proportion of 5MC. This result, along with the work of others, suggests that nuclease sensitivity may often reflect the transcriptional activity of chromatin in somatic cells, but is not indicative of the active state in pluripotent EC cells.","['Aujame, L', 'Craig, J', 'McBurney, M W']","['Aujame L', 'Craig J', 'McBurney MW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Canada,Can J Biochem Cell Biol,Canadian journal of biochemistry and cell biology = Revue canadienne de biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8302763,"['6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['5-Methylcytosine', 'Animals', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hybrid Cells/analysis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Teratoma/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/o84-078 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Biochem Cell Biol. 1984 Jul;62(7):584-91. doi: 10.1139/o84-078.,,,,,,,

The majority of patients will die either from acute myeloid leukaemia or from infection and/or haemorrhage. Thirty-eight courses of low dose Ara C were administered in 26 MDS patients. Nineteen courses (50%) were associated with good (12) or partial (7) response. Three complete remissions were observed. The median duration of response overall was 19.5 weeks, 26 weeks for the good and 10 weeks for the partial responders. A high incidence of treatment failure was seen in patients treated after transition to AML. Major complications were observed during 14 courses and mortality was directly related to therapy in five patients. Platelet transfusions were required during 26 courses. Aggravation of peripheral-blood cytopenia during the first weeks and hypocellularity of bone-marrow aspirates at the end of therapy suggest that low-dose Ara C exerts its main activity by suppression of leukaemic growth, rather than by induction of differentiation in malignant cells. Our results in MDS patients demonstrate that low-dose Ara C can be of value in severe cytopenia and can decrease the proportion of leukaemic cells in the bone marrow, but the danger of treatment should not be underestimated.","['Tricot, G', 'De Bock, R', 'Dekker, A W', 'Boogaerts, M A', 'Peetermans, M', 'Punt, K', 'Verwilghen, R L']","['Tricot G', 'De Bock R', 'Dekker AW', 'Boogaerts MA', 'Peetermans M', 'Punt K', 'Verwilghen RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb06081.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 Oct;58(2):231-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb06081.x.,,,,,,,

The serum activity was specific for hydrolysis of the long chain tetradecanoate moiety of TPA, hydrolyzed mono- and diacylglycerols, but was not effective against triacylglycerols, cholesterylesters, or phospholipids. Heating the enzyme preparation at 56 degrees C for 1 min was dually effective in reducing the hydrolysis of both TPA and dioleoylglycerol by 83-86% of control levels. The potent diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor, RHC 80267, inhibited the hydrolysis of TPA in the 0.2-1.0 microM range and was also a potent blocker of monoacyl- and diacylglycerol hydrolysis. In substrate competition studies, exogenous unlabeled TPA was added to the [14C]dioleoylglycerol-containing reaction mixture, however, this produced an approximate 3-fold stimulation of [14]dioleoylglycerol hydrolysis. Although we have not established whether the hydrolysis of TPA and diacylglycerol is the work of one enzyme, the effectiveness of the specific lipase inhibitor, RHC 80267, demonstrates that diacylglycerol lipase can utilize TPA as substrate, a finding never before documented. This point is of interest in light of the theory that phorbol esters act by mimicry of the natural lipid mediator, diacylglycerols.","['Cabot, M C']",['Cabot MC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Phorbols/*metabolism', 'Phospholipids/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",1984/08/30 00:00,1984/08/30 00:01,['1984/08/30 00:00'],"['1984/08/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/30 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(84)90395-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(84)90395-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1984 Aug 30;123(1):170-7. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(84)90395-4.,,,,,,,

The pattern of reactivity was similar in normal and leukemic cells, thus suggesting that these McAb could be applied to studies of normal myelopoiesis and to the classification of leukemia.","['Polli, N', 'Zola, H', 'Catovsky, D']","['Polli N', 'Zola H', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Bone Marrow/*ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/82.4.389 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1984 Oct;82(4):389-95. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/82.4.389.,,,,,,,

The digestion of the matrix phospholipids with phospholipases results in the release of essentially all the newly replicated matrix DNA. The exogenous addition of liposomal phosphatidylserine to rat liver nuclei induces chromatin structural changes consisting in a disaggregation of the heterochromatin, probably mediated by the matrix remodeling, and in a transition from the solenoid fiber to the nucleosome filament, due to the removal of the histone H1. These effects occur through a direct interaction of phospholipid molecules with the inner nuclear components, as demonstrated by carboxyfluorescein transfer and electron microscope autoradiography.","['Maraldi, N M', 'Capitani, S', 'Caramelli, E', 'Cocco, L', 'Barnabei, O', 'Manzoli, F A']","['Maraldi NM', 'Capitani S', 'Caramelli E', 'Cocco L', 'Barnabei O', 'Manzoli FA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Chromatin/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Phospholipases/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(84)90025-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1984;22:447-64. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(84)90025-6.,,,,,,,

Bone marrow negative patients were given a conventional lymphoma program with CHOP-Bleo and limited RT on bulky mediastinum without CNS prophylaxis. The CR rate of the whole group was 54% (62% for ALL-treated versus 47% for lymphoma-treated patients; not significantly different), with a median survival for remitters of 28.5 mos. Relapse-free survival of the whole group was 65% at 12 and 25% at 24 mos. Stage IV ALL-treated patients had a median survival of 16.5 versus 10 mos for stage IV lymphoma-treated ones (p = 0.05); the three-years survival was 24 and 10%, respectively. No patients undergoing CNS prophylaxis (ALL-therapy) had neurological complications or late meningeal relapse. The better prognosis of ALL-treated patients, in spite of bone marrow positivity, argues in favor of an ALL-like therapy in all adult lymphoblastic lymphomas, in terms of CR rate, overall survival, and absence of CNS relapse.

These cell lines exhibit the same growth properties, produce the same viruses, and express the same oncogenes as the leukemia cells found in mice with stage I disease. No cell lines were obtained from leukemic mice in the absence of CM. No cell lines were obtained from uninfected adult, newborn, or phenylhydrazine-treated animals with or without CM. We conclude that some of the hematopoietic cells in F-MuLV-diseased mice will proliferate indefinitely in the presence of CM.

The rationale of this approach assumes a relatively higher sensitivity of leukemic cells to the drug as compared to that of normal marrow precursors. We have investigated in direct comparison the sensitivity to ASTA-Z-7557 of normal bone marrow progenitors (GM-CFC and BFU-E) and clonogenic leukemic cells (L-CFC). Normal bone marrow cells and purified leukemic blast cells were exposed to varying concentrations of the drug. Dose-response relationships did not indicate a selective cytotoxic susceptibility of L-CFC to ASTA-Z-7557.

The mean annual incidence of lymphatic malignancies was 3.1/10(5) in the Israeli Jews, 2.3/10(5) in the Israeli Arabs and 2.5/10(5) in the Gaza Strip. In the Jewish population there was a peak in the incidence of lymphatic malignancies at the 2-5 years age group, while in the Israeli Arabs this was less prominent. There were no significant differences in the incidence or type of lymphatic malignancies in the various Jewish or Arab groups but there was a trend for a high leukemia to lymphoma ratio (LLR) in the patients from the Gaza Strip. A relatively higher LLR was observed in families of a high socioeconomic status, but it did not reach statistical significance. T-cell ALL comprised about a third of the typed ALL cases. A high proportion of the patients with ALL belonged to the high-risk category: 46% of the Jewish children and 76% of the Gaza Strip children.

These results, which stand in contrast to current views, question the experimental basis for the use of high-NaCl vehicles in the ""high-dose"" CDDP regimens.","['Aamdal, S', 'Fodstad, O', 'Kaalhus, O', 'Pihl, A']","['Aamdal S', 'Fodstad O', 'Kaalhus O', 'Pihl A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Sarcoma/*drug therapy', 'Sodium Chloride/administration & dosage', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1984 Sep;73(3):743-52.,,,,,,,

The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of CT brain scan findings: (1) those with normal CT scans (n = 10); (2) those with evidence of cortical atrophy (n = 8), and (3) those with intracerebral calcifications (n = 5). The SRT results indicated significant differences between patients with normal and abnormal CT scans. Specifically, patients with abnormal scans reacted slower, and this latency was exaggerated by increasing the length of the warning interval. Furthermore, they reacted with larger variability which increased with the prolongation of testing. Moreover, the severity of impairment was related to the type of CT-scan abnormality: patients with calcifications performed more poorly than patients with evidence of atrophy. The present results revealed a strong correlation between the presence and type of CT-scan abnormalities and attentional performance in long-term survivors of childhood ALL.","['Brouwers, P', 'Riccardi, R', 'Poplack, D', 'Fedio, P']","['Brouwers P', 'Riccardi R', 'Poplack D', 'Fedio P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Clin Neuropsychol,Journal of clinical neuropsychology,8002260,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Atrophy', '*Attention', 'Brain Damage, Chronic/psychology', 'Cerebral Cortex/pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*psychology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Reaction Time', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01688638408401222 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Neuropsychol. 1984 Aug;6(3):325-36. doi: 10.1080/01688638408401222.,,,,,,,

This study, however, demonstrated that normal lung lymphocytes actually express very little NK cell activity (P less than 0.001 compared with blood lymphocytes). This was true independent of the NK-sensitive target used (K562, U937, MOLT-3, or Daudi). This lack of lung lymphocyte NK activity occurred even though the proportions of lymphocytes in the normal lower respiratory tract with the morphology (large granular lymphocytes) and surface antigen markers of NK cells were similar to that of blood (P greater than 0.5). Although normal lung lymphocytes bound to known NK-sensitive targets, they did not lyse these cells (P less than 0.001 compared with blood), which suggested that the lack of lung NK cell activity resulted from a relative inability of lung NK cells to destroy their targets. While the mechanisms of this functional impotence of lung NK cells are not clear, normal human alveolar macrophages and lower respiratory tract epithelial lining fluid exerted a profound suppressive effect on blood NK cell activity (P less than 0.001 for both) by inhibiting their ability to lyse target cells after binding (P less than 0.001). Though impotent initially, when incubated for 24 h in medium alone, normal lung lymphocytes demonstrated markedly enhanced NK activity (P less than 0.02), which suggested that lung NK cells do have the potential to express NK activity. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) further augmented this effect (P less than 0.05), but gamma interferon did not (P greater than 0.2). Consistent with this observation, lung lymphocytes from patients with active sarcoidosis, a disease in which lung lymphocytes are spontaneously releasing IL-2, did express NK cell activity (P less than 0.01). These studies suggest that although NK cells are present in the normal lung, they are functionally inactive, due, at least in part, to local inhibitory influences. In the presence of IL-2, however, lung NK cell activity is expressed, which suggests that lung NK cell activity can be modulated.","['Robinson, B W', 'Pinkston, P', 'Crystal, R G']","['Robinson BW', 'Pinkston P', 'Crystal RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lung/*cytology', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Macrophages/cytology/immunology', 'Male', 'Phagocytes/cytology', 'Reference Values']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111513 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Sep;74(3):942-50. doi: 10.1172/JCI111513.,,PMC425251,,,,,

The present study extends these findings by demonstrating that ara-C induces hemoglobin synthesis in human K562 erythroleukemia cells. This effect occurs maximally at an ara-C concentration (5 X 10(-7) M) that results in K562 cytostasis. In contrast to the reversible effects of hemin and hydroxyurea on globin synthesis in this cell line, we have found that the induction of K562 hemoglobin synthesis by ara-C is irreversible. An induction of K562 hemoglobin synthesis also occurs with aphidicolin, another inhibitor of S-phase DNA synthesis, but not with vinblastine, an inhibitor of mitosis. Finally, ara-C induction of a differentiated K562 phenotype is accompanied by the loss of self-renewal capacity, a finding consistent with terminal differentiation.","['Luisi-DeLuca, C', 'Mitchell, T', 'Spriggs, D', 'Kufe, D W']","['Luisi-DeLuca C', 'Mitchell T', 'Spriggs D', 'Kufe DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI111498 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Sep;74(3):821-7. doi: 10.1172/JCI111498.,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC425236,,,,,

Other investigators, however, have found no intellectual impairment in these children. Fifty-one long-term survivors of ALL, having been treated according to the protocols of the BFM Study Group from 1970 to 1979, were assessed retrospectively using neurophysical methods. The results were compared with those obtained from 30 patients with other malignancies, who had received neither radiation therapy to the central nervous system (CRT) nor any methotrexate during chemotherapy. Additionally, neurological examinations and cranial computed tomography (CCT) were performed. neuropsychological examinations included verbal functions, intelligence (performance), psychomotor speed, motor skills and sensory integration. The results of verbal tests and the IQs, tested by nonspeed-related measures, were within normal limits in both groups. About one-third of all patients showed mild disturbances of psychomotor speed and motor skills. Children with leukemia had lower scores than those with solid tumors for nearly all tasks, but only tests for sensory integration revealed significant differences between former ALL patients and tumor patients. Furthermore, the following results were obtained related to different therapeutic modalities: The higher total radiation doses had been during CRT (maximum 24 GY), the more neuropsychological functions were impaired, particularly motor accuracy and sensory integration. These disturbances improved with the length of survival. Widening of subarachnoidal space was found in 33% of the CCT obtained. There was no correlation between the intellectual functions of the survivors and the CCT abnormalities. Neurological findings mainly consisted of slight fine motor disturbances.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Harten, G', 'Stephani, U', 'Henze, G', 'Langermann, H J', 'Riehm, H', 'Hanefeld, F']","['Harten G', 'Stephani U', 'Henze G', 'Langermann HJ', 'Riehm H', 'Hanefeld F']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/psychology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Psychomotor Performance/drug effects/*radiation effects']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00442447 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1984 Aug;142(3):189-97. doi: 10.1007/BF00442447.,,,,,,,

The cells were preincubated for 1 hr with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C; 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.2, and 2.4 micrograms/ml) or daunorubicin (0.018, 0.037, 0.075, 0.15, and 0.30 micrograms/ml), washed, and plated in agar, and cluster/colonies were counted after 10 days of incubation. Survival curves were constructed and used for calculation of the surviving fraction of clonogenic cells. In 18 patients treated with thioguanine-daunorubicin-1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-prednisone, the in vitro drug sensitivities could be correlated to the in vivo response to therapy. Patients who entered remission (12 of 18) were significantly more sensitive to ara-C (p less than 0.005) and to daunorubicin (p less than 0.02) than patients who did not enter remission (six of 18). All patients who entered remission, except two, had normal or increased sensitivity to both drugs, and all patients who did not enter remission, with one exception, had decreased sensitivity to one or both drugs. Comparison of the cytostatic effect of [3H]thymidine and ara-C suggested that, in some cases, ara-C killed more clonogenic cells than those in S phase, and in some cases, the cells seemed to be metabolically resistant to ara-C. We conclude that in vitro drug sensitivity tests on leukemic clonogenic cells reflect the patient's in vivo response to the tested drugs and may be used to study the biological properties of leukemic stem cells that determine their drug sensitivity.","['Gustavsson, A', 'Olofsson, T']","['Gustavsson A', 'Olofsson T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DCTP regimen']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Oct;44(10):4648-52.,,,,,,,

Our review of the cytochemical and immunophenotypic features of 89 cases of childhood leukemia in marrow relapse indicated lineage switch (lymphoid to myeloid or the reverse) in six patients (6.7%). Five patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis had converted to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), and one had converted from ANLL to ALL. Each child received lineage-specific multiagent chemotherapy when initially diagnosed, and all achieved a complete remission. After conversion, four patients readily achieved second remissions with treatment for the phenotype evident at lineage switch. Two patients with ANLL at conversion failed ALL-directed reinduction, while one of the two responded to high-dose cytarabine but died during bone marrow hypoplasia, emphasizing the importance of prompt recognition of lineage switch and selection of an appropriate plan of retreatment. Cytogenetic studies disclosed evidence of clonal selection in one patient and clonal stability in two. These findings indicate an unexpectedly high frequency of lineage switch in patients who relapse in the bone marrow after intensive chemotherapy. Although specific causative factors could not be identified, our observations suggest at least two general mechanisms for lineage switch in acute leukemia. In one, chemotherapy appears to eradicate the dominant clone present at diagnosis, permitting expansion of a secondary clone with a different phenotype. In the second, drug-induced changes in the original clone may either amplify or suppress differentiation programs so that phenotypic shift is possible.","['Stass, S', 'Mirro, J', 'Melvin, S', 'Pui, C H', 'Murphy, S B', 'Williams, D']","['Stass S', 'Mirro J', 'Melvin S', 'Pui CH', 'Murphy SB', 'Williams D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Phenotype']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83354-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Sep;64(3):701-6.,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR05584-18/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The reactivity of the whole leukemic population was measured by indirect immunofluorescence, and the reactivity of the colony-forming cells was established by complement-mediated cytotoxicity and by fluorescence activated cell sorting. Comparison of the immunofluorescent reactivity with cytotoxicity and cell sorting showed that colony-forming cells were found within a fraction of the leukemic subpopulations that expresses these antigens. This finding implies that immunofluorescence reactivity of the total leukemic population does not necessarily predict the phenotype of the clonogenic cells. When the surface phenotype of the clonogenic leukemic cells was compared to that previously established for normal marrow hemopoietic clonogenic cells, several patterns were seen: (1) in four of ten cases, the clonogenic cells expressed a phenotype like that of relatively mature normal granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (late CFU-GM) or, (2) in two cases, a phenotype similar to the less mature colony-forming cells (early CFU-GM or CFU-GEMM), and (3) in four cases, a composite phenotype of early and late CFU-GM. Thus, the level of impairment of differentiation in AML may vary from case to case. In those cases phenotypically similar to the late CFU-GM, it may be possible to separate leukemic clonogenic cells from less mature normal clonogenic cells using monoclonal antibodies selectively cytotoxic for the late CFU-GM.","['Lange, B', 'Ferrero, D', 'Pessano, S', 'Palumbo, A', 'Faust, J', 'Meo, P', 'Rovera, G']","['Lange B', 'Ferrero D', 'Pessano S', 'Palumbo A', 'Faust J', 'Meo P', 'Rovera G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology/pathology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83353-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Sep;64(3):693-700.,"['CA-10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

The influence of 7-OH methotrexate on methotrexate toxicity was investigated by studying cell growth in the presence of methotrexate and its 7-OH metabolite and by studying [3H]-methotrexate movement across the plasma membrane of isolated human cells. Transport was followed for net entry of the drug into drug-free cells, net exit of drug into drug-free medium and for unidirectional exit fluxes with drug and/or metabolite in the extracellular medium (exchange exit). Results indicate that 7-OH methotrexate (10(-6) M) interacts with melanoma cells to reduce the initial cellular uptake rate of [3H]-methotrexate but that no such interaction occurs with ALL cells. Efflux measurements revealed that a stimulatory effect of extracellular methotrexate on [3H]-methotrexate exit was apparent and that extracellular 7-OH methotrexate had a less stimulatory effect. Overall, loss of intracellular drug was greater from melanoma cells than from ALL cells. The results suggest that the drug resistance encountered following high dose therapy may be due to reduced cellular uptake and/or increased efflux of methotrexate from cells, both events being enhanced by 7-OH methotrexate. In addition, there is an apparently endogenous resistance of the melanomas to methotrexate as regards time of exposure to this agent which could also contribute to the lack of clinical response when compared to ALL.","['Gaukroger, J M', 'Wilson, L']","['Gaukroger JM', 'Wilson L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Melanoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1984.179 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1984 Sep;50(3):327-33. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1984.179.,,PMC1976804,,,,,

Routine biopsy prior to stopping chemotherapy is useful in detecting occult TR. Biopsies should be done on both the testes regardless of the clinical findings. The age, leucocyte count and hepatosplenomegaly at diagnosis of ALL were not found to be significant factors in influencing relapse. Eight children were in bone marrow remission at the time of TR, but three had preceding or concurrent meningeal leukaemia while in the other five the testis was the first and only site of relapse. Radiotherapy was effective in local disease control but failed to prevent bone marrow relapse in all except two patients despite continuation of chemotherapy. The median time from onset of TR until bone marrow relapse was 7 months (range 3-13 months) and the median time until death, was 11 months (range 6-18 months). The frequency of testicular relapse may be related to the intensity of either the initial induction therapy or the consolidation chemotherapy.

From our review of the literature, one could anticipate that a child with this condition would have a response to therapy and an anticipated survival similar to that seen in adults. This situation is quite different when one compares adults with ALL to children with the same disease. It has been suggested that Ph1-positive CML is an acquired, postzygotic abnormality induced by environmental agents. It is difficult to reconcile this hypothesis with the fact that this condition can be seen in infants as young as 5 months of age and the general belief that environmental carcinogens take many years to produce malignant changes in cells. Ph1-positive CML has been associated with atomic bomb exposure and it is of interest to note that two patients in the present series had received radiation. For both children and adults, bone marrow transplantation during the chronic phase is the most successful therapy if a suitable donor is available. Recently, successful marrow transplantation during the accelerated phase has also been reported. For patients without a suitable donor, control of the disease with either busulfan or hydroxyurea and attempts to induce a remission with chemotherapy during the accelerated or blast phase is the best current alternative. For patients whose blasts have lymphoid characteristics such as TdT activity, vincristine and prednisone may be successful. For those patients with a myeloid or mixed lymphoid-myeloid transformation, no chemotherapy regimen has been successful. An aggressive approach such as that described by Weinstein et al. for the treatment of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia might prove beneficial.","['Homans, A C', 'Young, P C', 'Dickerman, J D', 'Land, M L']","['Homans AC', 'Young PC', 'Dickerman JD', 'Land ML']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Platelet Count']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1984 Summer;6(2):220-4.,,,,,,,

The required condition was evolution into overt acute leukemia. The children were 5 months to 15 years of age, and the preleukemia period ranged from 2 to 42 months. The symptoms and physical signs were nonspecific. Different kinds of cytopenia were found in the peripheral blood. Twelve children developed ALL and 16 developed AML. The analysis revealed that in childhood there exist two different types of preleukemia: pre-ALL and pre-AML. The age and sex distribution were different, as were the hematological changes. The marrow was usually hypoplastic in pre-ALL but hyperplastic in pre-AML. True hypoplasia in any of the three cell lines was more common in pre-ALL, whereas ineffective thrombopoiesis and normal or increased myelopoiesis were specific for pre-AML. Ineffective erythropoiesis was characteristic of both types. A typical chromosomal change in marrow, seen in pre-AML only, was a missing group C chromosome. The childhood pre-AML resembled adult preleukemia (also pre-AML) in many aspects, whereas the childhood pre-ALL seemed to be a different entity. It might be assumed that all preleukemic conditions do not evolve to overt malignancy.

The age at the time of radiation was found to be significantly correlated with discrepancy between verbal and performance IQ, with younger age being associated with verbal IQ scores higher than performance IQ scores. When analyses were performed within specific subgroups of patients defined by sex and age at the time of radiation, dose of cranial radiation, concomitant intrathecal methotrexate therapy, and duration of therapy were all found to be correlated with a lower level of intellectual function.

We have used a retroviral vector to introduce a selectable marker into the mouse genome close to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Chromosomal segments containing large portions of the MHC from these donor cells have been transferred both to hamster and monkey cell recipients. The procedure involved the following steps. First, a murine cell line was multiply infected with a defective recombinant murine leukemia virus that contains the neomycin-resistance gene (a gene that confers resistance to G418). In this way, the neomycin-resistance gene was introduced at multiple sites in the mouse genome. Second, metaphase chromosomes, prepared from this infected cell population, were transferred to hamster cell recipients. Third, two G418-resistant transferents were identified that expressed murine H-2 antigens on their cell surface. These transferents were shown to contain a large segment of the murine MHC (H-2K and I regions) by DNA hybridization. The neomycin-resistance gene and the mouse MHC genes must be physically linked in these cells since they could be cotransferred from the hamster cells to monkey cells. Fourth, the murine cell carrying the neomycin-resistance gene near the MHC was identified from the original donor cell population. This cell will serve as a useful source of chromosome fragments for analysis of larger portions of the MHC. This series of steps can serve as a paradigm for the first steps in a detailed genetic analysis of any specific region of a mammalian genome to which one or more genes have already been mapped.","['Weis, J H', 'Nelson, D L', 'Przyborski, M J', 'Chaplin, D D', 'Mulligan, R C', 'Housman, D E', 'Seidman, J G']","['Weis JH', 'Nelson DL', 'Przyborski MJ', 'Chaplin DD', 'Mulligan RC', 'Housman DE', 'Seidman JG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genetic Linkage', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Selection, Genetic']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.15.4879 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Aug;81(15):4879-83. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.15.4879.,"['AI-18436/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-19148/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I-GM27882/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC391595,,,,,

One such clone, cHerbA-1, was used to map the chromosomal location of highly homologous human sequences that were found to be present on chromosome 17 as judged by Southern blot screening of a panel of mouse-human hybrid cell lines segregating human chromosomes. cHerbA-1 was hybridized in situ to metaphase chromosomes from a normal male subject and from a female patient with an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) having the typical t(15;17) translocation. The results localized the cellular c-erbA sequences on chromosome 17 to the q21-q24 region of normal chromosomes and indicated that the c-erbA sequences remained on the 17q- chromosome in the APL cells, suggesting that they could be assigned to the 17(q21-q22) region. For additional data, we hybridized human neoplastic cells derived from a poorly differentiated acute leukemia carrying a t(17;21) translocation with thymidine kinase (TK)-deficient LMTK- mouse cells. A resulting hybrid, containing only the 21q+ chromosome, did not have human c-erbA sequences. Since the breakpoint on 17q in this translocation was similar to that in the APL t(15;17) translocation, this supported the assignment of c-erbA to the q21-q22 region of chromosome 17. The apparent close proximity of the c-erbA sequences to the chromosomal breakpoints in these two leukemias suggests a possible role for this oncogene homologue in the development of these neoplasms.","['Dayton, A I', 'Selden, J R', 'Laws, G', 'Dorney, D J', 'Finan, J', 'Tripputi, P', 'Emanuel, B S', 'Rovera, G', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Dayton AI', 'Selden JR', 'Laws G', 'Dorney DJ', 'Finan J', 'Tripputi P', 'Emanuel BS', 'Rovera G', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, 16-18', 'DNA/analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.14.4495 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Jul;81(14):4495-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.14.4495.,"['CA16685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC345617,,,,,

The deoxyuridine suppression test performed with leukemic cells became abnormal after nitrous oxide inhalation, in accordance with the effect on normal bone marrow.

We have recently demonstrated that two inhibitors of DNA synthesis, cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and aphidicolin, can induce HL-60 differentiation with the appearance of monocytic markers. These pyrimidine antimetabolites may have affected DNA methylation patterns and resulted in altered gene expression, or the differentiated phenotype may have occurred by inhibition of DNA replication. Consequently, we have extended these studies by using the purine analog, adenine arabinoside (ara-A), which also acts as an inhibitor of DNA synthesis. The results demonstrate that ara-A also induces HL-60 non-specific esterase activity and enhances expression of myeloid cell surface antigens, MY-4 and MO-1. The induction of a differentiated phenotype by ara-A occurs after partial inhibition of DNA synthesis, a finding similar to that observed with ara-C and aphidicolin. These observations indicate that purine, as well as pyrimidine analog inhibitors of DNA polymerization can induce differentiation of HL-60 cells along a monocytic lineage. These findings may be relevant to recent clinical trials that have employed low doses of ara-C in an attempt to induce differentiation of malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Munroe, D', 'Sugiura, M', 'Griffin, J', 'Kufe, D']","['Munroe D', 'Sugiura M', 'Griffin J', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*physiopathology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(84)90075-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1984;8(3):355-61. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(84)90075-4.,,,,,,,

All but two of these children experienced marrow recurrence within seven months of testicular relapse. In contrast, the 12 patients who developed testicular disease late in their clinical course have responded much better to further therapy; ten remain in bone-marrow remission for a median of four years beyond testicular relapse.

TdT was undetectable in the peripheral blood of patients with ALL in complete remission and within the normal range in bone marrow (0.1%-8% of nucleated cells); median ADA activity was as in control subjects. Relapsing ALL patients had TdT and ADA enzymatic activities as before therapy; TdT immunofluorescence test (IF) was positive in 69% of bone marrow and in 100% of CNS relapses. Twenty percent of TdT-positive ALL at onset became TdT-negative in bone marrow at relapse. TdT IF test was instrumental in detecting meningeal leukemia but neither TdT nor ADA could be used as indicators of complete remission or impending relapse because TdT-positive cells were present in normal marrows and wide fluctuations of TdT IF values and of ADA activity were observed in remission.","['Brusamolino, E', 'Isernia, P', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Scovassi, I', 'Bertazzoni, U', 'Bernasconi, C']","['Brusamolino E', 'Isernia P', 'Lazzarino M', 'Scovassi I', 'Bertazzoni U', 'Bernasconi C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine Deaminase/*blood', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*blood', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1984.2.8.871 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1984 Aug;2(8):871-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1984.2.8.871.,,,,,,,

Both recombinant IFNs, species A (IFN-alpha rA) and species D (IFN-alpha rD) significantly augmented, in a dose-dependent manner, NK cell cytotoxic potential. Highest augmentation was achieved with doses in the range of 10(3)-10(4) u/ml. Augmentation was observed independently whether the IFN-alpha r was added directly to the cultures of the tumor and effector cells, or whether the effector cells were preincubated with IFN-alpha r. Increase in cytotoxicity was evident within 10 min of incubation with IFN-alpha rA and was further potentiated with increasing incubation time. In general, no synergistic effect of IFN-alpha rA and IFN-alpha rD was observed when both of these species were added together to target and effector cells. Studies on the mechanism of IFN-alpha r action demonstrated that neither species of IFN-alpha r affected NK cell tumor-binding potential, but augmented cytotoxic-tumor binding potential and maximum rate of lysis. NK cell recycling capacity of most of the donors was augmented by IFN-alpha rA. These data illustrate that pure preparations of IFN-alpha rA and IFN-alpha rD augmented NK cell antitumor potential in vitro, suggesting that these agents may have therapeutic potential in neoplasias when their mechanism of action is more understood, and optimal conditions for treatment are developed.","['Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A']","['Lotzova E', 'Savary CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/genetics/*toxicity', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jir.1984.4.201 [doi]'],ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1984 Spring;4(2):201-13. doi: 10.1089/jir.1984.4.201.,"['CA 21062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This growth arrest occurred in both wild-type HL-60 cells exposed to 2 microM TG and an HL-60 clone lacking hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) activity at a 500-fold higher concentration of drug. Both cell lines continued replication during an initial 4-day period of exposure to TG; however, upon removal of the purine antimetabolite and reincubation in fresh medium in the absence of drug, no further increase in cell number was observed over the next 4 days. Extensive differentiation, as measured by the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium, occurred in TG-treated, HL-60 HGPRT-negative cells, whereas no significant increase in the number of nitroblue tetrazolium-positive cells was observed in wild-type HL-60 cells exposed to the purinethiol. Thus, termination of proliferation in wild-type cells appeared to be an expression of cytotoxicity, while in the HGPRT-negative clone, cell replication was apparently terminated by conversion of cells to end-stage forms with a mature phenotype. In support of this conclusion, differences occurred in the stage of the cell cycle arrest, determined on Day 6 after exposure to TG. Approximately 85% of parental HL-60 cells treated with TG were present in the S and G2 + M phases of the cell cycle, with the greatest proportional change from untreated controls being in the G2-M phase (i.e., a 63% increase over untreated controls). In contrast, HL-60 HGPRT-negative cells treated with TG accumulated in G1, with 68% of the population located in this phase (i.e., an 80% increase compared to controls), as might be expected for a differentiated population. Dimethyl sulfoxide, which produced differentiation in both parental HL-60 and HL-60 HGPRT-negative cells, was used as a positive control. Both cell lines responded identically to dimethyl sulfoxide, with growth arrest being due at least in part to differentiation, which corresponded to an increase in G1 cells.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Blair, O C', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Schwartz EL', 'Blair OC', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)'],IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Sep;44(9):3907-10.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Previous studies, however, have not revealed any consistent relationship between clinical responsiveness and the cellular or cytosolic concentration of glucocorticoid-binding sites. The objectives of this study were to determine whether there are intrinsic structural differences among the glucocorticoid receptors in various types of leukemic cells and normal lymphocytes and to investigate the role of endogenous peptidases in receptor degradation. Cytosols were prepared from fresh or rapidly frozen leukocytes from 6 healthy adults and 35 high-risk leukemia patients (median white blood cell count, 150,000 cells/microliter; median age, 13 years). Receptors were labeled with [3H]triamcinolone acetonide and quantitated by charcoal-dextran treatment or Sephadex LH-20 chromatography. Mean and median cytosolic receptor concentrations in 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia specimens lacking the standard B-cell or T-cell markers (""null cells"") were approximately 4-fold higher than in 23 other leukemic cell specimens. No other consistent differences in receptor content were observed. Agarose filtration and ultracentrifugation in hypotonic buffers containing 20 mM Na2MoO4 revealed complexes of similar size and shape in all clinical specimens tested and two established leukemic cell lines. They had Stokes radii (Rs) of 8.1 +/- 0.5 (S.D.) nm (n = 50), sedimentation coefficients of 9.5 +/- 0.3S (n = 40), molecular weights of approximately 330,000, and axial ratios (a/b) of approximately 12. In hypertonic, molybdate-free buffer, these oligomeric complexes were dissociated into subunits with Rs of 5.9 +/- 0.3 nm (n = 12) and a/b of 11 to 12, as observed previously for other receptors. Fragmentation of the oligomer and the subunit was evident in some cytosols. High activities of peptidases of various specificities were detected in leukemic cell cytosols, as in other cytosols, by fluorometric assays with derivatives of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Receptor cleavage by these and other endogenous enzymes may account for previous observations of ""abnormal"" receptors in cytosols from some leukemic specimens. We conclude that intrinsic structural defects in the receptors are unlikely explanations for the unresponsiveness of some types of leukemia to steroid therapy.","['Sherman, M R', 'Stevens, Y W', 'Tuazon, F B']","['Sherman MR', 'Stevens YW', 'Tuazon FB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'F446C597KA (Triamcinolone Acetonide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Freezing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*isolation & purification', 'Reference Values', 'Triamcinolone Acetonide/metabolism']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Sep;44(9):3783-96.,"['CA-28392/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

The clone was isolated by prescreening mutagenized HL-60 cells in hypoxanthine-amethopterin-thymidine medium, followed by selection with 6-thioguanosine. TGuo-30-2 cells were cross-resistant to TGua and beta-2'-deoxythioguanosine. TGuo-30-2 cells exhibited a marked decrease in the capacity to accumulate intracellular TGua nucleotides after treatment with TGua. The decrease in accumulation was not caused by a defect in transport, a lack or alteration of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity, or enhanced degradation of TGua nucleotides but appeared to be due to the maintenance of a lowered level of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) in the resistant variant, which corresponded to 20% of the parental concentration. Despite the decrease in PRPP levels, incorporation of glycine into purine nucleotides was greater in TGuo-30-2 than in parental cells. Measurement of PRPP amidotransferase activity using cell homogenates revealed altered kinetics for the enzyme from TGuo-30-2 cells, which included significant loss of sensitivity to feedback inhibition by 6-thioguanosine 5'-phosphate and greater catalytic activity at low concentrations of PRPP.","['Ishiguro, K', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Ishiguro K', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.14 (Amidophosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Amidophosphoribosyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Biotransformation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Thioguanine/metabolism/*toxicity']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Sep;44(9):3679-85.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Regardless of presenting features, all patients received 4 weeks of conventional induction therapy with daily prednisone and weekly vincristine and daunorubicin. One-third were randomized to receive, in addition, two doses of asparaginase during induction therapy, while another one-third received four doses of both asparaginase and cytarabine after remission induction. Preventive central nervous system therapy uniformly included 2400 rads cranial irradiation and five doses of intrathecal methotrexate. Remissions were maintained with daily p.o. mercaptopurine and weekly i.v. methotrexate. Of the 277 assessable patients, 254 (92%) entered complete remission, and 102 (37%) remain clinically free of leukemia for 4.6 to 8.0 years (median, 6.3 years). The three treatment groups showed no significant differences in either remission induction rate or outcome, even when the analysis was based on risk assignment. A ""late intensification"" phase of therapy, added to the maintenance protocol for 65 patients who had been in continuous complete remission for 14 to 30 months, failed to extend remission durations, as judged from statistical comparison with matched controls (p = 0.84). When tested as a time-dependent covariate in the Cox proportional-hazards model, delayed intensification again showed no important effect on duration of complete remission. We conclude that limited early or aggressive late intensification of therapy, as described here, does not improve outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Pui, C H', 'Aur, R J', 'Bowman, W P', 'Dahl, G V', 'Dodge, R K', 'George, S L', 'Ochs, J', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Hustu, H O']","['Pui CH', 'Aur RJ', 'Bowman WP', 'Dahl GV', 'Dodge RK', 'George SL', 'Ochs J', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Abromowitch M', 'Hustu HO', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Prognosis']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Aug;44(8):3593-8.,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In the present study, we have examined the effect of CY on human natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. Lymphocytes from six normal volunteers were cultured alone or with CY in the medium containing human AB plasma, and their cytotoxicity was assessed against cells of K562. The results demonstrated that lymphocytes when cultured with CY had 154 to 333% increase in NK cell activity as compared to lymphocytes that were cultured in the absence of CY. Similarly, CY markedly boosted the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes from two healthy donors against cells from cultured B-leukemia 3163. Maximal augmentation occurred in cultured lymphocytes that expressed low levels of effector NK activity. Lymphocytes from 13 of 15 children with acute leukemia in remission when cultured alone had no reactivity to autologous leukemia cells. In the presence of CY, lymphocytes from eight of 15 of these patients developed cytotoxicity against autologous leukemia cells. CY was effective in augmenting NK cell activity at concentrations ranging from 7.5 to 60 micrograms/ml. Maximal potentiation of NK cell activity was induced after 8 hr of treatment with CY, although the increase in NK activity was started within 2 hr of incubation with CY. CY-activated NK cells were found in glass wool- and nylon wool-nonadherent cells. Treatment of lymphocytes with CY did not increase the extracellular levels of interferon. The results of this study demonstrate that CY can activate NK cells in vitro.

Clinical and hematologic observations, and identification of prognostic factors.",675-86,"The clinical and hematologic characteristics of 38 children with subacute and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (S & CMMOL) are described, and the prognostic significance of these characteristics as recorded at diagnosis is reported. The common and distinctive feature of these children was the excessive proliferation of cells of neutrophilic and monocytic series. The disease predominated in younger children, 95% were younger than 4 years, and boys were more affected than girls (22/16). The onset of the disease was heralded most often by acute or subacute symptoms. Splenomegaly was the most common physical finding at diagnosis. Leukocytosis was usually under 100 X 10(9)/l. Monocytosis and granulocytosis were often associated with normoblastosis, and, in some cases, with moderate blastosis (less than or equal to 30%). Severe anemia and marked thrombocytopenia were found in about one third of patients, increased fetal hemoglobin levels in 53%, and increased gamma-globulin levels in 50% of cases. The Philadelphia chromosome was absent in all blood and marrow cell karyotypes. Thirty-three of 38 patients were treated with moderate or intensive chemotherapy, and in all cases treatment never resulted in a complete remission. Terminal acute leukemia occurred in 11 cases. Of the 38 patients, 29 have died (median survival time, 16 months). Initial characteristics predicting a short survival (log-rank test) included: older age (greater than or equal to 2 years) (P less than 0.001), hepatomegaly (P less than 0.05), bleeding (P less than 0.001), thrombocytopenia (P less than 0.01), high counts of blasts and normoblasts in peripheral blood (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.01). Sex, infections, cutaneous manifestations, lymphadenopathy, degree of splenomegaly, hemoglobin levels, fetal hemoglobin, leukocyte counts, percent of blasts in bone marrow, and serum gamma-globulin levels were of no prognostic value. When survival was plotted on a semilogarithmic scale, a change in death rate was evident at the second year of survival suggesting that there may be two subgroups of patients with myelomonocytic picture, one with very rapid, and another with a slower rate of mortality. A stepwise discriminant-function analysis was performed in an attempt to distinguish between those children who lived less than or equal to 2 years and those who lived longer. A linear combination of variables which best discriminated between these two subgroups was found. Nearly all patients could be classified as a short-survivor or long-survivor on the basis of age and platelet, blast, and normoblast counts in peripheral blood.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Castro-Malaspina, H', 'Schaison, G', 'Passe, S', 'Pasquier, A', 'Berger, R', 'Bayle-Weisgerber, C', 'Miller, D', 'Seligmann, M', 'Bernard, J']","['Castro-Malaspina H', 'Schaison G', 'Passe S', 'Pasquier A', 'Berger R', 'Bayle-Weisgerber C', 'Miller D', 'Seligmann M', 'Bernard J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Examination', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Monocytes', 'Prognosis', 'Statistics as Topic']",1984/08/15 00:00,1984/08/15 00:01,['1984/08/15 00:00'],"['1984/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(1984)54:4<675::aid-cncr2820540415>3.0.co;2-q [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Aug 15;54(4):675-86. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(1984)54:4<675::aid-cncr2820540415>3.0.co;2-q.,['F05-TW-02524/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Nine molecular species of neutral GSLs and 13 or more species of sialo-GSLs, ie, gangliosides, were detected on the HPTLC chromatograms for untreated HL-60 cells. The major components were ceramide dihexoside (CDH), GM3, and sialo-paragloboside (SPG). When HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate into both myeloid mature cells and macrophage-like cells in vitro, no new molecular species of GSLs specific for one of the cell differentiations was induced, but distinctive quantitative changes in the GSL composition were definitely observed between the two cell differentiations. During the myeloid differentiation induced by either dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or retinoic acid (RA), CDH, paragloboside (PG), and gangliosides having longer sugar moieties characteristically increased with a concomitant decrease of GSLs with shorter sugar chains, such as ceramide monohexoside (CMH) and GM3, and the GSL composition profile of myeloid differentiation-induced HL-60 cells became more similar to that of normal human granulocytes. However, some marked differences were noted between the induced HL-60 cells and the normal granulocytes, especially in the ganglioside compositions. These differences might reflect either some deficiency in the in vitro myeloid differentiation or some leukemic properties of HL-60 cells. In marked contrast to the change of GSL composition during myeloid differentiation, a remarkable increase of GM3, with a concurrent marked decrease of CDH, was observed in the process of cell differentiation into macrophage-like cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which suggested an increase in the biosynthesis of GM3. These results demonstrate that HL-60 cells express distinct GSL profiles, depending not only on maturation stages but also on differentiation directions.","['Nojiri, H', 'Takaku, F', 'Tetsuka, T', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Miura, Y', 'Saito, M']","['Nojiri H', 'Takaku F', 'Tetsuka T', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Miura Y', 'Saito M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Globosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '19600-01-2 (G(M2) Ganglioside)', '37758-47-7 (G(M1) Ganglioside)', '56573-54-7 (paragloboside)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'G(M1) Ganglioside/analysis/metabolism', 'G(M2) Ganglioside/analysis/metabolism', 'Globosides/analysis/metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83818-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Aug;64(2):534-41.,,,,,,,

Histological findings in myelodysplastic syndromes and comparison with bone marrow smears.,423-30,"Forty bone-marrow trephine biopsies of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) were studied and compared with bone marrow smears. It proved possible to make the diagnosis of MDS on the basis of bone-marrow biopsies. Features of abnormal erythropoiesis and myelopoiesis, although different from those observed in smears, were easily detectable. Moreover, obvious advantages of bone-marrow biopsy over bone-marrow smears were found. Firstly, the biopsy in MDS gives an exact assessment of the cellularity; secondly, the presence of reticulin fibres, increased in the majority of the cases, can be evaluated; thirdly, dysmegakaryopoiesis is more easily detected in trephine biopsies than in smears; finally, abnormal behaviour of myeloblasts, clustering centrally in the bone marrow, is frequently observed before the smears show an excess of myeloblasts. The bone-marrow biopsy also has a role in difficult cases, where the diagnosis of MDS can not be established on just bone-marrow smears. The five types of MDS, as described by the FAB group, do not represent recognizable histological entities.","['Tricot, G', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Hendrickx, B', 'Verwilghen, R L']","['Tricot G', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Hendrickx B', 'Verwilghen RL']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02916.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 Jul;57(3):423-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02916.x.,,,,,,,

Chemotherapeutic courses of daunomycin, ara-C, thioguanine and prednisolone were administered, resulting in a complete remission. A relapse occurred in January 1982, and chemotherapy did not lead to a second complete remission; neutropenia persisted with a marked left shift of the marrow granulopoiesis. Courses of chemotherapy were given throughout the study. In September 1982, marrow promyelocytes markedly increased, making up 51% of the nucleated cells. One month later the situation was unchanged, and 13-cis-retinoic acid (1 mg/kg) was administered by mouth. Gradually the marrow proportion of promyelocytes decreased to normal levels. The peripheral blood and marrow were still normal after 20 weeks of treatment with retinoic acid. Thus, retinoic acid seemed to have been inducing differentiation in an abnormally increased, maturation-deficient population of promyelocytes in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukaemia.","['Nilsson, B']",['Nilsson B'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02910.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1984 Jul;57(3):365-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1984.tb02910.x.,,,,,,,

The patients were divided into two groups on the basis of blood and marrow findings: blast crisis and subacute transformation. The evolution of the leukemic process in 41 patients was classified as blast crisis based on one of three criteria: 30% or more blasts in blood and/or marrow smears, intramedullary focus of blast transformation in a marrow trephine biopsy, or blast transformation in an extramedullary site. The 17 patients with subacute transformation of CML had a deteriorating clinical and hematologic picture but did not manifest any of the criteria for blast crisis. The blood and marrow findings in this group of patients were characterized by several qualitative and quantitative changes, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, decreasing leukocyte count, increasing basophilia, myelofibrosis, dysplastic alterations in hematopoietic cells, and increased blasts which, however, never exceeded 25%. Chromosome abnormalities in addition to the Ph1 were found in 65% of the patients with blast crisis and 86% of the patients with subacute transformation. The 41 patients with blast crisis had a median survival of nine weeks; the 17 with subacute transformation had a median survival of 26 weeks. The shortest median survival for patients with blast crisis, four weeks, occurred in the patients with myeloid blast crisis with chromosome abnormalities in addition to the Ph.

While the Q-cell population did not contain the differentiation-associated chromatin protein H1 degrees, the cells did manifest a more condensed nuclear chromatin, altered sensitivity to acid denaturation, and reduced accessibility of the DNA in chromatin to acridine orange. The extent of chromatin condensation and the number of free ribosomes versus polysomes in RA-treated FL cells were intermediate between those in untreated and fully differentiated cells, whereas viral budding and the number of nucleoli remained unchanged from those seen in the untreated cell state. The non-Q-cell population in RA-treated cultures, termed ""T"" (transitional) cells, had an intermediate RNA and protein content and a cell cycle distribution similar to those of control cultures nearing the plateau phase of growth.

Growth inhibition of FL cells was observed only during continuous treatment with RA. While RA did not prevent growth to a high cell density, if cultures were maintained in exponential growth, cell number was reduced by 37, 67.4, and 72.2% after 6-day exposure to 10(-7), 10(-6), and 10(-5) M RA, respectively. In comparison, 280 mM (2%) DMSO and 5 mM DFMO inhibited growth over the same time course by 92 and 97.3%, respectively. DMSO resulted in an early, transient (18-24 hr) accumulation of cells in G1 phase followed by a later (5 day), irreversible accumulation of G1 cells. RA required several cell generations (48-72 hr) before a dose-dependent G1 accumulation was observed. Two populations of RA-treated FL cells could be identified: one with an intermediate RNA content (T-cells) similar to near-plateau-phase control cultures and the other with low RNA content (Q-cells) similar to that observed for DMSO-differentiated (D) cells. The kinetics of the decrease in RNA content of Q-cells paralleled those of D-cells in DMSO-treated cultures; the proportion of Q- versus T-cells in RA-treated cultures was dependent on both concentration and length of exposure. DFMO treatment did not give rise to low-RNA-containing Q-cells. Protein content of RA-treated cells was also diminished and approached that observed for hemoglobin-containing D-cells. FL cells were recoverable from long-term (greater than 5 days) treatment with RA, though 2-3 days were required for reestablishment of exponentially growing cultures; apparently only moderate RNA-containing T-cells repopulated the culture. Neither RA nor DFMO treatment gave rise to benzedine-positive, hemoglobin-containing cells as compared to DMSO that induced differentiation in these cultures.","['Traganos, F', 'Bueti, C', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z', 'Melamed, M R']","['Traganos F', 'Bueti C', 'Darzynkiewicz Z', 'Melamed MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1984 Jul;73(1):193-204.,"['CA-23296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Nearly 90% of the unidirectional 42K+ influx could be inhibited by the cardiac glycoside ouabain with a Ki of 5 X 10(-8) M. This ouabain-sensitive component of influx rose as a saturating function of the extracellular K+ concentration with a K1/2 of 0.85 mM. The component of 42K+ influx resistant to ouabain inhibition was a linear function of the extracellular K+ concentration and was insensitive to inhibition by the diuretic furosemide. Unidirectional K+ efflux followed first order kinetics with a half-time of 55 min. Addition of 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a culture of HL-60 cells allowed two population doublings followed by the cessation of growth without an impairment of cell viability. Beginning 2 to 3 days after DMSO addition, the cells underwent a dramatic reduction in volume (from 925 microns 3 to 500 microns 3) and began to take on the morphological features of mature granulocytes. Throughout this process of differentiation there was no change in the intracellular sodium or potassium concentration. However, immediately following the addition of DMSO to a culture of cells, there began an immediate, coordinated reduction in bidirectional K+ flux. The initial rate of the ouabain-sensitive component of K+ influx fell with a half-time of 11 h to a final rate, at 6 days induction, equal to one ninth that of the uninduced control, and over the same period, the rate constant for K+ efflux fell with a half-time of 14 h to a final value one fourth that of the uninduced control. The rapidity with which these flux changes occur raises the possibility that they play some role in the control of subsequent events in the process of differentiation.","['Gargus, J J', 'Adelberg, E A', 'Slayman, C W']","['Gargus JJ', 'Adelberg EA', 'Slayman CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Ouabain/pharmacology', 'Potassium/*metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041200112 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1984 Jul;120(1):83-90. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041200112.,"['GM07439/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM20124/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Leukemic blasts were either undifferentiated or demonstrated evidence of myeloid differentiation. All patients responded poorly to antileukemic therapy. Bone marrow monosomy 7 was observed in one patient with severe marrow hypoplasia. Antileukemic therapy in another patient with greater than 30 per cent marrow blasts was associated with the development of a bone marrow myeloproliferative disorder with persistence of the monosomy 7 karyotype.

The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of the chromosome findings in the bone marrow, blood, and spleen: i.e. those with only a Ph1 (PP), those having two types of clones, i.e. one clone with only a Ph1 and another with additional karyotypic changes (AP), and those with only abnormal clones containing karyotypic abnormalities in addition to the Ph1 (AA). The number of patients in each group was: 22 in PP, 25 in AP and 17 in AA. The results were as follows: (1) The percentage of patients with a good therapeutic response was 77 per cent (17/22) in PP, 60 per cent (15/25) in AP and 29 per cent (5/17) in AA and 2). The median survival after the onset of the acute crisis was 148 days (4.9 months) in PP, 183 days (6.1 months) in AP and 53 days (1.8 months) in AA. Statistically, there was a significant difference between the AA and the other two groups (P less than 0.001).

Cells were preloaded by incubation with 20 microM-2mM NBD-taurine, then diluted 10-30-fold, and efflux was monitored by measuring fluorescence intensity (FL) as a function of time using excitation at 488 nm. The observed rate of decrease in fluorescence was sensitive to temperature and also to phloretin, a compound known to inhibit anion transport and other carrier-mediated transport processes. The coefficient of variation (CV) of the fluorescence distribution increased markedly over the efflux period, suggesting heterogeneity of the K562 population with respect to the rate constant for NBD-taurine efflux. This heterogeneity was also reflected in the upward curvature of a first order plot of log (FLt - FL infinity) versus time. Half-times calculated from initial linear portions of the first-order plots were found to decrease as the loading concentration of NBD-taurine was decreased, as predicted for a saturable transport system. NBD-taurine is not an ideal anion transport substrate for flow cytometric studies. It appears to bind to high-affinity sites within the cells with consequent fluorescence quenching, complicating interpretation of kinetic curves at low concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Muirhead, K A', 'Steinfeld, R C', 'Severski, M C', 'Knauf, P A']","['Muirhead KA', 'Steinfeld RC', 'Severski MC', 'Knauf PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (NBD-taurine)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '1EQV5MLY3D (Taurine)']",IM,"['Anions/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Oxadiazoles/*metabolism', 'Taurine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990050309 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1984 May;5(3):268-74. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990050309.,"['AM27495/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23088/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Elimination of Ara-C from CSF followed a biphasic pattern, with an initial t1/2 of 1 hr and a terminal t1/2 of 3.4 hr. Ara-C clearance from CSF was 0.42 ml/min, suggesting that drug elimination was primarily by CSF bulk flow. The ratio of the AUC of Ara-U to the AUC of Ara-C was 0.08, indicating only minor metabolism of Ara-C to Ara-U in CSF, in contrast to that after systemic Ara-C.

Thirty-eight patients with AML, 2-80 years of age (mean +/- SE, 35.0 +/- 3.2), were evaluated during this study. Seventeen of these patients were given ACM after an unsuccessful attempt had been made to attain a complete remission (CR) with various regimens that included doxorubicin or daunorubicin; this group was considered resistant to these drugs. ACM was administered by rapid iv injection. Thirteen patients received a single course of ACM at a daily dose of 10-30 mg/m2 until a maximum total dose of 300 mg/m2 was reached or until unacceptable toxicity appeared. Of these patients, two (15%) attained a CR. The other 25 patients were given 10-day courses of ACM at a daily dose of 15 mg/m2 with 10-day intervals between courses; courses were repeated until the blast cells were cleared from peripheral blood and bone marrow or until progressive disease became evident. With this regimen, 11 patients (44%) attained a CR. The overall CR rate for the 38 patients was 34%. Total doses necessary to achieve a CR ranged from 150 to 600 mg/m2. A CR was attained by six patients who were previously resistant to a regimen containing moderate doses of doxorubicin. The incidence and severity of the toxic effects were related to the dose of ACM administered per course of therapy.

In this study, the nature of the increase in ALA dehydratase activity in MEL cells was examined using a monospecific antibody directed to the enzyme. A sevenfold increase in ALA dehydratase activity was observed after cells had been treated with 1.5% Me2SO for 5 days. Ouchterlony double immunodiffusion analysis showed that lysates from untreated and Me2SO-treated MEL cells formed a single precipitin line with rabbit IgG directed to the normal mouse liver ALA dehydratase. A single arc of identity was also observed with the lysates from normal mouse erythrocytes, spleen, liver, and lysates from both uninduced and induced MEL cells. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis demonstrated that lysates from both uninduced and induced cells formed rockets with the IgG and that the peak height of the rocket was proportional to the ALA dehydratase activity applied. The slope of linear plots of rocket peak heights v ALA dehydratase activity was identical for lysates from uninduced and Me2SO-induced cells. Succinylacetone, a potent inhibitor of ALA dehydratase, was shown to markedly inhibit the activity of the enzyme, but did not interfere with the synthesis of ALA dehydratase induced by Me2SO treatment. Me2SO-induced increases in ALA dehydratase activity and the enzyme protein were both blocked by the simultaneous treatment of cells with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU). BrdU-mediated repression of ALA dehydratase was partially overcome by treating the cells with thymidine. These data demonstrate that increased ALA dehydratase activity in MEL cells undergoing erythroid differentiation after Me2SO treatment is due to de novo synthesis of the same enzyme protein present in uninduced MEL cells as well as in normal erythrocytes. This represents the first direct demonstration of an increase in a heme biosynthetic pathway enzyme protein in erythroid cells undergoing differentiation.","['Chang, C S', 'Sassa, S']","['Chang CS', 'Sassa S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', 'EC 4.2.1.24 (Porphobilinogen Synthase)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cross Reactions', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/isolation & purification', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/microbiology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Porphobilinogen Synthase/*metabolism', 'Thymidine/pharmacology']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83838-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Jul;64(1):64-70.,"['AM 32890/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-01055/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This agent incorporates in leukemic cell DNA, and the extent of this incorporation correlates with loss of clonogenic survival. The incorporated Ara-C residue behaves as a relative DNA chain terminator, and the extent of (Ara-C)DNA formation correlates with inhibition of DNA synthesis. The incorporation of Ara-C into DNA requires the formation of Ara-CTP, and previous measurements of this metabolite have also been correlated with cytotoxicity. Because it is clinically relevant to define biochemical parameters predictive of Ara-C cytotoxicity, the present studies were undertaken to determine the relationship among Ara-CTP pools, formation of (Ara-C)DNA, and loss of clonogenic survival. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of Ara-C into DNA is the single most powerful predictor of cell lethality. Furthermore, although there is a correlation between Ara-CTP pools or continuous cellular exposure to Ara-CTP and cell kill, these relationships are less significant than that obtained with formation of (Ara-C)DNA. The extent of Ara-C incorporation into DNA can be predicted by the product of the Ara-CTP level and time (T), thus supporting the concept that Ara-C incorporation is dependent on continuous exposure to the triphosphate metabolite. These findings support the formation of (Ara-C)DNA as a highly predictive parameter of lethal cellular events.","['Kufe, D', 'Spriggs, D', 'Egan, E M', 'Munroe, D']","['Kufe D', 'Spriggs D', 'Egan EM', 'Munroe D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis/toxicity', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'DNA/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83836-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 Jul;64(1):54-8.,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

To analyse the action of low dose ARA-C freshly isolated leukaemic cells and cells from the cloned promyelocytic leukaemia cell line (HL60) were cultured in vitro in the presence of cytosine arabinoside. Minimal evidence of differentiation induction was observed when compared with the cytotoxic effects of the drug. These results suggest that ARA-C does not exert its anti-leukaemic effects by halting proliferation through differentiation induction. Rather, it appeared that the capacity of this agent to kill cells in S-phase produced a progressive depletion of the cycling leukaemic cells.

Putrescine concentrations in random CSF samples obtained from leukemic patients with and without CNS involvement were not significantly different. Spermidine levels were generally higher in patients without CNS leukemia than in patients with the disease. In serial CSF specimens from an individual patient, spermidine levels correlated well with clinical status, being high in the active stages of the disease and low in remission. Thus, CSF polyamines appear to be of limited value as a screening test for early detection of CNS leukemia; however, they may offer an additional means of evaluating CNS leukemia and its response to therapy.","['Smith, B J', 'Lee, S', 'Sabio, H', 'Wills, M R', 'Savory, J']","['Smith BJ', 'Lee S', 'Sabio H', 'Wills MR', 'Savory J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Hodgkin Disease/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*cerebrospinal fluid/complications/drug therapy', 'Polyamines/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Putrescine/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Spermidine/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Spermine/cerebrospinal fluid']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1984 May-Jun;14(3):225-31.,,,,,,,

Although fiberoptic bronchoscopy was a safe and well-tolerated procedure in our patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and acute leukemia, its success rate was only 50 percent overall, and it appeared to be even less successful when performed early in the course of the disease. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a useful first procedure for the evaluation of patients with acute leukemia and possible invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but a negative result does not exclude aspergillosis.

Counting blast cells type I and II involved no difficulties. 4 of 15 patients who developed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) according to the FAB classification of 1976 did not fulfill the new 1982 criteria for AML. A redefinition of the blast cell type II to include a more granulated blast cells, without the characteristics of promyelocytes, would solve this problem.

The maximal level of induction of hemoglobin synthesis is 10-80% of the cells, depending on the compound tested. The induction is concentration and time dependent, requiring micromolar amounts of the drugs and about 5 days of treatment for full expression. The time course is very similar to that observed for a well-studied inducer, dimethyl sulfoxide. The affinities of the agents for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site are not correlated with their capacity to induce differentiation. Also, the biological effect is stereospecific since the (3S) stereoisomer Ro11 -6896 is at least an order of magnitude more potent than its (3R) enantiomer, Ro11 -6893. The benzodiazepine effect exhibits definite structure-activity relationships. A 1-methyl group is an absolute requirement, although this is not sufficient in itself. Hydroxyl and methoxyl groups at the 4' position enhance the biological activity, but 4'-chloro decreases it. Substitutions at the 2', 6', and 4 positions also decrease the biological activity, as does the lack of a 2-carbonyl group.

In the present study, the protein composition of K562 cells during haemin-mediated induction of erythroid maturation was analysed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Under conditions in which haemin did not effect cell viability and proliferation, a protein of approximately 70,000 molecular weight (MW) accumulated in the differentiated K562 cells.

An antigenically related protein was also demonstrated in human bone marrow and accumulates at particular stages of human erythroid maturation.","['Singh, M K', 'Yu, J']","['Singh MK', 'Yu J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",1984/06/14 00:00,1984/06/14 00:01,['1984/06/14 00:00'],"['1984/06/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/14 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/309631a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1984 Jun 14-20;309(5969):631-3. doi: 10.1038/309631a0.,"['A1-70605/PHS HHS/United States', 'HL 21845/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Metabolism and effects on cell lethality studied with human leukemic cells in vitro.,431-5,"5-Methylcytosine ( 5MeCyt ) is a possible regulator of eukaryotic gene transcription. We investigated whether this compound could be introduced into DNA from exogenous deoxyribonucleoside 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5MedCyd ). High concentrations of 5MedCyd inhibited the growth of several types of human leukemic cell lines in vitro. However, the effect could be accounted for by dThd, a deamination product of 5MedCyd . We found that radioactivity from [methyl-14C] 5MedCyd and [2-14C] 5MedCyd was incorporated into DNA as thymidylate, and none was present as 5MeCyt . There are two conceivable metabolic pathways from 5MedCyd to thymidylate. The first consists of deoxycytidine or thymidine kinase and deoxycytidylate deaminase, and the second of sequential reactions catalyzed by deoxycytidine deaminase and thymidine kinase. No indication of the first pathway was demonstrable in human leukemic cells. We conclude that the DNA exclusion of 5MeCyt from exogenous 5MedCyd takes place because of powerful deoxycytidine deaminase activity in human malignant hematopoietic cells.","['Jekunen, A', 'Vilpo, J A']","['Jekunen A', 'Vilpo JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B200GV71QM (5-methyldeoxycytidine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1984 May;25(3):431-5.,,,,,,,

Objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to verify the incidence and the cause of early death in a wide population of children with ALL and (2) to elucidate factors associated with early death and therefore to identify ""high-risk"" groups of patients. Out of the 943 ALL patients, 39 (4.1%) early deaths were registered.

Two patients died during the first week of unknown cause. Thirteen factors measured at diagnosis and possibly influencing the early death rate were analyzed. Using the chi-square test, only three of these factors (age, mediastinum status, surface markers) appear to have any significant influence on the early death rate. We also tried to determine how therapy influences this process by analyzing variations in the early death rate, other factors being equal.

Each of these six patients had bone marrow eosinophils that were abnormal in morphology on light and/or electron microscopy and by cytochemical stains.

Results of craniospinal irradiation.,359-64,"Fourteen children were treated for isolated meningeal relapse occurring seven to 44 months (median, 14 months) after prophylactic cranial irradiation (2,400 rad/12 fractions) and intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX, 12 mg/m2 for four doses during cranial irradiation). Eight had ""high-risk"" acute lymphocytic leukemia with age less than 2 years, white blood cell counts greater than 20,000, or T cell markers. Treatment for central nervous system leukemia included IT MTX (12 mg/m2 twice weekly until clearance of spinal fluid cytology) followed by craniospinal irradiation (CSI, 3,000 rad/20 fractions to the cranium and 1,800 rad/12 fractions to the spine). No maintenance IT MTX was given. Systemic chemotherapy was continued or reinstituted for a minimum of one year after CSI. No instance of second meningeal relapse has occurred. Five patients remain in secondary complete remission 66+, 54+, 36+, 26+, and 24+ months after meningeal relapse. Disease-free survival was limited by marrow relapse in eight patients (2-20 months after CSI) and testicular relapse in one. No acute toxicities were noted with CSI. Myelosuppression occurred in seven patients. Infections within two months of CSI were noted in five. No neurologic sequelae are apparent. Serial neuropsychometric studies in 10 patients revealed a significant decline in mean values on Global IQ scales. Long-term survival with acceptable toxicity is possible following aggressive, prompt treatment of meningeal relapse occurring after prophylactic cranial irradiation. Hematologic relapse remains the major obstacle to long-term disease-free survival.","['Kun, L E', 'Camitta, B M', 'Mulhern, R K', 'Lauer, S J', 'Kline, R W', 'Casper, J T', 'Kamen, B A', 'Kaplan, B M', 'Barber, S W']","['Kun LE', 'Camitta BM', 'Mulhern RK', 'Lauer SJ', 'Kline RW', 'Casper JT', 'Kamen BA', 'Kaplan BM', 'Barber SW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/prevention & control/*radiotherapy', 'Methods', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1984.2.5.359 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1984 May;2(5):359-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1984.2.5.359.,,,,,,,

The bulk of this evidence is derived from experiments in rodents and in-vitro culture studies. We have studied the spatial relationships between the stromal and haemopoietic components and their cellular composition in histological sections of bone marrow (BM) from seven healthy fetuses, 10 normal adults and over 60 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and chronic granulocytic leukaemia (CGL) at different stages of the disease. During the early developmental stage (16-18 weeks) fetal BM showed focal haemopoiesis with a characteristic spatial localization of haemopoiesis near bony trabeculae and around small blood vessels. In AML following the treatment-induced hypoplasia, large uniform unilocular fat cells arranged in groups designated 'structured fat' developed from scattered multilocular precursor fat cells. Early foci of haemopoietic regeneration were present almost exclusively in areas of structured fat. In the marrow of patients with CGL in blast transformation (BT) treated by intensive therapy and autografting with cryopreserved haemopoietic stem cells, the haemopoiesis was focal. Clusters of regenerating erythroid precursors or of megakaryocytes were seen in intimate contact with marrow sinusoids and granulopoietic precursors in intimate association with small blood vessels and also in close contact with the endosteal surface of bony trabeculae. We conclude that the endosteal cells, fat cells and the vascular endothelial cells comprise the critical non-haemopoietic stromal elements of human BM. The close associations observed between the regenerating haemopoietic cells and the stromal cells provide strong evidence in support of the existence of a permissive haemopoietic micro-environment in man and emphasize the structural and functional interrelationships that exists between bone, fat, the microvascular system and haemopoiesis in human bone marrow.","['Islam, A', 'Catovsky, D', 'Goldman, J M', 'Galton, D A']","['Islam A', 'Catovsky D', 'Goldman JM', 'Galton DA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Communication', 'Fetus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1984.tb02343.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1984 Mar;8(2):293-313. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1984.tb02343.x.,,,,,,,

Bestatin effectively inhibited the growth of both tumors in vivo. The inhibition observed for colon 26 was the largest when bestatin was administered on days 1 to 5 after transplantation of the tumor. The inhibition of C1498 was the largest when bestatin was administered on days 7 to 11. In contrast to these results, bestatin was not at all inhibitory to either tumor line in vitro. Thus, the effect of bestatin administration on the functions of the spleen cells of mice bearing tumors was examined. Spleen cells taken from mice bearing colon 26 and C1498 did not neutralize the corresponding tumor. However, when bestatin was administered to these mice, spleen cells from the administered mice did neutralize the corresponding tumor.

This inhibition is overcome and repair appears to be stimulated by the poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide (3-AmB). The repair activity of older cultures is much diminished compared to those rapidly dividing, but the 3-AmB effect is seen in both 2- and 7-day cultures. The action of 3-AmB is very rapid and its removal results in a diminution of repair synthesis within 30 min. U.v.-induced repair synthesis was not affected by 3-AmB. However, the level of u.v.-induced repair synthesis was drastically reduced by treatment of cells with MMS. This MMS inhibition of u.v.-induced repair synthesis was completely counteracted by the presence of 3-AmB. Insofar as the effective action of 3-AmB is on poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, the data suggest that activation of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis by alkylation of DNA reduces the NAD and therefore the ATP level in the lymphoblastoid cells used.

M1 cells yielded two subclones: Mk1 cells, which were Ia+ and migrated specifically toward MCF-c; and Mm1 cells, which were Ia- and migrated specifically toward MCF-a and -b. These differences show the heterogeneity of the biologic activities of the MCFs in the presence of cell line cells. M-1 cells, blast cells, when grown in continuous culture, migrated toward none of the MCFs . Upon differentiation to mature macrophage-like cells in conditioned medium (M+1 cells), however, they migrated to MCF-a, -b, and -c and the experimental evidence points to the possibility that M+1 cells are separated into subpopulations on the basis of their chemotactic response. Cytotoxic treatment of M+1 cells with anti-Ia antisera resulted in the specific decrease of activity toward MCF-c. Furthermore, MCF-c attracted Ia-positive M+1 cells, while MCF-a and -b attracted Ia-negative M+1 cells. Thus, our results indicate the existence of two migrating subpopulations of M+1 cells with specificities for MCF-a, and -b and for MCF-c, respectively.

When assessed in vitro, NK cells in six of eight patients lysed K562 target cells to a greater extent when incubated with interferon-alpha A (1 ng/ml) than with the same concentration of interferon-alpha D. However, when patients were evaluated collectively, no significant difference was detectable in the effectiveness of the two subtypes in enhancing NK cell activity. Patients received the same interferons given as four injections which were randomized with respect to subtype and were separated by intervals of six or more days. NK cell activity was consistently elevated in peripheral mononuclear cells sampled 24 hr but not seven days after injection as compared to peripheral mononuclear cells sampled just prior to each injection (p less than 0.001 for both subtypes). At a given dose level, both interferon subtypes resulted in comparable NK cell activation. However, a negative correlation existed between the amount of interferon administered and the magnitude of enhancement (p less than 0.05). In 16 separate paired determinations, there were eight in which NK cell activity was lower after the second injection of an interferon dose than after the first injection of the same dose (15 or 45 micrograms, irrespective of subtype), and eight in which the alternate pattern occurred. Thus, repeated injection in the same patient of one or the other dose resulted in no consistent changes in the extent of NK cell stimulation. Since the two interferons have a 20-fold difference in specific antiviral activity for human amnion cells and up to an 80-fold difference in human fibroblasts, either different mechanisms are involved in antiviral and NK cell-stimulatory activity, or activities of these two subtypes for cells of different histogenesis vary. Greater NK cell-stimulatory activity therefore occurred at the lowest tested doses, a dose which was less than 10% of previously reported maximally tolerated doses of these interferons.","['Edwards, B S', 'Hawkins, M J', 'Borden, E C']","['Edwards BS', 'Hawkins MJ', 'Borden EC']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/therapy']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jul;44(7):3135-9.,,,,,,,

For this reason, the production of GAGs during the induction of myelocytic and macrophage-like differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cloned cell line HL60/HGPRT- was studied. The major GAG component of HL60/HGPRT- was chondroitin 4-sulfate. This molecule has been reported to be the major GAG constituent of normal granulocytes and myeloid leukemia cells as well. Treatment of HL60/HGPRT- cultures with dimethyl sulfoxide, which initiates myeloid maturation, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate, which induces the formation of macrophage-like cells, resulted in a 43 and 34% reduction, respectively, of the incorporation of [35S]sulfate into total GAGs at a time when greater than 80% of the cells were morphologically immature and were unable to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium dye. This reduction occurred primarily in GAGs associated with the cells, which decreased by 75% after exposure to these agents. Therefore, the distribution of GAGs between the cellular and medium compartments was altered by exposure to inducers. A phorbol ester with no capacity to induce differentiation, 4 alpha-phorbol-12, 13-didecanoate, elicited a reproducible but less dramatic decrease in cell-associated GAGs. The reduction in [35S]-sulfate incorporation into GAGs, therefore, may be an important step in leukocyte differentiation and may provide a useful biochemical probe of the maturation process.","['Luikart, S D', 'Maniglia, C A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Luikart SD', 'Maniglia CA', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*toxicity', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*deficiency', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity', 'Time Factors']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jul;44(7):2907-12.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-07001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Three acquired characteristics, cytotoxic resistance, cytodifferentiative resistance, and double minute chromosomes (DM), were monitored at successive 6-TG selection levels. Approximately 200-fold resistance to the cytotoxic effect of 6-TG was acquired at the first selection step, and it neither increased at higher 6-TG selection levels nor reverted to greater sensitivity in cells subcultured off of drug. This was due to the irreversible loss of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity. In contrast, a lesser, not completely quantifiable, degree of resistance developed to the cytodifferentiative effects of the purine nucleobases hypoxanthine and 6-TG which varied as a function of 6-TG selection pressure. Numerous DM, not observed in the parental wild-type HL-60 cells, appeared at 6-TG (0.5 micrograms/ml) selection which varied substantially in parallel with 6-TG selection pressure up to 6-TG (20 micrograms/ml). At higher selection levels (50 micrograms/ml or prolonged culture on 20 micrograms/ml), a marked decrease in DM occurred which was associated with the acquisition of new marker chromosomes. The most consistent marker was a chromosome 6 with additional material in the short arm (6p+); this was noted as a single copy in the basal 6-TG/20 subline but as two copies (trisomy 6; 2p+) in independently selected higher 6-TG-resistant subcultures. These cytogenetic findings suggest the presence of amplified genes which increased in number and shifted from a predominance in extra-chromosomal DM to intrachromosomal sites as a function of 6-TG selection. Among the 6-TG-resistant sublines, there was no change or a decrease in the amplification level of the known amplified oncogene c-myc from that demonstrated in parental HL-60 cells. Although proof requires detailed analyses with specific gene probes, the overall results imply that: (a) the cytotoxic component of the resistance is due to an invariant loss of HPRT which, therefore, is not likely to be related to amplified genes; (b) the cytodifferentiative component of the resistance is due to a positively selectable mechanism which could be directly or indirectly related to 6-TG-selected amplified genes; and (c) variations in the cytogenetic indicators of amplified genes and the resistance to 6-TG cannot be simply ascribed to quantitative variations in c-myc amplification.","['Gallagher, R E', 'Ferrari, A C', 'Zulich, A W', 'Yen, R W', 'Testa, J R']","['Gallagher RE', 'Ferrari AC', 'Zulich AW', 'Yen RW', 'Testa JR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Clone Cells', 'Drug Resistance', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jun;44(6):2642-53.,,,,,,,

While both Marek's disease cell lines exhibited overall phenotypes similar to those of T-lymphocytes, the lymphoid leukosis cell line possessed characteristics in common with either immature lymphocytes or cells of the reticuloendothelial system. The specific patterns of CFA expression on these lymphoid tumor cells may be related to the particular level of differentiation blockage during tumorigenesis as has been proposed for erythroblastosis. The lymphoid leukosis cell line exhibited a pattern of CFA expression that would not distinguish between the possibility of differentiation blockage versus retrogenic expression. Since CFA is known to be associated with a series of cell surface glycoproteins, the exact relationship between individual molecules, the level of lymphoid differentiation, and changes associated with tumorigenesis may now be examined.","['Trembicki, K A', 'Qureshi, M A', 'Dietert, R R']","['Trembicki KA', 'Qureshi MA', 'Dietert RR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Ia-like antigens, avian)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chickens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Rosette Formation']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jun;44(6):2616-21.,,,,,,,

Antineoplastic drugs such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, daunorubicin, and actinomycin D caused early inhibition of DNA synthesis, which generally preceded the accrual of differentiation markers. In contrast, retinoic acid and conditioned medium from mitogen-stimulated leukocytes caused a delayed decline in DNA synthesis, which accompanied the appearance of maturing morphology. With 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the decline in DNA synthesis was temporally linked to the onset of maturation, and this agent evidenced some properties of both the antineoplastic agents and the more physiological inducers, retinoic acid and conditioned medium. Antineoplastic agents and conditioned medium, when applied simultaneously, induced differentiation in an additive or synergistic manner, simulating the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. RNA and protein synthesis continued during maturation induced with all these agents, although a partial reduction in RNA synthesis was observed at later time points (greater than or equal to 24 hr). Agents incapable of inducing differentiation, such as cordycepin and cycloheximide, were characterized by a lack of sustained inhibition of DNA synthesis and/or by early (3 hr) inhibition of RNA or protein synthesis. The decline in DNA synthesis caused by the inducing agents was accompanied by decreased cell cycle progression, cells accumulating largely in G1 phase. With daunorubicin and actinomycin D, block of the G1-S transition was evident at 24 hr, whereas with conditioned medium and retinoic acid, accumulation in G1 occurred in a progressive fashion, greater than 77% of cells residing in this phase on Day 6. Maximal inducing doses of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (greater than 80% differentiation) caused an accumulation of cells in G1, as well as an accumulation of cells with a G2-M-phase DNA content (approximately 40%). These observations indicate that early inhibition of DNA synthesis, with sparing of RNA and protein synthesis, is characteristic of the differentiation-inducing antineoplastic drugs examined. These agents may induce differentiation by inhibition of the proliferation path, whereas conditioned medium and retinoic acid may act by the stimulation of differentiation paths. Differentiation can be enhanced by the simultaneous application of agents targeting both of these paths.","['Craig, R W', 'Frankfurt, O S', 'Sakagami, H', 'Takeda, K', 'Bloch, A']","['Craig RW', 'Frankfurt OS', 'Sakagami H', 'Takeda K', 'Bloch A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dactinomycin/*toxicity', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/toxicity', 'Tritium', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1984/06/01 00:00,1984/06/01 00:01,['1984/06/01 00:00'],"['1984/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Jun;44(6):2421-9.,['CA-12585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

There was a higher frequency of a variant Ph1 among black patients compared with whites. The significantly higher frequency of a variant among our patients compared with surveys from elsewhere could be due to differing environmental agents. Simple variants were detected in four patients. Complex variants were found in eight cases; in one of these patients, only chromosomes #9 and #22 were involved, but a complex rearrangement of chromosome #9 had occurred. A ""masked"" Ph1 translocation was detected in two cases, both of which showed monosomy #22 because the Ph1 chromosome was incorporated or interchanged with chromosome #9. Karyotypic evolution of the Ph1-positive cell line was observed more frequently in the variant group (71.4%) than the standard group (29.5%). This difference was significant (p less than 0.005). There was no difference in the type of clonal changes seen in standard and variant groups. The majority of clonal changes were observed during the acute stage in both groups. In the variant group, there was no obvious correlation between the type of variant, type of clonal change, blast morphology, or survival. Their initial survival pattern resembled that of Ph1-negative cases, but those patients who survived longer than 1 year showed a survival trend similar to standard Ph1-positive cases.

A Pediatric Oncology Group study.,207-10,"One hundred four children with advanced leukemia in relapse (74 with acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL] and 30 with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia [ANLL]) received AMSA (4'-(9-Acridinylamino) methanesulfon -m-anisidide) at a dose of 120 mg/m2/day for 5 days (Regimen I) or 60 mg/m2/day for 10 days (Regimen II). Children with ALL were randomized between Regimens I and II (31 and 36 evaluable patients, respectively). All 29 evaluable patients with ANLL were treated on Regimen I. Eighty-eight percent of evaluable patients experienced severe or life-threatening toxicity, with no statistical differences between Regimens I and II. Bacterial or fungal infections (considered life-threatening or fatal) occurred in 17 children with ALL and in 7 with ANLL. Fatal cardiac toxicity occurred in one patient. Complete or partial response occurred in 25.0% (SE = 8.8%), 28.1% (SE = 8.0%), and 25.9% (SE = 8.4%) of evaluable patients on ALL Regimen I, ALL Regimen II, and ANLL, respectively. However, responses were of short duration (16-91 days). There was no significant difference in the duration of survival from treatment start for the two ALL regimens (P = 0.46). The median duration of survival for ANLL patients was significantly longer (P = 0.004) than that of ALL patients treated on Regimens I and II combined. Eighty-two percent of the complete or partial responses (18 of 22) occurred after the first course of AMSA. At the dose schedules investigated, and in a heavily pretreated patient population, AMSA had activity in childhood leukemia. However, the high incidence of severe, life-threatening, or fatal infections meant that the quality and quantity of responses and survival was not commensurate with the toxicity, and that it would be difficult to incorporate this drug into combination chemotherapy with other myelosuppressive agents.","['Krischer, J', 'Land, V J', 'Civin, C I', 'Ragab, A H', 'Mahoney, D H', 'Frankel, L S']","['Krischer J', 'Land VJ', 'Civin CI', 'Ragab AH', 'Mahoney DH', 'Frankel LS']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Aminoacridines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Pancytopenia/chemically induced', 'Random Allocation']",1984/07/15 00:00,1984/07/15 00:01,['1984/07/15 00:00'],"['1984/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19840715)54:2<207::aid-cncr2820540205>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Jul 15;54(2):207-10. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19840715)54:2<207::aid-cncr2820540205>3.0.co;2-0.,"['CA-20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

From this, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia was classified into three groups in which the therapeutic response was examined. The leukemic cells of Group I were medium or large and were negative or weakly positive to peroxidase. These cells were characterized by their location in the upper part of the normal lymphocyte distribution. The leukocyte differential count, measured by a computer on the basis of the distribution picture, showed an increase in large unstained cells (LUC) and lymphocytes. The leukemic cells of Group II were large and positive to peroxidase and were characterized by their location in the right upper part, across the region of LUC, monocytes, basophil and neutrophil leukocytes as seen in the distribution picture. The findings of Hemalog-D showed an increase in LUC, remainder and neutrophil leukocytes. The leukemic cells of Group III were medium-sized and moderately or strongly positive to peroxidase. This group was characterized by their location in the lower part of normal neutrophil leukocytes and Hemalog-D showed an increase in neutrophil leukocytes. A total of 71 patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were assessed according to this classification. Group I (14 patients): 11 with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 2 with acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) and 1 with acute myelomonocytic leukemia ( AMMoL ); Group II (17 patients): 7 with AML and 10 with AMoL; Group III (40 patients): 28 with AML, 4 with AMoL, 1 with AMMoL and 7 with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).

A five- to tenfold amplification was correlated with high levels of expression of normal size c-myb messenger RNA and with chromosomal abnormalities in the region 6q22 -24, where the c-myb locus is normally located. Amplification and cytogenetic abnormalities were detected in DNA's from primary and secondary cultures of ML cells, suggesting that they may have contributed to leukemogenesis. The similar AML cell lines HL-60 and ML's contain different amplified oncogenes: c-myc and c-myb, respectively. Alternative activation of structurally and possibly functionally similar oncogenes may distinguish--at the pathogenetic level--phenotypically similar tumors.","['Pelicci, P G', 'Lanfrancone, L', 'Brathwaite, M D', 'Wolman, S R', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Pelicci PG', 'Lanfrancone L', 'Brathwaite MD', 'Wolman SR', 'Dalla-Favera R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes']",1984/06/08 00:00,1984/06/08 00:01,['1984/06/08 00:00'],"['1984/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.6585957 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1984 Jun 8;224(4653):1117-21. doi: 10.1126/science.6585957.,"['P30 CA-16087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 05399/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The NN/AN/AA classification had good prognostic value (CR rate and survival) in patients under 59 years, but not in older patients. In those patients over 59, a significant difference in CR rate and survival appeared between cases with NPF and those without. For each feature having an established relationship to survival, a panel of prognostic points was determined as follows: age over 59 (1 point), AA karyotype in patients under 59 (2 points), NPF in patients over 59 (1 point).

Bone marrow suppression represented the dose-limiting toxicity, and was related to plasma CdA levels, cumulative drug dosage, and the rapid release of CdA that accompanied tumor cell lysis.","['Carson, D A', 'Wasson, D B', 'Beutler, E']","['Carson DA', 'Wasson DB', 'Beutler E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', ""4753-04-2 (2'-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine)"", 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Deoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/chemical synthesis/toxicity', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', '*Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Radioimmunoassay']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.81.7.2232 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Apr;81(7):2232-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.7.2232.,"['31459/PHS HHS/United States', 'RR 00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC345472,,,,,

The results showed that 51Cr release was not a valid measure of tumor cell lysis in vivo. Prior exposure to 55 degrees C for 30 minutes caused Ib to lyse immediately after iv injection. Prior X-irradiation (10,000 R) enhanced the lysis of Ib in vivo but had only minor effects on IbN. In normal mice 125I-labeled Ib were entrapped in the lungs (approximately to 95%) immediately after iv injection, released in a diphasic manner, and then accumulated in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. In immune mice initial entrapment of Ib in the lungs was only about 42%, and label did not accumulate in the described organs. Heat-inactivated Ib were not retained to a significant degree in any of the organs of normal or immune mice. IbN were retained initially (2 hr) at values lower than Ib in the whole body, lungs, and livers of normal mice. 125I-labeled Ib were used to analyze how they were distributed and lysed in normal and immune mice during the first 6 hours after iv injection. To account for the loss of 125I from a tissue because of cell lysis (as distinct from cell redistribution), the amount of 125I associated with cells and blood plasma, and lost from the whole body, was quantified.

The females had a standardized cancer incidence ratio (SIR) of 112 (P less than .01). A significant excess of lung cancer (SIR = 141) and excesses of brain (SIR = 168) and ovarian cancer (SIR = 134) of borderline significance were observed. No significant cancer risk was evident for female cosmetologists licensed since 1935, even for those with 35 years or more of follow-up, although the SIRs for brain cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia were elevated. Female cosmetologists who entered the profession between 1925 and 1934, however, experienced a significant overall cancer incidence (SIR = 129) and significant excesses of respiratory, breast, corpus uterine, and ovarian cancers. Those with 35 years or more from time of first license appeared to be at the highest risk. Among males the overall cancer incidence rate was close to that expected (SIR = 105). Smoking habits and reproductive factors that could not be taken into account may explain some of the excesses among females. Although no specific occupational agent could be identified, the excess numbers of leukemias in females and brain cancers among males and females merit continued surveillance.","['Teta, M J', 'Walrath, J', 'Meigs, J W', 'Flannery, J T']","['Teta MJ', 'Walrath J', 'Meigs JW', 'Flannery JT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Adult', '*Beauty Culture', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Tobacco Use Disorder/complications']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1984 May;72(5):1051-7.,"['CA-20890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'OH-00780/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Divergent influence of alkyl chain length on the dihydrofolate reductase affinity and cytotoxicity of methotrexate monoesters.,605-9,"n-Octyl, n-dodecyl, and n-hexadecyl alpha- and gamma-esters of methotrexate (MTX) were compared with the previously described alpha- and gamma-n-butyl esters and with MTX as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and human leukemic lymphoblasts (CEM cells) in culture. The overall order of activity in both test systems was MTX greater than MTX gamma-esters greater than MTX alpha-esters. In the DHFR assay the activity of the alpha-esters followed the order C4 greater than C8 congruent to C12 greater than C16, whereas for the gamma-esters this order was C4 congruent to C8 greater than C12 greater than C16. On the other hand, the order of cytotoxic activity in culture in both series was C16 greater than C12 greater than C8 greater than C4. Increasing the alkyl chain length in the ester moiety therefore decreases DHFR affinity but increases cytotoxicity. The most potent member of the compounds tested was the gamma-n-hexadecyl ester, whose IC50 against CEM cells was 0.11 microM as compared with 0.025 microM for MTX. In a comparison of the effect of treatment with the gamma-n-hexadecyl ester (10(-5) M, 1 h) on DNA synthesis in CEM and CEM/MTX cells, the latter of which are 120-fold resistant to MTX by virtue of a transport defect, the ester produced only 4-fold less inhibition in the resistant line than in the parental line. These results suggest possible use of this compound or related derivatives in the treatment of MTX-resistant tumors with impaired transport.","['Rosowsky, A', 'Forsch, R A', 'Yu, C S', 'Lazarus, H', 'Beardsley, G P']","['Rosowsky A', 'Forsch RA', 'Yu CS', 'Lazarus H', 'Beardsley GP']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00371a009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1984 May;27(5):605-9. doi: 10.1021/jm00371a009.,"['CA 18662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The optimal harvesting time was 9.5 to 11.5 h after release from block, considerably later than the 6 h time previously assumed in studies using stimulated lymphocytes.

The mean white cell count in these 10 patients at presentation was 360,000/microliter, as compared to a mean of 137,000/microliter in 80 CML patients over 20 yr of age seen during the same time interval (p less than 0.02). Analyses of all 90 cases revealed a significant decrease in the average leukocyte count at presentation with increasing age. The childhood cases also had a significantly higher proportion of blood blasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes than did the adult subjects (p less than 0.01). Signs of leukostasis were present in 12% of adult cases as compared to 60% of the 10 childhood cases, and in these 6 subjects, the mean white cell count was 510,000/microliter. In these 6 patients, leukapheresis and/or chemical therapy was initiated rapidly, and this was followed by complete resolution of the clinical signs of leukostasis. A review of the literature from 1960 to 1982 identified 61 childhood cases that were reported with the usual type of CML. In this group, the frequency of hyperleukocytosis and the distribution of white cell counts corresponded very closely to the 10 cases studied at the University of Rochester. Thus, the usual type of CML presenting in childhood differs from that of adults in that hyperleukocytosis, blood granulocyte immaturity, and leukostatic central nervous system, retinal, and respiratory signs are significantly more common and extreme and merit rapid cytoreductive treatment.","['Rowe, J M', 'Lichtman, M A']","['Rowe JM', 'Lichtman MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Viscosity', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Hematocrit', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/mortality/physiopathology', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*blood/mortality/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/pathology/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'New York']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83442-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 May;63(5):1230-4.,['HL 18208/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Long-term culture reveals the persistence of Ph1-negative progenitors in treated as well as newly diagnosed patients.,1172-7,"We recently showed that long-term marrow cultures can be used to demonstrate the presence of Philadelphia (Ph1) negative progenitors in patients with newly diagnosed Ph1-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We now report results for 6 chronic phase patients studied 5-83 mo postdiagnosis and an additional 3 newly diagnosed patients. Marrow metaphases were exclusively Ph1-positive. Clonogenic assays revealed a minor population of Ph1-negative progenitors in 3 cases (1 treated, 2 untreated). Long-term marrow culture adherent layers contained Ph1-negative progenitors in 6 cases (3 treated, 3 untreated). Whenever this occurred, the Ph1-negative population had become the only one detectable within 3-4 wk, and this was always associated with a rapid decline of the Ph1-positive population. For 2 of the 3 cases where Ph1-negative progenitors were not detected, there was a similar rapid decline in the Ph1-positive population in culture. In the other case, Ph1-positive progenitors were maintained at levels typically seen in normal long-term marrow cultures. These results suggest that chromosomally normal stem cells may persist for a considerable period in the marrow of some, but perhaps not all, patients with CML, even in the face of maintenance chemotherapy. In addition, they provide new evidence of heterogeneity in this disease, as shown by the variable ability of Ph1-positive progenitor populations to be maintained in vitro.","['Dube, I D', 'Kalousek, D K', 'Coulombel, L', 'Gupta, C M', 'Eaves, C J', 'Eaves, A C']","['Dube ID', 'Kalousek DK', 'Coulombel L', 'Gupta CM', 'Eaves CJ', 'Eaves AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83433-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1984 May;63(5):1172-7.,,,,,,,

The neurone-specific gamma enolase value rose appreciably in nearly all patients during the first two weeks of treatment, which comprised chemotherapy only, but the mean values for this isoenzyme failed to show any further rise during the subsequent cranial irradiation. In contrast the alpha enolase value, which is derived predominantly from glial tissue, rose progressively to attain its highest value during radiotherapy.

The mechanism of acquired resistance of tumor cells to some agents is related to intracellular drug accumulation and retention. For example, in vincristine (VCR)- and adriamycin (ADM)-resistant tumor cell sublines, these agents can be shown to enter the cell but are actively transported to the outside. This results in a relatively low intracellular level of drug and thus to low cytotoxicity. These observations suggest that if we could control the VCR- and ADM-efflux function of resistant tumor cells appropriately, then we could expect a reversal of acquired resistance to these drugs in drug resistant tumor cells. We found that calcium channel blockers and calmodulin inhibitors enhance the intracellular level of vincristine and adriamycin in tumor cells, especially in drug-resistant mouse and human tumor cells by inhibiting their outward transport. The approach using calcium modifiers has the following advantages. (1) Reversal of acquired resistance to vinca alkaloids and anthracyclic antibiotics can be attained. Calcium channel blockers, such as verapamil, diltiazem, nicardipine, niludipine and nimodipine, at doses of 30 to 125 mg/kg administered daily for 10 days with VCR (10-200 micrograms/mg) enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of VCB (40-50% increase in life span) in P388/VCR-bearing mice. The calcium channel blockers also enhanced the therapeutic effect of ADM in ADM resistant P388 bearing mice. (2) The approach is also effective for the reversal of the inherent resistance of tumor cells to anticancer agents. Less sensitive tumor cells became more susceptible to VCR and the heterogeneity in drug sensitivity among tumor clones has been circumvented. (3) The approach with these calcium modifiers is also effective against other antitumor agents which are transported outside the cells by the similar mechanisms. As one of the mechanisms of cross-resistance is explained by the enhanced drug efflux from resistant tumor cells, antitumor agents which show cross-resistance to VCR and ADM become effective against resistant tumor cells by this approach. The mechanism of this approach is now under investigation. These calcium modifiers enhance the cellular level of antitumor agents by inhibiting their outward transport. The functions of cellular calcium and calmodulin in the membrane architecture and membrane functions might be involved in this process. Clinical evaluation is now under progress by using diltiazen, nicardipine and verapamil.","['Tsuruo, T']",['Tsuruo T'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Studies on the relationship between drug concentration and the appearance of hemoglobin demonstrated that the more the rate of cell division was reduced during the 4 days of exposure, the higher was the accumulation of hemoglobin per cell. Considering the variation in the intracellular protein content during the response, it appears that adriamycin (40 nM) stimulated the synthesis of both hemoglobin and non-hemoglobin proteins while hemin, a well-known erythroid inducer, specifically increased hemoglobin synthesis. In addition, the lack of cell growth was associated with a recruitment of benzidine-positive cells. In contrast to hemin, adriamycin did not modify the electrophoretic pattern found in untreated cells.","['Jeannesson, P', 'Ginot, L', 'Manfait, M', 'Jardillier, J C']","['Jeannesson P', 'Ginot L', 'Manfait M', 'Jardillier JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Benzidines', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1984 Jan-Apr;4(1-2):47-51.,,,,,,,

Antibodies to apolipoproteins and endogenous heparin were not detected as previously reported. Fatty acid analysis of the triglyceride esters revealed a high proportion of stearic-acid (18:0) which was associated with a slower in vitro degradation of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by human milk lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This suggests that a cause of the hyperlipidemia could be abnormal composition of triglycerides which render the VLDL a poor substrate for lipoprotein lipase. Hyperlipidemia in leukemia may be more prevalent than previously realized since nine other cases of newly diagnosed ALL have been studied who had moderate hypertriglyceridemia associated with elevated ApoB and low ApoA-I levels, but normal triglyceride composition. These findings suggest that the abnormal triglyceride composition is a late feature of the hyperlipidemia in leukemia, as observed in the case studied.","['Blackett, P R', 'Koren, E', 'Blackstock, R', 'Downs, D', 'Wang, C S']","['Blackett PR', 'Koren E', 'Blackstock R', 'Downs D', 'Wang CS']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Apolipoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, VLDL)', '0 (Stearic Acids)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Apolipoproteins/blood', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/*etiology/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*complications/metabolism', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, VLDL/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Stearic Acids/blood', 'Triglycerides/blood']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 1984 Mar-Apr;14(2):123-9.,,,,,,,

This patient was delivered of a normal, 3140 g, male infant by Caesarian section in the 38th gestational week and 1 month later she died of her disease. One patient (AML, promyelocytic type) who presented in the 10th week of pregnancy underwent elective abortion while in remission after induction treatment. The patient with ALL gave birth to a normal, full-term, male infant by Caesarian section. The two other patients (AML) had spontaneous deliveries of normal male infants in the 37th and 38th weeks of pregnancy. Growth and development of three of the children are normal at 12, 36, and 37 months of life while the fourth child was lost to follow-up evaluation. The disease relapsed in all mothers but they are still alive at 15 (ALL), 37, and 42 months after diagnosis.

The main primary disorders included multiple myeloma, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast carcinoma. Acute leukemia developed earlier in patients treated by chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy than in patients treated by radiotherapy alone (63 months, range 24-132 months; 201 months, range 48 months to 30 years, respectively). 13 patients presented without organomegaly and 8 were pancytopenic. Abnormalities of myeloid and erythroid cell lines were observed in the majority of the patients. A high rate of acute erythroleukemia (5 out of 14) was found. Increased reticulin fibers were found in 3 patients. The leukemia was invariably refractory to treatment with a median survival of 4 months. The possible role of preexisting abnormal marrow structure in the development of therapy-related leukemia is discussed.","['Brenner, B', 'Carter, A', 'Sharon, R', 'Tatarsky, I']","['Brenner B', 'Carter A', 'Sharon R', 'Tatarsky I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000225798 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncology. 1984;41(2):83-7. doi: 10.1159/000225798.,,,,,,,

G was cytocidal (inhibited growth greater than 90%) to MELC at greater than 10 microM, but not at less than 5 microM in medium supplemented with 10 and 15% fetal calf serum (FCS). Five micromolar of G was cytocidal in 2 and 5% FCS. Serum albumin (2%) also decreased the effective cytocidal dose of G. This inhibition was reversible if extracellular drug (30 microM) was removed after 1 h but not after 24 h. Uptake of [14C]G by MELC (approximately 10(6) cells/ml) was saturable with half-maximal uptake at 8 microM in the absence of FCS. This uptake was concentrative, i.e., 75-fold relative to the total [14C]G concentration. In the presence of both FCS (approximately 2%) and serum albumin (approximately 0.03%), the accumulation of [14C]G (10 microM) by MELC was decreased approximately 50%. Direct binding of G to albumin, assayed by quenching of intrinsic fluorescence, was stoichiometric with respect to micromolar albumin content suggesting an apparent affinity of approximately 10(-7) M. Visible absorption spectra for G in the presence of serum albumin exhibited batho- and hyperchromic shifts of the maxima at approximately 380 nm. These studies demonstrate that: 1) G, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations, is cytocidal for MELC; 2) serum protein, e.g., albumin, can reduce both the cytocidal effects of G and the uptake of [14C]G by MELC; and 3) these effects are probably the result of G binding to serum protein, e.g., albumin, which reduces the free effective concentration of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Haspel, H C', 'Ren, Y F', 'Watanabe, K A', 'Sonenberg, M', 'Corin, R E']","['Haspel HC', 'Ren YF', 'Watanabe KA', 'Sonenberg M', 'Corin RE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gossypol/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 1984 Apr;229(1):218-25.,,,,,,,

The monoclonals were directed against four antigens (Thy-1.2, H-2k, Ly 2.1, Ly 9.2). None was as effective in ADCC as allo-anti-Thy-1.2 serum or rabbit anti-mouse spleen serum, even at plateau levels of killing. Monoclonals gave the highest levels of ADCC at relatively low amounts of antibody bound to targets; increasing the amount of bound antibody by 10- to 100-fold did not increase murine macrophage-mediated cytotoxicity. In contrast, ADCC using alloantiserum continued to increase over the same range of antibody bound to the tumor targets. The activity of individual monoclonals was not enhanced by the presence of various dilutions of normal mouse or rabbit serum, suggesting that the superiority of the allo- and hetero-antisera was due to their content of heterogeneous antibodies. IgG monoclonals of different isotypes and recognizing different antigens gave enhanced ADCC in combination; monoclonals to the same antigen did not. An IgM anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal was inactive in ADCC and inhibited the activity of IgG monoclonals of the same specificity. These studies show that IgG antibodies of different specificity and class can collaborate in ADCC, and that this cooperative effect is not due simply to increased amounts of antibody bound to the tumor targets.","['Ralph, P', 'Nakoinz, I']","['Ralph P', 'Nakoinz I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.35.1.131 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1984 Jan;35(1):131-9. doi: 10.1002/jlb.35.1.131.,['AI 15811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

In contrast to the almost constant results observed for normal myeloid colony formation, in patients there were apparent individual variations. Strong inhibition of colony formation by PGE1 was observed in three cases. In one case, enhancement rather than inhibition was observed. These in vitro inhibitory or stimulatory effects of PGE1 were not related to the degree of the in vivo proliferation of leukemia cells. Morphologic analysis of colonies revealed that preferential inhibition of monocytic colony formation by PGE1, characteristic of normal bone marrow cultures, was not always observed in leukemia cell cultures. These abnormal responses to PGE1 suggest that the proliferation and differentiation of leukemic progenitor cells are regulated in a different way from normal hemopoiesis.","['Ozawa, K', 'Miura, Y', 'Suda, T', 'Motoyoshi, K', 'Takaku, F']","['Ozawa K', 'Miura Y', 'Suda T', 'Motoyoshi K', 'Takaku F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cell Cloning,International journal of cell cloning,8308172,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",IM,"['Alprostadil', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*physiopathology', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/stem.5530010603 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cell Cloning. 1983 Dec;1(6):440-50. doi: 10.1002/stem.5530010603.,,,,,,,

The loss of methotrexate transport during differentiation resulted from a 15-fold decrease in the Vmax for the influx while the Km remained unchanged. Inducer dose dependencies for hemoglobin accumulation and loss of methotrexate influx were similar. A dimethyl sulfoxide-resistant variant of MELC did not express complete accumulation of hemoglobin or loss of methotrexate transport when treated with dimethyl sulfoxide. The decrease of folate influx during differentiation was not a result of: 1) changes in cell densities or growth phase; 2) growth-related changes of the medium; or 3) a direct inhibition of folate influx by the inducers. Loss of folate compound transport correlated with MELC differentiation.,"['Corin, R E', 'Haspel, H C', 'Sonenberg, M']","['Corin RE', 'Haspel HC', 'Sonenberg M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acetamides)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1984/01/10 00:00,1984/01/10 00:01,['1984/01/10 00:00'],"['1984/01/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/10 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)43642-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Jan 10;259(1):206-11.,"['AM 26572/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-27612/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

This technique is applicable to the study of malignant effusions and hematopoietic tumors. The tumor cells are centrifuged to form a pellet and the pellet is resuspended in the presence of bovine fibrinogen to form a jelled clot. This clot is cut into fragments which are implanted beneath the renal capsule of normal mice. The growth of the tumor cells from ovarian adenocarcinoma obtained from ascitic fluid is better than that of tumor fragments from the solid tumors. This is probably a reflection of the greater viability of tumor cells from ascitic fluids. The sensitivity to chemotherapy was the same for the solid tumor and its malignant effusions.,"['Stratton, J A', 'Micha, J P', 'Rettenmaier, M A', 'Braley, P S', 'DiSaia, P J']","['Stratton JA', 'Micha JP', 'Rettenmaier MA', 'Braley PS', 'DiSaia PJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Gynecol Oncol,Gynecologic oncology,0365304,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'CISCA protocol']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Ascites/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-8258(84)90075-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Gynecol Oncol. 1984 Feb;17(2):185-8. doi: 10.1016/0090-8258(84)90075-1.,,,,,,,

The inhibitory effect of leukemic cells on burst formation by normal BFU-E was detected only at a high concentration (5 X 10(5)/ml). Leukemic-cell-conditioned medium (LCCM) was prepared by adding 1.25-10 X 10(6)/ml leukemic cells to culture medium. LCCM caused a dose-dependent inhibition of burst formation by normal BFU-E, but the medium prepared from normal cells did not. To examine the influence of fluoxymesterone (FM) on the inhibition of burst formation, we added 10(-10)-10(-7) M FM to the culture medium. Inhibition of burst formation by normal BFU-E was reduced from 73.4% to 58.2%-63.1%. These results suggest that FM stimulates proliferation and differentiation of normal BFU-E that are affected by inhibitory factors produced by leukemic cells.","['Bai, G Z', 'Hara, H', 'Nagai, K']","['Bai GZ', 'Hara H', 'Nagai K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,['9JU12S4YFY (Fluoxymesterone)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Line', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Fluoxymesterone/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1984 Mar;12(3):171-6.,,,,,,,

Sixty-four febrile episodes (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C) occurred during 37 periods of neutropenia (less than 0.5 X 10(9)/l). In all of 41 microbiologically or clinically documented infections the maximum CRP level exceeded 30 mg/l, and in 25 it was greater than 100 mg/l. In no case in which the CRP level remained below 30 mg/l for 48 hr after the onset of fever was any clinical or microbiological evidence of infection obtained. The CRP level during documented infection began to fall 24-48 hr after appropriate treatment was begun. A CRP level above 30 mg/l in neutropenic patients was associated with early recurrence of fever if systemic antibiotics were discontinued. Graft-vs-host disease, without infection, did not result in high levels of CRP.","['Starke, I D', 'de Beer, F C', 'Donnelly, J P', 'Catovsky, D', 'Goldman, J M', 'Galton, D A', 'Pepys, M B']","['Starke ID', 'de Beer FC', 'Donnelly JP', 'Catovsky D', 'Goldman JM', 'Galton DA', 'Pepys MB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,['9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'C-Reactive Protein/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fever/blood', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/complications', 'Humans', 'Infections/blood/complications', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0277-5379(84)90076-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1984 Mar;20(3):319-25. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(84)90076-2.,,,,,,,
