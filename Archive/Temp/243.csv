It also assessed diagnostic standards for viral hepatitis infections and their prevalence in BMT candidates. Sixty-three EBMT centers from 22 countries participated in the survey. Median pre-transplant prevalences of HBsAg and anti-HCV positivity were 3.5% (range 0-15%) and 5% (range 0-45%), respectively. Forty-six (73%) centers adopt the policy of cancelling or postponing BMT in patients with ALT abnormalities but in four of these centers, BMT is not delayed when progressive disease or acute leukemia is present. In 17 institutions (27%) BMT was reported to be carried out irrespective of transaminase values. Data on fatal post-BMT liver disease were provided by 45 centers. The overall mortality rate for liver failure was 4.5% (258 of 5788) with no differences between centers performing or not performing BMT in cases of ALT elevation. These results indicate that there is strong concern in most European BMT units about performing BMT in the presence of ALT elevation and prospective studies on its real impact on fatal post-BMT liver disease should be conducted.","['Locasciulli, A', 'Alberti, A', 'de Bock, R', 'Cordonnier, C', 'Einsele, H', 'Engelhard, D', 'Grundy, J', 'Reusser, P', 'Ribaud, P', 'Ljungman, P']","['Locasciulli A', 'Alberti A', 'de Bock R', 'Cordonnier C', 'Einsele H', 'Engelhard D', 'Grundy J', 'Reusser P', 'Ribaud P', 'Ljungman P']","['Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hepatitis Antibodies)', '0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)', '0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)']",IM,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/mortality', 'Contraindications', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis B/complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/blood', 'Hepatitis C/complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/*complications/diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/*complications/mortality', 'Patient Selection', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Nov;14(5):833-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recipient might also profit by an enhanced graft-versus-leukemia reaction exerted by the high number of natural killer cells contained in such grafts. The donor could be spared the discomfort and risks of general anesthesia and marrow harvesting. Primary transplantation of unmanipulated allogeneic PBPCs has not been reported so far because the vast amount of T cells contained in the collection product was thought to cause severe graft-versus-host disease. We present preliminary data on primary transplantation of allogeneic PBPCs in patients who either suffered from advanced leukemia or had a donor unable to undergo general anesthesia. Eight patients with a median age of 42 years suffering from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in first remission (n = 3), AML in third remission, AML in relapse (n = 2), acute lymphoblastic leukemia in second remission, or chronic myelogenous leukemia in accelerated phase received myeloablative therapy followed by transplantation of unmanipulated allogeneic PBPCs mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 to 10 micrograms/kg of body weight of filgrastim administered for 5 to 6 days) in their HLA-identical donors. Hematopoietic reconstitution was achieved in all patients with a median of 15.5 (16.5) days after transplant needed to surpass an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 (1.0) x 10(9)/L. The median time to an unsupported platelet count greater than 20 (> 50) x 10(9)/L was 19.5 (41) days after grafting. Three patients did not exhibit signs of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), grade I disease was seen in one patient, and three patients experienced grade II disease limited to the skin. The only patient with severe acute GVHD (grade III) refused to take his oral cyclosporin regularly and had ineffective serum levels for most of the time until relapse. Six of eight patients are currently alive without evidence of disease between 61 and 533 days after grafting; two patients grafted for AML in relapse achieved a complete remission after transplantation but relapsed again and died of leukemia on days +48 and +70, respectively. Primary transplantation of unmanipulated allogeneic PBPCs is feasible and results in long-term engraftment without causing detrimental GVHD.","['Schmitz, N', 'Dreger, P', 'Suttorp, M', 'Rohwedder, E B', 'Haferlach, T', 'Loffler, H', 'Hunter, A', 'Russell, N H']","['Schmitz N', 'Dreger P', 'Suttorp M', 'Rohwedder EB', 'Haferlach T', 'Loffler H', 'Hunter A', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1995/03/15 00:00,1995/03/15 00:01,['1995/03/15 00:00'],"['1995/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 15;85(6):1666-72.,['S0006-4971(20)68781-X [pii]'],,['Blood. 1995 Jul 15;86(2):836-7.

We used a series of polymorphic markers mapped to chromosome 7 to test this hypothesis in 22 children with MPS and MDS, including 19 with JCML. All MPS and MDS samples demonstrated allelic heterozygosity with at least one chromosome 7 marker; 16 were heterozygous with probes from both 7p and 7q. Furthermore, the percentage of patient bone marrow samples heterozygous at each locus tested was similar to the frequency observed in the normal population. Whereas these data demonstrate that submicroscopic loss of large segments of chromosome 7 alleles is uncommon in children with MPS and MDS who do not have Mo 7, they do not exclude small deletions around an uncharacterized tumor-suppressor locus. Our results suggest that a number of distinct molecular events contribute to leukemogenesis, and we propose a multistep model to explain the similarities and differences between the major subtypes of childhood MPS and MDS.","['Butcher, M', 'Frenck, R', 'Emperor, J', 'Paderanga, D', 'Maybee, D', 'Olson, K', 'Shannon, K']","['Butcher M', 'Frenck R', 'Emperor J', 'Paderanga D', 'Maybee D', 'Olson K', 'Shannon K']","['Department of Pathology, U.S. Naval Hospital, Oakland, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Male', 'Monosomy/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Syndrome']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995 Jan;12(1):50-7. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870120109.,['10.1002/gcc.2870120109 [doi]'],,,"['3M01 RR01271-13S1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the reason for the clustering of the breakpoints and the underlying mechanism of the chromosomal translocation, we characterized the joining sequences of der(15) and der (17) by polymerase chain reaction in samples from eight patients with APL. There was no cluster of the breakpoints within the introns, and no consensus sequence-motif was found around them. One or nine extra nucleotides were inserted into two joining sites. There were identical stretches of one to seven nucleotides between the PML and RARA genes in the majority of the joining sequences. These data provide a potential model of the t(15;17) translocation: random DNA double strand cleavage, modification of DNA ends by enzymes including terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, and single strand base-pairing within identical short stretches. Furthermore, APL develops only when the PML and RARA genes are rearranged, within restricted genomic regions and a functional PML-RARA chimeric product is produced, and this might lead to a clustering of the breakpoints.","['Yoshida, H', 'Naoe, T', 'Fukutani, H', 'Kiyoi, H', 'Kubo, K', 'Ohno, R']","['Yoshida H', 'Naoe T', 'Fukutani H', 'Kiyoi H', 'Kubo K', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University Branch Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1995 Jan;12(1):37-44. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870120107.,['10.1002/gcc.2870120107 [doi]'],,,,"['GENBANK/S76369', 'GENBANK/S76370', 'GENBANK/S76371', 'GENBANK/S76372', 'GENBANK/S76373', 'GENBANK/S76375', 'GENBANK/S76379', 'GENBANK/S76382', 'GENBANK/S76387', 'GENBANK/S76389', 'GENBANK/S76395', 'GENBANK/S76397', 'GENBANK/S76399', 'GENBANK/S76402', 'GENBANK/S76405']","['PML', 'RARA']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Low valence FNR ligands such as glycine-arginine-glycine-aspartate-serine (GRGDS) are the most potent stimulators of the cell cycle regulatory kinase cdc2. Partial synchronization and Western blotting studies suggest that GRGDS affects cdc2/cyclin A complexes in cells in S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. These studies suggest that FNR-mediated growth control appears to be a common feature of transformation.

If horizontal transmission of SLV and PL occurs in infected chinook salmon, it is most likely to occur after the second viremic period begins.","['Eaton, W D', 'Folkins, B', 'Kent, M L', 'Dawe, S', 'Newbound, G C', 'Zinkl, J']","['Eaton WD', 'Folkins B', 'Kent ML', 'Dawe S', 'Newbound GC', 'Zinkl J']","['Biology Department, Malaspina University College, Nanaimo, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Vet Microbiol,Veterinary microbiology,7705469,"['0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fish Diseases/etiology/*virology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/etiology/*veterinary/virology', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/blood', 'Retroviridae/*chemistry/pathogenicity', '*Salmon', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/*isolation & purification', 'Viremia/etiology/*veterinary/virology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Microbiol. 1994 Nov;42(2-3):217-27. doi: 10.1016/0378-1135(94)90020-5.,"['0378-1135(94)90020-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1135(94)90020-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine the most efficient strategy, we have compared three known methods, using consensus primers against the VH FR3 or FR2 (FR256) regions, or a mix of six primers against the FR1 region (FR1f), with a new approach using a consensus primer against FR1 (FR1c), never previously described for diagnostic purposes, on DNA from 89 monoclonal B-cell proliferations (16 ALL, 28 CLL/PLL, 15 myelomas, 30 NHL). We obtained a detection rate of 70% for FR3, 64% for FR1f and 77% and 78% for FR256 and FR1c, respectively. Polyclonal lymphocytes and mature T cell malignancies tested negative for all systems. Differences in the detection rate were related not only to the choice of VH primer but also the JH primer(s) used and the pathological subtype. All strategies led to adequate detection of leukaemic DNA, whereas the detection rate in myeloma varied between strategies from 47 to 80% and that of follicular lymphoma from 13 to 63%. The lowest detection rates were observed in follicular lymphoma and in mature CD5 negative proliferations, reflecting the probable correlation between somatic mutation and PCR false-negativity. The combined use of FR1c and FR256 allowed detection in at least one system of 92% of cases overall and at least 75% in all pathological subtypes, thus providing a simple, reliable and rapid non-radioactive system for the detection of B cell clonality.","['Aubin, J', 'Davi, F', 'Nguyen-Salomon, F', 'Leboeuf, D', 'Debert, C', 'Taher, M', 'Valensi, F', 'Canioni, D', 'Brousse, N', 'Varet, B']","['Aubin J', 'Davi F', 'Nguyen-Salomon F', 'Leboeuf D', 'Debert C', 'Taher M', 'Valensi F', 'Canioni D', 'Brousse N', 'Varet B', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, CHU Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD5 Antigens', '*Clone Cells', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'False Negative Reactions', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):471-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The leukemic stem cell might also be characterized by the expression of CD34 and the absence of differentiation markers. Bone marrow samples of 33 AML patients, including 10 patients both at presentation and after relapse, were double labeled for CD34 and CD33. In 14/33 AML less than 1% of the labeled cells were found in the CD34+/33- fraction. After relapse a certain shift towards a more primitive phenotype was observed, but in 4/5 relapsed AML the CD34+/33- fraction remained below 1%. Single cells from the different subfractions were cultured and showed heterogeneous cluster and colony growth in both the CD34-/33+ and CD34+/33+ fraction. More colonies were observed in the CD34+/33- fraction. In AML with a more 'mature' phenotype (low number of CD34+/CD33- cells), highly proliferative myeloid, erythroid and mixed colonies could be cloned exclusively from this small CD34+/33- fraction. In five patients with numerical chromosomal abnormalities all these highly proliferative colonies appeared disomic using in situ hybridization (ISH) with centromeric probes. Based on these data we conclude that the CD34+/33- cell fraction in AML with a more mature immunophenotype (small fraction of cells CD34+/33-) comprise residual normal progenitors, while no primitive leukemic progenitors could be identified.","['Raymakers, R', 'Wittebol, S', 'Pennings, A', 'Linders, E', 'Poddighe, P', 'De Witte, T']","['Raymakers R', 'Wittebol S', 'Pennings A', 'Linders E', 'Poddighe P', 'De Witte T']","['Department of Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Separation', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/immunology/*pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):450-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effector cells involved in GVL, by studying the role of these cells in purging of the cell line K562 in short-term bone marrow cultures. The effect of the addition in vitro of rGCSF was also studied. Monitoring of purging was achieved by cytotoxicity assays, DNA analysis and the use of the polymerase chain reaction for the detection of bcr/abl transcripts in the Philadelphia positive (Ph+) K562 cell line. Supernatants from IL-2-treated and non-treated bone marrow were tested for cytokine production (TNF alpha and IFN gamma). The results have shown that the main cytotoxic effector cells in the bone marrow generated by IL-2 have the CD56+ CD8+ phenotype. Overnight incubation of bone marrow was sufficient to generate cytotoxic cells as measured by Chromium51 (Cr51) release assays. Measurable levels of TNF alpha but not IFN gamma were also detected in supernatants. Addition of TNF alpha and IFN gamma to the IL-2 in the bone marrow cultures augmented the cytotoxicity but tended to inhibit progenitor cell growth as measured by granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) and erythroid blast-forming unit (BFU-e) assays. An estimate of the purging of the marrow could also be achieved by DNA analysis of K562 DNA in bone marrow. The bcr/abl transcript could still be detected by PCR analysis in marrow containing 1% K562 and treated with IL-2 for 24 h, but by 6 days of incubation the bcr/abl transcript was weak or undectable. The results suggest that although reduction in the proportion of leukaemia in contaminated marrow can be detected after incubation with IL-2 for 24 h, complete elimination of minimal residual disease requires longer incubation times.","['Dickinson, A M', 'Middleton, S L', 'Latham, J', 'Dunn, J', 'Thomas, L', 'Proctor, S J']","['Dickinson AM', 'Middleton SL', 'Latham J', 'Dunn J', 'Thomas L', 'Proctor SJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*drug effects/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):444-9.,,,,,,['bcr-abl'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Two growth factor-sensitive AML cell lines and the peripheral blood blast cells from 10 patients with AML were studied in culture for sensitivity to IDA and DNR under four culture conditions; cells were grown either in methylcellulose or suspension culture in the presence of G-CSF or GM-CSF. Normal bone marrow cells were cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of IDA or DNR under conditions suitable for the detection of BFU-E and CFU-C. Dose-response curves for AML blast cells were characterized by an initial shoulder and then an exponential decrease in survival. Marked patient-to-patient variation was observed for both portions of the survival curves. IDA was significantly more toxic to blast cells than DNR, especially for more sensitive cell populations. Consistent differences in drug sensitivity in the four culture conditions were not observed. BFU-E and CFU-C dose-response curves of normal marrow progenitors resembled those of AML blast cells but in contrast fell within a narrow range. The culture studies support the clinical finding in AML of modest superiority of IDA over DNR. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of AML blasts in culture suggests an opportunity to individualize treatment. Preclinical studies may help in developing such a therapeutic approach.","['Curtis, J E', 'Minden, M D', 'Minkin, S', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Curtis JE', 'Minden MD', 'Minkin S', 'McCulloch EA']","['Department of Medicine, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Mar;9(3):396-404.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequent clinical trials have also demonstrated major activity with fludarabine in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. Fludarabine was noted to be an active agent in indolent lymphoma in phase I/II studies. Approximately 60% of patients with follicular lymphoma respond to fludarabine when it is administered as a single agent. Many of these remissions are complete remissions despite patients having received extensive prior therapy. Combination programs are being developed for application in CLL and indolent lymphoma. Because of the activity of fludarabine in inhibiting DNA repair, it has been combined with cisplatinum and cytosine arabinoside and plans are in place to explore the radiation sensitizing effect of fludarabine in clinical trials.

ERG is a member of the ETS gene family and is fused with EWS in a subset of Ewing's sarcomas. EWS in 22q12 has a very high homology with FUS (also called TLS) in 16p11; the latter gene is rearranged in the t(12;16)(q13;p11) that characterizes myxoid liposarcoma. To investigate whether FUS is involved in the t(16;21) of AML, we used the Southern blot technique and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to examine the bone marrow of a 3-year-old boy with a t(16;21)(p11;q22)-positive AML. Hybridization of Southern blot filters containing digested DNA with probes for FUS and ERG showed both germline and aberrant fragments. Using specific primers for the 5' part of FUS and the 3' part of ERG, we amplified a 4.4 kb genomic FUS/ERG DNA fragment from the leukemic sample. In a second PCR experiment, in which we used primers upstream of the 5' part of ERG and downstream of the 3' part of FUS, a 5.6 kb fragment was amplified. Blotting and hybridization with specific probes for FUS and ERG revealed that the amplified fragments consisted of FUS/ERG and ERG/FUS hybrid DNA. Both PCR fragments, when used as probes, detected germline ERG and FUS as well as aberrant fragments on Southern blot filters. The results suggest that the t(16;21) in AML leads to rearrangement and fusion of the FUS and ERG genes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Panagopoulos, I', 'Aman, P', 'Fioretos, T', 'Hoglund, M', 'Johansson, B', 'Mandahl, N', 'Heim, S', 'Behrendtz, M', 'Mitelman, F']","['Panagopoulos I', 'Aman P', 'Fioretos T', 'Hoglund M', 'Johansson B', 'Mandahl N', 'Heim S', 'Behrendtz M', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein FUS)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994 Dec;11(4):256-62. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870110408.,['10.1002/gcc.2870110408 [doi]'],,,,,"['ERG', 'FUS']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the 11q13 breakpoint region was extended on both sides, centromeric to the MTC and telomeric to PRAD1. We report here the molecular cloning of a new t(11;14) breakpoint site, 20 kb centromeric to the MTC, from a patient with prolymphocytic leukemia. We subcloned a non-repetitive DNA fragment near the breakpoint and mapped this new 11q13 probe (pHO11c) relative to already identified breakpoint sites, using long- and short-range physical mapping within the BCL1 locus. Rearrangements in the BCL1 locus are associated with deregulation of the PRAD1 gene, which is often overexpressed, particularly in mantle-cell malignancies. The detectable but weak PRAD1 expression in the case we present suggests that this breakpoint centromeric to the MTC still lies inside the BCL1 locus boundaries. We think that attention should be focused on this region centromeric to the BCL1-MTC, where the investigation of previously unidentified translocations may increase understanding of the PRAD1 gene deregulation in t(11;14) associated pathologies.","['Galiegue-Zouitina, S', ""Collyn-d'Hooghe, M"", 'Denis, C', 'Mainardi, A', 'Hildebrand, M P', 'Tilly, H', 'Bastard, C', 'Kerckaert, J P']","['Galiegue-Zouitina S', ""Collyn-d'Hooghe M"", 'Denis C', 'Mainardi A', 'Hildebrand MP', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C', 'Kerckaert JP']","['U.124 INSERM, Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer de Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Centromere', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994 Dec;11(4):246-55. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870110407.,['10.1002/gcc.2870110407 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/S76351'],"['BCL1', 'PRAD1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular cytogenetic analysis and cloning of a few t(3;21) cases indicate that the breakpoints are quite heterogeneous even within a specific clinical phenotype. Interestingly some of the (3;21) breakpoints involve the AML1 gene previously found rearranged in the t(8;21) associated with acute myelogenous leukemia. AML1 is related to the Drosophila gene runt and is the human counterpart of the gene for the alpha subunit of the nuclear polyoma enhancer binding protein (PEBP2) also known as the core binding factor (CBF). In the t(3;21) AML1 was found rearranged with EAP, a gene on chromosome 3 encoding a small ribosomal protein, as well as with EV11, another gene on chromosome 3. Here we report our study of six cases of t(3;21). By using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and AML1 probes we could conclude that at least in two CML-BC cases the breakpoint occurred in the AML1 intron that is disrupted by the t(8;21). An AML1/EAP fusion transcript, different from the one described in a therapy-related myelodysplasia, was detected in both CML-BC cases. This transcript is expected to result in a predicted protein containing the AML1 nuclear binding domain with an attached stretch of 17 amino acids unrelated to the EAP small ribosomal protein. In the other t(3;21) patients we could not detect an AML1/EAP transcript or an AML1/EV11 transcript. This result suggests heterogeneity of the t(3;21) at the molecular level. The AML1 chimeric transcripts identified so far, both in the t(3;21) and in the t(8;21), diverge from the normal transcripts either after exon 5 or exon 6. Here we show that in normal AML1 transcripts different splicing events are seen to occur after AML1 exon 5 as well as exon 6.","['Sacchi, N', 'Nisson, P E', 'Watkins, P C', 'Faustinella, F', 'Wijsman, J', 'Hagemeijer, A']","['Sacchi N', 'Nisson PE', 'Watkins PC', 'Faustinella F', 'Wijsman J', 'Hagemeijer A']","['Department of Biology and Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Probes', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994 Dec;11(4):226-36. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870110405.,['10.1002/gcc.2870110405 [doi]'],,,,"['GENBANK/S76343', 'GENBANK/S76345', 'GENBANK/S76346', 'GENBANK/S76350']",['AML1'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We found the BrdU-labelled cells infiltrating selectively into the milky spots in the omentum. Furthermore, we intraperitoneally inoculated the BrdU-labelled P388 cells at 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) cells per mouse into three groups of ten CDF1 mice and then quantified the distribution of the BrdU-labelled cells by counting the number of the labelled cells per unit area at each milky spot and non-milky spot site in the omentum. Inoculations of 10(5), 10(6) and 10(7) BrdU-labelled P388 cells per mouse resulted in 15.8 +/- 13.3, 120 +/- 46.5 and 504 +/- 208 cells mm-2 respectively in the milky spot sites and 9.14 x 10(-3) +/- 1.58 x 10(-2), 1.14 x 10(-1) +/- 7.82 x 10(-2) and 7.07 x 10(-1) +/- 5.98 x 10(-1) cells mm-2 respectively in the non-milky spot sites. The ratios of the mean labelled cell numbers in the milky spot sites vs those in the non-milky spot sites were 1728:1, 1049:1 and 713:1 respectively. In all cases, there were statistically significant differences in the number of BrdU-labelled cells mm-2 between milky spot sites and non-milky spot sites. However, the ratios decreased as the numbers of inoculated cells increased. In addition, we inoculated C57/BL mice intraperitoneally with B-16 PC melanoma cells, which were easily differentiated from the other cells by the intrinsic black melanin, and examined the distribution of the cells macro- and microscopically. The B-16 PC melanoma cells were also found to be infiltrating preferentially into the milky spots in the omentum.

Cholesterol pullulan (10 micrograms/ml) emulsified alpha-linolenic acid (20 micrograms/ml) was recommended as an additional form serum free medium. We determined the fatty acid composition in all neutral lipids, free fatty acids and all phospholipids in alpha-linolenic acid-treated cells. In all cases the concentration of alpha-linolenic acid and docosahexenoic acid (DHA, 22:6 (n-3)) was increased, while linolenic acid (18:2 (n-6)) was slightly and arachidonic acid (20:4 (n-6)) was markedly decreased. Content of histamine in alpha-linolenic acid-treated cells was remarkably lower than that of untreated cells. Accordingly, net histamine release stimulated by antigen or A23187 was also markedly decreased in the alpha-linolenic acid-treated cells, as was the percent histamine release stimulated by antigen. Results from our in vitro experiment suggest that the anti-allergic effect of alpha-linolenic acid may be caused either by the decrease in histamine content or by inhibition of the release of chemical mediator resulting from changes in the fatty acid composition.","['Kawasaki, M', 'Toyoda, M', 'Teshima, R', 'Sawada, J', 'Saito, Y']","['Kawasaki M', 'Toyoda M', 'Teshima R', 'Sawada J', 'Saito Y']","['National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,"['0 (Dietary Fats, Unsaturated)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-6)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Glucans)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '0RBV727H71 (alpha-Linolenic Acid)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholesterol/chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dietary Fats, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Emulsions', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/chemistry', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-6', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Glucans/chemistry', 'Haptens/pharmacology', 'Histamine H1 Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Linolenic Acid/*pharmacology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1994 Oct;17(10):1321-5. doi: 10.1248/bpb.17.1321.,['10.1248/bpb.17.1321 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In summary, the present study shows that the use of the CD117 antigen in different monoclonal antibodies combinations may be of great help for the detection of minimal residual disease in a high proportion of AML cases, especially in those patients displaying the CD117+/CD15+ phenotype, because cells coexpressing both antigens in normal BM, if present, are at very low frequencies.","['Macedo, A', 'Orfao, A', 'Martinez, A', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Valverde, B', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Macedo A', 'Orfao A', 'Martinez A', 'Vidriales MB', 'Valverde B', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*immunology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):338-41. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03309.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03309.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VCAM-1 was demonstrated on > 20% blasts in 4/22 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and 6/10 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) specimens but was absent from CD34+ normal bone marrow precursor cells. Interestingly, the VCAM-1+ AMLs classified as M1 and M5 simultaneously expressed N-CAM (CD56), a member of the immunoglobulin family. In ALL, VCAM-1 expression was restricted to Calla+ CD19+ precursors of the c-ALL subtype. VCAM-1 was also found on some cell lines, mainly of the B-lymphocytic type. Furthermore, in 13/20 chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) samples > 20% of the CD19+ B-lymphocytic precursors carried VCAM-1, which seemed to correlate with more advanced disease. Therefore VCAM-1 expression appeared to characterize leukaemic cells of the B-cell lineage as well as a CD56+ subset of AML. Since its expression was clinically correlated with dermal infiltrates of leukaemic cells in AML and with advanced Rai stages in CLL, VCAM-1 may play a role in enhanced adhesion of the malignant cells to tissues and/or to each other.","['Reuss-Borst, M A', 'Ning, Y', 'Klein, G', 'Muller, C A']","['Reuss-Borst MA', 'Ning Y', 'Klein G', 'Muller CA']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Medical University Clinic, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Fluoroimmunoassay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Feb;89(2):299-305. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03304.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb03304.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditions underwhich AFP led to increases in thymidine incorporation were found to promote activation induced cell death (AICD) associated with adherence in 96 well plates. The ensuing death was judged to be apoptosis based on morphology, shrinkage of dying cells, inducibility, reversibility, a sensitivity to levels of FCS, kinetics, DNA fragmentation pattern and internal program (passage number) of the cells investigated. Both AFP and the 167H.1 MAb but not the 167H.4 MAb blocked the induction of cell death under these conditions indicating apparent growth enhancement by AFP relates to the abrogation of cell death and not that AFP contains bona fide growth factor-like activity. We additionally report that HL-60 cells spontaneously senescence during normal propagation in vitro which correlated with an increased susceptibility to and earlier kinetics of AICD. In substantiation of this was the correlation of the loss of expression of the AFPr with increasing passage number and the induction of AICD. Overall, our findings lend further support to the recent proposals that AFP by binding to AFP receptors may block cellular senescence and that there may be differential expression of AFPr isoforms related to commitment (167H.1 reactive) or resistance (167H.4 reactive) of cells to apoptosis/programmed cell death (PCD).","['Laderoute, M P', 'Pilarski, L M']","['Laderoute MP', 'Pilarski LM']","['Department of Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', '0 (alpha-fetoprotein receptor, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cellular Senescence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Receptors, Peptide/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/immunology/*pharmacology']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1994 Nov-Dec;14(6B):2429-38.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the results obtained with primary cells, this effect could not be inhibited by preincubating the cell line with recombinant human interleukin-4 (rh IL-4). This deficiency in response to the cytokine was not caused by a general unresponsiveness of MONO-MAC-6 cells to IL-4. Thus, the expression of the monocyte-associated differentiation markers CD14 and monocyte-specific esterase (MSE), upregulated by long-term stimulation with LPS, could be decreased by IL-4. Long-term LPS treatment apparently induced IL-4 responsiveness of the cell line. While IL-4R alpha mRNA was upregulated about 3-fold, this positive effect was not apparent at the cell surface protein level. In contrast to the constitutive alpha chain expression, the IL-4R gamma chain expression could not be detected with a specific mAb nor by Northern blot analysis. However, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated the presence of low-level IL-4R gamma chain mRNA in the cell line.

Northern Region Haematology Group.",231-7,"A 4-year prospective study of de novo acute myeloid leukaemia in patients aged 56 years and over was undertaken in the Northern Region of England (population 3.09 million). The study was conducted to assess the incidence and outcome of treatment in all elderly patients diagnosed between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 1991. Two hundred cases de novo AML were confirmed, giving an incidence of 6.05/10(5) per annum (age specific population) (95% Cl, 5.2-6.9). Acute promyelocytic leukaemia was rare. Erythroleukaemia, monocytic leukaemia and AML with trilineage myelodysplasia were more common than in younger patients. Karyotypic abnormalities classically associated with response to therapy were present in only six of 91 patients where cytogenetic data was available. Treatment was at the discretion of the physician in charge: if given, specific treatment was recorded and clinical outcome assessed. Only 84 (42%) of patients received treatment with curative intent. Forty-four of 84 achieved a complete remission, usually of brief duration. A normal karyotype in leukaemic cells was associated with a survival advantage in this group (p < 0.05). Actuarial overall survival at 4 years for the entire group was 2.5%. Even with aggressive treatment, the outcome is poor. The pattern of disease and its lack of response to conventional treatment would support the hypothesis that AML in the elderly may differ biologically from that observed in younger patients. Karyotyping appears to predict those patients likely to benefit from intensive therapy and decisions about management in otherwise fit patients should, if possible, be delayed until a result is obtained. Every effort should be made to give such patients optimal treatment. However, most patients are unsuitable for aggressive treatment and, since long-term survival is rare, cure should not be offered as an inducement to accept such treatment and improving quality of life outside hospital should be the aim of treatment in this group.","['Taylor, P R', 'Reid, M M', 'Stark, A N', 'Bown, N', 'Hamilton, P J', 'Proctor, S J']","['Taylor PR', 'Reid MM', 'Stark AN', 'Bown N', 'Hamilton PJ', 'Proctor SJ']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Feb;9(2):231-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a bipotential oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cell line that can be manipulated in vitro to become either a type-2 astrocyte or to follow a linear sequence of events into becoming a mature oligodendrocyte. Using Northern and Western analyses in conjunction with immunocytochemistry we have demonstrated that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) cause a transient increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells. At maximal cytokine concentrations, the largest increase in GFAP protein levels were observed for CNTF and LIF; albeit, IL-6 did increase GFAP but the order of magnitude was 6-7 times less. Moreover, in trophic factor deprived medium, CNTF and LIF protected immature (O4+/MBP-) and mature (MBP+) oligodendrocytes from the apoptotic mode of cell death, while IL-6 had no effect in enhancing oligodendrocyte cell survival. Analysis of the cytokine-induced early response genes (ERGs) revealed a strong degree of overlap for CNTF and LIF. The effect of IL-6 was different in the degree to which the ERGs were up-regulated and in their temporal patterns of expression. These findings suggest that ERGs may be important, at least in part, for determining the extent of functional overlap observed within this cytokine family. Our findings clearly demonstrate differential regulation of oligodendrocyte survival and differentiation by the IL-6 family of cytokines.","['Kahn, M A', 'De Vellis, J']","['Kahn MA', 'De Vellis J']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, UCLA, School of Medicine 90024-1759.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Glia,Glia,8806785,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Astrocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cerebral Cortex', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Myelin Basic Protein/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Glia. 1994 Oct;12(2):87-98. doi: 10.1002/glia.440120202.,['10.1002/glia.440120202 [doi]'],,,"['HD-06576/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-07228/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that ligation of VLA beta 1 integrins on a number of cell types enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of pp125FAK. Cellular transformation by retroviral oncogene products or mitogenic neuropeptides also result in the activation of this kinase. On the basis of these observations, pp125FAK has been proposed to be a key regulatory molecule connecting cell adhesion, transformation, and growth. We have previously shown that ligation of VLA beta 1 integrins induced CD3-dependent T cell proliferation and stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of a molecular mass with a 105-kDa protein (pp105). Here we report that engagement of alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 integrins by adherence to their respective ligands stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of 105- to 120-kDa proteins (pp105 and pp120, respectively) in human H9 T-lymphoblastic cells. At least one component of the 105- to 120-kDa proteins was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated pp125FAK. While kinetics of adherence-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of pp120/pp125FAK and pp105 are closely similar, pp105 appeared to be distinct from pp125FAK. Given T cell costimulation induced by VLA beta 1 integrins and the putative functional role of pp125FAK in cell growth, tyrosine phosphorylation of these two distinct proteins may be involved in T cell activation and proliferation.","['Nojima, Y', 'Tachibana, K', 'Sato, T', 'Schlossman, S F', 'Morimoto, C']","['Nojima Y', 'Tachibana K', 'Sato T', 'Schlossman SF', 'Morimoto C']","['Division of Tumor Immunology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibronectin', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Mar;161(1):8-13. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1995.1002.,"['S0008-8749(85)71002-7 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1995.1002 [doi]']",,,"['AI12069/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR33713/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following exposure to specific antibodies, surface antigens are usually rapidly redistributed on the cell surface and internalized. A subsequent intracellular processing results in dissociation of the antigen-antibody complexes, degradation, exocytosis and recycling. AIAM plays an important role in MoAb-targeted therapy of hematopoietic malignancies contributing to escape of tumor cells from immunodestruction. On the other hand, internalization of MoAbs used as carriers of toxins and drugs is a prerequisite of therapeutic efficacy. Even though MoAbs directed against CD10 and CD19 have been used in immunotherapy of B cell malignancies, some aspects regarding AIAM of these Ags are not yet fully understood. Both Ags are modulated by specific MoAbs and internalized through the same pathway, however, the kinetics of AIAM vary from one Ag to another and from one cell type to another. Recent studies with malignant B-cell lines show that, under certain experimental conditions, the extent and rate of surface clearing, uptake and intracellular transport are considerably higher in the case of CD19 than in CD10 and higher in less mature cells compared with more mature cells. These observations may be useful in the selection of MoAbs for immunotherapy, although they need to be confirmed with fresh malignant B cells.","['Pulczynski, S']",['Pulczynski S'],"['University Department of Pathology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*pharmacology', '*Antigenic Modulation', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', 'Biological Transport', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neprilysin/*immunology/*metabolism']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Oct;15(3-4):243-52. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049720.,['10.3109/10428199409049720 [doi]'],,,,,['Ig'],,49,,,,,,,,,,

Isosmotic replacement of Na+ in the extracellular medium with the nonpermeant Na+ analogue choline+ or with glucose led to a significant increase in anti-IgE- (1/5000: 43.7 +/- 7.3% in high Na+ vs 68.9 +/- 7.3% in low Na+, mean +/- SEM, n = 8, P < 0.001), FMLP- (1 microM: 37.9 +/- 2.3% vs 49.5 +/- 4.3%, n = 8, P < 0.01) and PMA-(160 nM: 12.7 +/- 0.9% vs 27.3 +/- 4.3%, n = 8, P < 0.05) induced histamine release, whereas A23187-induced histamine release was reduced (1 microM: 90.4 +/- 2.4% vs 45.4 +/- 3.4%, n = 8, P < 0.0001). The progressive increase in extracellular Na+ concentration was accompanied by a decrease of basophil response to anti-IgE, FMLP and PMA; in contrast, A23187-induced histamine release was up-regulated by Na+. The Na+/H+ exchanger monensin, in the concentration range of 10(-8)-10(-4) M, exerted a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on anti-IgE-, FMLP- and PMA-induced histamine release, but not on A23187-induced histamine release. Extracellular Ca2+ up-regulated the histamine release induced by all the above stimuli. Removal of extracellular Na+ lowered the requirement of extracellular Ca2+ for anti-IgE, FMLP- and PMA-induced histamine release. In contrast with previous observations showing that Na+ supports histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells and rat basophilic leukaemia cells, these results indicate that Na+ strongly inhibits histamine release from human basophils stimulated by anti-IgE, FMLP and PMA, whereas it enhances Ca2+ ionophore A23187-induced histamine release. The effects of Na+, which are probably related to modulation of membrane potential and/or intracellular pH, vary depending on the cell type and the stimulus employed for cell activation.","['Tedeschi, A', 'Palella, M', 'Arquati, M', 'Milazzo, N', 'Miadonna, A']","['Tedeschi A', 'Palella M', 'Arquati M', 'Milazzo N', 'Miadonna A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Milan, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Pharmacol Res,Pharmacological research,8907422,"['0 (Antibodies)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Basophils/*drug effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Sodium/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacol Res. 1994 Oct-Nov;30(3):229-41. doi: 10.1016/1043-6618(94)80105-3.,"['1043-6618(94)80105-3 [pii]', '10.1016/1043-6618(94)80105-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early events induced upon cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI include tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc epsilon RI subunits and activation of the tyrosine kinase p72syk (Syk), which binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated Fc epsilon RI. Clustering of Syk, as a result of its interaction with aggregated Fc epsilon RI, may play a role in activating one or more of the signaling pathways leading to mediator release. To test this possibility, Syk was introduced into a model mast cell line (rat basophilic leukemia cells) as part of a chimeric transmembrane protein containing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD16 and CD7, respectively. Clustering of the Syk chimera, using antibodies against CD16, was found to be sufficient to stimulate early and late events normally induced by clustering of Fc epsilon RI. Specifically, aggregation of Syk induced degranulation, leukotriene synthesis, and expression of cytokine genes. Induction of mediator release was dependent on the kinase activity of Syk. Consistent with this finding, clustering of Syk also induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of a profile of proteins, including phospholipase C-gamma 1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase, similar to that induced upon clustering of Fc epsilon RI. These results strongly suggest that Syk is an early and critical mediator of multiple signaling pathways that emanate from the Fc epsilon RI receptor and give rise to the allergic response.","['Rivera, V M', 'Brugge, J S']","['Rivera VM', 'Brugge JS']","['ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Precursors/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/immunology', 'Leukotrienes/biosynthesis', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Vaccinia virus/immunology']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1995 Mar;15(3):1582-90. doi: 10.1128/MCB.15.3.1582.,['10.1128/MCB.15.3.1582 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC230382,,,,,,,,,

The results obtained with target Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-immortalized B cells and effector cells of different donors, showed that: (a) multiple in vitro treatments of lymphoblastoid cells with methyl-triazene-benzoic acid (MTBA, a triazene compound active in vitro), gave origin to lines that were more resistant than the parental lines to the antitumor effects of MTBA; (b) MTBA-treated lines were more susceptible (37.5% of cases), or less susceptible (31.2% of cases) to NI than parental cells.

A new anticancer drug with significant activity in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in patients with lymphoma.,75-92,"Fludarabine phosphate is a purine antimetabolite approved for use in the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Fludarabine works primarily by inhibiting DNA synthesis. The compound also possesses lymphocytotoxic activity with preferential activity toward T-lymphocytes. Initial preclinical studies demonstrated antitumor activity with fludarabine against L1210 murine leukemia. In phase I studies, myelosuppression was identified as the dose-limiting toxicity in patients with solid tumors and fatal neurotoxicity as the dose-limiting toxicity in adult patients with acute hematologic malignancies. The recommended dose and schedule was determined to be 18-25 mg/m2/d for five days, repeated every 28 days. Unlike preclinical studies, phase II trials showed a lack of significant effect when fludarabine was given to patients with solid tumors. However, phase II investigations have confirmed the efficacy of fludarabine in lymphoid malignancies, including non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, mycosis fungoides, prolymphocytic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The place of fludarabine in the management of leukemias in children is under investigation. Early results indicate an unusual degree of antitumor activity when the agent is used in combination chemotherapy for patients with refractory disease. Fludarabine is an effective antitumor agent in the management of lymphoid malignancies. Studies are ongoing to more completely define the role of fludarabine in these malignancies as well as in the pediatric leukemias. Additional studies evaluating the activity of fludarabine as an immunomodulator are warranted, due to the lymphocytotoxic properties associated with this agent.","['Rodriguez, G']",['Rodriguez G'],"['Division of Medicine/Oncology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio 78284-7884.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1994;12(2):75-92. doi: 10.1007/BF00874436.,['10.1007/BF00874436 [doi]'],,,['CA 09434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,96,,,,,,,,,,

The constitutional expression of the L-selectins (LECAM-1), LFA-1/CD11a, VLA alpha-4/CDw49d and ICAM-1/CD54 adhesion molecules was detected, and changes in their density after IFN-alpha stimulation were compared to results obtained by the high endothelial venule (HEV)-binding assay and a carbohydrate (phosphonomannan core polysaccharide: PPME and fucoidin) immobilization test. The LECAM-1 and ICAM-1 molecules were expressed on the great majority of CLL cells, while the LFA-1 and VLA-4 alpha-chains were expressed by only a small number of cells. Statistically significant changes (p < 0.001) were observed in LECAM-1 antigen density (changes in mean cell fluorescence), as well as in functional tests (HEV-, PPME- and fucoidin-binding; p < 0.01) after in vitro IFN-alpha stimulation. Based on a prior study (Jewell et al., Leukemia 1992: 6: 400-404) and on the present findings, not only an increased expression but also an enhanced function of the L-selectins seem to be well substantiated after IFN-alpha stimulation, which may explain the therapeutic effect of IFN-alpha in reducing the accumulation of leukaemic B cells in the blood.

To identify regulatory elements with this potential, we have analysed the transcriptional regulation of the murine stem cell antigen CD34. Within haemopoiesis CD34 is expressed in stem and early progenitor cells, but it is also expressed in certain non-haemopoietic cell types, including fibroblasts. Comparison of CD34 chromatin in haemopoietic progenitor cells (416B and M1) and fibroblasts (Swiss 3T6) revealed several DNase I hypersensitive regions, one of which, a cluster of sites centred 3 kb upstream of exon 1, was specific to haemopoietic progenitors. This element stimulated expression by approximately two orders of magnitude in CD34+ haemopoietic progenitors, but not in CD34+ fibroblasts or in CD34- haemopoietic cells (18.8). Enhancer function was dependent upon chromosomal integration, although position-independent expression was not obtained. However, largely position-independent expression was conferred by addition of a downstream element which was hypersensitive in all the cell types analysed. We conclude that the murine CD34 gene is regulated by a chromatin-dependent, upstream enhancer element which acts in conjunction with a downstream domain-controlling element to confer high level gene expression in haemopoietic progenitor cells.","['May, G', 'Enver, T']","['May G', 'Enver T']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, Chester Beatty Laboratories, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1995 Feb 1;14(3):564-74.,,,,,,,,,PMC398115,,,,,,,,,

The exact role these changes play in the process of secretion is unclear. Using confocal microscopy we now show that PMA+A23187 causes extensive F-actin rearrangements during secretion of [3H] 5-HT. We also describe for the first time the association of myosin with F-actin during this secretory process. In unstimulated cells, myosin and F-actin are concentrated at the plasma membrane with no evidence of stress fibres. Upon addition of PMA or A23187, both F-actin and myosin are rearranged into membrane ruffles and discrete aggregations (foci), followed by the formation of parallel stress fibres located on the ventral membrane. This is in contrast to reports in other cell types in which PMA has been described as causing the disruption of F-actin stress fibres. The time course of secretion coincides with the formation of the foci and ruffles whilst the stress fibres form after the majority of secretion has occurred. These changes are accompanied by a 40% decrease in cell height and a two-fold increase in cell spreading and they occur in the absence of extracellular calcium but are inhibited by the protein kinase C inhibitor, Bisindolylmaleimide, which also inhibits secretion. The formation of myosin-decorated stress fibres, foci, and ruffles is not sufficient to cause secretion, as PMA alone induces these changes without any secretion. The relevance of actin and myosin rearrangements for the regulation of secretion is discussed.","['Ludowyke, R I', 'Kawasugi, K', 'French, P W']","['Ludowyke RI', 'Kawasugi K', 'French PW']","[""Centre for Immunology, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton,Cell motility and the cytoskeleton,8605339,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Vimentin)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Actins/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Animals', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Histamine Release', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mast Cells/chemistry/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Myosins/*analysis/ultrastructure', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Tubulin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/analysis']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Motil Cytoskeleton. 1994;29(4):354-65. doi: 10.1002/cm.970290408.,['10.1002/cm.970290408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, complete eradication of the leukemic clone may not be a necessary prerequisite for long-term remission or cure. This observation limits the value of qualitative PCR analysis for prediction of progressive disease and highlights the need to monitor the proliferative activity of the malignant clone in order to permit timely detection of impending relapse. We have developed a quantitative PCR protocol based on the principle of competitive enzymatic amplification and demonstrated its applicability to the monitoring of treatment efficacy and early assessment of clonal expansion in patients with CML. We have introduced the term 'PCR relapse' for the detection of a proliferating leukemic clone by serial quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) analyses. At a recent meeting of the group of European Investigators on Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (EICML Group) the use of Q-PCR investigation has been recommended for the monitoring of MRD, and the detection of PCR relapse was accepted as a basis for therapeutic decisions. This article discusses problems in the interpretation of MRD by PCR and presents guidelines for the clinical use of qualitative and quantitative PCR analyses.","['Lion, T']",['Lion T'],"[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/therapy', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Oct;14(4):505-9.,,,,,,,,26,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients received both courses of IC as scheduled, 12 refused the second cycle. There was no significant difference in DFS or survival. Seventeen out of the 122 patients refused either IM or IC following early consolidation (""refusals""). They received no further treatment and served as control. Fourteen percent of all patients underwent autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) at different stages of their disease, equally distributed amongst the IM and IC-group.

Cells were removed from cultures and plated weekly in colony assays. The clonagenic cell output from cultures completely lacking SCF was lower over the first 2 to 3 weeks, but by 5 weeks was similar to the clonagenic cell output from the other culture conditions. Analysis of bcr/abl transcripts from individual colonies showed a lower percentage of malignant progenitors present in long-term cultures completely deficient in SCF than under the other culture conditions, particularly compared with primary human stroma-containing long-term cultures. SCF may specifically favor malignant versus benign progenitor cells present in the marrow of CML patients, and an abnormal proliferative response to SCF in very primitive cells may be an underlying defect in the pathophysiology of this disease.","['Agarwal, R', 'Doren, S', 'Hicks, B', 'Dunbar, C E']","['Agarwal R', 'Doren S', 'Hicks B', 'Dunbar CE']","[""Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Connective Tissue/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/deficiency/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 1;85(5):1306-12.,['S0006-4971(20)68808-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that SCF also supported the growth of UT-7 in the absence of other cytokines and downregulated the cell surface c-kit receptors. Constitutive expression of SCF by introducing SCF expression vector made UT-7 grow factor-independently in liquid medium, but not in semisolid medium. This SCF-expressing factor-independent UT-7 (UT-7scf9) expressed the membrane bound form of SCF on their surface, but did not secrete detectable amounts of soluble SCF. UT-7scf9 formed aggregates as they grew in the absence of cytokines, and this aggregation was inhibited by adding soluble SCF into the medium. UT-7 cultured with SCF and UT-7scf9 cultured without cytokines expressed GM-CSF, and anti-GM-CSF neutralizing antibody partially inhibited their growth. These results suggest that SCF stimulated UT-7 proliferation partially through the autocrine-loop of GM-CSF, and UT-7scf9 expressed SCF mostly as a membrane-bound form, which transduces its growth signal through c-kit receptor as they aggregate by cell-to-cell interaction.","['Sasaki, K', 'Ikeda, K', 'Ogami, K', 'Takahara, J', 'Irino, S']","['Sasaki K', 'Ikeda K', 'Ogami K', 'Takahara J', 'Irino S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kagawa Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 1;85(5):1220-8.,['S0006-4971(20)68797-3 [pii]'],,,,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood (PB) and/or marrow cells collected after treatment with recombinant canine stem cell factor (rcSCF) or cyclophosphamide were transduced in a vector-containing long-term culture system. Three different vector-producing cell lines with similar viral titers were used. In two of them, the neo-containing LN vector was packaged either in the PA317 cell line with an amphotropic murine retrovirus envelope or the PG13 cell line with the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope. The MFG/GC vector produced in PA317 cells contained the human glucocerebrosidase gene. Nineteen dogs received either no conditioning (group A, n = 5), irradiation to both humeri with 1,000 cGy (group B, n = 5), a sublethal dose of cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg (group C, n = 4), a sublethal dose of 200 or 300 cGy total body irradiation (TBI) (group D, n = 3), or an otherwise lethal dose of 920 cGy TBI (group E, n = 3) before intravenous (groups A, C, D, E) or intramedullary (group B) infusion of the transduced autologous hematopoietic cells. Transduction efficiency of hematopoietic cells at the time of infusion into the animals was similar among the different conditioning groups. Dogs were observed for at least 6 months. PB granulocytes were obtained at least every 3 weeks after transplant and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the transduced genes. The percentages of positive results in dogs more than 4 weeks after transplantation were 0% without conditioning, 5% with local irradiation, 18% with sublethal cyclophosphamide, 33% with sublethal TBI, and 17% with otherwise lethal TBI. Analyzing the influence of conditioning regimens by a generalized estimating equation (GEE) technique, which considered the use of different retrovirus vectors and the number of mononuclear cells infused as potential confounding variables, we found that engraftment of genetically marked repopulating cells was significantly improved (P < .001) in dogs receiving systemic conditioning with either otherwise lethal TBI, sublethal TBI, or sublethal cyclophosphamide compared to dogs with local irradiation only or no conditioning. Within the limitation of the experimental design, these data suggest that myeloablative or myelosuppressive conditioning improves engraftment of genetically marked hematopoietic repopulating cells.","['Barquinero, J', 'Kiem, H P', 'von Kalle, C', 'Darovsky, B', 'Goehle, S', 'Graham, T', 'Seidel, K', 'Storb, R', 'Schuening, F G']","['Barquinero J', 'Kiem HP', 'von Kalle C', 'Darovsky B', 'Goehle S', 'Graham T', 'Seidel K', 'Storb R', 'Schuening FG']","['Division of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104-2092.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured/transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Graft Enhancement, Immunologic', 'Graft Survival', 'Granulocytes/chemistry', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humerus/radiation effects', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1995/03/01 00:00,1995/03/01 00:01,['1995/03/01 00:00'],"['1995/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Mar 1;85(5):1195-201.,['S0006-4971(20)68793-6 [pii]'],,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,['neo'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These results suggest overall that the activation of NF-kappa B is not a generalized mediator of signal transduction of most cytokines and also that NF-kappa B activation is not sufficient for antiproliferative effects mediated through certain cytokines.","['Chaturvedi, M M', 'Higuchi, M', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Chaturvedi MM', 'Higuchi M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lymphokine Cytokine Res,Lymphokine and cytokine research,9107882,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994 Oct;13(5):309-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PGE2 activities the E-type PG receptor subtypes EP1, EP2 and EP3, whereas the PGE2 analogue, sulprostone, binds only to the EP1 and EP3 receptor subtypes. The stable PGI2 analogues, iloprost and cicaprost, both activate the PGI2 receptor (IP) and iloprost, additionally, bind to the EP1 subtype. Using these subtype-selective PG receptor agonists, we studied the interaction of PG receptor subtypes with Gs and Gi-type heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) in membranes from the human erythroleukaemia cell line, HEL. Sulprostone stimulated high-affinity GTPase in HEL membranes in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner. In contrast, the stimulations induced by PGE2, iloprost and cicaprost were only partially inhibited by PTX. PGE2, sulprostone, iloprost and cicaprost stimulated cholera toxin-catalysed ADP-ribosylation as well as labelling with GTP azidoanilide of membrane proteins comigrating with immunologically identified Gi protein alpha subunits. Furthermore, PGE2, iloprost and cicaprost enhanced GTP azidoanilide-labelling of Gs protein alpha subunits, whereas sulprostone did not. We suggest that in HEL cells (1) EP1 and EP3 receptor subtypes activate G1 proteins, that (2) the EP2 receptor subtype activates Gs proteins and that (3) the IP receptor activates both Gi and Gs proteins.","['Schwaner, I', 'Offermanns, S', 'Spicher, K', 'Seifert, R', 'Schultz, G']","['Schwaner I', 'Offermanns S', 'Spicher K', 'Seifert R', 'Schultz G']","['Freie Universitat Berlin, Institut fur Pharmakologie, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Receptors, Epoprostenol)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin)', '0 (Receptors, Prostaglandin E)', '501Q5EQ1GM (sulprostone)', 'DCR9Z582X0 (Epoprostenol)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'JED5K35YGL (Iloprost)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NE94J8CAMD (cicaprost)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Epoprostenol/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iloprost/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Epoprostenol', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin/drug effects', 'Receptors, Prostaglandin E/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/16 00:00,1995/02/16 00:01,['1995/02/16 00:00'],"['1995/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1995 Feb 16;1265(1):8-14. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(94)00198-n.,"['0167-4889(94)00198-N [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(94)00198-n [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A thorough investigation of the mode of inhibition was conducted with HIV-1 RT-associated DNA polymerase activity. The inhibition is unaffected by the nature of template-primer used. The inhibitory active site of toxiusol is attributable to the polar moieties at the benzene ring. The presence of either sulfate groups in the natural lead compound or hydroxyl groups in the corresponding hydroquinone is critical, because both compounds are equally effective at low micromolar concentrations. Conversely, the presence of acetyl groups in the same position in the derivative toxiusol diacetate lowers significantly or abolishes the inhibitory activity. Toxiusol binds the HIV-1 RT irreversibly and in a noncompetitive way with high affinity (Ki = 1.2 microM), probably through polar groups. The replacement with acetyl moieties in the analog toxiusol diacetate hampers the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme (Ki increases to about 26 microM). Still, the compound binds irreversibly, probably through its hydrophobic structure skeleton. Toxiusol diacetate loses its ability to inhibit the first step in the DNA polymerization process (that is, the formation of the DNA-enzyme complex as measured by a gel retardation assay), which contributes to its poor inhibitory capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Loya, S', 'Bakhanashvili, M', 'Kashman, Y', 'Hizi, A']","['Loya S', 'Bakhanashvili M', 'Kashman Y', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '0 (toxiusol)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/enzymology', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Porifera/*chemistry', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Species Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes/*pharmacology']",1995/02/21 00:00,1995/02/21 00:01,['1995/02/21 00:00'],"['1995/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Feb 21;34(7):2260-6. doi: 10.1021/bi00007a021.,['10.1021/bi00007a021 [doi]'],,,['AI31790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inducible endothelial adhesion molecules, E-selectin, VCAM-1/alpha 4 beta 1 and vitronectin receptor have been reported to mediate attachment of cancer cells to IL-1-treated endothelial cells. We have examined the relative contribution of these molecules by quantifying the adhesion of a panel of 22 human, 125I-labelled cancer cells and the rat W256 tumour to untreated and IL-1-treated endothelial monolayers in the presence of relevant neutralising antibodies. Antibodies against E-selectin inhibited the adhesion of HL-60 leukaemia cells and two colon carcinomas. Anti-alpha 4 beta 1 antibodies blocked adhesion of four melanomas, five sarcomas and one lung carcinoma. Anti-vitronectin receptor antibodies inhibited adhesion of 14 of the 22 human cell lines to IL-1-treated endothelial cells. Adhesion of seven cell lines was inhibited by more than a single antibody. In contrast, adhesion of one of the cancer cell lines was unaffected by any of the antibodies, suggesting involvement of other IL-1-inducible endothelial adhesion molecules. Moreover, none of the antibodies altered the attachment of cancer cells to unstimulated endothelial monolayers. We conclude that the mechanisms of cancer cell adhesion to the endothelium are influenced by endothelial activation and by the adhesive repertoire of the cancer cell.","['Lafrenie, R M', 'Gallo, S', 'Podor, T J', 'Buchanan, M R', 'Orr, F W']","['Lafrenie RM', 'Gallo S', 'Podor TJ', 'Buchanan MR', 'Orr FW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoadhesin)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'E-Selectin', 'Endothelium/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoadhesin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/physiology', 'Receptors, Vitronectin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*physiology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1994;30A(14):2151-8. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(94)00354-8.,['10.1016/0959-8049(94)00354-8 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we cloned MCF1233, determined its nucleotide sequence and, by comparison with its MuLV relatives, identified the sequences that relate to the leukemogenic character of this virus. MCF1233 was found to have an ecotropic backbone, and carried acquired polytropic sequences in the 3' pol and 5' env region. The gag-region contained six specific nucleotides, determining the viral B-tropism. Short sequences within the U3 LTR shared specific homology with the xenotropic Bxv-1 MuLV, which is the U3 donor for leukemogenic MCF MuLV of AKR origin. These sequences, in combination with specific ecotropic sequences present in env p15E, most likely determine the viral oncogenicity. Currently, the deduced MCF1233 amino sequence is being exploited for T cell epitope analysis, which in this paper is discussed with respect to antigenically distinct Friend/Moloney/Rauscher types of MuLV. Identification of these T cell epitopes will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental aspects of immune control on MCF1233-induced lymphomagenesis. It will help to elucidate the mechanisms that underlie immune escape of T lymphomas, rarely arising in immunoresistant mice, and allow the development of vaccination protocols for tumor therapy.","['Sijts, E J', 'Leupers, C J', 'Mengede, E A', 'Loenen, W A', 'van den Elsen, P J', 'Melief, C J']","['Sijts EJ', 'Leupers CJ', 'Mengede EA', 'Loenen WA', 'van den Elsen PJ', 'Melief CJ']","['Department of Immunohematology, University Hospital Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral', 'Epitopes/genetics/*immunology', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Lymphoma/immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tropism/genetics', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/immunology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1994 Dec;34(3):339-49. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(94)90133-3.,"['0168-1702(94)90133-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(94)90133-3 [doi]']",,,,['GENBANK/U13766'],"['env', 'gag']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although p56lck is thought to be a specific T-cell marker, we found that LSTRA cells can be induced to differentiate towards macrophages or granulocytes by the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or the cyclic nucleotide analogue, dibutyryl cAMP, respectively. Treatment of LSTRA cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate resulted in marked alterations in morphology including increased size, adherence, and spreading on culture dishes. These cells also ceased proliferating, accumulated in G0-G1 and expressed nonspecific esterase activity. In contrast, although LSTRA cells treated with dibutyryl cAMP stopped growing and accumulated in G0-G1, these cells expressed functionally active chemotactic peptide receptors and became irregular and granular in appearance. Differentiation of LSTRA cells was also found to be associated with altered expression of p56lck. Thus, while 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment caused the cells to produce higher molecular weight forms of p56lck, dibutyryl cAMP treatment resulted in increased expression of total p56lck mRNA as well as the more mature type II p56lck mRNA transcript. There were no major alterations in p56lck kinase activity in vitro following differentiation. Phospholipase C gamma and p21rasGAP, two putative substrates for the tyrosine kinase activity of p56lck, were found to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine in LSTRA cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates was not altered following differentiation. These results indicate that LSTRA cells are relatively early precursors that have the capacity to develop along the myeloid differentiation pathway.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Garcia-Welsh, A', 'Laskin, D L', 'Molloy, C J', 'Laskin, J D']","['Garcia-Welsh A', 'Laskin DL', 'Molloy CJ', 'Laskin JD']","['Department of Environmental and Community Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Macrophages/*cytology/enzymology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Peptide/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1994 Nov;5(11):1215-23.,,,,"['ES-03647/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-04738/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-05022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was observed that occasionally the viability of control cells in one assay box was reduced compared with control cells in other boxes from the same assay.

We tested the hypothesis that a metabolite of treosulfan might be the cause of this airborne cytotoxicity, and found that whilst 10 mg ml-1 of either methane sulphonic acid or tetrahydrofuran had no airborne cytotoxic effect, 1 mg ml-1 diepoxybutane killed over 95% of cells in all tubes in the same box.

To test this hypothesis we utilized the monoclonal antibody anti-APO-1, which has been demonstrated to induce apoptosis in human T cells. Human T cell lines expressing HTLV-I showed reduced susceptibility to anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis despite expression of high levels of cell surface APO-1. Cell-free supernatant of the Tax-expressing cell line C8166 and heat-inactivated supernatant of the HTLV-I-producing cell line MT2 transferred increased resistance to anti-APO-1 to susceptible Jurkat T cells. Susceptible T cells transfected with an HTLV-I Tax-expressing vector or treated with soluble Tax protein became less susceptible to anti-APO-1-induced cell death. Furthermore, primary human lymphocytes treated with soluble Tax were less susceptible to apoptosis induced by anti-APO-1. The protective effect of Tax in T cell lines and primary human lymphocytes was reversed by the addition of anti-Tax antibodies. Anti-APO-1-induced apoptosis was also found to be inhibited in Jurkat cells by the induction of protein kinase C (PKC) with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Resistance to apoptosis conferred by HTLV-I Tax and an active PKC pathway may be factors contributing to the survival of dysregulated HTLV-I-infected T cells prone to the development of adult T cell leukemia.","['Copeland, K F', 'Haaksma, A G', 'Goudsmit, J', 'Krammer, P H', 'Heeney, J L']","['Copeland KF', 'Haaksma AG', 'Goudsmit J', 'Krammer PH', 'Heeney JL']","['Laboratory of Viral Pathogenesis, Biomedical Primate Research Centre, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/biosynthesis/immunology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology/virology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1994 Oct;10(10):1259-68. doi: 10.1089/aid.1994.10.1259.,['10.1089/aid.1994.10.1259 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MBP is stored in eosinophil crystalloid granules and released with other granule constituents during eosinophil action. Previous studies have identified an MBP gene promoter that generates a 1.0 kb mRNA transcript encoding MBP preproprotein which undergoes processing to the mature storage form. To investigate how the MBP gene is regulated, we have examined the identity and levels of the MBP transcripts both in precursor cells and in blood eosinophils. It was found that the gene was expressed from two upstream promoters, a distal promoter P1 in addition to the previously described promoter P2. Evidence for the second promoter was initially provided by isolation from a human HL-60 leukaemic cell cDNA library of a novel 1.6 kb MBP cDNA that was distinct from the known 1.0 kb cDNA. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 1.6 kb cDNA was determined, and showed that the two cDNAs had identical coding and 3' untranslated regions but differed in their 5' sequences. By isolating and sequencing MBP genomic clones from an arrayed chromosome 11 library, it was demonstrated that the MBP gene is composed of nine upstream exons and five coding exons. The 1.6 and 1.0 kb cDNAs arise by differential splicing of alternate MBP transcripts from promoters P1 and P2 respectively, located 32 kb apart in the genomic DNA. Primer extension analysis identified two transcription start sites at P1, neither associated with a typical TATA box motif. Northern blotting and reverse-transcription PCR analysis showed that the 1.0 kb mRNA was present at higher levels than the 1.6 kb species in immature cells including HL-60 and bone-marrow cells. By contrast, low levels of 1.6 kb mRNA transcripts predominated in differentiated blood eosinophils. The results are compatible with differential use of P1 and P2 promoters as a mechanism for regulation of MBP expression during eosinophil maturation.","['Li, M S', 'Sun, L', 'Satoh, T', 'Fisher, L M', 'Spry, C J']","['Li MS', 'Sun L', 'Satoh T', 'Fisher LM', 'Spry CJ']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Science, St. George's Hospital Medical School, University of London, U.K..""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Complementary/chemistry', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophils/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', '*Ribonucleases', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1995 Feb 1;305 ( Pt 3):921-7. doi: 10.1042/bj3050921.,['10.1042/bj3050921 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/Z26248'],,,,PMC1136346,,,,,,,,,

In monolayer cultures of breast cancer cell line MDA-468 treated with tamoxifen for 4 hours all cells detached from substratum. These cells were apoptotic by nuclear morphology and stained with F7-26. Subset of cells without visible chromatin condensation but stained with F7-26 was detected among cells still attached to the substratum 1 hour after addition of tamoxifen. Thus, in breast cancer cells reactivity with F7-26 preceded chromatin condensation detected by fluorescence microscopy. Apoptotic cells stained with the antibody and non-apoptotic cells with background fluorescence were completely separated on two-parameter plots generated on a flow cytometer. Linear relation between percentage of apoptotic cells and ELISA reactivity with F7-26 in the cells attached to microtiter plates was demonstrated. These data show that apoptotic response can be measured by ELISA using staining with F7-26. Cells undergoing apoptosis can be detected by the procedure based on thermal denaturation of DNA in situ in the presence of Mg2+ with subsequent staining with the antibody specific for DNA in single-stranded conformation.

To identify more active derivatives, we studied the effect of a series of phenothiazines and a group of related compounds alone or in combination with bleomycin against rat glioblastoma cell lines. C6 cells were grown for 24 hours prior to a 48 hour exposure to anti-psychotic drug alone or to an IC20 concentration of antipsychotic drug with bleomycin.

Following G-CSF treatment, the initially subnormal erythroid burst-forming unit (BFU-E) values underwent AIC in five of 11 patients along with increased reticulocyte responses in vivo, whereas four of the five patients who lacked AIC of BFU-E did not. Three patients with persisting cytogenetic abnormalities and increased neutrophilic differentiation in vitro also responded in vivo, suggesting that G-CSF induced in vivo cellular differentiation from the abnormal clone. Two of the three patients who developed blastic responses in vivo had increased CFU-GM growth pre- and post-therapy. These results indicate in vivo-in vitro correlations for myeloid and erythroid responses of MDS marrow cells which related to treatment with G-CSF.","['Nagler, A', 'MacKichan, M L', 'Negrin, R S', 'Donlon, T', 'Greenberg, P L']","['Nagler A', 'MacKichan ML', 'Negrin RS', 'Donlon T', 'Greenberg PL']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/genetics/*therapy']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):30-9.,,,,['R0136915/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two mechanisms (thrombin activation and plasmin activation) may cleave the fibrinogen molecule, but their respective roles in low fibrinogen levels and bleeding diathesis genesis remain in dispute. In vivo ATRA therapy induces a rapid correction of both low fibrinogen level and bleeding tendency, but no clear explanation of this beneficial effect has been proposed. We prospectively investigated 27 APL patients at presentation for diffuse intravascular coagulation (DIC) markers (prothrombin activation fragment and thrombin/antithrombin complexes) and plasmin-dependent primary fibrinogenolysis markers (alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor consumption +/- plasmin/alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complexes). Fourteen of these patients were then serially studied during the first 2 weeks of ATRA therapy. Four of them, however, developed an hyperleukocytosis requiring additional chemotherapy before the end of the 2nd week. At presentation, low level of fibrinogen was clearly associated with alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor deficiency (p < 0.01), while DIC was equally present in fibrinogenopenic and non-fibrinogenopenic patients. Moreover, was observed a rapid simultaneous correction of low fibrinogen levels and plasmin activation markers in APL patients undergoing ATRA therapy (before day 5), but a more prolonged persistence of DIC markers (until day 14). Initial bleeding syndrome seemed more frequent in patients with initial low fibrinogen level. These data indicate that plasmin-dependent primary fibrinogenolysis is the major etiologic factor of low fibrinogen level in APL patients. In vivo differentiation ATRA therapy induces a rapid decrease in the plasmin activation and a normalization of fibrinogen level, while DIC may in vivo persist for several weeks. Prospective studies evaluating antifibrinolytic agents as therapy of APL-associated hemostasis disorders should be considered. Additionally, prophylactic heparin therapy might be useful after day 5 in patients undergoing ATRA therapy, since they present a prolonged procoagulant tendency.","['Dombret, H', 'Scrobohaci, M L', 'Daniel, M T', 'Miclea, J M', 'Castaigne, S', 'Chomienne, C', 'Fenaux, P', 'Degos, L']","['Dombret H', 'Scrobohaci ML', 'Daniel MT', 'Miclea JM', 'Castaigne S', 'Chomienne C', 'Fenaux P', 'Degos L']","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '0 (plasmin-plasmin inhibitor complex)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Antifibrinolytic Agents', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/etiology', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Fibrinolysin/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thrombin/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/analysis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1995 Jan;9(1):19-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology.,345-51,"PURPOSE: During maintenance chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), the cytotoxic metabolites of methotrexate (MTX polyglutamates) and mercaptopurine (6MP) (thioguanine nucleotides [6TGN]) accumulate intracellularly, including in erythrocytes (E-MTX and E-6TGN) with large interindividual variations. In the present Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (NOPHO) study, the relation of E-MTX and E-6TGN to relapse risk was explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety-seven patients with non-B-cell ALL, aged 1 to 14 years, on oral MTX and 6MP had E-MTX and E-6TGN levels measured three to 35 (median, eight) and three to 75 (median, nine) times, respectively. For each patient, a mean of all E-MTX (mE-MTX) and E-6TGN (mE-6TGN) measurements was calculated, as well as the product of mE-MTX and mE-6TGN (mE-MTX-6TGN), since MTX and 6MP may have synergistic action. RESULTS: For patients in remission, the median mE-MTX and mE-6TGN values were 4.7 nmol/mmol hemoglobin (Hgb) (range, 0.4 to 10.3) and 173 nmol/mmol Hgb (range, 58 to 846). With a median follow-up duration of 66 months for patients in remission, 64 patients relapsed. Cox regression analysis identified mE-MTX-6TGN and sex to be the most significant parameters to predict relapse (global P = .001). Factors that predicted a better prognosis were high mE-MTX 6TGN and female sex. Patients who had a mE-MTX-6TGN less than the product of the median mE-MTX and median mE-6TGN (813 [nmol/mmol Hgb]2) had a significantly poorer event-free survival (EFS) than did patients with higher values (5-year probability of EFS [pEFS5y], 0.70 v 0.86; P = .001). CONCLUSION: The pharmacokinetics of MTX and 6MP may have significant influence on the risk of relapse. The value of dose adjustments by E-MTX and E-6TGN remains to be determined.","['Schmiegelow, K', 'Schroder, H', 'Gustafsson, G', 'Kristinsson, J', 'Glomstein, A', 'Salmi, T', 'Wranne, L']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Schroder H', 'Gustafsson G', 'Kristinsson J', 'Glomstein A', 'Salmi T', 'Wranne L']","['Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*blood', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Thionucleotides/*blood', 'Time Factors']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1995 Feb;13(2):345-51. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.345.,['10.1200/JCO.1995.13.2.345 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The YT subline we are investigating, YT-INDY, does not lyse K562 or the T-cell line Molt-4. It does, however, lyse the EBV+ Burkitt lymphoma (BL) B-cell line Raji and EBV-immortalized B-cell lines. Several EBV- BL lines and an EBV- pre-B-cell leukemia line that we tested were not appreciably lysed by YT-INDY. To determine if EBV plays a role in TC susceptibility to lysis by YT-INDY, we compared YT-INDY's ability to lyse the EBV- BL line BL41 to its ability to lyse an EBV-infected derivative of BL41. The EBV-infected cell line was lysed, on average, at twice the level of the uninfected line. CD28/B7 interactions appeared to be involved in TC recognition by YT-INDY. Therefore, we examined the level of expression of B7 molecules on the infected and uninfected BL41 lines. An average of 15% of the uninfected BL41 cells expressed B7-1/B7-3, compared to 79% of the infected. B7-2 expression was similar in the two cell lines. Lysis of EBV-infected BL41 was reduced by anti-B7-1/B7-3 (BB1) or anti-CD28 antibodies (Abs) to the level of lysis of the uninfected line, indicating that upregulation of B7-1/B7-3 by the virus may be responsible for the enhanced susceptibility. We attempted to determine the particular EBV latent protein responsible for B7-1/B7-3 upregulation by analyzing BL41 clones expressing LMP1, EBNA-2/EBNA-LP, or EBNA-1. All of the high-expressing clones showed a higher level of B7-1/B7-3 expression than the vector-transfected control cell line, with LMP1-expressing clones expressing the highest amount. EBNA-1 clones and a high-expressing EBNA-2/EBNA-LP clone had a slightly higher density of B7-2 on their surface than the remaining clones. The increased expression of molecules of the B7 family correlated with increased susceptibility of the clones to lysis by YT-INDY. Anti-CD28 or a combination of anti-B7-1/B7-3 and anti-By-2 did not inhibit lysis of the clones to the level of lysis of the vector-transfected control cell line in all cases. We conclude that intact EBV enhances susceptibility to YT-INDY lysis by upregulating B7-1/B7-3. EBV proteins expressed individually also enhance susceptibility to lysis and upregulate members of the B7 family.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Montel, A H', 'Morse, P A', 'Brahmi, Z']","['Montel AH', 'Morse PA', 'Brahmi Z']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/*biosynthesis', 'CD28 Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Jan;160(1):104-14. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(95)80015-b.,"['0008-8749(95)80015-B [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(95)80015-b [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No evidence for a functional role of imidazoline receptors in modulating calcium.,187-96,"Human erythroleukaemia (HEL) cells were investigated to characterize their alpha 2-adrenoceptor and imidazoline receptor sites. Membranes from HEL cells bound [3H]2-(2-methoxy-1, 4-benzodioxan-2yl)-2-imidazoline ([3H]RX821002) in a saturable and specific manner with a KD of 0.64 +/- 0.07 nM and a Bmax of 126 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein. [3H]RX821002 was displaced from HEL membranes by adrenergic drugs with the order of potency being yohimbine approximately oxymetazoline >> prazosin = 2-[2-[4-(o-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-4,4-dimethyl- 1,3(2H,4H)-isochinolindione HCl (ARC 239), consistent with this site being an alpha 2A-adrenoceptor. HEL membranes also bound [3H]idazoxan in the presence of adrenaline to block alpha 2-adrenoceptors. This binding was saturable and specific with a KD of 3.5 +/- 1.0 nM and a Bmax of 31 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein. Adrenergic drugs from both the phenylethylamine and imidazoline classes increased high-affinity GTPase activity, an index of activation of regulatory heterotrimeric guanine-nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins), and produced increases in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i). The effects of these agonists in both systems were abolished by pertussis toxin pretreatment, and oxymetazoline and clonidine were antagonists. The potency of adrenergic drugs to inhibit 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)-quinoxaline (UK 14304)-induced increases in [Ca2+]i was yohimbine approximately oxymetazoline >> ARC 239, consistent with the binding data and an action at alpha 2A-adrenoceptors. No evidence was found for a role of imidazoline receptors in stimulating G-proteins or modulating [Ca2+]i. The adrenergic agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+]i were due to both release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores and entry of extracellular Ca2+.

Since normal hematopoiesis is regulated by bone marrow stromal cells, in this study we have characterized the bone marrow stromal toxicity induced by BP and BP-derived metabolites, particularly quinones. Incubation of stromal cells with various concentrations of BP-1,6-, 3,6-, 6,12-, or 7,8-quinone for 24 hr resulted in a significant decrease of cell survival in a concentration-dependent manner, while cells treated with BP or BP-7,8-dihydrodiol did not exhibit any significant loss of cell survival. Among the BP quinones examined, BP-1,6-quinone was the most cytotoxic to stromal cells. The cytotoxicity induced by BP-1,6-quinone also exhibited a time-dependent relationship. Pretreatment of stromal cells with 1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T) resulted in a significant induction of both cellular reduced glutathione (GSH) content and quinone reductase (QR) activity in a concentration-dependent manner. However, D3T pretreatment did not offer any protection against BP-1,6-quinone-induced toxicity. Furthermore, dicumarol, a potent inhibitor of QR, or buthionine sulfoximine, a specific inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, did not potentiate BP-1,6-quinone-induced cytotoxicity was not altered. However, incubation of stromal cells with BP-1,6-quinone resulted in a significant depletion of cellular ATP content and mitochondrial morphological changes, which preceded the loss of cell survival. In addition to BP-1,6-quinone, other cytotoxic BP quinones also exhibited a capacity to deplete cellular ATP level in stromal cells, while BP, which was not cytotoxic to stromal cells, did not elicit any significant decrease in cellular ATP level. These observations suggest that mitochondria may be a potential target of BP quinones. Overall, the above results indicate that neither cellular GSH and QR nor reactive oxygen species appear to be involved in BP quinone-induced stromal cell injury and that BP quinones may elicit cytotoxicity to stromal cells through directly disrupting mitochondrial energy metabolism.","['Zhu, H', 'Li, Y', 'Trush, M A']","['Zhu H', 'Li Y', 'Trush MA']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrenes)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Thiones)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '3067-13-8 (benzo(a)pyrene-1,6-quinone)', '3417WMA06D (Benzo(a)pyrene)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WT2QF220RR (1,2-dithiol-3-thione)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Anemia, Aplastic/chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzo(a)pyrene/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Benzopyrenes/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/metabolism', 'Quinones/*toxicity', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Superoxide Dismutase/pharmacology', 'Thiones/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/pharmacology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1995 Jan;130(1):108-20. doi: 10.1006/taap.1995.1015.,"['S0041008X85710150 [pii]', '10.1006/taap.1995.1015 [doi]']",,,"['CA44530/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03760/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the shed form of L-selectin (sL-selectin) is frequently increased in acute leukaemia (sL-selectin+ leukaemia), we examined whether assay of sL-selectin in CSF could improve our ability to detect such meningeal involvement. CSF sL-selectin was significantly (p < 0.001) higher in 15 patients with sL-selectin+ meningeal leukaemia (median 60 ng/mL, range 34-150) than in 20 patients with acute leukaemia without meningeal involvement (12 ng/mL, 1-39) or 88 control patients (14 ng/mL, 0-37). Serial measurements of sL-selectin in patients with sL-selectin+ leukaemic meningitis showed increased CSF concentrations of the cleaved receptor in 4 patients with therapy-resistant meningeal leukaemia and sustained normal concentrations in 9 patients in remission.

In this study, we compared the effects of IL-13 and IL-4 on B chronic lymphocytic leukaemias (B-CLL) cells. After anti-CD40 activation, both IL-13 and IL-4 promoted the DNA synthesis of B-CLL cells and increased the recovery of viable cells. The time kinetics of the proliferative response of B-CLL cells to IL-13 or IL-4 were superimposable and showed the long-lasting effect of both cytokines. As on normal B cells, both IL-4 and IL-13 synergized with IL-10 to enhance B-CLL DNA synthesis. Moreover, IL-13, like IL-4, was able to increase CD23 expression on anti-CD40-activated leukaemic B cells. The CD23 up-regulation and the DNA synthesis induced by IL-13 on anti-CD40-activated B-CLL cells, were significantly reduced when B-CLL cells were cultured with anti-IL-4 receptor monoclonal antibody, suggesting a common pathway for IL-13 and IL-4 signalling. However, after cross-linking of surface IgM, IL-4 strongly inhibited the IL-2-induced DNA synthesis of B-CLL cells, whereas IL-13 did not inhibit IL-2-driven proliferation of anti-IgM-activated B-CLL cells. Furthermore, while IL-4 strongly up-regulated the expression of CD23 on anti-IgM-activated leukaemic B cells, IL-13 only marginally increased it. Finally, IL-13, in contrast to IL-4, did not prevent the entry of B-CLL cells into apoptosis. Thus IL-13 and IL-4 display comparable effects on anti-CD40-activated B-CLL cells, which are blocked by anti-IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) monoclonal antibodies. However, IL-13-dependent effects are absent or inefficient in non-activated or anti-IgM-activated B-CLL cells. This suggests that such cells may lack functional IL-13 receptors, though IL-13R and IL-4R on B-CLL cells share a common component.","['Fluckiger, A C', 'Briere, F', 'Zurawski, G', 'Bridon, J M', 'Banchereau, J']","['Fluckiger AC', 'Briere F', 'Zurawski G', 'Bridon JM', 'Banchereau J']","['Schering-Plough, Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Interleukin-13/*immunology', 'Interleukin-4/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/immunology', 'Up-Regulation']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1994 Nov;83(3):397-403.,,,,,,,,,PMC1415034,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate that overexpressed AML1a totally suppresses granulocytic differentiation and stimulates cell proliferation in 32Dcl3 murine myeloid cells treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. These effects of AML1a were canceled by the concomitant overexpression of AML1b. Such biological phenomena could be explained by our observations that (i) AML1a, which on its own has no effects as a transcriptional regulator, dominantly suppresses transcriptional activation by AML1b, and (ii) AML1a exhibits the higher affinity for DNA binding compared with AML1b. These antagonistic actions could be important in leukemogenesis and/or myeloid cell differentiation because more than half of myelogenous leukemia patients showed an increase in the relative amounts of AML1a.","['Tanaka, T', 'Tanaka, K', 'Ogawa, S', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Mitani, K', 'Nishida, J', 'Shibata, Y', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Tanaka T', 'Tanaka K', 'Ogawa S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Mitani K', 'Nishida J', 'Shibata Y', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (transcription factor PEA3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/16 00:00,1995/01/16 00:01,['1995/01/16 00:00'],"['1995/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1995 Jan 16;14(2):341-50.,,,,,,['AML1'],,,PMC398088,,,,,,,,,

The results suggest that these cell interactions are mediated by multiple mechanisms involving Steel factor and its receptor encoded by c-kit, carbohydrates and possibly other unknown factors. We find that Steel factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor are survival rather than proliferation factors for primordial germ cells. Both molecules prevent primordial germ cell death in culture by suppressing apoptosis. Morphological and molecular features of primordial germ cell apoptosis in vitro are reported. Activation of protein kinase C does not promote primordial germ cell proliferation, but compounds known to enhance intracellular levels of cAMP (i.e. dibutyryl cAMP and forskolin) markedly stimulate primordial germ cells to proliferate in culture.

In order to extend superantigen-dependent cytotoxicity to MHC class II-negative carcinoma cells, covalent conjugates of superantigen and mAbs against surface markers of these cells have been used. We now describe a novel strategy which allows rapid selection of mAb suitable for superantigen targeting against MHC class II-negative tumor cells. A recombinant fusion protein of protein A and SEA binding to the mAbs CD7 or CD38 was able to mediate T cell-dependent lysis of MHC class II-negative Molt-4 and CCRF-CEM acute lymphatic leukemia cell lines. Lysis was dose dependent and correlated with E:T cell ratio. In contrast, SEA alone did not induce any significant lysis. In order to decrease the MHC class II affinity of the protein A-SEA complex, a point mutation was introduced into SEA (protein A-SEA mu9). The mutated fusion protein had similar potency as protein A-SEA against Molt-4 cells but was 100-fold less active against MHC class II-positive cells. Considering the efficiency and specificity of the mutated SEA protein interacting with mAb in targeting T lymphocytes against MHC class II-negative leukemia cells while only marginally affecting normal MHC class II-positive cells, we suggest the development of SEA-mAb fusion proteins as a potential adjuvant therapy of leukemias.","['Ihle, J', 'Holzer, U', 'Krull, F', 'Dohlsten, M', 'Kalland, T', 'Niethammer, D', 'Dannecker, G E']","['Ihle J', 'Holzer U', 'Krull F', 'Dohlsten M', 'Kalland T', 'Niethammer D', 'Dannecker GE']","[""Department of Oncology/Hematology, Children's University Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Superantigens)', '37337-57-8 (enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enterotoxins/*toxicity', 'HLA-D Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/toxicity', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Superantigens/*toxicity', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Feb 1;55(3):623-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to ligand-dependent activation, we have previously shown that KIT is constitutively activated in a ligand-independent manner by two point mutations, Val-559-->Gly (G559) mutation in the juxtamembrane domain and Asp-814-->Val (V814) mutation in the phosphotransferase domain. To investigate the biochemical consequence and biologic significance of these mutations, retroviral vectors encoding KITG559 or KITV814 were introduced into murine pro-B-type Ba/F3 cells and myeloid FDC-P1 cells, both of which require interleukin-3 (IL-3) for their growth and survival. In the cells, KITG559 or KITV814 were found to be constitutively phophorylated on tyrosine in the absence of stem cell factor (SCF) that is a ligand for KIT. Chemical cross-linking analysis showed that a substantial fraction of the phosphorylated KITG559 underwent dimerization even in the absence of SCF, whereas the phosphorylated KITV814 did not, suggesting the distinct mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of KIT by G559 and V814 mutations. Furthermore, the cells expressing either KITG559 or KITV814 were found to show a factor-independent growth, whereas the cells expressing wild-type KIT (KITWT) proliferated in response to SCF as well as IL-3. Moreover, subcutaneous injection of Ba/F3 cells expressing KITG559 or KITV814 into nude mice resulted in production of large tumors at all sites of the injection within 2 weeks, and all nude mice quickly succumbed to leukemia and died. These results suggest that, although the mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of KITG559 or KITV814 may be different, both of the activating mutations have a function to induce a factor-independent and tumorigenic phenotype. Also, the data of this study raise the possibility that the constitutively activating mutations of c-kit may play a causal role in development of hematologic malignancies.","['Kitayama, H', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Furitsu, T', 'Tsujimura, T', 'Oritani, K', 'Ikeda, H', 'Sugahara, H', 'Mitsui, H', 'Kanayama, Y', 'Kitamura, Y']","['Kitayama H', 'Kanakura Y', 'Furitsu T', 'Tsujimura T', 'Oritani K', 'Ikeda H', 'Sugahara H', 'Mitsui H', 'Kanayama Y', 'Kitamura Y', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Aspartic Acid', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Point Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Valine']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 1;85(3):790-8.,['S0006-4971(20)68853-X [pii]'],,,,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Finnish Leukemia Group.,765-71,"High serum level of bioactive interleukin-6 (IL-6) is regarded as a predictor of poor prognosis in multiple myeloma (MM). On the other hand, the reported levels of immunoreactive IL-6 have been highly variable, and the prognostic value of immunoreactive IL-6 in MM is not clear. We have analyzed the prognostic significance of serum immunoreactive IL-6, as measured by a sensitive immunosorbent assay, in 210 patients with newly diagnosed MM subsequently treated with intermittent melphalan and prednisone. The serum levels of acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP), alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT), and acid alpha 1-glycoprotein (orosomucoid; OM) were evaluated as surrogates for IL-6. Serum IL-6, CRP, alpha 1AT, and OM levels were raised in 42%, 40%, 41%, and 24% of the patients, respectively. There was a significant correlation between the clinical stage of the patients and serum IL-6 (P = .006), alpha 1AT (P = .001), and OM (P = .004) levels at diagnosis. At 3 years, 52% of the patients were alive. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that high levels of IL-6 (P = .002), CRP (P = .02), alpha 1AT (P < .001), OM (P = .007), beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M; P < .001), and thymidine kinase (P < .05) were all associated with 3-year mortality. In multivariate regression analysis, beta 2M (P < .0001) and alpha 1AT (P = .01) had independent prognostic significance. The patients with high levels of both beta 2M and alpha 1AT or IL-6 were at very high risk of dying within 3 years from diagnosis (16% and 21% of the patients in these groups were alive, respectively). When the patients were stratified according to the clinical stage, the prognostic significance of serum IL-6 and alpha 1AT was especially evident in stage II patients. When the patients were divided into two groups according to normal or raised serum IL-6 levels, the patients with high IL-6 levels had more frequent osteolytic bone lesions (P = .03) and a more aggressive disease. We conclude that serum immunoreactive IL-6 is a significant prognostic marker in MM.","['Pelliniemi, T T', 'Irjala, K', 'Mattila, K', 'Pulkki, K', 'Rajamaki, A', 'Tienhaara, A', 'Laakso, M', 'Lahtinen, R']","['Pelliniemi TT', 'Irjala K', 'Mattila K', 'Pulkki K', 'Rajamaki A', 'Tienhaara A', 'Laakso M', 'Lahtinen R']","['Department of Hematology, Turku University Central Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Calcium/blood', 'Clodronic Acid/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Uric Acid/blood']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Feb 1;85(3):765-71.,['S0006-4971(20)68850-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increasing body of work implies a role for homeobox genes in both hematopoiesis and oncogenesis. We have analyzed the role of the homeobox gene, HOX B7, in the program of differentiation of the biphenotypic myeloid cell line, HL60. Induction of monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells by vitamin D3 resulted in rapid expression of HOX B7 mRNA, but stimulation with phorbol ester or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) did not. Constitutive overexpression of HOX B7 in the HL60 cell line inhibited the granulocytic differentiation associated with stimulation with DMSO or retinoic acid, but had no effect on the monocytic differentiation induced by vitamin D3. Normal human monocytes do not constitutively express HOX B7, nor are they able to be induced to do so by stimulation with colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) and gamma interferon (IFN gamma), or with vitamin D3 and lipopolysaccharide. Human bone marrow (BM) cells were found to express HOX B7 in response to granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and antisense oligonucleotides directed against HOX B7 inhibited the formation of colonies derived from GM-CSF-stimulated BM.

Both pRPneo/tat and pRPneo/SL3/tat Jurkat cell lines showed a constant and high production of bioactive Tat in transient co-transfection assays with an HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid. Tat-positive and mock-transfected Jurkat cells were cultured with various cytotoxic agents, which have been associated to the progressive loss of CD4 T-lymphocytes characteristic of HIV-1 disease. In the presence of recombinant tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), anti-fas antibody, Leu3a anti-CD4 antibody, the percentage of apoptosis, evaluated in a 24-72 h short-term assay, was lower (P < 0.05) in tat-positive Jurkat cells than in mock-transfected controls. The low susceptibility to the cytotoxic activity of TNF-alpha and anti-fas antibody of tat-transfected cells was confirmed by counting viable cells up to 15 d of culture. Also, recombinant Tat protein was able to prevent the increase of apoptosis induced in mock-transfected Jurkat by TNF-alpha. Of note, tat-expressing cells showed a better survival with respect to mock-transfected control cells even when acutely infected with high doses (500,000 cpm of reverse transcriptase) of HIV-1 (strain IIIB) or treated with heat-inactivated HIV-1. These data demonstrate that the expression of the regulatory HIV-1 Tat protein is able to rescue Jurkat lymphoblastoid cells from apoptosis induced by a variety of cytotoxic agents. Since Tat protein expression is restricted to the initial phases of an active HIV-1 replication, the anti-apoptotic effect of Tat could have the physiological significance of selectively protecting HIV-1 producing cells from death, at least for the time necessary to allow virus production and spreading.","['Gibellini, D', 'Caputo, A', 'Celeghini, C', 'Bassini, A', 'La Placa, M', 'Capitani, S', 'Zauli, G']","['Gibellini D', 'Caputo A', 'Celeghini C', 'Bassini A', 'La Placa M', 'Capitani S', 'Zauli G']","['Institute of Microbiology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*pathology/ultrastructure', '*Genes, tat', 'HIV Infections/*genetics', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1995 Jan;89(1):24-33. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08915.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1995.tb08915.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of TaxI in a human T-cell line Jurkat carrying the TaxI gene under the metallothionein promoter led to increases in mRNA and surface expression of ICAM-I. The response of LFA-3 to TaxI induction was, on the other hand, relatively slow and weak, and might be indirect. Transactivation of the ICAM-I promoter by TaxI was further shown by co-transfection of a CAT reporter construct with the ICAM-I promoter and a plasmid expressing TaxI. The mechanism of down-regulation of ICAM-I or LFA-I in 4 ATL cell lines was next examined. ICAM-I mRNA was quite low in MT-I, but no genomic changes were found. The CAT reporter with the ICAM-I promoter was inactive in MT-I. Finally, combined treatment of MT-I with 5-azacytidine and IFN-gamma induced re-expression of ICAM-I. Collectively, (a) transcriptional factor(s) necessary for expression of ICAM-I gene may be repressed in MT-I through DNA methylation. Three other ATL cell lines (TL-OmI, H582, HuT102) were found to have little mRNA for the LFA-I beta chain (CD18). H582 and HuT102 were also negative for the LFA-I alpha chain (CDIIa) mRNA. No genomic changes were found, and a CAT reporter gene with the CD18 promoter was inactive in the 3 of them, again suggesting lack of (a) transcriptional factor(s) necessary for CD18 expression.","['Tanaka, Y', 'Fukudome, K', 'Hayashi, M', 'Takagi, S', 'Yoshie, O']","['Tanaka Y', 'Fukudome K', 'Hayashi M', 'Takagi S', 'Yoshie O']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed/metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, tat/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/biosynthesis', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Methylation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/virology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1995/02/08 00:00,1995/02/08 00:01,['1995/02/08 00:00'],"['1995/02/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/08 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1995 Feb 8;60(4):554-61. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910600421.,['10.1002/ijc.2910600421 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because vast amounts of potentially graft-vs.-host-reactive T cells are transfused with PBPC grafts, the use of PBPC in the allogeneic setting may be associated with an increased incidence or severity of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). To evaluate strategies for prevention of GVHD after PBPC allografting, we have studied T cell depletion (TCD) of G-CSF-mobilized PBPC samples harvested from six healthy donors and from five patients scheduled for autologous PBPC transplantation. Three approaches (CAMPATH-1 plus autologous complement [C], immunomagnetic CD34+ cell selection, and biotin-avidin-mediated CD34+ cell selection) were compared. TCD of PBPC samples with the monoclonal antibody (MAb) CAMPATH-1 plus autologous C resulted in a median elimination of 2.16 log CD3+ T cells, whereas 39% of CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells and 56% of CD34+ progenitor cells were recovered. TCD by CD34+ cell selection with the Isolex (Baxter, Munich, Germany) or Ceprate (CellPro, Bothell, WA) devices achieved median depletions (Isolex vs. Ceprate) of 4.04 vs. 3.12 log T cells and > 5 vs. 3.27 log NK cells while allowing the recovery of 36 vs. 27% CD34+ cells. The median purity of CD34+ cells in the final product was 1.7 (CAMPATH-1), 94 (Isolex), and 65% (Ceprate). We conclude that all methods tested effectively deplete T cells from PBPC preparations harvested from healthy donors. Whereas immunomagnetic CD34+ selection is most effective in terms of elimination of T cells, the less intensive T and NK cell depletions achieved with CAMPATH-1 might be advantageous with regard to retaining engraftment potential and graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) activity of PBPC allografts.","['Dreger, P', 'Viehmann, K', 'Steinmann, J', 'Eckstein, V', 'Muller-Ruchholtz, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Schmitz, N']","['Dreger P', 'Viehmann K', 'Steinmann J', 'Eckstein V', 'Muller-Ruchholtz W', 'Loffler H', 'Schmitz N']","['Second Department of Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '1405-69-2 (Avidin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, CD/*blood/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Avidin', 'Biotin', 'Blood Component Removal/*methods', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Complement System Proteins', '*Glycoproteins', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', '*T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Feb;23(2):147-54.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The survival of all animal cells may require multiple polypeptide factors and PGCs seem to be no exception (Fig. 7). A number of lines of evidence suggest that membrane-bound forms of SLF may be required for PGC survival. These data suggest an exquisite mechanism for controlling both PGC survival and migration. Thus PGCs that stray from the normal migratory pathway might be eliminated through programmed cell death. SLF, together with LIF, can stimulate PGC proliferation in culture and it seems likely that LIF or a related cytokine may function in vivo to regulate PGC survival and proliferation. Animals doubly deficient in LIF and its relatives may soon allow the roles of these cytokines in PGC development to be determined. Although bFGF is a potent PGC mitogen in vitro, whether PGCs ever encounter bFGF in vivo remains questionable since in culture it alters both the proliferative and developmental potential of PGCs. TGF beta or MIS may be important negative regulators of PGC development, and mice lacking these factors should allow their role in PGC development to be assessed.","['Donovan, P J']",['Donovan PJ'],"['Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, ABL-Basic Research Program, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Top Dev Biol,Current topics in developmental biology,0163114,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics/*physiology', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/physiology', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Germ Cells/*cytology', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/chemistry/genetics/physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Male', 'Mice/*embryology/genetics', 'Mice, Mutant Strains/embryology/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Stem Cells/cytology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Top Dev Biol. 1994;29:189-225. doi: 10.1016/s0070-2153(08)60551-7.,"['S0070-2153(08)60551-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0070-2153(08)60551-7 [doi]']",,,['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Sl', 'c-kit', 'iv', 'ter']",,119,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of patients showing complete Ph disappearance was 64% in those receiving this procedure within the first year of diagnosis. In vitro studies were performed to assess the behavior of the Ph-negative PBPC. In clonogenic cultures they responded to stem cell factor and were able to grow as mixed colonies. Moreover, long-term culture initiating cells (LTCIC) were present in many Ph-negative collections but rarely in Ph-positive PBPC. In 4 females, clonality was studied by analyzing X chromosome inactivation and methylation patterns of the DXS255 locus with the probe M27 beta. Hematopoiesis was polyclonal in all 4 patients tested. Thus far, the Ph-negative collections have been used for autografting in 16 patients (CP, 11 patients; PA, 5 patients) after conditioning with total-body irradiation, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide or idarubicin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Carella, A M', 'Frassoni, F', 'Podesta, M', 'Pungolino, E', 'Pollicardo, N', 'Ferrero, R', 'Soracco, M']","['Carella AM', 'Frassoni F', 'Podesta M', 'Pungolino E', 'Pollicardo N', 'Ferrero R', 'Soracco M']","['Hematology and Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Ospedale S.

The present work has examined the involvement of protein tyrosine phosphorylation in ara-C-induced responses of HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. The results of immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that HL-60 cells respond to ara-C with tyrosine phosphorylation of the cell cycle regulatory protein p34cdc2 and a decrease in the activity of this kinase. This effect was detectable at 15 min of ara-C exposure. Coimmunoprecipitations with anti-p34cdc2 support binding of this protein to the Src-like p56/p53lyn tyrosine kinase in ara-C-treated, but not untreated, cells. The results further demonstrate that ara-C treatment is associated with a dose-dependent activation of p56/p53lyn and that ara-C-induced p56/p53lyn activity is blocked by the protein tyrosine inhibitors herbimycin A and genistein. Studies with a glutathione S-transferase-Lyn fusion protein confirm interaction of p34cdc2 and p56/p53lyn in lysates of ara-C-treated cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that (1) p56/p53lyn phosphorylates Tyr-15 of p34cdc2 in vitro and (2) phosphorylation of p34cdc2 by p56/p53lyn inhibits p34cdc2 activity. These findings indicate that the cellular response to ara-C includes activation of p56/p53lyn and that association of p56/p53lyn with p34cdc2 may contribute to regulation of the cell cycle progression in ara-C-treated cells.","['Yuan, Z M', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Kufe, D']","['Yuan ZM', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe D']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*src-Family Kinases']",1995/01/24 00:00,1995/01/24 00:01,['1995/01/24 00:00'],"['1995/01/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/24 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1995 Jan 24;34(3):1058-63. doi: 10.1021/bi00003a041.,['10.1021/bi00003a041 [doi]'],,,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Biochemistry. 1995 Apr 11;34(14):4908.

A cuprammonium-regenerated cellulose hollow fiber, termed BMM, originally developed for biohazardous viral removal, was used to concentrate two different retroviruses, an ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The BMM was useful for concentrating live virus suspension 10- to 30-fold from 500-1000 ml of culture supernatant. The ecotropic MuLV concentrated by BMM was demonstrated to be viable and biologically intact by XC plaque-forming assay and reverse transcriptase assay. The concentrated MuLV reached a much higher titer in the spleen in mice than the original one. The virus concentration assessed by p24 antigen for HIV was clearly higher than that of the original culture supernatant of HIV-infected cell lines. Since BMM hollow fibers trapped viruses by the sieving mechanism but not by adsorption, the viral particles were recovered by washing and the total live virus recovery rate was high, about 50%. Furthermore 60 min sufficed to handle 1000 ml of supernatant in the case of a filtration area of 0.03 m2. These results show that the BMM provides us with a rapid, safe and efficient method for concentrating live retroviruses.","['Makino, M', 'Ishikawa, G', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Okada, Y', 'Watanabe, K', 'Sasaki-Iwaki, Y', 'Manabe, S', 'Honda, M', 'Komuro, K']","['Makino M', 'Ishikawa G', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Okada Y', 'Watanabe K', 'Sasaki-Iwaki Y', 'Manabe S', 'Honda M', 'Komuro K']","['Department of Bacterial and Blood Products, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '9004-34-6 (Cellulose)', '9050-09-3 (cuprammonium cellulose)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cellulose/analogs & derivatives', 'HIV/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'HIV Core Protein p24/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/analysis', 'Spleen/virology', 'Viral Plaque Assay', '*Virus Replication']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Virol. 1994;139(1-2):87-96. doi: 10.1007/BF01309456.,['10.1007/BF01309456 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To ascertain the reproducibility and relevance of previously conducted gene mutation studies, the Salmonella/microsome test and the L5178Y mouse lymphoma TK+/- assay were repeated according to the protocols that previously produced positive results. For the mouse lymphoma TK+/- assay, standard conditions were employed. For the Salmonella/microsome tests, however, metabolic cofactors were supplemented relative to standard protocols. In addition, trans-anethole was evaluated for its ability to induce chromosome aberrations in vitro in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results presented here indicate that trans-anethole does not increase the mutant frequency in the Salmonella/microsome test, whereas a dose-related response was confirmed in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma TK+/- assay with metabolic activation. The metabolic conditions used in each of the published gene mutation assays may explain the various responses to trans-anethole. Trans-anethole did not induce chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The molecular nature of the genetic change induced in mouse lymphoma cells by trans-anethole has not been identified but the available genotoxicity data are consistent with either a recombination event or a non-DNA reactive mechanism. Considering the trans-anethole genotoxicity data base as a whole, including the positive response observed only in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma TK+/- assay, the irreproducible response in the Salmonella/microsome test, the negative result in the chromosome aberration test in vitro and the results from 32P-postlabeling studies in vivo, as well as the occurrence of liver tumors in the rat bioassay only at doses which exceeded the MTD and caused significant liver toxicity, repeated toxic insult followed by compensatory cell proliferation is favored as an underlying mechanism for the observed rat tumorigenic response.","['Gorelick, N J']",['Gorelick NJ'],"['Procter & Gamble Company, Miami Valley Laboratories, Cincinnati, OH 45253-8707.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Allylbenzene Derivatives)', '0 (Anisoles)', '0 (Flavoring Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '53-59-8 (NADP)', 'Q3JEK5DO4K (anethole)']",IM,"['Allylbenzene Derivatives', 'Animals', 'Anisoles/*toxicity', 'Biotransformation', 'CHO Cells/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavoring Agents/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Microsomes/drug effects/enzymology', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'NADP/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1995 Feb;326(2):199-209. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(94)00173-3.,"['0027510794001733 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(94)00173-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, LY-R cells are more sensitive to killing by hydrogen peroxide: at 37 degrees C LY-R cells are 1.4 times more sensitive to the killing effect of H2O2 than LY-S cells. Pretreatment with the iron chelator desferroxamine followed by hydrogen peroxide treatment at 37 degrees C gives a considerable sparing effect, which is substantially greater for the LY-R subline than for the LY-S subline. This is reflected in the initial DNA damage (estimated by single cell gel electrophoresis), survival and mutation frequency in the HGPRT locus. Similar results have been obtained with calcium chelators, which, according to recent findings (Sandstrom and Granstrom 1993), also are efficient iron chelators.

The gene AFXI, on the X chromosome, is expressed in a variety of cell types. Sequence analysis indicates a high degree of homology between AFXI and the forkhead family of transcription factors.

The present study is intended to investigate the expansion of haemopoiesis by volume selective proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Six patients were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, n = 2) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF, n = 4) for 5d before marrow harvest. MRS investigations were performed prior to treatment (day 0), day 5 and day 12. Spectroscopic examinations were performed with the stimulated echo acquisition mode (STEAM) method on a 1.5 T clinical whole-body imaging unit. A cubic volume of interest (VOI) was selected in the bone marrow of the left iliac bone. The patients responded with a rise in blood absolute neutrophil count from median 3.3 x 10(9)/l (range 1.3-7.3 x 10(9)/l) before to 15.6 x 10(9)/l (range 6.8-22.0 x 10(9)/l) after treatment. Concomitantly an increase in bone marrow cellularity and myeloid:erythroid ratios documented the stimulation of myelopoiesis. During priming, the light-density cell proliferation rate in marrow samples increased from median 21.9 (range 4.5-31) x 10(3) cpm to 54.7 (range 13.9-94) x 10(3) cpm and the total number of myeloid progenitors enumerated as day 7/14 GM-CFUs per volume aspirated marrow increased from median 11/8 x 10(3) (range 4.0-87.5/2.2-103.0) to 64/76 x 10(3) (range 28.4-1180.6/23.2-2850.0).

Cells from 18 seminomas attached poorly to STO, and only a few survived through day 10. In contrast, three seminomas showed a higher degree of attachment.

The presence of stem cell factor was necessary and sufficient for colonies of tumour cells to form during the first 3 days of culture. While the cell number decreased after day 3 in medium without fetal calf serum, it increased until day 9 in medium containing fetal calf serum.

Using immunohistological, flow cytometry and electron microscopic analyses, we investigated the expression of Fas antigen on various skin tissues, and on cultured SV40-transformed human epidermal keratinocyte cell line KJD and human skin squamous cell carcinoma cell line HSC. The Fas antigen was widely distributed in skin components such as the keratinocytes in the lower portion of the epidermis, epidermal dendritic cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, apocrine glands, eccrine sweat glands, sebaceous glands, some normal melanocytes and infiltrating lymphoid cells. It was also strongly expressed on the keratinocytes of lichenoid eruptions seen in lupus erythematosus and lichen planus, and on the spongiotic or acanthotic epidermis seen in chronic eczema, adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and atopic dermatitis. Its expression was closely correlated with lymphoid infiltrating cells and it was strongly expressed in lymphoid neoplastic cells, particularly ATLL cells, and fibroblasts seen in dermatofibroma. However, the antigen was not detected on basal cell epithelioma cells, some malignant melanomas or any junctional naevi. The cell lines KJD and HSC strongly expressed the Fas antigen, and crosslinking of the Fas antigen by an anti-Fas monoclonal antibody induced apoptosis of these cell lines. These results indicate that the apoptosis-mediating Fas antigen may play an important role in normal skin turnover and cell differentiation, in immune regulation of skin tumours, and in the pathogenesis of various skin diseases.","['Oishi, M', 'Maeda, K', 'Sugiyama, S']","['Oishi M', 'Maeda K', 'Sugiyama S']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Sapporo Medical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/etiology/*immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Keratinocytes/*cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Skin/drug effects/*immunology/ultrastructure', 'Skin Diseases/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Diseases, Viral/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/etiology/*immunology/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 1994;286(7):396-407. doi: 10.1007/BF00371800.,['10.1007/BF00371800 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, when this probe was used to screen a human bone marrow cDNA library, eight clones were obtained with information for another putative human peptide antibiotic, designated FALL-39 after the first four residues. FALL-39 is a 39-residue peptide lacking cysteine and tryptophan. All human peptide antibiotics previously isolated (or predicted) belong to the defensin family and contain three disulfide bridges. The clone for prepro-FALL-39 encodes a cathelin-like precursor protein with 170 amino acid residues.

In basal medium E, synthetic FALL-39 was highly active against Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium. Residues 13-34 in FALL-39 can be predicted to form a perfect amphiphatic helix, and CD spectra showed that medium E induced 30% helix formation in FALL-39. RNA blot analyses disclosed that the gene for FALL-39 is expressed mainly in human bone marrow and testis.","['Agerberth, B', 'Gunne, H', 'Odeberg, J', 'Kogner, P', 'Boman, H G', 'Gudmundsson, G H']","['Agerberth B', 'Gunne H', 'Odeberg J', 'Kogner P', 'Boman HG', 'Gudmundsson GH']","['Department of Microbiology, Stockholm University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (FALL 39)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '139637-11-9 (PR 39)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*biosynthesis/chemistry', 'Anti-Infective Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Cysteine', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptides/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'RNA/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Swine', 'Testis/*metabolism']",1995/01/03 00:00,1995/01/03 00:01,['1995/01/03 00:00'],"['1995/01/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/03 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1995 Jan 3;92(1):195-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.92.1.195.,['10.1073/pnas.92.1.195 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/Z38026'],,,,PMC42844,,,,,,,,,

Following our protocol, we found that in vitro binding of factor A correlated with the in vivo activity of the M-MuLV silencer. Factor A bound specifically to the wild-type silencer element at room temperature and 30 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C, and bound 10-fold better to the full-length silencer than to a minimal silencer core element. The factor was enriched in nuclear compared with cytosolic extracts and in undifferentiated EC cells compared with differentiated cells in which the silencer is nonfunctional. Salt and ion requirements for factor A binding were investigated, and partial purification steps indicated the factor to be a heparin-Sepharose-binding moiety of greater than 100 kDa. To examine possible relationships between silencer and PBS activities, sequences representing phenylalanine, isoleucine, lysine-1,2, lysine-3, methionine, and tryptophan PBS DNA fragments were tested in vivo for stem cell-specific repression of M-MuLV expression and in vitro in DNA binding assays. Of these PBS elements, only the lysine-1,2 PBS DNA fragment showed consistently high levels of repression. Interestingly, the lysine-1,2 PBS DNA fragment also formed a complex with an EC cell factor with characteristics similar to those of factor A. However, the two factors did not cross-compete in binding studies, suggesting that they may be different but related factors. Our results suggest that expression of Mason-Pfizer monkey virus, visna virus, and spumavirus, which use the lysine-1,2 PBS, may be inhibited in undifferentiated stem cells.","['Yamauchi, M', 'Freitag, B', 'Khan, C', 'Berwin, B', 'Barklis, E']","['Yamauchi M', 'Freitag B', 'Khan C', 'Berwin B', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1995 Feb;69(2):1142-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.69.2.1142-1149.1995.,['10.1128/JVI.69.2.1142-1149.1995 [doi]'],,,['1 R01 CA53332-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC188687,,,,,,,,,

The strain was multiply resistant to antibiotics; the MIC and MBC of vancomycin were 2 and 4 mg/liter, and the MIC and MBC of teicoplanin were 4 and 16 mg/liter, respectively. We performed a surveillance study on the carriage of S. haemolyticus in medical and nursing staff of the hospital ward where the patient was treated. S. haemolyticus was isolated from 18 sites on 12 of the 39 people tested. A number of typing methods were performed in order to investigate the possible relationships among the isolates. Methods used were immunoblotting of staphylococcal peptides, plasmid analysis, restriction fragment length polymorphism of chromosomal DNA, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of total DNA. Compared with the immunoblotting technique, the molecular methods were more discriminative. The strain colonizing the patient showed a consistent pattern by all typing methods during isolation. When the immunoblot technique was used, similar patterns were found with isolates from hospital staff and isolates from unrelated sources. With the molecular techniques, no evidence of a local spread of the patient's strain was found. However, plasmid profiles and restriction fragment length polymorphism and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns showed that S. haemolyticus isolates collected from hospital ward personnel were related, which was not the case with isolates collected from unrelated sources. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was more discriminative when IS431 was used as a DNA probe instead of a probe based on the 16S rRNA gene. S. haemolyticus, as in this case, may develop resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin. These antibiotics are considered the last-resort drugs for the therapy of nosocomial gram-positive infections. Thus, local spread of staphylococci resistant to these drugs is an important problem, which should be prevented by strict hygienic measures and antibiotic policy.","['Degener, J E', 'Heck, M E', 'van Leeuwen, W J', 'Heemskerk, C', 'Crielaard, A', 'Joosten, P', 'Caesar, P']","['Degener JE', 'Heck ME', 'van Leeuwen WJ', 'Heemskerk C', 'Crielaard A', 'Joosten P', 'Caesar P']","['Department of Medical Microbiology, Public Health Laboratory, Leeuwarden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 16S)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier State/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Cross Infection/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'DNA, Ribosomal/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Personnel, Hospital', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'RNA, Bacterial/genetics', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 16S/genetics', 'Staphylococcal Infections/complications/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Staphylococcus/classification/drug effects/*isolation & purification']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1994 Sep;32(9):2260-5. doi: 10.1128/jcm.32.9.2260-2265.1994.,['10.1128/jcm.32.9.2260-2265.1994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC263978,['J Clin Microbiol 1994 Nov;32(11):2887'],,,,,,,,

Spanish Multicentric Study Group for Hematopoietic Recovery.,293-7,"The role of flow cytometric reticulocyte (RET) counting and the immature RET fractions (IRF) in the evaluation of hematopoietic recovery following chemoradiotherapy-induced aplasia was studied. RET counts and IRF were studied using an automated flow cytometric reticulocyte counter (Sysmex R-2000) in three groups of patients: 58 patients undergoing an autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT group), 28 of whom received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); 28 patients undergoing an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT group); and 28 patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia (CHEMO group). To evaluate the IRF the percentages of RET fractions with middle and high fluorescence reticulocyte (MFR and HFR, respectively) were used. A rising IRF (expressed as the percentage of MFR + HFR) was the first sign of hematopoietic recovery (ABMT group, IRF 9 days versus 18 days for the absolute neutrophil count (ANC); BMT group, 15 versus 18 days; CHEMO group, 9 versus 11 days). When recovery of the ANC (> 0.5 x 10(9)/l) was compared with that of the iRF (MFR + HFR > 5%), statistically significant differences were found in all three groups. Additionally, 93.1% of the ABMT, 92% of the BMT and 91.2% of the CHEMO recovered the IRF before the ANC. In conclusion, an elevation in the percentage of IRF is the first sign of hematologic recovery in the majority of patients receiving remission-induction chemotherapy and the first sign of engraftment in those submitted to ABMT or BMT.

We describe the novel finding that the phosphatase-resistant ATP analogue, ATP gamma S, mimics antigen-induced serotonin secretion and cytoskeletal rearrangements in permeabilized cells. Confocal microscopy of unstimulated cells shows that myosin and F-actin are concentrated at the plasma membrane. Upon addition of ATP gamma S, F-actin becomes rearranged into membrane ruffles and also associates with myosin in a cytoplasmic meshwork, concentrated perinuclearly. F-actin and myosin ultimately become colocalized into parallel microfilament bundles located on the basolateral membrane. During this period the cell height decreases whilst the cell area increases more than twofold. Gel electrophoresis shows that the cytoskeletal proportion of actin remains unchanged, indicating that the rearrangements occur within the total F-actin pool. The distribution of microtubules and intermediate filaments is unchanged in the presence of ATP gamma S. These results suggest that overcoming a phosphatase may be sufficient to induce secretion in RBL-2H3 cells, and that this secretion may be regulated by F-actin and myosin rearrangements.","['Ludowyke, R I', 'Kawasugi, K', 'French, P W']","['Ludowyke RI', 'Kawasugi K', 'French PW']","[""Centre for Immunology, St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Actins)', ""35094-46-3 (adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate))"", '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)']",IM,"['Actins/*drug effects', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Chemical Fractionation', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Myosins/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1994 Aug;64(2):357-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This artifact can result in the apparent coexpression of CD4 and CD8 (observed in lymphoblastic processes) or of CD5 and CD20 (characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia) in normal persons, leading to an erroneous diagnosis. Using plasma, serum, or immunoglobulin preparations from donors who exhibit this artifact we sought to determine 1) the source of the artifact and 2) ways to overcome it.

When human HL60 promyelocytic cells differentiate in vitro, the transcriptional activity of the MYC gene is down-regulated. We have shown that in the expressed MYC gene, 56% of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) are removed within 18 h and the transcribed strand is selectively repaired. However, late in differentiation, when the MYC gene is maximally down-regulated, only 15% of the CPDs are removed within the same period. During early differentiation, the MYC gene is regulated by a block to transcription elongation at the 5' end of the first intron. Our results reveal no significant difference in the rate of CPD removal between the restriction fragments upstream and downstream of this elongation block. Furthermore, both strands of each fragment exhibit similar repair characteristics. In contrast, the constitutively expressed FMS gene exhibits proficient removal of CPD in both the differentiated and undifferentiated cells. Furthermore, the repair appears to be more proficient at the 5' end (exon 1) than in the 3' end of the gene about 35 kilobases downstream from exon 1. Since efficient repair of the active FMS gene is maintained in the differentiated cells the loss of repair competence seen in MYC is more likely associated with its reduced transcriptional activity than with a decrease in the overall repair capacity of the terminally differentiated cells.","['Islas, A L', 'Hanawalt, P C']","['Islas AL', 'Hanawalt PC']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, California 94305-5020.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Pyrimidine Dimers)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*genetics', '*DNA Repair', 'Down-Regulation', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, fms/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Pyrimidine Dimers/*metabolism', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1995/01/15 00:00,1995/01/15 00:01,['1995/01/15 00:00'],"['1995/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1995 Jan 15;55(2):336-41.,,,,['CA 44349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['FMS', 'MYC']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean percentage of the cells expressing c-kit molecule among the lymphoid marker-positive cases was significantly larger than that among the lymphoid marker-negative cases (p < 0.05). All 19 lymphoid leukemia cases were c-kit-negative, including 8 cases which were positive for some myeloid markers. Stem cell factor enhanced the colony growth in five out of six acute myeloblastic leukemia cases expressing the c-kit molecule. On the other hand, SCF did not stimulate colony growth in any of the four cases which were not positive for the c-kit molecule. These findings indicated that the distribution of flow cytometrically detectable c-kit molecules on leukemic cells is related to the morphologic and immunologic classification of these leukemic cells and to the expression of the CD34 cell surface molecule on some myeloid leukemic cells. On such cells, expression of the c-kit molecule may have a functional role and be related to the maturation process.","['Kubota, A', 'Okamura, S', 'Shimoda, K', 'Harada, M', 'Niho, Y']","['Kubota A', 'Okamura S', 'Shimoda K', 'Harada M', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Aug;14(5-6):421-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049699.,['10.3109/10428199409049699 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ubiquitous expression of RHAMM suggests the existence of multiple isoforms, and indeed, RHAMM is found in various cellular compartments, namely nuclear, cytosolic, membrane-bound and extracellular. In this review, we emphasize the evolving role of RHAMM in B cell malignancies, and examine the function of RHAMM in T cell development in the thymic microenvironment. Both the motile behaviour of progenitor thymocytes (CD3-CD4-CD8-) and malignant B cells from multiple myeloma (MM), plasma cell leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia was blocked by monoclonal antibodies to RHAMM, suggesting that motility may correlate with increased expression of RHAMM at the cell surface. Interestingly, the soluble form of RHAMM is able to inhibit fibroblast locomotion, and it is likely that a balance between expression of both forms determines, in part the motility of cells. RHAMM appears to play a fundamental role in the immune system and the ability of RHAMM to function as a motility receptor is likely to be due to complex variables including the extent to which soluble RHAMM is secreted. RHAMM expression characterizes circulating monoclonal B cells as abnormal. potentially invasive and/or metastatic components of myeloma and may underlie the malignant behavior of these cells.","['Pilarski, L M', 'Masellis-Smith, A', 'Belch, A R', 'Yang, B', 'Savani, R C', 'Turley, E A']","['Pilarski LM', 'Masellis-Smith A', 'Belch AR', 'Yang B', 'Savani RC', 'Turley EA']","['Department of Immunology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Aug;14(5-6):363-74. doi: 10.3109/10428199409049691.,['10.3109/10428199409049691 [doi]'],,,,,,,83,,,,,,,,,,

To study the lineage distribution of Mpl-R in normal hematopoietic cells, we developed a monoclonal antibody (designated M1 MoAb) by immunizing mice with a soluble form of the human Mpl-R protein. With few exceptions, Mpl-R was detected by indirect immunofluorescent analysis on all human leukemic hematopoietic cell lines with pluripotential and megakaryocytic phenotypes, but not on other cell lines. By immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, M1 MoAb recognized a band at 82 to 84 kD corresponding to the expected size of the glycosylated receptor. Among normal hematopoietic cells, M1 MoAb strongly stained megakaryocytes (MK) and Mpl-R was detected on platelets by indirect immunofluorescence staining or immunoblotting. On purified CD34+ cells, less than 2% of the population was stained, but the labeling was weak and just above the threshold of detection. However, dual-labeling with the M1 and antiplatelet glycoprotein MoAbs showed that most Mpl-R+/CD34+ cells coexpressed CD41a, CD61, or CD42a, suggesting that cell surface appearance of Mpl-R and platelet glycoproteins could be coordinated. M1-positive and M1-negative subsets were sorted from purified CD34+ cell populations. Colony assays showed that the absolute number of hematopoietic progenitors was extremely low and no primitive progenitors were present in the CD34+/Mpl-R+ fraction. However, this cell fraction was significantly enriched in low proliferative colony-forming units-MK. When the CD34+/Mpl-R+ fraction was grown in liquid culture containing human aplastic serum and a combination of growth factors, mature MK were seen as early as day 4, whereas the predominant cell population was erythroblasts on day 8. Similar data were also obtained with the CD34+/Mpl-R- fraction with, however, a delay in the time of appearance of both MK and erythroblasts. In conclusion, Mpl-R is a cytokine receptor restricted to the MK cell lineage. Its expression is low on CD34+ cells and these cells mainly correspond to late MK progenitors and transitional cells. These data indicate that the action of the Mpl-R ligand might predominate during the late stages of human MK differentiation.","['Debili, N', 'Wendling, F', 'Cosman, D', 'Titeux, M', 'Florindo, C', 'Dusanter-Fourt, I', 'Schooley, K', 'Methia, N', 'Charon, M', 'Nador, R']","['Debili N', 'Wendling F', 'Cosman D', 'Titeux M', 'Florindo C', 'Dusanter-Fourt I', 'Schooley K', 'Methia N', 'Charon M', 'Nador R', 'et al.']","['INSERM U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1995/01/15 00:00,1995/01/15 00:01,['1995/01/15 00:00'],"['1995/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jan 15;85(2):391-401.,['S0006-4971(20)71263-2 [pii]'],,,,,['c-mpl'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although variable in size, these deletions are usually interstitial. With the object of defining a commonly deleted region for smaller 20q deletions, we used quantitative Southern blot analysis complemented by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to determine the copy number at 15 loci spanning 20q. The proximal breakpoints of three such deletions were found to separate HCK and the growth hormone releasing factor (GHRF) locus near the centromeric boundary of band 20q11.2. The distal breakpoints were localized to the vicinity of the D20S22 locus in band q13.1. A candidate tumor suppressor gene, RBL2, and the SRC oncogene were both located within the commonly deleted region. Six loci in terminal region q13.2-q13.3 were conserved on these del(20q) chromosomes, thereby confirming that the deletions were interstitial. Molecular heterogeneity at one and possibly both deletion breakpoints rules out the pathological involvement of loci at these sites.

The guanosine/thymidine-containing oligonucleotides (GTOs) which demonstrated anti-FMLV activity in acute infection assays were synthesized with natural phosphodiester (PD) linkages (backbones). The observed antiviral activities of these oligonucleotides increased significantly when the PD backbone was replaced with a phosphorothioate (PT) backbone. Experiments designed to investigate a potential antiviral mechanism of action demonstrated that oligonucleotides tested were capable of blocking virus adsorption. In addition, GTOs with PD backbones were competitive inhibitors of FMLV reverse transcriptase (RT). When the same experiments were performed using oligonucleotides with PT backbones, all compounds tested demonstrated significant competitive inhibition of FMLV RT. The measured inhibitory activity of all compounds tested in culture assays was enhanced by at least a factor of 10 when the PD linkages were replaced with PT. The enhanced antiviral activity exhibited by the sulfur group on the oligonucleotide backbone, and the lack of any designed, sequence-specific interactions, suggest that a large percentage of the reported antiviral activity of oligonucleotides containing a phosphorothioate backbone is due to factors other than rationally designed, sequence-specific interactions.

Effects on liver metabolism and fibrogenesis.,236-44,"The liver is the largest organ in the body providing a large number of essential functions for the organism. It is the center for the metabolism of nutrients and drugs, and plays a key role in the unspecific immune system by harbouring Kupfer cells, the majority of all macrophages. The liver is the main site for the synthesis of many different metabolites and releases most of the plasma proteins. All these functions of the liver must be coordinated and regulated in response to metabolic changes and minor or major injuries. This is accomplished by metabolites, the autonomous nerve system, the endocrine system and by cytokines, which form a complex network of mediator molecules. Cytokines modulate liver metabolism in many ways. Synthesis of acute phase proteins is regulated by cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, TNF, transforming growth factor beta, epidermal growth factor, and ciliary derived neurotropic factor, which interact synergistically with corticosteroids and insulin. Hepatic lipid metabolism and hepatic carbohydrate metabolism are also regulated by cytokines and by classical hormones. Cytokines play an important role in the pathogenesis of liver diseases and liver fibrosis, which is the common morphological reaction after chronic injury of the liver. An uncontrolled production of extracellular matrix and its impaired degradation destroy the architecture of the liver and its function. Fat-storing cells (Ito cells, lipocytes, perisinusoidal cells) are the major source of extracellular matrix in the liver. They are activated to proliferate or to produce extracellular matrix compounds by cytokines like transforming growth factor beta, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF). Interferon gamma and alpha inhibit this activation. Modulation of fibrogenesis by these cytokines may be helpful for future treatment of liver fibrosis.","['Andus, T', 'Holstege, A']","['Andus T', 'Holstege A']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin I, Universitatsklinikum Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Belgium,Acta Gastroenterol Belg,Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,0414075,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Liver Cirrhosis/metabolism', 'Liver Diseases/*metabolism']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Gastroenterol Belg. 1994 May-Aug;57(3-4):236-44.,,,,,,,,52,,,,,,,,,,

I discuss here the possibility that different, but related, MHC haplotypes would predispose either to autoimmune disease or to B-CLL, based on our findings obtained from MHC (H-2)-congenic New Zealand mouse strains.","['Shirai, T']",['Shirai T'],"['Department of Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 1994 May;173(1):133-40. doi: 10.1620/tjem.173.133.,['10.1620/tjem.173.133 [doi]'],,,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,

The cultured cells were Epstein-Barr virus-negative and exhibited the morphological and ultrastructural features characteristic of plasma cells. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the presence of cytoplasmic IgA kappa as well as the plasma cell-associated surface antigens CD38 and CD56. Other B-cell markers, including CD10, CD19, CD20, and HLA-DR, were absent. The UTMC-2 cells were interleukin (IL)-6 responsive: Co-culture with IL-6 increased IgA kappa synthesis and cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, an IL-6 antisense oligonucleotide had an opposite effect. Although the UTMC-2 cells expressed IL-6 mRNA (as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) and contained IL-6, the concentration of this cytokine in cell culture supernatants was less than that detectable by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) employed (i.e. <3 pg/ml). Further, cell growth was not inhibited by polyclonal or monoclonal anti-IL-6 antibodies. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that IL-6 receptors present on the surface of the UTMC-2 cells were not saturated with endogenous IL-6. Taken together, these results indicate that, in this human plasma cell line, IL-6 functions uniquely in an intracellular autocrine fashion to enhance Ig synthesis and cell growth. In this respect, the UTMC-2 cells represent a novel resource for further study of the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma.","['Ozaki, S', 'Wolfenbarger, D', 'deBram-Hart, M', 'Kanangat, S', 'Weiss, D T', 'Solomon, A']","['Ozaki S', 'Wolfenbarger D', 'deBram-Hart M', 'Kanangat S', 'Weiss DT', 'Solomon A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Medical Center/Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville 37920.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Division', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/biosynthesis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Dec;8(12):2207-13.,,,,['CA 10056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At later stages when leukapheresis procedures were started, the CD34+/33+ cells predominated in five of six patients. In leukapheresis harvests of peripheral blood, and in bone marrow addition of SCF and IL-6 to the culturing medium enhanced the plating efficiency. In peripheral blood an increase from 12 to 22% for CD34+/33+ and from 6 to 14% for CD34+/33- was observed. In normal bone marrow we observed an increase from 15 to 23% for CD34+/33+ and from 7 to 17% for CD34+/33-.

In addition, the bactericidal activity of U937 cells was increased by ubenimex treatment, and was further enhanced by treatment with macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). Furthermore, ubenimex augmented the expression of M-CSF receptors by U937 cells and enhanced the tyrosine kinase activity of cellular pp60c-src.

ATRA alone did not show any colony-stimulating ability when added in culture to partially purified bone marrow populations.

Since ATRA had only modest stimulatory effects on purified CD34+ cells, the megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity of ATRA was mainly due to an increased production of endogenous cytokines by bone marrow accessory cells. In parallel experiments, the in vitro growth of the different hematopoietic progenitors was evaluated in 28 patients affected by acute non-lymphoid leukemia (ANLL), mainly acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Bone marrow cells were harvested after remission induction obtained: (i) in ten APL patients treated with ATRA followed by one chemotherapy cycle (CHT) (3/7: Daunorubicin+Ara-C): group A ('ATRA/CHT'); (ii) eight APL patients treated with one CHT cycle alone (3/7 as above): group B ('APL-CHT'); (iii) in ten ANLL-non-APL patients after one CHT cycle (3/7 as above): group C ('ANLL-CHT'). The number of the different hematopoietic progenitors, and in particular CFU-GM and CFU-meg, was significantly higher in APL patients treated with ATRA plus CHT (group A) compared to APL (group B) or ANLL-non-APL (group C) patients treated with CHT alone (CFU-GM: p = 0.01; CFU-meg: p = 0.03).

In addition, ATRA has been reported to induce complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the majority of the patients relapse after several months of ATRA therapy. Since one possible cause of relapse in these patients is drug resistance, it is of interest to investigate the antileukemic activity of other agents that can be used in combination with ATRA in order to overcome this problem. Vitamin D3 analogs such as 1,25-dihydroxy-delta 16-23-yne-cholecalciferol (16-23-D3) are also capable of inducing differentiation of myeloid leukemic cells.

We have observed that the resistant cell line (HL-60/RA) was more sensitive to the antileukemic action of 16-23-D3 than the parental cell line with respect to the inhibition of cell growth and DNA synthesis, the induction of differentiation and the loss of cell clonogenicity.","['Dore, B T', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Momparler, R L']","['Dore BT', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Momparler RL']","['Departement de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'O13QTC8612 (Ro 23-7553)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Dec;8(12):2179-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such interactions have importance since the processes of homing and egress within the marrow microenvironment involve the traverse of sinusoidal endothelium. Umbilical vein endothelial monolayers expressed CD44 and CD54 constitutively, and expression of both E-selectin (ELAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were inducible with interleukin-1 (IL-1) alpha and beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). CD34+ marrow cells bound to unstimulated endothelial layers (33 vs. 16% to plastic), and their adhesion was significantly increased in the presence of IL-1 or TNF. This increased adhesion was not inhibited by functionally blocking antibodies to E-selectin or to CD54 but was partially inhibited by antibodies to VCAM. CD34+ KG1a cells also bound to endothelial monolayers (33 vs. 8% to plastic), and such adhesion was also upregulated by pretreatment of the endothelial cells with IL-1 or TNF. In contrast to normal CD34+ cells, this increased adhesion was inhibited by antibodies to E-selectin but not to VCAM.

Recent work established CD30 as a member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor superfamily whose ligand (CD30L) has also been cloned and expressed; CD30L is active as membrane-bound type II glycoprotein. Here, CD30L mRNA expression was studied in a panel of 102 continuous human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines and was found only in four Burkitt lymphoma, one Burkit-type acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cell line. The product of CD30L mRNA is expressed as a membrane protein on the surface of these malignant B-cell lines. Treatment of these cell lines with soluble CD27L, phorbol ester or staphylococcus aureus Cowan antigen resulted in the enhancement of cell surface CD30L protein expression. CD30L mRNA was not detected in normal unstimulated peripheral blood (PB) monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages, or T-cells, but was detected in primary granulocytes; exposure to activating reagents induced and upregulated CD30L transcription in these different PB populations. While CD40 and CD30L surface protein expression on PB monocytes could be enhanced or induced by treatment with gamma-interferon, these cells remained negative for CD30, both at the mRNA and at the protein level. Similarly, PB monocyte-derived macrophages and granulocytes remained negative for CD30 mRNA and protein expression, regardless of stimulation. Only activated T-cells expressed CD30 mRNA and surface protein. CD30L-transfected cells and cells constitutively expressing CD30L delivered a similar stimulus for proliferation of the CD30+ Hodgkin's disease (HD)-derived cell line HDLM-2, but inhibited proliferation of the CD30+ large cell anaplastic lymphoma cell line KARPAS-299. These data provide strong evidence for the involvement in growth regulation of recombinant and natural CD30L through its interaction with the CD30 receptor. Collectively, these data suggest that the CD30L-CD30 interaction has potent biological activity and might play a critical role in the immune response and pathogenesis of HD and some NHL, in particular Burkitt lymphomas.","['Gruss, H J', 'DaSilva, N', 'Hu, Z B', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Goodwin, R G', 'Drexler, H G']","['Gruss HJ', 'DaSilva N', 'Hu ZB', 'Uphoff CC', 'Goodwin RG', 'Drexler HG']","['Immunex Research and Development Corporation, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD30 Ligand)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (TNFSF8 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'CD30 Ligand', 'CD40 Antigens', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Dec;8(12):2083-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we aimed to further investigate the effects of this drug combination. In vitro, on fresh AML cells from ten patients, our results confirm an additive cytotoxic effect displayed by fludarabine + Ara-C, as demonstrated by isobologram analysis of the data. The addition of G-CSF significantly increased the efficacy of the drug combination. These effects appeared to be related to an increased incorporation of [3H]Ara-C into cellular DNA in the presence of fludarabine + G-CSF. Furthermore, the quantitative evaluation of programmed cell death (apoptosis) showed that fludarabine + Ara-C + G-CSF induce apoptosis to a higher degree than either compound alone.

One of the required intermediates is leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; Shadiack et al., J Neurosci 13:2601-2609, 1993). In the present study we have examined the possibility that ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is another intermediate involved in the IL-1 induction of sympathetic SP. CNTF mimics the action of IL-1CM by raising both SP and choline acetyltransferase activity--actions that are blocked by a specific neutralizing antiserum for CNTF. However, IL-1CM and CNTF differ in their response to depolarizing agents: while KCl (40 mM) blocks the action of IL-1CM (and LIF), it enhances the action of CNTF. Furthermore, neither CNTF bioactivity nor CNTF protein is detected in IL-1CM. Neutralizing antiserum to CNTF fails to block the action of either IL-1 or IL-1CM, suggesting that neither a soluble nor a membrane-bound form of the molecule is active in direct response to IL-1 action. While Northern blots confirm the presence of both CNTF and CNTF receptor mRNA in neonatal ganglia, neither culturing nor IL-1 treatment alters these mRNA levels. These data taken together suggest that while CNTF is present and possibly active in sympathetic ganglia, it is not a mediator of the IL-1 induction of SP.","['Ding, M', 'Hart, R P', 'Shadiack, A M', 'Jonakait, G M']","['Ding M', 'Hart RP', 'Shadiack AM', 'Jonakait GM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Culture Techniques', 'Electrophysiology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/*metabolism/physiology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Substance P/*metabolism']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1994 Aug 15;38(6):640-7. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490380606.,['10.1002/jnr.490380606 [doi]'],,,"['KO2 MH00855/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30560/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the substrates of tyrosine phosphorylation is the Epo receptor (EpoR). The carboxyl region of EpoR cytoplasmic domain is required for EpoR phosphorylation and has been shown to negatively affect the response to Epo both in vivo and in cell lines. Hematopoietic cell phosphatase (HCP) has also been hypothesized to negatively regulate erythropoiesis, based on the hypersensitivity to Epo of erythroid lineage cells in moth-eaten mice that genetically lack HCP. In the studies presented here, we show that HCP binds the tyrosine phosphorylated Epo receptor through the amino-terminal src-homology 2 (SH2) domain of HCP. Using a series of phosphotyrosine-containing peptides, potential HCP binding sites in the cytoplasmic domain of the EpoR are identified. The results support the concept that, after Epo stimulation, phosphorylation of EpoR provides a docking site for HCP in the receptor complex. Recruitment of HCP to the complex and its subsequent dephosphorylation of substrates and/or associated kinases may be important to mitigate the ligand-induced mitogenic response.","['Yi, T', 'Zhang, J', 'Miura, O', 'Ihle, J N']","['Yi T', 'Zhang J', 'Miura O', 'Ihle JN']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation Research Institute, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn6 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Disulfides/metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jan 1;85(1):87-95.,['S0006-4971(20)69775-0 [pii]'],,,"['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK42932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) specific for either E-selectin or P-selectin are protective in several animal models of inflammatory disease. To generate an MoAb with broader therapeutic potential, MoAbs that bind to both E- and P-selectin were generated by immunization of mice with mouse pre-B cell lines transfected with human E- and P-selectin. Interestingly, although the only selection criterion was the ability to bind both E- and P-selectin, all three antibodies obtained efficiently block both E- and P-selectin-mediated functions. The inhibited functions include neutrophil or HL-60 cell binding to tumor necrosis factor-alpha-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells, E- or P-selectin transfectant cell lines, and platelet-HL-60 rosetting. These antibodies, EP-5C7, EP-2C9, and EP-1D8, recognize the same or overlapping epitope within the lectin domains of E- and P-selectin. The data suggest that functionally important epitopes of homologous proteins can be targeted by selecting for antibodies with reactivity toward both proteins. Furthermore, a potent blocking antibody specific for both E- and P-selectin may provide a more effective and broadly useful reagent for treating acute and potentially certain chronic inflammatory conditions.","['Berg, E L', 'Fromm, C', 'Melrose, J', 'Tsurushita, N']","['Berg EL', 'Fromm C', 'Melrose J', 'Tsurushita N']","['Protein Design Labs, Inc.

The percentage of COS cells with rosettes (five or more adherent RBCs) was determined. Normal RBCs did not adhere to VCAM-1-transfected COS cells.

The adherent SS RBCs were a young reticulocyte population, staining positively for transferrin receptor. Another measure of reticulocyte age, RNA content, also correlated with adherence. SS RBC binding was specific--inhibitable by antibodies to either VCAM-1 or the alpha 4 integrin chain of VLA-4.

To determine whether D-factor can induce the differentiation of leukemia cells other than M1 cells, WEHI-3B D+ mouse myelomonocytic leukemia cells were transfected with a plasmid containing mouse D-factor receptor cDNA. Expression of D-factor receptor in transfected cells was determined by binding of [125]D-factor and analyzed by Scatchard's method. The transfected cells had high-affinity D-factor receptors with a dissociation constant of 100 to 200 pmol/L and binding sites per cell varied from 67 to 1,500 among several clones. The cells expressing a high level of D-factor receptor were induced to differentiate by D-factor; about 60% of the cells exhibited the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium and expression of the differentiation antigen Mac-1 (CD11b) on the cell surface increased. The effect of cytokines, which induce the differentiation of M1 cells, on the transfected WEHI-3B cells was examined. The sensitivity to oncostatin M was identical to that against D-factor in the cells of each clone. Expression of D-factor receptor in WEHI-3B cells promoted sensitivity to IL-6 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Induction of differentiation of the cells accompanied the suppression of proliferation. Treatment of the cells with D-factor for longer than 5 days resulted in 50% inhibition of growth. These results indicate that the stimulating effect of D-factor on the differentiation of malignant myeloid cells is not unique to M1 cells.","['Tomida, M']",['Tomida M'],"['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1995 Jan 1;85(1):217-21.,['S0006-4971(20)69790-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both aspects were addressed in subsequent clinical phase II studies and preclinical investigations. In a first clinical trial, 36 patients with high-risk AML received granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) after successful cytoreductive chemotherapy and experienced a shortening of the period of post-therapeutic neutropenia by 6 to 9 days, leading to a significant reduction of treatment-associated deaths from 39% to 14%. In preclinical studies an enhancement of the cytotoxicity of cytosine arabinoside (AraC) on leukemic blasts could be shown by pretreatment with GM-CSF or IL-3. Investigations on the impact of hematopoietic growth factors on the intracellular metabolism of AraC indicated that this effect was primarily mediated by an increase in the activity of DNA-polymerase-alpha. The evaluation of different doses of AraC showed the most marked increase after the combination of GM-CSF with conventional rather than high doses of AraC. Based on these preclinical experiments, a prospective randomized trial was subsequently initiated investigating the effect of GM-CSF before and during induction, consolidation, and the first two cycles of maintenance chemotherapy in newly diagnosed AML. This ongoing trial has enrolled 67 patients at the current time. An early interim analysis showed no differences in remission rates but a tendency toward a longer remission duration in patients receiving GM-CSF. These data indicate that hematopoietic growth factors like GM-CSF in particular may provide a new perspective in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia with the possibility of reducing treatment associated mortality and perhaps of increasing the efficacy of antileukemic treatment.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B', 'Reuter, C', 'Schleyer, E', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Bockmann, A', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B', 'Reuter C', 'Schleyer E', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Bockmann A', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase II/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1994 Dec;21(6 Suppl 16):33-8.,,,,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,

Thus several interleukins (1, 3, 4, 6, and 11), tumor necrosis factors (alpha, beta), colony-stimulating factors (M and GM), leukemia inhibitory factor, gamma-interferon, and transforming growth factor-beta have effects on bone resorption and bone formation in vivo and in vitro. The kallikrein-kinin system and the coagulation cascade are also activated in inflammation. We have found that peptides produced in the kallikrein-kinin system (bradykinin, kallidin) and thrombin, the end product in the coagulation cascade, can stimulate bone resorption in vitro. The stimulatory effect of bradykinin is linked both to B1 and B2 bradykinin receptors. Both kinins and thrombin stimulate prostaglandin biosynthesis in bone parallel with the bone resorptive effect. The stimulatory effect of bradykinin on bone resorption is completely lost when the prostaglandin response is abolished, whereas thrombin can stimulate bone resorption both via prostaglandin-dependent and independent mechanisms. In addition, bradykinin and thrombin act in concert with interleukin-1 to synergistically stimulate bone resorption and prostaglandin biosynthesis. We also have found that one of the acute-phase reactants, haptoglobin, can stimulate bone resorption in vitro, indicating the possibility of generalized bone loss in chronic inflammatory diseases. Moreover, haptoglobin synergistically potentiates bradykinin-induced and thrombin-induced prostanoid biosynthesis in osteoblasts. These observations indicate that the rate of bone resorption in inflammation-induced bone loss may not be due to a single factor but to the concerted action of several local or systemic factors.","['Lerner, U H']",['Lerner UH'],"['Department of Oral Cell Biology, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology",0376406,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '0 (Bradykinin Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (Kinins)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '9001-30-3 (Factor XII)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/*physiology', 'Bone Resorption/*metabolism', 'Bradykinin Receptor Antagonists', 'Factor XII/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kallikrein-Kinin System/*physiology', 'Kinins/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/biosynthesis']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol. 1994 Oct;78(4):481-93. doi: 10.1016/0030-4220(94)90043-4.,['10.1016/0030-4220(94)90043-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,87,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro methods for identifying tumor promoters with suitable sensitivity and specificity have been particularly elusive. Experiments are described which suggest that the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 provides a sensitive indicator of promoter-induced changes to gene regulation and expression. As a result of differentiation these cells undergo a transition from a non-phagocytic suspension culture to an attached fibroblast-like culture which exhibits high phagocytic activity. Fluorescent latex particles were used as sensors to highlight the phagocytic phenotype and permitted the use of flow cytometry to automatically quantitate particle internalization. To evaluate specificity, HL-60 cells were treated with a series of phorbol esters covering a range of in vivo tumor promoting activity. Results indicate that this family of compounds induces HL-60 cells to differentiate in proportion to their in vivo promoting activity. To closely assess the sensitivity of the phagocytic endpoint, HL-60 cells were treated with picogram levels of 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), whereupon increments as low as 50 pg of TPA per ml caused statistically significant increases in phagocytic activity. The experiments described herein suggest that in vitro differentiation of HL-60 cells may reflect the promoter-dependent modifications to gene expression that are observed in vivo during the promotion phase of carcinogenesis. The described method may represent a sensitive promoter screening assay which is both rapid and economical.","['Dertinger, S D', 'Torous, D K', 'Tometsko, A M']","['Dertinger SD', 'Torous DK', 'Tometsko AM']","['Litron Laboratories, Rochester, NY 14620.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phorbols)']",IM,"['Carcinogenicity Tests/*methods', 'Carcinogens/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Microspheres', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Phorbol Esters/toxicity', 'Phorbols/toxicity', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/02/01 00:00,1995/02/01 00:01,['1995/02/01 00:00'],"['1995/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1995 Feb;334(1):49-57. doi: 10.1016/0165-1161(95)90030-6.,"['0165-1161(95)90030-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1161(95)90030-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional construction of the bisbenzimidazole ring system from the piperazinyl terminus, via two consecutive Pinner-type reactions, gave low yields of products contaminated with the 2-methyl analogue which proved difficult to separate. An alternative synthesis was developed, involving construction of the bisbenzimidazole from the mustard terminus, via Cu(2+)-promoted oxidative coupling of the mustard aldehydes with 3,4-diaminobenzonitrile to form the monobenzimidazoles, followed by a Pinner-type reaction and condensation with 4-(1-methyl-4-piperazinyl)-o-phenylenediamine. This process gives higher yields and pure products. The mustard analogues showed high hypersensitivity factors (IC50AA8/IC50 UV4), typical of DNA alkylating agents. There was a large increase in cytotoxicity (85-fold) across the homologous series which cannot be explained entirely by changes in mustard reactivity and may be related to altering orientation of the mustard with respect to the DNA resulting in different patterns of alkylation.

Evidence for somatic mutations and intraclonal diversity of the expressed VH region gene.,413-21,"Mixed cryoglobulinemia is usually considered to be a nonmalignant human B cell proliferation that produces a monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor (RF). Important immunologic similarities and differences were described between the monoclonal B cells during mixed cryoglobulinemia and during malignant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL):high frequency of the same VH and V kappa gene usage by both types of monoclonal B cells producing IgM with RF activity, apparent intraclonal homogeneity, but different expression of the pan T cell CD5 Ag. The description of an unusual CD5-negative B cell CLL case secreting a mutated IgM RF led the authors to suggest that the usage of non-mutated germline Ig genes is a property of cells derived from the CD5 lineage or stage of differentiation, rather than an intrinsic property of CLL or of IgM RF-producing cells in general. Because mixed cryoglobulinemia cells are usually CD5-negative, it was of interest to test for the existence of mutations in the VH and V kappa regions, as well as for the intraclonal homogeneity of the expressed Ig genes. In this study, we used the PCR technique to analyze the monoclonal rheumatoid factor (mRF) V genes from a patient with mixed cryoglobulinemia. We show that the CD5-negative monoclonal B cells express a slightly mutated V kappa 3 gene, but a more mutated VH1 gene whose genomic counterpart was shown to be the 51p1 germline gene. The sequence analysis of several independent clones shows some degree of intraclonal diversity, suggesting the existence of a clonal filiation.

We therefore propose that this region would be a good candidate for a peptide-based HTLV-I vaccine. To develop a peptide-based vaccine that can induce a high titer of neutralizing Abs against HTLV-I, we first synthesized peptides of various lengths containing aa187-199. Because the addition of gp46 aa181-186 or aa200-210 to either the N-terminus or C-terminus of SP187-199 did not alter the antigenicity of the principal neutralizing determinant, we prepared two peptide-based vaccines, MAP181-203 and MAP181-210, by conjugating SP181-203 and SP181-210 with a branched polylysine oligomer. In rabbits, X4 to X8 and X8 to X64 titers of the neutralizing Abs were induced by immunization with MAP181-203 and MAP181-210, respectively. Furthermore, high titers of neutralizing Abs (X40 to X320) were elicited in five different strains of rats by immunization with MAP181-210.

Furthermore, the peripheral T lymphocytes obtained from the majority of HTLV-I-infected patients including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma, and healthy carriers, proliferated in response to the peptides containing aa194-210. These results indicated that MAP181-210 contains a T cell helper epitope on aa194-210 not only in rats and rabbits, but also in humans with various HLA haplotypes. It is therefore possible that MAP181-210 could become one of the candidates for a peptide-based HTLV-I vaccine for human use.","['Baba, E', 'Nakamura, M', 'Ohkuma, K', 'Kira, J', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Nakano, S', 'Niho, Y']","['Baba E', 'Nakamura M', 'Ohkuma K', 'Kira J', 'Tanaka Y', 'Nakano S', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/*immunology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*immunology', 'Sequence Alignment', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', '*Viral Vaccines/immunology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1995 Jan 1;154(1):399-412.,,,,,,['env'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the hematologic recovery of 27 adult patients with hematologic malignancies who received marrow-ablative chemotherapy and ABSCT to determine whether or not the numbers of infused mononuclear cells (MNC), colony-forming units granulocyte/macrophage (CFU-GM), and colony-forming units megakaryocyte (CFU-Mk) were related to the speed of platelet recovery after ABSCT. Peripheral blood stem cells were collected using chemotherapy-induced mobilization with or without cytokine therapy. While the number of MNC infused did not show a significant correlation with time to platelet recovery as well as granulocyte and reticulocyte recovery, the logarithmic number of CFU-GM-infused did (p < 0.01). We also found a significant correlation between the logarithmic number of CFU-Mk-infused and the time to platelet recovery (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that the number of CFU-GM-infused is a reliable indicator of hematopoietic recovery and that the number of CFU-Mk-infused is no more reliable than CFU-GM for predicting platelet recovery after ABSCT.","['Takamatsu, Y', 'Harada, M', 'Teshima, T', 'Makino, S', 'Inaba, S', 'Akashi, K', 'Shibuya, T', 'Niho, Y']","['Takamatsu Y', 'Harada M', 'Teshima T', 'Makino S', 'Inaba S', 'Akashi K', 'Shibuya T', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Jan;23(1):8-13.,,,['Exp Hematol. 1995 Jan;23(1):4-6.

The effector cells used in that experiment were peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) for 2 weeks, with the initial addition of anti-CD3 moAb; these were termed T3-LAK effector cells. In this study, we examined the effects of T3-LAK cells and BsAb on autologous normal CD34+ BM cells in both cytotoxicity and colony formation assays. When T3-LAK cells were incubated with CD34+ BM cells, low levels of cytotoxicity were induced against the CD34+ BM cells and the cytotoxicity was enhanced by the addition of anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD 13 Fab' BsAb but not by the addition of anti-CD3 Fab' x anti-CD10 Fab' BsAb. This enhancement appeared to be due to the lysis of CD34+CD13+ BM cells. When T3-LAK cells were preincubated with CD34+ BM cells in the presence or absence of the BsAb and plated for colony assay, neither the T3-LAK cells nor the BsAb affected granulocyte-macrophage or mixed-cell colony formation by CD34+ BM cells. Taken together with our previous finding that T3-LAK cells used in combination with the BsAb markedly inhibited colony formation by leukemic progenitor cells, these results indicate that this combination provides a potential new strategy for CD34+ BM cell purging in autologous BMT.","['Kaneko, T', 'Fukuda, J', 'Teramura, M', 'Fusauchi, Y', 'Kakui, Y', 'Okumura, K', 'Mizoguchi, H', 'Oshimi, K']","['Kaneko T', 'Fukuda J', 'Teramura M', 'Fusauchi Y', 'Kakui Y', 'Okumura K', 'Mizoguchi H', 'Oshimi K']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Aug;14(2):213-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies of the CD34+ Lin- population have indicated that the blast-sized cells, which are presumably in cycle, proliferate and give rise to colony-forming cells in the presence of combinations of growth factors, including c-kit ligand and interleukin-3 (IL-3). Recent studies have examined the factors required for the growth of the quiescent subset of the CD34+ Lin- cells, identified as small to medium lymphocyte-sized cells that resist treatment with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, a known characteristic of the marrow-repopulating cell. These studies have shown that an interaction with marrow stromal cells is required, in addition to c-kit ligand and IL-3, to induce these cells to proliferate and form multiple colony-forming cells.

Mast cells are distinct hematopoietic cells and express a unique profile of antigens. Growth and differentiation of normal mast cells is dependent on mast cell growth factor (MGF), the ligand of the c-kit protooncogene product. In this study, we screened for mast cell-lineage involvement in 52 patients suffering from myeloid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), systemic mastocytosis, or other diseases by probing for mast cell-related molecules (c-kit, tryptase, histamine, and MGF) and by analyzing kit ligand/MGF-independent growth of mast cells in long-term suspension culture. Of the 52 patients tested, 2 patients with refractory anemia with excess of blast cells in transformation and 1 patient suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia blast crisis (CML-BC) were diagnosed as mastocytic disease. These patients were characterized by complex chromosomal abnormalities, splenomegaly, high percentages of circulating metachromatic cells (5% to 25%), high levels of cellular tryptase (> 10 ng/10(5) peripheral blood mononuclear cells/mL) and a tryptase/histamine (ng:ng) ratio greater than 1. The metachromatic cells expressed the mast-cell-related surface antigen c-kit, but not basophil-related antigens (CD11b, CDw17). Furthermore, in these 3 patients, spontaneous, MGF-independent growth of mast cells along with spontaneous synthesis of tryptase was demonstrable in long-term culture. No autocrine production, paracrine production, or overproduction of MGF was found. The spontaneous growth of mast cells could neither be abbrogated by addition of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to c-kit nor by MoAbs against MGF (< 5% inhibition), whereas factor (MGF)-dependent differentiation of mast cells in these patients could be abbrogated by MoAbs to c-kit or MoAbs to MGF (> 70% inhibition, P < .001). In addition, serum MGF levels in these patients were within the normal range and MGF could not be detected in cell-free culture supernatants. All 3 patients showed rapid progression of disease and had a survival time of less than 1 year. In conclusion, we describe a unique form of transformation in MDS and CML-BC characterized by mast cell lineage involvement and factor-independent differentiation of mast cells. This form of leukemic transformation has to be delineated from chronic myeloid leukemia with basophilia or basophil crisis, from primary mast cell leukemia, and from monocytic leukemias and myelodysplastic disorders associated with basophilia.","['Valent, P', 'Spanblochl, E', 'Bankl, H C', 'Sperr, W R', 'Marosi, C', 'Pirc-Danoewinata, H', 'Virgolini, I', 'Eichler, H G', 'Agis, H', 'Sillaber, C']","['Valent P', 'Spanblochl E', 'Bankl HC', 'Sperr WR', 'Marosi C', 'Pirc-Danoewinata H', 'Virgolini I', 'Eichler HG', 'Agis H', 'Sillaber C', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (chymase 2)', 'EC 3.4.21.39 (Chymases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/pathology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chymases', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/blood/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Piebaldism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tryptases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/12/15 00:00,1994/12/15 00:01,['1994/12/15 00:00'],"['1994/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 15;84(12):4322-32.,['S0006-4971(20)69998-0 [pii]'],,,,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore a careful observation for leukaemic transformation is necessary in long-term administration of G-CSF for AA.","['Izumi, T', 'Muroi, K', 'Takatoku, M', 'Imagawa, S', 'Hatake, K', 'Miura, Y']","['Izumi T', 'Muroi K', 'Takatoku M', 'Imagawa S', 'Hatake K', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jul;87(3):666-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08339.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08339.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied G-CSF-mediated PBPC mobilization in healthy donors and analysed the cellular composition of the resulting PBPC grafts. PBPC grafts were obtained from nine healthy donors (18-67 years old) for allogeneic or syngeneic transplantation. Six donors received 10 micrograms/kg G-CSF per day, the others 5-6 micrograms/kg. Mobilization and harvesting were well tolerated except for moderate bone pain which occurred in all donors primed with 10 micrograms/kg. With 10 micrograms/kg, a 31-fold (9-62) enrichment of circulating CD34+ cells was observed with peak values constantly occurring on day 5 after the start of G-CSF administration. Starting harvest on day 5, one to three collections on consecutive days yielded 5.5 x 10(6)/kg (0.9-10.7) CD34+ cells, 219 x 10(6)/kg (106-314) T cells, and 34 x 10(6)/kg (23-67) NK cells per 10 litres leukapheresis volume. Altogether, PBPC grafts contained 3 times more CD34+ cells, 7 times more T cells, and 20 times more NK cells than five allogeneic marrow grafts that were analysed for comparison. The yield of CD34+ cells per 10 litres apheresis volume as well as the height of the CD34+ peak in peripheral blood were inversely correlated to the age of the donor. In the donors primed with 5-6 micrograms/kg G-CSF the increase of circulating CD34+ cells (4-7-fold enrichment) and the CD34+ cell yield per 10 litres leukapheresis volume (1 x 10(6)/kg [0.8-2.2]) was much smaller compared with the 10 micrograms/kg group. In conclusion, sufficient amounts of PBPC capable of restoring haemopoiesis in allogeneic recipients can be mobilized safely by administration of G-CSF (10 micrograms/kg s.c. for 5 d) in healthy donors, and harvested with one or two leukapheresis procedures. Whether the large numbers of T-cells and NK cells that are contained in the collection products may influence graft-versus-host and graft-versus-leukaemia reactivities of PBPC grafts remains to be determined.","['Dreger, P', 'Haferlach, T', 'Eckstein, V', 'Jacobs, S', 'Suttorp, M', 'Loffler, H', 'Muller-Ruchholtz, W', 'Schmitz, N']","['Dreger P', 'Haferlach T', 'Eckstein V', 'Jacobs S', 'Suttorp M', 'Loffler H', 'Muller-Ruchholtz W', 'Schmitz N']","['Second Department of Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*physiology/transplantation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukapheresis', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jul;87(3):609-13. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08321.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08321.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A soluble form of Fc gamma RIII has been identified in human plasma. This soluble form of Fc gamma RIII (sFc gamma RIII) originates from release by neutrophils. In the present study we show by transfusions of plasma that contains sFc gamma RIII of one allotype (NA1-Fc gamma RIII) in recipients homozygous for the other allotype (NA2-Fc gamma RIII) that the clearance of sFc gamma RIII is about 0.7 ml/min. Because the concentration of sFc gamma RIII was found to be constant in a small cohort of donors followed for about 1.5 years, the half-life of NA1-sFc gamma RIII is about 1.8 d, assuming a one-compartment model. The plasma concentration of sFc gamma RIII depended mainly on the production of neutrophils in the bone marrow, and was not influenced by shifts of neutrophils from one pool to another (storage, marginating or circulating pool). Because Fc gamma RIII is only expressed on mature neutrophils, this implies that the concentration of sFc gamma RIII depends on production of mature neutrophils.","['Huizinga, T W', 'de Haas, M', 'van Oers, M H', 'Kleijer, M', 'Vile, H', 'van der Wouw, P A', 'Moulijn, A', 'van Weezel, H', 'Roos, D', 'von dem Borne, A E']","['Huizinga TW', 'de Haas M', 'van Oers MH', 'Kleijer M', 'Vile H', 'van der Wouw PA', 'Moulijn A', 'van Weezel H', 'Roos D', 'von dem Borne AE']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, IgG)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood/therapy', 'Cell Division', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/therapy', 'Neutropenia/metabolism/therapy', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/*metabolism']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Jul;87(3):459-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08298.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb08298.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of hematologic recovery based on stem cell source and influence of hematopoietic growth factor administration was undertaken. Hematopoietic growth factor use significantly reduced neutrophil engraftment time for patients receiving bone marrow stem cells, with evidence of earlier recovery times for patients receiving granulocyte colony-stimulating factor compared with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Neutrophil recovery times varied based on the source of stem cells used, with the earliest engraftment times seen for patients receiving peripheral blood stem cells primed with cyclophosphamide and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

Photoisomerization, one of the dominant deactivation pathways in the sulfur- or oxygen-containing analogues, was completely absent in the selenium-containing derivatives. Efficient triplet state formation was observed for selenium-containing derivatives incorporated into L1210 cells by diffuse reflectance laser flash photolysis. Cytotoxicity studies, carried out using clonogenic assays on L1210 leukemia cells, showed a good correlation with phi T and phi delta, measured in solution.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced solid tumors were eligible if they had normal bone marrow, renal, and hepatic function and had not previously been treated with platinum compounds. Topotecan was administered intravenously on days 1 through 5 and cisplatin was administered intravenously on day 1 of a 21-day cycle. The topotecan dose was fixed at 1.0 mg/m2/d on the first four dose levels, and cisplatin was escalated in 25-mg/m2 increments from 25 to 100 mg/m2 without filgrastim. After encountering DLT, the dose of cisplatin was decreased by one level and topotecan dose escalation was attempted. After defining the MTD without growth factor, the study proceeded with escalating cisplatin doses to define the MTD with filgrastim 5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously (SC) daily starting on day 6 of treatment. Priming with filgrastim 5 micrograms/kg SC on days -6 to -2 before the first course was explored last. RESULTS: Of 38 patients entered, 37 were eligible, 35 assessable for toxicity in the first course, and 28 assessable for response. The principal toxicity was grade 4 neutropenia, which had to last more than 7 days to be considered dose-limiting. No DLT was observed at the starting cisplatin dose of 25 mg/m2 (dose level 1). On level 2 (cisplatin 50 mg/m2, one patient had dose-limiting neutropenia and one patient had grade 3 renal toxicity. On level 3 (cisplatin 75 mg/m2), two patients had dose-limiting neutropenia. Therefore, cisplatin dose escalation was stopped. On dose level 5 (cisplatin 50 mg/m2 and topotecan 1.25 mg/m2/d), one patient had grade 4 neutropenia that lasted more than 7 days and one patient died of neutropenic sepsis. The remaining dose levels used topotecan 1.0 mg/m2/d plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (level 6) and 100 mg/m2 (levels 7 and 8) with filgrastim. No DLT was observed on level 6. On level 7, two patients had dose-limiting neutropenia and one patient had grade 3 hyperbilirubinemia. Priming with filgrastim on level 8 demonstrated no obvious advantage over level 7, and one patient had grade 4 thrombocytopenia that lasted more than 7 days. Three patients with non-small-cell lung cancer achieved a partial response and one patient with breast cancer had a complete response. CONCLUSION: Topotecan and cisplatin in combination cause more neutropenia than expected from either drug given alone at the same dosage. The recommended phase II doses are topotecan 1.0 mg/m2/d for 5 days in combination with cisplatin 50 mg/m2 on day 1 without filgrastim or cisplatin 75 mg/m2 on day 1 with filgrastim support.","['Miller, A A', 'Hargis, J B', 'Lilenbaum, R C', 'Fields, S Z', 'Rosner, G L', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Miller AA', 'Hargis JB', 'Lilenbaum RC', 'Fields SZ', 'Rosner GL', 'Schilsky RL']","['University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Camptothecin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Topotecan']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Dec;12(12):2743-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2743.,['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.12.2743 [doi]'],,,"['CA 11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assay, based on dye exclusion, utilizes a plasma membrane-impermeable, dimeric cyanine dye (YOYO-1). YOYO-1 fluoresces brightly only when bound to nucleic acids. Cells are incubated with YOYO-1, and fluorescence is measured before and after the addition of detergent, which allows the dye to enter the cells. The fluorescence before detergent treatment originates from nonviable cells that have membrane damage and take up YOYO-1. The fluorescence after detergent treatment originates from all cells in the sample. The ratio of the two fluorescence values is used as an indicator of cell viability. The cell viability results of this microplate assay closely resemble those of dye exclusion studies by flow cytometry and are similar but not identical to those of the thiazolyl blue assay, which uses a metabolic indicator of cell death.

To study possible mechanisms by which the activity of p50csk might be regulated, we searched for p50csk-interacting proteins in human erythroleukemia cells. We found that in response to the treatment of cells with pervanadate, a potent inhibitor of protein tyrosine phosphatases, or to the cross-linking of Fc gamma RIIA receptors, p50csk becomes tightly associated with a 36-kDa protein (p36). This association is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of p36 and involves its interaction with the SH2 domain of p50csk.p36 can be phosphorylated in vitro by p50csk or by a full-length GST-Csk fusion protein expressed in Escherichia coli. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p36 is found exclusively in the particulate membrane fraction of the cell. Conditions that induce the formation of the p50csk.p36 complex promote the appearance of p50csk in the particulate fraction. These data suggest that the association between p50csk and p36 serves to translocate the normally cytosolic p50csk to the membrane, where it presumably interacts with its physiologically relevant substrates.","['Ford, C E', 'Furlong, M T', 'Geahlen, R L', 'Harrison, M L']","['Ford CE', 'Furlong MT', 'Geahlen RL', 'Harrison ML']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.23 (CSK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'CSK Tyrosine-Protein Kinase', 'Cell Line', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', '*src-Family Kinases']",1994/12/02 00:00,1994/12/02 00:01,['1994/12/02 00:00'],"['1994/12/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Dec 2;269(48):30378-85.,['S0021-9258(18)43824-0 [pii]'],,,"['1F31DC00152/DC/NIDCD NIH HHS/United States', 'GM48099/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of the LECAM-1 molecule was correlated to the expression of activation (CD23, CD25) and proliferation (Ki67) markers.

The ratio and location of CD3+ and LFA-1+ cells was very similar in lymph nodes from B-CLL and LL, and from this fact may arise the suspicion that LFA-1+ reported in LL cases derive from the sometimes significant T-cell compartment of the diseased lymph nodes.

SCF as a single factor did not induce significant colony formation, and even in the presence of rhEPO or rhG-CSF it very weakly stimulated erythroid colony formation and was rarely capable of inducing myeloid colony formation by clonogenic leukemic cells. In culture dishes supplemented with SCF, both myeloid and erythroid colony formations were dramatically enhanced in MDS, regarding both colony number and size.

The biological role of gamma/delta T cells has been related to functions within the 'first line of defense'. Similar to gamma/delta T lymphocytes in the T-cell compartment, CD5 positive B cells represent a small subset of B lymphocytes, which is thought to be involved in the maintenance of natural immunity and autoimmunity. We provide evidence for the cooperation of gamma/delta T cells and CD5 positive B cells in the proliferative response of gamma/delta T cells to bacterial antigens. Our data indicate a strong proliferation of V gamma 9 delta 2 T cells in response to gram-negative bacteria, which is dependent upon the presence of CD5 positive B-CLL or activated normal B lymphocytes. The selective stimulation of the V gamma 9 delta 2 subpopulation by gram-negative bacteria is also confirmed by analysis of different gamma/delta T-cell clones. The interaction of gamma/delta T cells with activated B cells and gram-negative bacteria may prove to be a useful model similar to the expansion of the V gamma 9 delta 2 subpopulation during development.

We measured the association between Fc epsilon RI and the kinase, using chemical crosslinking to stabilize their interaction. In the rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line, 3-4%, and at most 20%, of Fc epsilon RI appear to be associated with the kinase prior to aggregation, even though there is an excess of total cell lyn kinase. Aggregating the Fc epsilon RI causes three to four times more of the kinase to associate with receptors, a process requiring a prior phosphorylation step. In an in vitro assay, the lyn associated with the aggregated receptors becomes disproportionately more phosphorylated than would be predicted from the amount of lyn associated with the receptors. These and other data are consistent with a model in which aggregation of the receptor leads to its transphosphorylation by constitutively associated lyn kinase. We propose that additional molecules of this kinase are thereby recruited and that this markedly enhances transphosphorylation of tyrosine on the receptor and associated proteins, thereby initiating a cascade of further biochemical changes. This model is also consistent with data on receptors such as the clonotypic receptors on B and T lymphocytes, which share structural and functional features with Fc epsilon RI.","['Yamashita, T', 'Mao, S Y', 'Metzger, H']","['Yamashita T', 'Mao SY', 'Metzger H']","['Section on Chemical Immunology, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1820.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Enzyme Activation', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Rats', '*Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', '*src-Family Kinases']",1994/11/08 00:00,1994/11/08 00:01,['1994/11/08 00:00'],"['1994/11/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/08 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Nov 8;91(23):11251-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.23.11251.,['10.1073/pnas.91.23.11251 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC45205,,,,,,,,,

Since the respiratory manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) are characterized by intense chronic airway inflammation very early in life, successful gene therapy for CF will require that expression of the transferred normal CFTR gene be resistant to down-regulation by inflammatory mediators. To evaluate the concept that a viral promoter--human CFTR cDNA unit would be resistant to this form of down-regulation, a retrovirus promoter (5' long terminal repeat of the Moloney murine leukemia virus)--human CFTR cDNA unit was transferred to T84 human colon carcinoma cell line using a retrovirus vector. Exposure of the retrovirus-modified T84 cells to PMA resulted in down-regulation of the endogenous CFTR mRNA transcripts (6.5 kb), but did not affect the level of exogenous CFTR transcripts (8.0 kb). Importantly, in parallel with the persistence of the exogenous CFTR transcripts, the modified cells still maintained cAMP-regulated CI- secretion in the presence of PMA.

The expression of an exogenous c-myc proto-oncogene or a 12H-ras oncogene lowered the requirement of FDC-P1 cells for IL-3 or GM-CSF, in a similar manner to M-CSF or SCF addition. Furthermore, the expression of either of these genes complemented the defective M-CSFr F809.

Since overexpression of the bcl-2 gene has been reported to retard apoptosis due to a variety of anticancer agents, we examined and compared taxol-induced intracellular microtubular bundling and apoptosis in pre-B human leukemia 697 cells and their counterparts which have been transfected with and overexpress cDNA derived from the bcl-2 gene. Treatment with 0.1 or 1.0 mumol/l taxol for 24 h resulted in internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphologic features of apoptosis in 697 cells, but not in 697/BCL-2 cells. However, indirect immunofluorescent staining with anti-tubulin antibody revealed that taxol treatment produces stable microtubule bundles resistant to calcium-mediated disassembly in 697, as well as 697/BCL-2 cells. In addition, taxol-induced microtubule bundling was associated with a marked accumulation of the two cell types in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Following exposure to taxol, when 697 cells were washed and kept in drug-free medium, they showed rapid onset of apoptosis followed by loss of cell viability and a decline in cell numbers. In contrast, identically treated 697/BCL-2 cells kept in drug-free medium remained in a growth arrested state, but showed little evidence of apoptosis for up to 4 days. They eventually demonstrated features of apoptotic cell death and loss of viability between 5 and 7 days. This was not accompanied by a decrease in p26BCL-2 levels. Anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-MAP kinase immunoblot analyses of proteins isolated from taxol-treated 697 and 697/BCL-2 cells failed to show any difference in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins. Therefore, our findings indicate that in 697/BCL-2 cells, high levels of p26BCL-2 significantly delay taxol-induced endonucleolytic internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and apoptosis, but do not affect taxol-induced microtubule bundling or cell cycle growth arrest. The delayed onset of taxol-induced DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in 697/BCL-2 cells without down-regulation of p26BCL-2 levels suggests that an alternative mechanism of taxol-mediated apoptosis might be triggered which is unimpeded by high p26BCL-2 levels, or taxol-induced prolongation of mitotic arrest may lead to the inactivation or inhibition of that mechanism by which p26BCL-2 is able to block apoptosis.","['Tang, C', 'Willingham, M C', 'Reed, J C', 'Miyashita, T', 'Ray, S', 'Ponnathpur, V', 'Huang, Y', 'Mahoney, M E', 'Bullock, G', 'Bhalla, K']","['Tang C', 'Willingham MC', 'Reed JC', 'Miyashita T', 'Ray S', 'Ponnathpur V', 'Huang Y', 'Mahoney ME', 'Bullock G', 'Bhalla K']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Microtubules/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Paclitaxel/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Nov;8(11):1960-9.,,,,,,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the remaining four infected sheep that did not have persistently elevated CD5+ B-lymphocyte counts, three developed lymphoid neoplasia within 14 months post-inoculation. Neoplastic cells from two of these three sheep were CD5- B-lymphocytes, while cells from the third were CD5+ B-lymphocytes.

CD34 antigen was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI) and alkaline phosphatase-labeled streptavidin biotine (AP-LSAB) in 62 patients (median age: 51 years). P-170 expression was determined by AP-LSAB in 51 cases using JSB1 and C219 monoclonal antibodies. All patients were treated with conventional chemotherapy induction regimen. Follow-up was from 6 to 79 months. Complete remission (CR) rate was not statistically different between CD34+ and CD34- patients (67 vs. 84%, p = 0.2). The duration of CR and survival were not influenced by CD34 expression. Karyotype abnormalities were more frequent among MDR+ patients (65 vs. 21%, p < 0.01). CR rate was statistically lower in MDR+ patients as compared to MDR- patients (63 vs. 96%, p = 0.01).

Eighteen patients were considered 'refractory' (eight primarily resistant, five relapsing within 6 months of initial remission, or at a second relapse; five relapsing after an autologous bone marrow transplantation procedure. Ten cases were defined 'secondary' AML (diagnosis of AML made after a preexisting diagnosis of: myelodysplastic syndrome: five cases; myelodysplastic syndrome after therapy for breast cancer: one case; previously untreated, and concomitant, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: two cases; Hodgkin's disease treated with chemoradiotherapy: one case). Overall, 15 patients (58%) achieved a complete remission (CR). Two patients died of infection during induction, and 11 had resistant disease. Analyzing the data in relation to selected host and disease characteristics, the response varied widely. The highest CR rates (89%) were obtained in secondary AML; in particular, two cases of 'second-primary' (concomitant with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) AML obtained CR for both diseases. Refractory AML differed widely for response: high CR rate (75%), although with short mean CR duration for primary resistance AML, and very poor response (11% CR) for relapsed (early, second, after ABMT) cases. Interestingly, a slow kinetic of leukemic growth in vivo before FLAG administration was significantly related to the response and outcome (p = 0.0002). Hematological and nonhematological toxicities were acceptable. In conclusion, the FLAG regimen has significant antileukemic activity and acceptable toxicity especially in secondary AML, both with and without coexisting lymphoid malignancy.","['Visani, G', 'Tosi, P', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Manfroi, S', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Testoni, N', 'Clavio, M', 'Cenacchi, A', 'Gamberi, B', 'Carrara, P']","['Visani G', 'Tosi P', 'Zinzani PL', 'Manfroi S', 'Ottaviani E', 'Testoni N', 'Clavio M', 'Cenacchi A', 'Gamberi B', 'Carrara P', 'et al.']","[""Institute of Haematology 'L.e A.

Based on the results of the previous trial ALL/NHL-BFM 86 this treatment program focused especially on therapy modifications for average (MRG) and high risk (HRG) pts, on the evaluation of therapy response for prognosis, and on the identification of high risk pts by molecular genetics. For average risk pts consolidation therapy was intensified by the addition of L-asparaginase (L-ASP) on a randomized basis. In HRG induction and consolidation therapy was modified by introduction of early intensification elements that had proved to be effective in relapsed pts. This patient group was randomized for the evaluation of the effects of G-CSF administered in the intervals between the intensification elements. Distribution of the 1376 eligible pts into the three treatment arms SRG (standard risk), MRG, and HRG was as expected (17 pts not yet assigned): 385 pts (28.0%), 834 pts (60.6%), and 140 pts (10.2%), respectively. Treatment consisted of the 8-drug induction (Protocol I), consolidation (Protocol M), reinduction (Protocol II), and maintenance therapy (total therapy duration 24 months). The drug doses and combinations were only slightly modified compared to the previous study ALL-BFM 86 with the exception of the randomized L-ASP containing arm MRG-2 (Protocol M-A) and group HRG. Preventive cranial irradiation was reduced to 12 Gy and applied to MRG and HRG pts only. As in study ALL-BFM 86, the initial response to a 7-day exposure to prednisone and to the first intrathecal injection of MTX at diagnosis was evaluated at day 8 of treatment with regard to blast count in peripheral blood (PB). In addition, pts were now investigated for the presence of blasts in the bone marrow (BM) at day 15 of treatment to compare the prognostic power of both response parameters. Identification of translocation t(9; 22) and/or BCR-ABL rearrangement characterized a small subgroup of pts that were not detected by poor initial therapy response. These pts were enrolled in HRG for more intensive treatment including allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT).

The research presented here demonstrates that the inhibitory effect of PGE2 on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages involves IL-10. In a dose-dependent manner, PGE2 inhibits LPS-induced release of TNF-alpha and IL-6, but not of lactate or nitric oxide. The decrease in the level of these cytokines is inversely proportional to the increase in immunoreactive IL-10. This differential inhibitory effect of PGE2 is mimicked by agents that elevate intracellular levels of cAMP, but not cGMP. Neutralizing anti IL-10 antibody but not neutralizing antibodies against other macrophage secretory products (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-beta]), significantly reverse the potent inhibitory effect of PGE2. In vivo, the administration of PGE2 before LPS challenge significantly reduces circulating TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels. Anti-IL-10 antibody substantially enhanced the LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels in mice that received either LPS alone or LPS plus PGE2. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of PGE2 on mononuclear phagocytes is mediated in part by an autocrine feedback mechanism involving IL-10.","['Strassmann, G', 'Patil-Koota, V', 'Finkelman, F', 'Fong, M', 'Kambayashi, T']","['Strassmann G', 'Patil-Koota V', 'Finkelman F', 'Fong M', 'Kambayashi T']","['Department of Immunology, Otsuka-America Pharmaceutical Inc., Rockville, Maryland 20850.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lactates)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Biological Assay', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Lactates/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins E/*pharmacology', 'Shock, Septic/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Dec 1;180(6):2365-70. doi: 10.1084/jem.180.6.2365.,['10.1084/jem.180.6.2365 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC2191801,,,,,,,,,

We examined the possibility that the leukocytes were activated by their adhesion to activated platelets and demonstrated that P-selectin-dependent platelet adhesion to neutrophils and monocytes induced production of extracellular superoxide anion (O2-) by these leukocytes. Leukocyte membrane glycoproteins containing Ser/Thr-linked carbohydrate chains were responsible for the signal reception leading to the leukocyte activation. Cytokines were shown to influence these processes. For example, treatments of neutrophils with interleukin-8 (IL-8) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) potentiated the P-selectin-induced O2- production. Furthermore, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) induced surface expression of P-selectin on platelets in the presence of a low concentration of thrombin and consequently enhanced their adhesion capacity to leukocytes.

These unusual lymphocytes are believed to control the migration and differentiation of highly invasive fetally derived trophoblast cells, which infiltrate into the maternal uterus to remodel the spiral arteries during the first trimester. One possible mechanism of control is by cytokine production. In this study, highly purified (> 99%) populations of first trimester decidual CD56brightCD16- NK cells and CD3+ T lymphocytes were obtained by using a FACS. These cells were examined by reverse transcriptase PCR for their expression of mRNAs for the following cytokines: granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, CSF-1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, TGF-beta 1, leukemia-inhibitory factor (LIF), and IL-2. Then, the expression was compared with that of resting PBL. The identity of the PCR products was verified by Southern blotting and hybridization with cytokine-specific probes. Both decidual CD56brightCD16- NK cells and CD3+ T cells were found to express mRNA for CSF-1, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma TGF-beta 1, and LIF, but GM-CSF mRNA was detected only in CD56bright NK cells. IL-2 mRNA was detected in only some decidual T cell samples, and then only after at least two rounds of amplification. In contrast, peripheral blood CD56brightCD16- NK cells, CD56dimCD16+ NK cells, and CD3+ T cells expressed mRNA only for TNF-alpha and TGF-beta 1, but not for GM-CSF, CSF-1, IFN-gamma, LIF, or IL-2. These results suggest that both decidual NK cells and decidual T cells produce a variety of cytokines that may be involved in the control of trophoblast migration and differentiation during pregnancy.","['Jokhi, P P', 'King, A', 'Sharkey, A M', 'Smith, S K', 'Loke, Y W']","['Jokhi PP', 'King A', 'Sharkey AM', 'Smith SK', 'Loke YW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Decidua/cytology/*immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase']",1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Nov 15;153(10):4427-35.,,,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate this in vivo, methotrexate and its active polyglutamated metabolites (MTX-PG) were measured in bone marrow blasts obtained from 101 children randomized to single-agent therapy with either HDMTX (1 g/m2 per 24 h i.v., n = 47) or low-dose MTX (LDMTX, 30 mg/m2 by mouth every 6 h x 6, n = 54), before remission induction therapy. Blast concentrations of total MTX-PGs (median 460 vs 1380 pmol/10(9) cells) and of long-chain MTX-glu4-6 were both significantly higher after HDMTX (P < 0.001). With either treatment, MTX-PGs were significantly higher in B-lineage blasts than in T-lineage blasts (LDMTX P = 0.001, HDMTX P = 0.03). In a multiple regression analysis of B-lineage ALL, blast MTX-PG was significantly related to MTX dose (or plasma MTX concentration), lymphoblast ploidy (hyperdiploid > nonhyperdiploid), and percentage S-phase. This is the first evidence that HDMTX achieves higher MTX-PG concentrations in ALL blasts in vivo, establishing a rationale for HDMTX in the treatment of childhood ALL, especially T-lineage or nonhyperdiploid B-lineage ALL, disease characteristics associated with a poor prognosis on conventional therapy.","['Synold, T W', 'Relling, M V', 'Boyett, J M', 'Rivera, G K', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Mahmoud, H', 'Crist, W M', 'Pui, C H', 'Evans, W E']","['Synold TW', 'Relling MV', 'Boyett JM', 'Rivera GK', 'Sandlund JT', 'Mahmoud H', 'Crist WM', 'Pui CH', 'Evans WE']","[""Hematology-Oncology, Department, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Ploidies', 'Polyglutamic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1994 Nov;94(5):1996-2001. doi: 10.1172/JCI117552.,['10.1172/JCI117552 [doi]'],,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC294625,,,,,,,,,

In these transfectants, antibodies to alpha v beta 3 block phagocytosis of fibronectin-opsonized beads completely, even though half the ingestion occurs through endogenous alpha 5 beta 1 receptors. alpha 5 beta 1-mediated adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces is unaffected by alpha v beta 3 ligation.

However, physiological regulation of neurotransmitter uptake has not been demonstrated. We have examined the effect of receptor-activated second messengers on the 5HT transporter in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL 2H3). Here, we show that activation of an A3 adenosine receptor results in an increase of 5HT uptake in RBL cells, due to an increase in maximum velocity (Vmax). The A3 adenosine receptor-stimulated increase in transport is blocked by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and by a cGMP-dependent kinase inhibitor. In fact, compounds that generate nitric oxide (NO) and the cGMP analog 8-bromo-cGMP mimicked the effect of A3 receptor stimulation, suggesting that the elevation in transport occurs through the generation of the gaseous second messenger NO and a subsequent elevation in cGMP. Additionally, the 5HT transporter is differentially regulated by second messengers since direct activation of protein kinase C by phorbol esters decreases 5HT uptake by decreasing Vmax. Our results suggest that the changes in transport are due to a direct modification of the 5HT transporter, possibly by phosphorylation, which appears to alter the rate at which transport occurs. As the 5HT transporter in RBL cells is identical to that in neurons, our results suggest that analogous mechanisms may operate in the brain.","['Miller, K J', 'Hoffman, B J']","['Miller KJ', 'Hoffman BJ']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, National Institute of Mental Health, Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Slc6a4 protein, rat)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '41VRH5220H (Paroxetine)', '4R9H38JAWL (calmidazolium)', '91300-60-6 (6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.4.- (Amino Acid Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'T42P99266K (Methylene Blue)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)"", 'Amino Acid Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Aminoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/*physiology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methylene Blue/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nitric Oxide/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Paroxetine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/*metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/11/04 00:00,1994/11/04 00:01,['1994/11/04 00:00'],"['1994/11/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Nov 4;269(44):27351-6.,['S0021-9258(18)46992-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients experience prolonged and profound severe granulocytopenia--often with absolute neutrophil counts of less than 100/cu mm. Patients suffer neutropenic sepsis and often are as sick as patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for lymphoma or leukemia. Thus, it is important to evaluate the state-of-the-art management of such patients and to define the role of growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Early use of G-CSF or GM-CSF can shorten the duration of granulocytopenia from a mean of 16 to 8 days and reduce the morbidity of the disorder.

To test this, we immunized a NZW rabbit and BALB/c mice with a synthetic peptide containing the HTLV-II gp46 amino acids 182 to 199 (pep182-199) conjugated to OVA. The serum from the rabbit reacted to the HTLV-II gp46 and neutralized HTLV-II-mediated syncytium formation. One monoclonal antibody (MAb), M2E186N1, generated from the BALB/c mice, stained specifically the surface of HTLV-II-positive cells and reacted with HTLV-II gp46 by Western blot. This MAb was of the IgA isotype and inhibited HTLV-II- but not HTLV-I-mediated syncytium formation at a final antibody concentration of 200 micrograms/ml; it also neutralized an HTLV-II-VSV pseudotype virus specifically. Epitope mapping by ELISA using overlapping synthetic peptides indicated that the neutralization epitope recognized by the M2E186N1 MAb was located between HTLV-II gp46 amino acids 186 and 192, corresponding to the sequence Leu-Gln-His-Val-Ile-Leu-Gln-Pro.

Cell surface ICAM-1 was upregulated on HGF under transcriptional control by exposure not only to interleukin-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and gamma interferon but also to sonic extracts prepared from Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia (nigrescens) and lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli. However, these stimuli induced only minimal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and E-selectin on HGF. Binding assays using HGF and Molt 4, the human T-cell leukemia cell line, showed induced ICAM-1 to be functional, and the increased binding was blocked by a combination of monoclonal antibodies against ICAM-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen 1. Furthermore, gingival tissues from adult periodontitis patients showed increased mRNA expression of ICAM-1 compared with that in tissues from normal healthy donors. In immunohistological analysis, we also observed in vivo that the expression of ICAM-1 on fibroblasts in adult periodontitis tissues was greater than that in normal gingiva. Thus, the overexpression of ICAM-1 on gingival fibroblasts induced by cytokines and periodontopathic bacteria is speculated to be deeply involved in the accumulation and retention of leukocyte function-associated antigen 1-bearing leukocytes in adult periodontitis lesions.","['Hayashi, J', 'Saito, I', 'Ishikawa, I', 'Miyasaka, N']","['Hayashi J', 'Saito I', 'Ishikawa I', 'Miyasaka N']","['Department of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bacteroidaceae/chemistry/*pathogenicity', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'E-Selectin', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gingiva/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Periodontitis/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Porphyromonas gingivalis/chemistry/pathogenicity', 'Prevotella intermedia/chemistry/pathogenicity', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 1994 Dec;62(12):5205-12. doi: 10.1128/iai.62.12.5205-5212.1994.,['10.1128/iai.62.12.5205-5212.1994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC303255,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation assay using a variety of cytokines demonstrated that the HSM911 cells proliferate in response to recombinant granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (rGM-CSF), recombinant Interleukin-3 (rIL-3) and recombinant stem cell factor (rSCF), but do not in response to recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (rG-CSF), natural macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), rIL-1, rIL-2, rIL-4, rIL-5, rIL-6 or recombinant erythropoietin (rEpo). Polyclonal anti-GM-CSF antibody and polyclonal anti-IL-3 antibody blocked the proliferation of HSM911 stimulated with rGM-CSF and rIL-3, respectively. HSM911 maintained in the presence of rGM-CSF expressed the CD7, CD13, CD33, CD34, CD41a, HLA-DR, VLA1-VLA5, CD11a, CD54, CD44 and LAM1. These findings suggest that HSM911 might be of multipotent progenitor cell origin. GM-CSF receptors and rIL-3 receptors expressed on this cell line were simultaneously suppressed by rGM-CSF or rIL-3, whereas only IL-3 receptors were down-modulated by rSCF. Treatment with 12-o-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced the differentiation of HSM911 cells into macrophage-like cells but not erythroblasts, megakaryocytes or lymphocytes. Interferon-gamma and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) suppressed the proliferation of HSM911 cells in a dose dependent manner. HSM911 was relatively resistant against anti-cancer drugs compared with fresh AML cells and other leukemic cell line.

Since T3 and RA are important in cell differentiation and development, and since their receptors are highly homological, we investigated the T3 effects on RA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. Although T3 alone did not induce cell differentiation, RA-mediated differentiation was significantly enhanced in the presence of 10(-7) M T3. This effect of T3 was considered to be mediated, at least in part, by increased intracellular cAMP, since the phosphodiesterase inhibitor enhanced, and the protein kinase A antagonist partially blocked, T3 potentiation. When HL-60 cells were pretreated with RA for 20 h, T3 alone stimulated the cell differentiation. The time-course study showed that incubation with RA for 12 h was necessary for HL-60 cells to be primed to respond to T3 for differentiation. The present finding that T3 potentiates RA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation may raise the possibility that T3 supplement increases clinical remission in APL patients who are treated with RA.","['Miyoshi, Y', 'Nakamura, H', 'Tagami, T', 'Sasaki, S', 'Nakao, K']","['Miyoshi Y', 'Nakamura H', 'Tagami T', 'Sasaki S', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Triiodothyronine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1994 Jul;103(1-2):119-23. doi: 10.1016/0303-7207(94)90078-7.,['10.1016/0303-7207(94)90078-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of subsequent studies with lower dosages of 25 to 30 mg/m2/day for 5 days in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and low grade lymphomas have shown this regimen to be effective and safe, with almost no significant neurotoxicity. At present, the major role of fludarabine in leukaemia is in the management of CLL. In previously treated patients with CLL, responses are obtained in more than 50% of patients, with two-thirds of those responses being complete remissions according to the National Cancer Institute Working Group (NCIWG) criteria for complete response and partial response. The major causes of morbidity associated with fludarabine in CLL are infections and febrile episodes. These occur more frequently in previously treated patients and those with advanced stage of disease. Myelosuppression is dose limiting and a small proportion of patients with CLL develop moderate to severe and sometimes protracted myelosuppression.

As an extension, knowledge of the mechanism of drug action is necessary to construct the optimal strategy for combination chemotherapy. Nucleoside antimetabolites such as arabinosylcytosine, arabinosyladenine, and fludarabine are prodrugs that must enter cells and be phosphorylated to the respective triphosphates before they can elicit biological activity. DNA synthesis is the major metabolic target for this class of compounds. Common to members of the arabinosyl nucleoside class is the finding in experimental systems of a relationship between incorporation of each drug into DNA and the loss of clonogenicity. Although additional inhibitory mechanisms have been identified, they all require formation of the respective triphosphate. Thus, knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of the triphosphates in target cells and an understanding of the mechanisms by which these active forms of arabinosyl nucleosides kill cells are indispensable to the rational design of treatment protocols. This article considers the clinical development of arabinosyl nucleosides with respect to investigations of their pharmacokinetics and mechanisms of action. An understanding of these elements of arabinosyl nucleoside metabolism should provide a rationale for combinations with other chemotherapeutic agents and anticancer modalities.","['Plunkett, W', 'Gandhi, V']","['Plunkett W', 'Gandhi V']","['University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biological Availability', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 1994;47 Suppl 6:30-8. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199400476-00006.,['10.2165/00003495-199400476-00006 [doi]'],,,"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,76,,,,,,,,,,

The commonest structural abnormalities involve chromosome 13 at band q14, the site of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor gene. A gene located telomeric to the Rb1 gene, identified by the D13S25 probe, might be a better candidate for a pathophysiologically relevant gene in CLL, since repeated reports have identified homozygous deletions of this site.

Both derivatives were found to be cytotoxic at micromolar concentrations. For example, in the alveolar tumor cell line A549 which was included in all experiments as a reference, drug concentrations required to induce 50% inhibition of cell growth (D50 values) equalled 55 microM for 3'-cycloC and 80 microM for xyloC. Compared with the response of this reference cell line, none of the solid tumor cell lines tested--representing five different malignancies--displayed significant hypersensitivity to these drugs, while the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines proved to be hypersensitive (range of D50 values, 5-13 microM). To gain insight into the modes of cytotoxic action of xyloC and 3'-cycloC, we compared the effect on DNA metabolism of these compounds with that of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (araC), a potent inhibitor of semi-conservative DNA replication and long-patch excision repair. As seen with araC, the xylo compound strongly inhibited both DNA replicative synthesis and the repair of DNA damage induced by UV light and 60Co gamma-radiation. In gamma-irradiated A549 cells, the extent of repair inhibition by 1 mM xyloC was approximately 40% of that inhibited by araC, and concomitant exposure of the irradiated cultures to xyloC plus araC gave rise to a synergistic response. Since araC was employed at a concentration (0.1 mM) which produced a maximal effect on DNA repair when applied alone, the observed synergistic response implies that the mode of action of xyloC on DNA repair is different from that of araC. In contrast to that observed with xyloC, 3'-cycloC proved to be a very weak inhibitor of DNA replication and repair, strongly suggesting that the genotoxic action of the latter analog may be through a mechanism other than inhibition of DNA synthesis.","['Mirzayans, R', 'Cubitt, S', 'Enns, L', 'Karimian, K', 'Radatus, B', 'Hirani-Hojatti, S', 'Murthy, K', 'Paterson, M C']","['Mirzayans R', 'Cubitt S', 'Enns L', 'Karimian K', 'Radatus B', 'Hirani-Hojatti S', 'Murthy K', 'Paterson MC']","['Molecular Oncology Program, Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3530-56-1 (xylocytidine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'DO2D32W0VC (Ancitabine)']",IM,"['Ancitabine/*toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Cytidine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/radiation effects']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1994 Oct;15(10):2319-24. doi: 10.1093/carcin/15.10.2319.,['10.1093/carcin/15.10.2319 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An assay which measured neutrophil rolling on interleukin (IL)-1 beta-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) showed 50% reduction in the number of rolling neutrophils in the presence of 1 microM SLeX16BSA, whereas the level of free, monovalent SLeX oligosaccharide required to produce the same effect was approximately 0.3 mM. SLeX-BSA was found to be an excellent reagent for staining endothelial cells expressing E-selectin. Biotinylated SLeX-BSA in conjunction with Texas red avidin-stained lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated HUVECs, and co-incubation of activated cells with anti-E-selectin, specifically blocked staining. The distribution of E-selectin, as determined by binding of SLeX-BSA, was virtually identical with that obtained by binding of anti-E-selectin antibody.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Welply, J K', 'Abbas, S Z', 'Scudder, P', 'Keene, J L', 'Broschat, K', 'Casnocha, S', 'Gorka, C', 'Steininger, C', 'Howard, S C', 'Schmuke, J J']","['Welply JK', 'Abbas SZ', 'Scudder P', 'Keene JL', 'Broschat K', 'Casnocha S', 'Gorka C', 'Steininger C', 'Howard SC', 'Schmuke JJ', 'et al.']","['Monsanto Corporate Research, Department of Immunology, St Louis, MO 63167.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (Sialyl Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '82354-19-6 (Texas red)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'E-Selectin', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Oligosaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Sialyl Lewis X Antigen', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Umbilical Veins', 'Xanthenes']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Glycobiology. 1994 Jun;4(3):259-65. doi: 10.1093/glycob/4.3.259.,['10.1093/glycob/4.3.259 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this culture system, cells were stimulated by interleukin-4 (IL-4) and anti-CD40 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) that were added in soluble form or were cross-linked via their Fc part using Fc gamma RII-transfected mouse fibroblast cells. Proliferation was induced and confirmed by 3H-thymidine incorporation in 14 cases and by the presence of metaphases in 42 cases. 3H-thymidine incorporation showed a heterogeneous pattern: cross-linking of anti-CD40 gave the highest proliferation in 8 cases; in 11 cases, stimulation with anti-CD40 MoAbs alone, without cross-linking also resulted in proliferation; the addition of IL-4 further enhanced 3H-thymidine incorporation in 5 cases, but suppressed this phenomenon in 5 other cases. The CD40 system proved to be very effective in obtaining cytogenetic data. With a success rate of 42 of 43 patients tested, we found clonal abnormalities in 8 cases (19%) and nonclonal abnormalities with involvement of one or two abnormal metaphases in another 7 cases. The chromosomes most frequently involved in the abnormal karyotypes, both structurally and numerically, were chromosomes 5, 7, and 14. By fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis of the cultured cells, and by immunophenotypic analysis of metaphase spreads, T-cell growth could be excluded and the HCL-lineage confirmed.

IL-6 has an autocrine and paracrine role in human multiple myeloma (MM) cell growth. With the use of the CD40 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) G28-5, we examined CD40 expression and the effect of CD40 binding on MM clonogenic colony (MCC) formation to characterize the IL-6/CD40 loop activity in MM. CD40 was expressed on plasmacytoid cells in 21 of 28 plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD) bone marrow (BM) biopsies tested (10 of 14 MM, 2 of 2 Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia [WM], 2 of 2 plasma cell leukemia [PCL], 6 of 8 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS], and 1 of 2 primary amyloidosis [AL]). G28-5 binding increased MCCs by 35% to 150% in 11 of 17 CD40+ PCD BM cultures, but did not affect MCC formation in CD40- specimens or normal BM colony forming units (CFU-GEMM, CFU-GM, BFU-E). Responsive cultures originated from BM of patients with MM (2 of 5 cases tested), WM (2 of 2), PCL (2 of 2), and MGUS (5 of 6). CD40-responsiveness was not significantly inhibited by the presence of an anti-IL-6 MoAb (2 of 2 MGUS cultures tested), and did not correlate with the capacity to respond to IL-6 stimulation (n = 17, P > .05) or a detectable level of endogenous IL-6 (n = 15, P > .05). Additional studies were performed with PCD cell lines to characterize the interrelationship of CD40 activation and IL-6 production. Fifty percent to greater than 95% of cells from the RPMI 8226 and ARH77 lines expressed CD40, whereas 6% of U266 cells were CD40+. For RPMI 8226, ARH-77, and U266 cells, the increased MCC formation after anti-CD40 stimulation was not affected by the presence of an anti-IL-6 neutralizing MoAb and was not accompanied by detectable IL-6 secretion. There was no apparent increase in IL-6 mRNA transcription following G28-5 treatment of U266 or RPMI 8226 cells. Our observations indicate that CD40 is expressed in a subset of human myeloma cells present in various PCDs. Cell-line studies suggest that the CD40+ myeloma cell may regulate MM clonogenic colony formation without activating the IL-6 pathway.","['Tong, A W', 'Zhang, B Q', 'Mues, G', 'Solano, M', 'Hanson, T', 'Stone, M J']","['Tong AW', 'Zhang BQ', 'Mues G', 'Solano M', 'Hanson T', 'Stone MJ']","['Cancer Immunology Research Laboratory, Charles A.

In this report, we studied the role of SCL in the proliferation of human peripheral blood burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) and the effects of Steel factor on SCL expression in proliferating erythroid cells. BFU-E-derived colonies increase progressively in size, as determined by cell number, from day 7 to day 14 of culture, with the greatest increase in colony size (10-fold expansion) occurring between day 7 and day 10. SCL protein levels in BFU-E-derived cells were highest in day 7 cells and decreased progressively from day 7 to day 14 of culture, suggesting an association of SCL with erythroid proliferation. In contrast, SCL mRNA levels did not decrease significantly between day 7 and day 14 cells, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms are largely responsible for the decrease in SCL protein observed. The role of SCL in Steel factor-induced erythroid proliferation was then examined. In BFU-E-derived colonies cultured with Steel factor, colony size was significantly increased compared to control. In day 7 and day 10 erythroid precursors cultured with Steel factor, SCL protein was increased significantly compared to control. The increase in SCL protein levels in early erythroid precursors stimulated with Steel factor suggests one mechanism through which Steel factor may enhance normal erythroid proliferation. SCL mRNA levels assessed by Northern blot in day 7 cells did not increase significantly in response to Steel factor stimulation, suggesting that posttranscriptional mechanisms may also be important in the increase in SCL protein observed in response to Steel.","['Miller, B A', 'Floros, J', 'Cheung, J Y', 'Wojchowski, D M', 'Bell, L', 'Begley, C G', 'Elwood, N J', 'Kreider, J', 'Christian, C']","['Miller BA', 'Floros J', 'Cheung JY', 'Wojchowski DM', 'Bell L', 'Begley CG', 'Elwood NJ', 'Kreider J', 'Christian C']","['Department of Pediatrics, Milton S.

Mobilized PB CD34+ cells were collected during hematopoietic recovery after myelosuppressive chemotherapy with or without granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or during G-CSF administration alone. The expression of activation and lineage-associated markers and c-kit gene product were studied by flow cytometry. Proliferative capacity was measured by generation of nascent myeloid progenitor cells (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; CFU-GM) and nucleated cells in a stroma-free liquid culture stimulated by a combination of six hematopoietic growth factors (interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and stem cell factor). G-CSF-mobilized CD34+ cells have the highest percentage of CD38- cells (P < .0081), but otherwise, CD34+ cells from different mobilization protocols were similar to one another in their phenotype and proliferative capacity. The spectrum of primitive and mature myeloid progenitors in mobilized PB CD34+ cells was similar to their steady-state counterparts, but the percentages of CD34+ cells expressing CD10 or CD19 were lower (P < .0028). Although steady-state PB and chemotherapy-mobilized CD34+ cells generated fewer CFU-GM at day 21 than G-CSF-mobilized and steady-state BM CD34+ cells (P < .0449), the generation of nucleated cells and CFU-GM were otherwise comparable. The presence of increased or comparable numbers of hematopoietic progenitors within PB collections with equivalent proliferative capacity to BM CD34+ cells is not unexpected given the rapid and complete hematopoietic reconstitution observed with mobilized PB. However, all four types of mobilized PB CD34+ cells are different from steady-state BM CD34+ cells in that they express less c-kit (P < .0002) and CD71 (P < .04) and retain less rhodamine 123 (P < .0001). These observations are novel and suggest that different mobilization protocols may act via similar pathways involving the down-regulation of c-kit and may be independent of cell-cycle status.","['To, L B', 'Haylock, D N', 'Dowse, T', 'Simmons, P J', 'Trimboli, S', 'Ashman, L K', 'Juttner, C A']","['To LB', 'Haylock DN', 'Dowse T', 'Simmons PJ', 'Trimboli S', 'Ashman LK', 'Juttner CA']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Blood Cells/*cytology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):2930-9.,['S0006-4971(20)71306-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph chromosome arises from a translocation that deregulates the c-ABL protein tyrosine kinase, giving it transforming potential and increased kinase activity. We observed a unique 39-kD tyrosine phosphoprotein (pp39), previously reported in blastic CML cell lines, in neutrophils from 50 cases of chronic phase CML. This protein was prominently and constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated in CML neutrophils and was not phosphorylated in normal neutrophils. Stimulation of normal neutrophils with cytokines and agonists did not induce tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins migrating in the region of pp39, and the phosphorylation state of pp39 in CML neutrophils was not affected by kinase inhibitors known to downregulate the ABL kinase. The pp39 was not phosphorylated in hematopoietic cells from healthy donors or from patients with Ph chromosome-negative myeloproliferative disorders. Using micro amino acid sequencing of purified preparations of pp39, we identified pp39 as CRKL protein, which is consistent with recent immunologic studies in the blastic K562 cell line. Immunoblotting with anti-CRKL antibodies showed the presence of CRKL protein in CML cells and cell lines as well as in antiphosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from CML cells. Our results suggest that pp39 CRKL in CML neutrophils may be stably tyrosine-phosphorylated by the BCR/ABL kinase at an early stage of myeloid differentiation when the ABL kinase is active. CRK, CRKL, and other SH2 (SRC homology domain)/SH3-containing proteins function as adaptor molecules in nonreceptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways. Although the CRKL protein is present in normal neutrophils, it is not tyrosine-phosphorylated, and the inability to induce such phosphorylation in normal neutrophils suggests a special role of this phosphoprotein in the pathogenesis of CML. Constitutive phosphorylation of CRKL is unique to CML, indicating that it may be a useful target for therapeutic intervention.","['Nichols, G L', 'Raines, M A', 'Vera, J C', 'Lacomis, L', 'Tempst, P', 'Golde, D W']","['Nichols GL', 'Raines MA', 'Vera JC', 'Lacomis L', 'Tempst P', 'Golde DW']","['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Staurosporine', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 1;84(9):2912-8.,['S0006-4971(20)71303-0 [pii]'],,,"['5 P30 CA08748-29/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['CRKL'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, transduction efficiency has been low using amphotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) vectors. In this study, we investigated modifications of gene transfer using amphotropic MoMLV vectors in cell-free supernatant for their ability to increase the currently low transduction of both committed hematopoietic progenitors, granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GMs), and their precursors, long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC). First, based on the observation that bone marrow cells express more gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) receptor (Glvr-1) than amphotropic receptor (Ram-1), PG13/LN, which is a MoMLV vector pseudotyped with the GALV envelope, was compared with the analogous amphotropic envelope vector (PA317/LN). Second, progenitor cell transduction efficiency was compared between CD34 enriched and nonenriched progenitor populations. Third, the duration of transduction in vitro was extended to increase the proportion of progenitor cells that entered cell cycle and could thereby integrate vector cDNA. In 20 experiments, 1 x 10(6) marrow or peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)/mL were exposed to identical titers of pseudotyped PG13/LN vector or PA317/LN vector in the presence of recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-3, IL-6, and stem cell factor (SCF; c-kit ligand) for 5 days. 50% of fresh vector supernatant was refed daily. Hematopoietic progenitor cells as measured by G418-resistant granulomonocytic colony (CFU-GM) formation were transduced more effectively with PG13/LN (19.35%) than with PA317/LN (11.5%, P = .012). In 11 further experiments, enrichment of CD34 antigen positive cells significantly improved gene transfer from 13.9% G418-resistant CFU-GM in nonenriched to 24.9% in CD34-enriched progenitor cells (P < .01).

The histiocytic disorders are characterized by the proliferation of cells of these lineages. With recent advances in knowledge of the developmental biology of histiocytic cells, it is now possible to formulate a reasonable catalogue of histiocytic diseases based on ultra-structural and phenotypic markers of cellular origins and molecular or chromosomal markers of malignancy. The catalogue includes the following groups of diseases. Nonmalignant reactive macrophage disorders include (1) macrophage storage diseases, (2) several benign proliferative macrophage disorders that predominantly involve skin and bone, and (3) several hemophagocytic syndromes that vary from indolent and benign to fulminant and fatal. In some of the latter disorders, viruses have been identified as the inciting stimulus. The malignant macrophage disorders include (1) acute monocytic leukemia and (2) chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. A rare disorder that gave rise to a permanent cell line with an anomaly of chromosomal segment 5q35 may also be an example of a histiocytic malignancy. The existence of a separate category of true histiocytic lymphoma of macrophage type is uncertain. Reactive Langerhans cell disorders include (1) congenital self-healing histiocytosis, (2) the many variants of eosinophilic granuloma, and (3) a related disorder designated as relapsing Langerhans cell histiocytosis that is characterized by a relapsing course and infiltration of bone and soft tissues by Langerhans cells. Presumptively neoplastic diseases of Langerhans and dendritic cells include (1) progressive Langerhans cell histiocytosis, a disease with prominent involvement of blood and BM as well as skin and viscera; (2) Langerhans cell lymphoma, and (3) dendritic cell lymphoma.

To overcome the host-versus-graft barrier, we increased the size of the graft inoculum, which has been shown to be a major factor in controlling both immune rejection and stem cell competition in murine models. Seventeen patients (mean age, 23.2 years; range, 6 to 51 years) with end-stage chemoresistant leukemia were received transplants of a combination of BM with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells from HLA-haploidentical ""three-loci"" incompatible family members. The average concentration of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage in the final inoculum was sevenfold to 10-fold greater than that found in BM alone. The sole graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of T-cell depletion of the graft by the soybean agglutination and E-rosetting technique. The conditioning regimen included total body irradiation in a single fraction at a fast dose rate, antithymocyte globulin, cyclophosphamide and thiotepa to provide both immunosuppression and myeloablation. One patient rejected the graft and the other 16 had early and sustained full donor-type engraftment. One patient who received a much greater quantity of T lymphocytes than any other patient died from grade IV acute GVHD. There were no other cases of GVHD > or = grade II.

In contrast, growth of human mast cells was initially dependent on coculture with murine fibroblasts. The growth factor produced by murine fibroblasts and required to observe differentiation of human mast cells is attributable in part to stem cell factor (SCF). However, other factors are likely involved. We have previously shown that the combination of SCF and interleukin-3 (IL-3) efficiently sustains proliferation and differentiation of colony-forming cells (CFCs) from pre-CFC enriched from human umbilical cord blood by CD34+ selection. With periodic medium changes and the addition of fresh growth factors, five consecutive cultures of different cord blood samples gave rise to differentiated cells and CFCs for more than 2 months. Although differentiated cells continued to be generated for more than 5 months, CFCs were no longer detectable by day 50 of culture. The cells have the morphology of immature mast cells, are Toluidine blue positive, are karyotypically normal, are CD33+, CD34-, CD45+, c-kit-, and c-fms-, and die in the absence of either SCF or IL-3. These cells do not form colonies in semisolid culture and are propagated in liquid culture stimulated with SCF and IL-3 at a seeding concentration of no less than 10(4) cells/mL. At refeedings, the cultures contain a high number (> 50%) of dead cells and have a doubling time ranging from 5 to 12 days. This suggests that subsets of the cell population die because of a requirement for a growth factor other than SCF or IL-3. These results indicate that the combination of cord blood progenitor and stem cells, plus a cocktail of growth factors including SCF and IL-3, is capable with high efficiency of giving rise in serum-deprived culture to human mast cells that behave like factor-dependent cell lines. These cells may represent a useful tool for studies of human mast cell differentiation and leukemia.","['Durand, B', 'Migliaccio, G', 'Yee, N S', 'Eddleman, K', 'Huima-Byron, T', 'Migliaccio, A R', 'Adamson, J W']","['Durand B', 'Migliaccio G', 'Yee NS', 'Eddleman K', 'Huima-Byron T', 'Migliaccio AR', 'Adamson JW']","['Laboratory of Hematopoietic Growth Factors, New York Blood Center, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', '*Mast Cells', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1994/12/01 00:00,1994/12/01 00:01,['1994/12/01 00:00'],"['1994/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Dec 1;84(11):3667-74.,['S0006-4971(20)70471-4 [pii]'],,,['HL-46524/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They may involve an insensitivity to a negative regulation of a growth factor-independent proliferation. Clonogenic progenitors from CML patient blood or marrow in chronic phase were grown either in the presence or absence of recombinant growth factors. No erythroid colonies were observed in the absence of any cytokine. In contrast, erythroid colonies composed of fully mature hemoglobinized erythroblasts (day 12 burst-forming units-erythroid) were obtained in the presence of Steel factor (SF) alone. Addition of erythropoietin (Epo) to SF either had no effect on the cloning efficiency or increased up to 50% the number of erythroid colonies. No erythroid growth was observed when cultures were stimulated by interleukin-3 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor alone. Similar erythroid growth in the presence of SF but without Epo was obtained in ""serum-free"" cultures when purified blood CML CD34+ cells were grown. This growth of erythroid colonies in the absence of Epo was not accounted for by an autocrine stimulation loop by Epo, because neutralizing antibodies against Epo did not inhibit it. This abnormal response to growth factor was specifically observed in the CML clone, as shown by the presence of the BCR-ABL transcript in all of these erythroid colonies. The direct implication of BCR-ABL was further documented (1) by studies of alpha-interferon-treated patients with a chimerism in which the abnormal growth correlates with the presence of the malignant clone and (2) by the use of antisense oligonucleotide against BCR-ABL transcript, which abrogated this abnormal growth. Finally, erythroid growth in the SF presence was greatly diminished by herbimycin A, whereas, at the same concentration, this tyrosine kinase inhibitor had no marked effect on erythroid colony formation in the presence of SF plus Epo on CML or normal marrow cells. This result suggests that the BCR-ABL kinase activity leads directly to this Epo-independent terminal differentiation requiring, however, the presence of SF.","['Issaad, C', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Issaad C', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U 362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Drug Interactions', 'Erythroblasts/*drug effects/pathology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Exons', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1994/11/15 00:00,1994/11/15 00:01,['1994/11/15 00:00'],"['1994/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Nov 15;84(10):3447-56.,['S0006-4971(20)73925-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells with and without the Ph1 chromosome had a common abnormal chromosome, t(3;3) (q21;q26). The reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed no bcr/abl message at diagnosis. However, the mRNA encoding P210bcr/abl was detected in the early stage of ANLL transformation. Furthermore, the mRNAs encoding both P210bcr/abl and P190bcr/abl were detected in the late stage of ANLL transformation when the Ph1 chromosome was detected by cytogenetic analysis.

The R region is deleted in most cases of deletion hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), but is unaffected in most delta beta zero-thalassemias.

The pervanadate, generated from a combination of H2O2 and vanadate (Vi), induced concomitantly protein tyrosine phosphorylation, formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), an increase in [Ca2+]i, and histamine secretion in RBL-2H3 cells. These effects were clearly dependent on the ratio of H2O2/Vi. The secretion of histamine, IP3 formation, and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i were effectively induced by treatment of the cells with the pervanadate produced from 1 mM H2O2 and 1 mM Vi. These effects mimic the stimulatory effects of an antigen (dinitrophenylated BSA) on Ca2+ signals, histamine secretion and morphological changes. Protein tyrosine phosphorylation, formation of IP3 and transient increase in [Ca2+]i were markedly induced by the pervanadate produced from 3 mM H2O2 and 1 mM Vi. However, histamine secretion induced by the pervanadate was very low. After the pervanadate from 3 mM H2O2 and 1 mM Vi was treated with catalase, it was able to induce the [Ca2+]i increase and histamine secretion as much as the antigen did. This indicates that pervanadate from a lower H2O2 concentration (1 mM H2O2/1 mM Vi) and catalase-treated pervanadate from a higher H2O2 concentration (3 mM H2O2/1 mM Vi) are able to mimic the activity that was caused by cross-linking of IgE receptors with antigen. The present results also demonstrate that protein tyrosine phosphorylation seems to have a crucial role in Ca2+ entry from the external medium, and that a sustained [Ca2+]i increase is an important step for histamine secretion in RBL-2H3 cells.","['Teshima, R', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Nakanishi, M', 'Sawada, J']","['Teshima R', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Nakanishi M', 'Sawada J']","['National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (pervanadate)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Vanadates/chemistry/*pharmacology']",1994/09/15 00:00,1994/09/15 00:01,['1994/09/15 00:00'],"['1994/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Sep 15;302 ( Pt 3):867-74. doi: 10.1042/bj3020867.,['10.1042/bj3020867 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC1137311,,,,,,,,,

However, the effect of FFP on plasma concentrations of ATIII and biochemical markers of activation of coagulation has never been tested. In this study, FFP (20 ml/kg) was administered to eight children with ALL receiving ASP in the consolidation phase of their treatment. Plasma samples were drawn pre-infusion, and following infusion at 1, 24, and 48 hr. Prior to the FFP infusions, plasma concentrations of prothrombin, fibrinogen, alpha 2-macroglobulin, heparin cofactor II, protein C, and protein S were similar to levels in healthy children. Only plasma concentrations of ATIII were significantly decreased (0.55 U/ml). Following FFP infusions, there was no statistical or clinically important increase in plasma concentrations of any coagulation protein at any time point. Pre-infusion plasma concentrations of markers of endogenous thrombin generation (thrombin-antithrombin III complexes (TAT)) and activation of the fibrinolytic system in response to activation of the coagulation system (D-dimer levels) were significantly increased.

A polyclonal rabbit anti-TdT serum was used to immunostain 54 routinely processed bone marrow sections from patients with acute leukemic disorders, using a recently described antigen-unmasking technique based on microwave oven heating. The specificity of this method of TdT analysis was confirmed by comparing the results obtained with conventional TdT analysis by indirect immunofluorescence.

Here we describe a tyrosine kinase substrate, fakB, a putative homologue of the focal adhesion kinase pp125FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of fakB was rapidly augmented in human T and B cells following antigen receptor cross-linking with antibody, while pp125FAK was nonresponsive. Costimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR/CD3) with either the CD2 or CD4 costimulatory receptors induced synergistic fakB tyrosine phosphorylation in normal human T cells. Engagement of TCR/CD3 induced the stable association of fakB with ZAP-70, the TCR/CD3 sigma-chain-associated tyrosine kinase involved in antigen receptor-induced T-cell activation. In addition, preformed complexes of fakB and ZAP-70 were observed in T-cell leukemia lines. Phosphorylation of fakB on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues was observed both in vivo and in vitro, where a functional increase of in vitro kinase activity was observed following TCR/CD3 stimulation. fakB is thus a focal adhesion kinase-related tyrosine kinase substrate that is differentially regulated from that of pp125FAK and likely plays a role in antigen-induced lymphocyte signaling.","['Kanner, S B', 'Aruffo, A', 'Chan, P Y']","['Kanner SB', 'Aruffo A', 'Chan PY']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, WA 98121.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1994/10/25 00:00,1994/10/25 00:01,['1994/10/25 00:00'],"['1994/10/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Oct 25;91(22):10484-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.22.10484.,['10.1073/pnas.91.22.10484 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC45045,,,,,,,,,

Human K562 cells were mutated to produce a cell line (IA) incapable of the earliest step in PI glycosylation, the formation of PI-GlcNAc. Another cell line (IVD) was deficient in the deacetylation of PI-GlcNAc to form PI-GlcN and subsequent mannosylated species. Each line was transfected with wild-type human insulin receptors. Similar insulin-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was observed in all three lines, along with a nearly identical increase in the association of phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate 1 with endogenous PI 3-kinase. Both normal and GPI-defective lines also displayed a similar 2- to 3-fold increase in phosphorylation of the Shc protein and its association with growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 in response to insulin. In contrast to these results, striking differences were noted in insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis. In normal cells, glycogen synthesis was significantly increased by insulin, whereas no insulin stimulation was observed in GPI-deficient IA cells, and only a trace of stimulation was detected in IVD cells. These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation produced by insulin is not dependent on GPI synthesis, and this effect is not sufficient to elicit at least some of the metabolic effects of the hormone. In contrast, GPI synthesis is required for the stimulation of glycogen synthesis by insulin in these cells. These findings support the existence of divergent pathways in the action of insulin.","['Lazar, D F', 'Knez, J J', 'Medof, M E', 'Cuatrecasas, P', 'Saltiel, A R']","['Lazar DF', 'Knez JJ', 'Medof ME', 'Cuatrecasas P', 'Saltiel AR']","['Department of Signal Transduction, Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research Division, Ann Arbor, MI 48105.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9005-79-2 (Glycogen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycogen/*biosynthesis', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Receptor, Insulin/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1994/10/11 00:00,1994/10/11 00:01,['1994/10/11 00:00'],"['1994/10/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Oct 11;91(21):9665-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.21.9665.,['10.1073/pnas.91.21.9665 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC44877,,,,,,,,,

The antigen-specific T-cell receptor can deliver the first signal, while ligation of the T-cell surface molecule CD28 by antibodies or its cognate ligands B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 has been demonstrated to be sufficient for the delivery of the second signal. Signaling via CD28 and the T-cell receptor results (i) in their costimulation of T cells to produce numerous lymphokines including interleukin 2 and (ii) in the prevention of anergy induction. Little is known about the pathway by which CD28 mediates its signals except that protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is involved. We show here in human Jurkat cells that the Tec-family protein-tyrosine kinase ITK/EMT (p72ITK/EMT) is associated with CD28 and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated within seconds of CD28 ligation. This tyrosine phosphorylation of p72ITK/EMT is rapid (within 30 sec), occurs in the absence of LCK activation, and precedes tyrosine phosphorylation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor VAV. Secondary crosslinking of CD28 is unnecessary for the induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p72ITK/EMT. Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of p72ITK/EMT may represent one of the earliest events in CD28 signaling. This demonstrates that a member of the Tec family of protein tyrosine kinases, similar to members of the Src and Syk families, plays a role in the activation of T cells. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that p72ITK/EMT, and by analogy other members of the Tec family, responds to extracellularly generated signals.","['August, A', 'Gibson, S', 'Kawakami, Y', 'Kawakami, T', 'Mills, G B', 'Dupont, B']","['August A', 'Gibson S', 'Kawakami Y', 'Kawakami T', 'Mills GB', 'Dupont B']","['Immunology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['CD28 Antigens/*physiology', 'CD3 Complex/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology/immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1994/09/27 00:00,1994/09/27 00:01,['1994/09/27 00:00'],"['1994/09/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/27 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Sep 27;91(20):9347-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.20.9347.,['10.1073/pnas.91.20.9347 [doi]'],,,"['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-22507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC44809,,,,,,,,,

The major IGFBP in serum is IGFBP-3. We investigated whether sera from children with malignancies show alterations in levels of IGFBP-3 as measured by Western ligand blot analysis (WLB) and RIA with alpha IGFBP-3gl, a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody. Furthermore, IGFBP-3 proteolysis was quantified by densitometric analysis of [125I]IGFBP-3 protease assays, and IGFBP-3 fragments were visualized by Western immunoblot with alpha IGFBP-3gl. We examined sera from 21 children with solid tumors, five patients with sarcoma who had reached complete remission, and 13 children with acute leukemia. Serum samples were collected at diagnosis, before initiation of therapy. Sera of 10 healthy children served as normal controls. Children with solid tumor or leukemia had significantly higher (p < 0.001) IGFBP-3 protease activity in serum than did normal controls or patients with sarcoma in complete remission. Corresponding to this finding, densitometry of WLB showed lower IGFBP-3 levels in sera of children with malignancies in comparison with normal controls. The negative correlation (p < 0.001, r = -0.80) between IGFBP-3 proteolysis, as measured by [125I]IGFBP-3 protease assay, and IGFBP-3 band density on WLB indicates that proteolysis is the probable reason for reduction of IGFBP-3 on WLB.

In this study, the capacity of IgG to activate the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) and rat peritoneal mast cells was investigated. Immune complexes formed with purified rat IgG and antigen as well as chemically cross-linked rat IgG induced histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells. This stimulation was inhibited by pre-incubation of the cells with saturating concentrations of monomeric IgE. With chemically cross-linked rat IgG of each subclass, only IgG2a stimulated histamine release from RBL-2H3 cells and this release was also inhibited by prior saturation of the Fc epsilon RI with monomeric IgE. Identical results were obtained with rat peritoneal mast cells. In binding experiments, IgE and cross-linked rat IgG2a bound to rat Fc epsilon RI transfected into CHO cells. Monomeric rat IgG2a, cross-linked rat IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c and rabbit IgG did not bind to Fc epsilon RI. Stimulation of RBL-2H3 cells with aggregated IgG2a induced phosphorylation of tyrosines in the beta and gamma subunits of the Fc epsilon RI. Thus, although RBL-2H3 and rat peritoneal mast cells have Fc gamma R, the IgG-mediated stimulation of these cells for histamine release was by the Fc epsilon RI. Altogether, these data demonstrate that the rat Fc epsilon RI is a functional receptor with low affinity for rat IgG2a.","['Benhamou, M', 'Berenstein, E H', 'Jouvin, M H', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Benhamou M', 'Berenstein EH', 'Jouvin MH', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, National Institute of Dental Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Histamine Release/*immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred ACI', 'Rats, Inbred Lew', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, IgE/*physiology', 'Receptors, IgG/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1994 Oct;31(14):1089-97. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(94)90104-x.,['10.1016/0161-5890(94)90104-x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date APL is the only AML which is sufficiently sensitive to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) differentiating effect. We have recently reported that APL express and secrete hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) such as IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, and IL-6. In vivo ATRA alone allows achievement of complete remission in APL patients. One of ATRA therapy's drawbacks is the increase of peripheral blast cells often associated with the ATRA leukocyte activation syndrome. To determine if this specific side-effect was linked to an increase of HGF release by APL cells, we studied the modulation of cytokine production by APL cells, we studied the modulation of cytokine production by APL samples (n = 12) before and after incubation with ATRA. ATRA failed to modulate TNF alpha, IL-6 or GM-CSF secretion levels; however, IL-8 levels decreased in 11 cases, and in four cases up-regulation of IL-1 beta and G-CSF protein expression was observed. These modulations were found to be linked to ATRA sensitivity as ATRA failed to modulate cytokine production in non-APL cells (n = 8). Interestingly, the increase of IL-1 beta and G-CSF production in the presence of ATRA was highly correlated to an increase in APL cell count in vitro and in vivo hyperleukocytosis, resulting in fatal outcome. IL-1 beta, TNF alpha, IL-6, and IL-8 are known to be implicated in leukocyte activation. The results of this study suggest that ATRA-induced hyperleukocytosis and ATRA leukocyte activation syndrome in APL may be inherent to the secretion of specific hematopoietic growth factors by the APL cells.","['Dubois, C', 'Schlageter, M H', 'de Gentile, A', 'Balitrand, N', 'Toubert, M E', 'Krawice, I', 'Fenaux, P', 'Castaigne, S', 'Najean, Y', 'Degos, L']","['Dubois C', 'Schlageter MH', 'de Gentile A', 'Balitrand N', 'Toubert ME', 'Krawice I', 'Fenaux P', 'Castaigne S', 'Najean Y', 'Degos L', 'et al.']","[""Laoratoire de Biologie, Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1750-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that normal and leukemic B-cell precursors bind to bone marrow stromal cells through the beta-1 integrins VLA-4 and VLA-5, thereby exposing early lymphoid cells to regulatory cytokines. It has been recently reported that the pre-B cell line NALM-6 is capable of migrating under layers of murine stromal cells in vitro (Miyake et al. J Cell Biol 1992;119:653-662). We have further analyzed leukemic cell motility using human bone marrow fibroblasts (BMF) as a stromal layer. The precursor-B ALL cell line NALM-6 rapidly adhered to BMF, and underwent migration or tunneling into BMF layers within 5 h, as demonstrated by light and electron microscopy, and confirmed by a chromium-labeling assay. Migration was also observed with the precursor-B ALL lines Reh and KM-3, with a T leukemia line RPMI-8402, the monocytic line U937, and the mature B line Daudi. In contrast, mature B (Raji), myeloid (K562, HL-60), and T lines (CCRF-CEM, MOLT-4) did not migrate. When cases of leukemia were analyzed, BMF migration was largely confined to precursor-B ALL, occurring in eight of 13 cases tested. Of other types of leukemia, migration was observed in one of four cases of T-ALL, but no evidence was seen in six acute myeloid leukemias and two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Only minimal migration into BMF was observed with purified sorted CD10+ CD19+ early B cells from normal adult marrow, while normal mature B lymphocytes from peripheral blood did not migrate. ALL migration was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies to the beta sub-unit of the VLA integrin family, and by a combination of antibodies to VLA-4 and VLA-5. Partial inhibition was also observed when leukemic cells were incubated with antibodies to VLA-4, VLA-5, or VLA-6 alone. In contrast, treatment of stromal cells with antibodies to vascular cell adhesion molecule or fibronectin (ligands of VLA-4 and VLA-5) did not prevent leukemic cell migration. These results indicate that ALL cells are highly motile and capable of rapid migration within marrow stroma, an effect largely mediated by VLA-4 and VLA-5. In the case of precursor-B ALL, this process may reflect a homing mechanism to areas of selective growth advantage within the bone marrow microenvironment.","['Makrynikola, V', 'Bianchi, A', 'Bradstock, K', 'Gottlieb, D', 'Hewson, J']","['Makrynikola V', 'Bianchi A', 'Bradstock K', 'Gottlieb D', 'Hewson J']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/pathology']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1734-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, possible mechanisms resulting in a disruption of regulated expression of wild-type p53 were examined in acute leukemias of either lymphoid (ALL) or myeloid (AML) phenotype. p53 transcript accumulation, nucleotide sequence and gene structure were analyzed in primary leukemic cells from 50 patients. p53-specific transcripts were detected in 26/26 cases of ALL and 16/23 cases of AML using reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Sequencing of transcripts did not reveal any point mutations or deletions. Heterozygosity at a polymorphic Bg/II site within intron 1 was found in 4/28 leukemic samples, and loss of one allele was noted in one of these. In addition, a novel, leukemia-associated structural abnormality located within the 5' flanking region of the p53 gene and associated with the loss of heterozygosity was observed in cells from this patient with ALL. The MDM2 gene which inactivates p53 by binding to it was neither amplified nor rearranged in 28 leukemias studied. Thus, disruption of regulated p53 expression resulting in lack of detectable p53 mRNA even by RT-PCR occurs in about 30% of cases of AML; however, p53 alterations typical for human solid tumors are an infrequent event in most types of human acute leukemias.","['Schottelius, A', 'Brennscheidt, U', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Mertelsmann, R H', 'Herrmann, F', 'Lubbert, M']","['Schottelius A', 'Brennscheidt U', 'Ludwig WD', 'Mertelsmann RH', 'Herrmann F', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Center, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Oct;8(10):1673-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the most common marker profile in CLL, CD5+, CD23+, FMC7- and weak expression (+/-) of surface immunoglobulin (SmIg) and CD22, we devised a scoring system that gives for each of these five markers a value of 1 or 0 according to whether it is typical or atypical for CLL. Scores range from 5 (typical of CLL) to 0 (atypical for CLL). Application of the scoring system to all the cases showed that 87% of CLL scored 5 and 4 and only 0.4% scored 0 or 1, whereas 89% of other B-cell leukemias and 72% of lymphomas scored 0 or 1; only one case (0.3%) scored 4 and none scored 5 (p < 0.0001). There were no differences between CLL with high and low scores but higher scores were found in cases with more typical morphology (p < 0.0015). Considering each individual marker, there was no single one that distinguished CLL from other diseases, although the most reliable were SmIg intensity and FMC7.

Thus, HL-60 cell maturation is accompanied by an increase in the affinity of their polyamine transport system. This system is much more efficient than that found in end-stage PMNs, suggesting that it plays a more important role in supporting the metabolic requirements of HL-60 cells.

Effect of recombinant retrovirus expressing antisense glial fibrillary acidic protein RNA.,376-85,"Injury to the central nervous system (CNS) either from trauma or due to demyelinating/degenerating diseases results in a typical response of astrocytes, termed astrogliosis. This reaction is characterized by astrocyte proliferation, extensive hypertrophy of nuclei, cell body, and cytoplasmic processes and an increase in immunodetectable glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). GFAP accumulation may cause a physical barrier preventing the reestablishment of a functional environment. Our studies have aimed at modulating astrogliosis by inhibiting or delaying GFAP synthesis in damaged and reactive astrocytes. The present study investigates the use of a recombinant retrovirus expressing antisense GFAP RNA in controlling the response of mechanically injured astrocytes. A 650 bp fragment from the coding region of mouse GFAP cDNA was cloned in the antisense orientation under the control of long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter of Moloney murine leukemia virus. Increase in GFAP as detected by immunocytochemical staining in injured astrocytes was inhibited by treatment with retrovirus expressing antisense GFAP RNA. Also, astrocytes at the site of injury in these scratched cultures did not show cell body hypertrophy compared to control cultures. These observations demonstrate that the increase in GFAP at the site of injury can be inhibited using retroviral treatment and indicate the potential of retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in modulating scar formation in the CNS in vivo. These studies also shed light on the role of GFAP in maintaining the morphology of astrocytes.","['Ghirnikar, R S', 'Yu, A C', 'Eng, L F']","['Ghirnikar RS', 'Yu AC', 'Eng LF']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/*biosynthesis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Antisense/*biosynthesis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Wounds and Injuries/pathology']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1994 Jul 1;38(4):376-85. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490380403.,['10.1002/jnr.490380403 [doi]'],,,['NS-11632/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied Ki-S1 and PCNA (PC10) immunostaining of erythroid precursors (proliferative activity) and megakaryocytes (endoreduplicative activity) in bone marrow trephine biopsies in a variety of reactive and neoplastic lesions using double immunohistochemistry to identify both cell lineages. A significant increase in Ki-S1 labelling compared with PCNA positivity was found in all conditions studied. In particular, specimens derived from secondary polycythaemia (SP), polycythaemia vera (P. vera), and primary osteomyelofibrosis (OMF), and from splenic tissue with myeloid metaplasia (MM), revealed a disproportionally high labelling index of erythropoiesis, which was not present in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), AIDS, and autoimmune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenia (ITP). Enhancement of Ki-S1 (PCNA) staining in SP and P. vera is in keeping with the relevant increase in erythroid precursor proliferation, but in OMF and MM there is overexpression of both proliferation markers, possibly due to secondary folic acid deficiency, which is known to cause a block in the S-phase of the cell cycle. A significant correlation was observed between the sizes of megakaryocytes and their nuclei with Ki-S1 (and also PCNA) staining. Ki-S1 (and PCNA) labelling of predominantly smaller elements of this lineage supports a hypothesis that the phases of the cell cycle have different durations in the various steps of polyploidization, with a prolongation of G1/G2 at higher ploidy levels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Thiele, J', 'Bertsch, H P', 'Kracht, L W', 'Anwander, T', 'Zimmer, J D', 'Kreipe, H', 'Fischer, R']","['Thiele J', 'Bertsch HP', 'Kracht LW', 'Anwander T', 'Zimmer JD', 'Kreipe H', 'Fischer R']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*pathology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*analysis', 'Staining and Labeling']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1994 May;173(1):5-12. doi: 10.1002/path.1711730103.,['10.1002/path.1711730103 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on the results of that study, a successor study was designed with the objective to maintain treatment efficacy while decreasing adverse effects, particularly the occurrence of secondary leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-seven children with a chronologic and/or bone age less than 16 years were enrolled onto this study between May 1982 and October 1990. Treatment consisted of six cycles of combination chemotherapy--three of doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) and three of MOPP--and low-dose irradiation (15 Gy) of involved fields. Boosts of 10 Gy were given to areas of bulky disease and to those that did not respond completely after two cycles of chemotherapy. RESULTS: With a median follow-up duration of 6.7 years, the projected 10-year survival and event-free survival (EFS) rates are 96% (SE 2.5%) and 93% (SE 3.5%) for the entire cohort of 57 patients, and 85% (SE 10%) and 69% (SE 12.8%), respectively, for 13 patients with stage IV disease. No patient has developed a second malignancy. Growth and development have progressed normally. No patients have symptomatic cardiac, pulmonary, or thyroid disease. Subclinical abnormalities of pulmonary function were detected in 32% and chemical hypothyroidism in 16%. CONCLUSION: This therapy was highly efficacious in children with Hodgkin's disease without unacceptable toxicity. Future efforts should be directed toward further reducing therapy for favorable early-stage patients and improving treatment efficacy for those with stage IV disease.","['Hunger, S P', 'Link, M P', 'Donaldson, S S']","['Hunger SP', 'Link MP', 'Donaldson SS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Oct;12(10):2160-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2160.,['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.10.2160 [doi]'],,,"['1 F32 CA 09184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the intracellular mechanisms by which their signals are transduced remain poorly understood. We have previously studied the regulation of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide gene expression by LIF and CNTF in the NBFL neuroblastoma cell line. Because these cytokines induce tyrosine phosphorylation that may lead to Ras activation, we explored a possible role for Ras in LIF- and CNTF-induced signal transduction. In NBFL cells LIF increases activated Ras in a rapid, transient, and concentration-dependent manner. CNTF and a related cytokine, oncostatin M, produce similar increases. CNTF and LIF also increase activated Ras in neuron-enriched dissociated cultures of sympathetic ganglia. Moreover, these cytokines rapidly and transiently induce specific tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, p165 and p195. The protein kinase inhibitors K252a and staurosporine block LIF-induced increases in tyrosine phosphorylation, activated Ras, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide mRNA in NBFL cells. These data support a possible role for Ras in the cell differentiation effects of LIF and CNTF.","['Schwarzschild, M A', 'Dauer, W T', 'Lewis, S E', 'Hamill, L K', 'Fink, J S', 'Hyman, S E']","['Schwarzschild MA', 'Dauer WT', 'Lewis SE', 'Hamill LK', 'Fink JS', 'Hyman SE']","['Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02129.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Staurosporine', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/biosynthesis', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 1994 Oct;63(4):1246-54. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1994.63041246.x.,['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1994.63041246.x [doi]'],,,"['MH00892/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS27514/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS29767/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have discovered that LSTRA cells, like HL60 and U937 promyelocytic leukemia cells, can be induced to differentiate toward macrophages by the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or granulocytes by the cyclic nucleotide analogue dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP). One property of mature macrophages and granulocytes is the ability to produce nitric oxide, a highly reactive free radical that is important in non-specific host defense. Nitric oxide production by mature macrophages is stimulated by inflammatory mediators via an inducible form of the enzyme, nitric oxide synthase. We report that LSTRA cells acquire the ability to produce nitric oxide following differentiation induced by TPA and, to a lesser extent, by dbcAMP. Nitric oxide production by the cells is dependent on L-arginine and blocked by several inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase, including N-monomethyl-L-arginine, L-canavanine, L-arginine benzyl ester, and L-arginine methyl ester. In macrophage-differentiated LSTRA cells, the inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma was found to be a potent inducer of nitric oxide production. This was correlated with a marked increase in nitric oxide synthase activity in the cells that was due to interferon-gamma-induced expression of the macrophage-inducible form of nitric oxide synthase protein as well as mRNA. Differentiated LSTRA cells also expressed increased amounts of a constitutive form of nitric oxide synthase that was also present in undifferentiated cells. Taken together with previous findings, these results support the model that LSTRA cells have the capacity to differentiate toward mature macrophages.","['Garcia-Welsh, A', 'Laskin, D L', 'Hwang, S M', 'Denhardt, D T', 'Laskin, J D']","['Garcia-Welsh A', 'Laskin DL', 'Hwang SM', 'Denhardt DT', 'Laskin JD']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway 08854.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.4.- (Amino Acid Oxidoreductases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Oxidoreductases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Canavanine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'omega-N-Methylarginine']",1994/10/01 00:00,1994/10/01 00:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Oct;56(4):488-94. doi: 10.1002/jlb.56.4.488.,['10.1002/jlb.56.4.488 [doi]'],,,"['ES 03647/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 04738/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 05022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bacterial superantigen, staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA), is known to induce activation-induced apoptosis in the TCR V beta-bearing CD4+ T cells in the periphery after clonal expansion of these cells. The murine retroviral model of AIDS (MAIDS), which is induced by LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus, shares many common features with HIV infection in humans, except that CD4+ T cells increase progressively in susceptible strains. In this study, we challenged SEA to MAIDS mice and examined whether this retrovirus affects the fate of the SEA-reactive CD4+ T cells in vivo. At 4 wk post-infection with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus, clonal expression and subsequent deletion of SEA-reactive CD4+V beta 3+ T cells occurred normally after SEA administration, whereas in vitro proliferative responses were severely impaired. At 8 wk postinfection, the in vivo expansion of CD4+V beta 3+ T cells was evident, but not followed by clonal deletion, as late as 14 days after SEA administration. This expanding subset in the infected mice expressed the Fas Ag in the same amount as the same subset in uninfected controls. These findings suggest that activation-induced apoptosis of superantigen-reactive CD4+ T cells is interfered with in vivo during the course of MAIDS, which is not attributable to underexpression of the Fas Ag by the CD4+ T cells.","['Aoki, Y', 'Hiromatsu, K', 'Usami, J', 'Makino, M', 'Igarashi, H', 'Ogasawara, J', 'Nagata, S', 'Yoshikai, Y']","['Aoki Y', 'Hiromatsu K', 'Usami J', 'Makino M', 'Igarashi H', 'Ogasawara J', 'Nagata S', 'Yoshikai Y']","['Laboratory of Host Defense, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37337-57-8 (enterotoxin A, Staphylococcal)', '39424-53-8 (enterotoxin B, staphylococcal)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Clonal Deletion', 'Enterotoxins/immunology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/immunology', 'Superantigens/*immunology', 'fas Receptor']",1994/10/15 00:00,1994/10/15 00:01,['1994/10/15 00:00'],"['1994/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Oct 15;153(8):3611-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of APRF, p91, and additional members of the ISGF3 family is thus a general feature of a wide variety of signaling pathways, integrating diverse signals through common transcriptional regulators.","['Raz, R', 'Durbin, J E', 'Levy, D E']","['Raz R', 'Durbin JE', 'Levy DE']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Isgf3g protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit', 'Interferons/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/09/30 00:00,1994/09/30 00:01,['1994/09/30 00:00'],"['1994/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Sep 30;269(39):24391-5.,['S0021-9258(19)51096-1 [pii]'],,,['R01 AI28900/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/U08378'],['ISGF3'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Dibutyryl cAMP induced eosinophilic differentiation of EoL-1 cells from 6-9 days after the start of culture with down-regulation of CD11a, CD18, and CD49 expression and up-regulation of CD11b expression. Changes in integrin expression, except for CD18, were seen predominantly in the fraction containing eosinophilic granule-positive cells, suggesting that the changes were dependent on eosinophilic differentiation. On the other hand, dbcAMP-induced changes of integrin expression were reversible and were not seen on day 9 when dbcAMP was removed on day 3, whereas eosinophilic differentiation was still present. A combination of G-CSF and TNF-alpha, which also induced eosinophilic differentiation of EoL-1 cells, increased CD11b expression slightly but had no significant effect on the expression of the other integrins. Butyrate and PMA up-regulated CD11b expression without eosinophilic differentiation. The results collectively suggest that the regulation of integrin expression on EoL-1 cells is partly dependent and partly not dependent on eosinophilic differentiation. The possible involvement of protein kinase A and protein kinase C in these changes is suggested.","['Jung, E Y', 'Ohshima, Y', 'Shintaku, N', 'Sumimoto, S', 'Heike, T', 'Katamura, K', 'Mayumi, M']","['Jung EY', 'Ohshima Y', 'Shintaku N', 'Sumimoto S', 'Heike T', 'Katamura K', 'Mayumi M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '84478-11-5 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/physiology', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*pharmacology', 'Eosinophils/*chemistry/*pathology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins/*analysis/physiology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*blood/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*analysis/physiology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*analysis/physiology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Sep;53(3):156-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00664.x.,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00664.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutrophils were obtained from 4 pediatric patients with malignancies and healthy adult volunteers before and after rhG-CSF administration. Neutrophils obtained before rhG-CSF treatment started to undergo apoptosis after 24 h of incubation. In contrast, the survival of neutrophils drawn after rhG-CSF administration increased by approximately 24 h. Concomitantly, the appearance of typical ladder-like DNA fragmentation was delayed. Such an increase in neutrophil survival was inhibited by co-incubation with either H 7 (10 mumol/l) or H 8 (20 mumol/l), which worked as protein kinase C inhibitors. Although our study did not measure neutrophil survival in vivo directly, it provides us with further evidence that rhG-CSF may function to prolong neutrophil life expectancy in vivo.","['Adachi, S', 'Kubota, M', 'Lin, Y W', 'Okuda, A', 'Matsubara, K', 'Wakazono, Y', 'Hirota, H', 'Kuwakado, K', 'Akiyama, Y']","['Adachi S', 'Kubota M', 'Lin YW', 'Okuda A', 'Matsubara K', 'Wakazono Y', 'Hirota H', 'Kuwakado K', 'Akiyama Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '84478-11-5 (N-(2-(methylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*pathology', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/pathology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Sep;53(3):129-34. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00660.x.,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb00660.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To assess the contribution of Fas to the pathogenesis of retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency, we examined the kinetics of Fas expression on the lymphocytes during the course of murine acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) induced by a defective LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus. The Fas-positive cells were increased in proportion both in alpha beta T cells and B cells with the progression of MAIDS. The appearance of Fas-positive cells in alpha beta T cells preceded those in B cells during the course of MAIDS. Among alpha beta T cells, about half of the Thy1.2+ alpha beta T cells were positive for Fas, while almost all of Thy1.2- CD4+ alpha beta T cells were of the Fas-positive phenotype. The Fas-positive cells in MAIDS mice, especially unique Thy1.2-CD4+ alpha beta T cells, were easily rendered apoptotic by stimulation via Fas, indicating that Fas expressed on the lymphocytes is functional. Furthermore, concomitant infection with Mycobacterium avium in MAIDS mice caused a marked increase in Fas-positive cells accompanied by a severely impaired T cell reactivity to polyclonal stimuli.

The results indicated that SCF alone had suppressive effect on DNA synthesis and colony forming unit-leukemic blast (CFU-L) in LT12 cells. 100ng/ml of SCF caused substantial reduction in colony number and 3H-TdR uptake although this suppression was of lower magnitude than those induced by IL3, IL6 or GM-CSF. Enhanced suppression on the proliferation of LT12 cells was observed when SCF was used in combination with one of these three factors. Among these combinations, SCF+GM-CSF or SCF+IL6 resulted in more suppression on LT12 cells than SCF+IL3 did. Combination of SCF with two or three factors produced even more suppression. No apparent effect on the size of leukemic colony was seen. Furthermore, in growth kinetics study of LT12 cells in the presence of SCF production of LT12 cells declined.

In this study the authors addressed the issue of the biologic effects of two different schedules of rIL-2 administration (i.e., continuous intravenous infusion versus subcutaneous injection) on the expression of the p55 and p75 chains of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). METHODS: Sixteen patients were studied: 6 patients with a previous diagnosis of acute leukemia entered the study at least +60 days (+63(-)+144 days) after autologous bone marrow transplantation and were treated with continuous rIL-2 infusion; 10 patients with advanced metastatic renal cancer were treated with subcutaneous rIL-2 therapy. In both groups of patients, therapy consisted of two cycles of 5-day rIL-2, and immunologic evaluation was performed two days after completion of the second cycle. RESULTS: Intravenous treatment was associated with a marked increase in CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells expressing the p75 but lacking the p55 IL-2R; however, the absolute number of CD3+ lymphocytes was unchanged, and they showed a low or absent expression of the p55 and negativity for the p75 IL-2R. After subcutaneous rIL-2 therapy, a slight increase in the percentage of NK cells expressing only the p75 IL-2R was shown. CD3+ lymphocytes still retained the p75 IL-2R negative phenotype, however, with a significant increase (> 15%) in p55 IL-2R expression. The absolute number of CD3+ lymphocytes was also significantly increased. Functional tests on the purified CD3+ population indicate that these cells exhibited low values of cytotoxic and proliferative activities in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' data point out that subcutaneous administration of rIL-2 during a 2-week period is associated with a marked increase in T-cells that bear the low affinity p55 IL-2R. These findings could be relevant considering the independent role of lymphokine modulation mediated by the p55 and p75 IL-2R on T- and NK cells.","['Zambello, R', 'Trentin, L', 'Cerutti, A', 'Enthammer, C', 'Milani, A', 'Franceschi, T', 'Messina, C', 'Cetto, G L', 'Agostini, C', 'Semenzato, G']","['Zambello R', 'Trentin L', 'Cerutti A', 'Enthammer C', 'Milani A', 'Franceschi T', 'Messina C', 'Cetto GL', 'Agostini C', 'Semenzato G']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Child', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/immunology/therapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",1994/11/01 00:00,1994/11/01 00:01,['1994/11/01 00:00'],"['1994/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Nov 1;74(9):2562-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19941101)74:9<2562::aid-cncr2820740926>3.0.co;2-1.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19941101)74:9<2562::aid-cncr2820740926>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that (1) incubation of normal bone marrow mononuclear cells with 200 U/mL rhTNF alpha for 20 hours induced a diminution of 31.2% +/- 5.2% of CD34+ cells coexpressing c-kit; (2) the same decrease was observed using purified CD34+ cells and, furthermore, their proliferative response to SCF was inhibited by 31.5% +/- 7.3% after exposure to TNF alpha; (3) similar experiments performed on CD34+ c-kit+ AML cells from 11 patients gave comparable results. Further analysis at the mRNA level indicated that TNF alpha decreased c-kit mRNA transcripts. Moreover, using monoclonal antibodies against the two types of TNF alpha receptors, p75 and p55, we showed that the downregulation of c-kit proto-oncogene product by TNF alpha, on normal and leukemic CD34+ cells, was exclusively mediated by the TNF alpha p55 receptor.

The majority of patients with T-LGL leukemia have a chronic disease (years) manifested often by severe neutropenia, rheumatoid arthritis, and mild-to-moderate splenomegaly. The characteristic phenotype of the leukemic LGL is CD3+, CD8+, CD16+, CD57+, and CD56-. In this report we describe an aggressive variant of T-LGL leukemia in which leukemic LGL also expressed CD56, as identified by two-color flow-cytometry analysis. In contrast to the chronic nature typical of T-LGL leukemia, these patients presented with a severe systemic illness that was rapidly progressive and resistant to treatment. Atypical clinical features included rapidly increasing spleen size to massive proportions, extensive lymphadenopathy, and the presence of B symptoms (fever, nightsweats, weight loss). Hematologic and pathologic features were also unusual for T-LGL leukemia. These patients had very high LGL counts at diagnosis (range 11,692 to 26,312 microL), which increased rapidly despite treatment. Histopathologic examination of splenic sections showed extensive infiltration of red pulp cords and sinuses by leukemic cells with atrophy of the white pulp. These clinicopathologic features are similar to those described for patients with natural killer cell (NK)-LGL leukemia, whose cells are also CD56+. However, unlike NK-LGL leukemia, we could not show a direct pathogenic role for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as Southern-blot analyses using an EBV-joined termini probe were negative in these patients. Our findings suggest that CD3+, CD56+ LGL leukemia is a distinct clinicopathologic entity separate from the usual CD3+, CD56- T-LGL leukemia. The expression on leukemic LGL of CD56, an adhesion molecule, may determine the aggressive biologic nature of this newly described disease.","['Gentile, T C', 'Uner, A H', 'Hutchison, R E', 'Wright, J', 'Ben-Ezra, J', 'Russell, E C', 'Loughran, T P Jr']","['Gentile TC', 'Uner AH', 'Hutchison RE', 'Wright J', 'Ben-Ezra J', 'Russell EC', 'Loughran TP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York at Syracuse.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD57 Antigens', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*classification/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics']",1994/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1994/10/01 00:00'],"['1994/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1994/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Oct 1;84(7):2315-21.,['S0006-4971(20)76517-1 [pii]'],,"['Blood. 1995 Mar 15;85(6):1675-6.

Analysis of IL-2 and IFN production by isolated CD4+ and CD8+ cells.,702-8,"Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that PBMC from recipients of an HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplant produce levels of IL-2 which are 10-100-fold lower than those produced by the same number of PBMC from healthy controls, whereas production of IFN-gamma is normal. The present study examined IL-2 and IFN production over a range of cell numbers for PBMC and for isolated CD4+ and CD8+ cells for controls and marrow transplant recipients. There was a 5-fold lower IL-2 production in marrow transplant recipient CD8+ cells compared with equivalent numbers of control cells, whereas no difference was found in IL-2 production by CD4+ cells. In contrast, IFN production by CD4+ cells from marrow transplant recipients was 4-fold higher than in controls, whereas CD8+ cells from both populations produced similar amounts of IFN. When the observed production of cytokine by PBMC was compared with the expected production based on the CD4+ and CD8+ content of the PBMC, control values were similar, but the expected values for both cytokines were approximately 2-fold higher than the observed values for marrow transplant recipients. The results suggest that the capacity of T cells from marrow transplant recipients to produce IL-2 and IFN is not impaired, but that the frequency of cytokine-producing cells may be reduced, and that a negative interaction present in recipient PBMC, eliminated by isolating T-cell subsets, is responsible for the observed low levels of cytokine production.","['Cooley, M A', 'Wright, L', 'Atkinson, K']","['Cooley MA', 'Wright L', 'Atkinson K']","[""Centre for Immunology, St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/blood', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1994 Apr;86(4):702-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04818.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1994.tb04818.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This similarity to human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMo) renders this cell line a promising model for studies of monocyte activation and differentiation. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is known to act antagonistically to LPS during the activation process of PBMo, inhibiting the production of cytokines. Therefore, this study was designed to compare the effects of IL-4 and LPS on the expression of monocytic markers and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) mRNA on PBMo and the MONO-MAC-6 cell line. IL-4 inhibited the LPS-induced expression of TNF alpha mRNA in PBMo and downregulated the LPS receptor CD14 but it had no influence on MONO-MAC-6 cells regarding these parameters. However, upregulation of CD14 and MSE mRNA expression in the cell line by a 2-day incubation with LPS were inhibited by IL-4. This response to IL-4 after long-term treatment with LPS was seemingly contradictory to the missing reduction of TNF alpha mRNA expression after short-term incubation with LPS. Obviously long-term treatment with LPS made the cells responsive to IL-4. The increase in responsiveness was not due to IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) upregulation, as LPS did not influence the constitutive expression of the IL-4R.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Kolsdorf, K', 'Zaborski, M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Kolsdorf K', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Monocytes/*enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Sep;8(9):1551-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, Northern hybridization was used to determine the pattern of expression of transcripts for VLA subunits in: (i) leukemic blasts obtained from the peripheral blood of ten patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) of different FAB subclasses; (ii) the human leukemic cell lines KG-1, HL-60, K-562, HEL and U-937; and (iii) normal hematopoietic cells. Most of the AML blasts and the cultured leukemic cells expressed mRNAs for the beta 1 and alpha 5 subunits (the only exception among the cell lines was KG-1 cells) and these transcripts were also found in normal bone marrow progenitors, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), and peripheral blood monocytes. While the alpha 4 transcript was detected in all cultured cells but K-562, and in normal circulating monocytes, it occurred in blasts from only two AML patients and was weakly expressed in mature PBMNC. No specific pattern of expression of beta 1, alpha 5, and alpha 4 transcripts could be related to cell differentiation or maturation in the AML blasts and leukemic cell lines tested. None of the primary AML blasts or cultured cells showed mRNA messages for alpha 2, alpha 3 or alpha 6 chains of the beta 1 integrins.

Abnormalities were detected in 4/32 AML patients (13%) and 2/15 non-AML controls (13%). Direct sequencing of PCR products revealed five different base substitutions. Three were conservative, two caused amino acid changes. The base substitution leading to amino acid change alanine to glycine at position 17 was found in both an AML patient and a control. It lies in the signal sequence and does not affect the mature protein. The other base change altering arginine to glutamine at position 164 is unlikely to influence the receptor structure as this structural position in the chain is not well conserved in members of the cytokine receptor family. Both amino acid changes were constitutive alterations as they could be demonstrated in the patients' children.

Until now it has not been known to what extent in vitro Ara-C cytotoxicity can be restored by HGF stimulation in samples from previously treated AML patients. Therefore, we studied the individual effects of the hematopoietic growth factors (HGF) granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-3 (IL-3), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulation on the Ara-C sensitivity of clonogenic leukemic cells from six patients with newly diagnosed AML. These results were directly compared with the outcome using AML samples from the same patients at relapse or primary refractory AML. In one patient, a sample of the second relapse was also studied. The results were expressed as IC50 values, and were used to calculate sensitivity ratios, defined as the ratio of the IC50 value with drug exposure alone and with HGF plus Ara-C. In AML samples treated with Ara-C alone and no HGF, IC50 values of Ara-C in relapsed/refractory AML were greater than IC50 values of AML cells at diagnosis. Addition of either HGF enhanced the Ara-C cytotoxicity for the relapsed samples significantly (for G-CSF p = 0.036, IL-3 p = 0.036, and for GM-CSF p = 0.036). The values of Ara-C sensitization of AML samples due to HGF at relapse did not significantly differ from those at diagnosis. However, enhancement of Ara-C cytotoxicity to AML progenitors by IL-3 or GM-CSF stimulation was significantly less in the cell specimens from AML recurrence patients as compared with the original diagnosis samples. In three AML samples at diagnosis and at their relapse, Ara-C incorporation into the DNA was determined. IL-3 stimulation enhanced Ara-C incorporation in all samples tested. Nevertheless, Ara-C incorporation in the relapsed samples was significantly less than that in the diagnosis samples of the same patients. A good correlation between Ara-C incorporation and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation was found. The results indicate that HGF stimulation in relapsed/refractory AML enhances Ara-C cytotoxicity, but not to the level that was observed with AML samples at diagnosis.","['te Boekhorst, P A', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Sonneveld, P']","['te Boekhorst PA', 'Lowenberg B', 'Sonneveld P']","['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Sep;8(9):1480-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the high levels of soluble vimentin in HL60 cells suggests that these cells may be a good model for studying components involved in vimentin assembly.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Desmin)', '0 (Vimentin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Desmin/analysis/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Keratins/analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry', 'Vimentin/*analysis/chemistry/metabolism']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1994 Aug;53(2):78-84. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb01869.x.,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1994.tb01869.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ligand for this receptor (Steel factor) can stimulate hematopoiesis both in vitro and in vivo. To study the pattern of c-kit receptor expression in normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells, we prepared a monoclonal antibody (9B9) against human c-kit receptor by using a synthetic peptide (amino acids 476-501) from the extracellular domain of c-kit receptor to immunize Balb/c mice. Monoclonal antibody 9B9 bound to recombinant c-kit protein, the erythroleukemic line HEL, the megakaryocytic line MEG-01, and the murine mast cell line P815. Monoclonal antibody 9B9 also bound to the surface of the CD7+CD3-CD4-CD8- T cell lymphoid cell lines DU.528 and HSB2T, and also to 1 to 4% of normal bone-marrow cells. The majority (67 +/- 6%) of CD34+ bone-marrow progenitor cells coexpressed c-kit receptor. Flow-cytometry analysis of immature CD3-CD4-CD8- (triple-negative) thymocytes indicated 30 +/- 9.5% expressed the c-kit receptor, and thymidine incorporation assay revealed that the receptor is functional. Indirect fluorescent microscopy of human thymic tissue, using a monoclonal antibody against Steel factor, revealed its presence on scattered mononuclear cells within the intralobular septae and the subcapsular cortex, which are regions where the triple-negative thymocytes are also localized. These data provide evidence that the c-kit receptor is present on human hematopoietic bone marrow and intrathymic T cell progenitor cells, and that it likely plays a role in early T cell lymphopoiesis.","['deCastro, C M', 'Denning, S M', 'Langdon, S', 'Vandenbark, G R', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Scearce, R', 'Haynes, B F', 'Kaufman, R E']","['deCastro CM', 'Denning SM', 'Langdon S', 'Vandenbark GR', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Scearce R', 'Haynes BF', 'Kaufman RE']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Stem Cells/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology/ultrastructure']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Sep;22(10):1025-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The continued replication of these cells, although unable to induce tumours in athymic mice, could be the result of the maintained expression of an IFN antagonist termed sarcolectin (SCL), a balance being struck between the effects of v-mos oncogene, interferon beta and SCLs.

A significant correlation between the number of infused CFU-GM and the time to both granulocyte and platelet engraftment was found. Cells induced by G-CSF could speed the recovery of granulocyte or platelet counts after PBSCT. In terms of preserving engraftment potential, cryopreservation of PBSC by a simplified uncontrolled-rate method is at least as effective as the traditional controlled-rate freezing procedure with a programmed freezer. As the serum G-CSF level increases immediately following infusion of PBSC graft, therapy with G-CSF may have only a limited ability to further enhance hematopoietic recovery after PBSCT.

RESULTS: Measurement of plasma MTX, 6-TG, and mononuclear 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) levels indicates that the desired biochemical modulation and serum levels were achieved. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild and the dose-limiting toxicity was bone marrow depression. A 300-mg/m2 dose of 6-TG with MTX is considered the MTD. Responses were noted in patients with lymphoma. CONCLUSION: Encouraging antitumor effects were produced with this regimen in heavily pretreated patients with lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin's disease (HD).

Using the factor-dependent myelogenous leukemia cell lines GF-D8 and Mo7, we show that TGF-beta interferes with stem cell factor (SCF)-induced proliferation by downmodulating c-jun gene expression. The ability of SCF to induce accumulation of c-jun transcripts was abolished when TGF-beta was present in culture. Transcriptional nuclear run-on assays indicated that TGF-beta relieved the capacity of SCF to enhance the transcriptional rate of the c-jun gene. Deletion analysis of the c-jun promoter furthermore showed that SCF was activating the c-jun promoter via the NF-jun transcription factor. Gel mobility shift assays showed that SCF increased the binding activity of NF-jun to its recognition site within 5 to 15 minutes. Binding activity peaked at 1 hour after exposure to SCF and declined to starting levels within 4 hours. The ability of SCF to enhance NF-jun binding activity was also dose-dependent in the range of 5 to 100 ng/mL. Exposure of GF-D8 and Mo7 cells to TGF-beta before the addition of SCF antagonized SCF-induced NF-jun binding. Moreover, whereas SCF was capable of functionally activating a heterologous promoter containing the NF-jun binding site, pretreatment of GF-D8 cells with TGF-beta abolished transcriptional activation of this heterologous promoter. These findings indicate that SCF-mediated activation of c-jun via NF-jun is crucial for the SCF-inducible proliferative response and is inhibited by TGF-beta. In additional experiments, the antisense technique was used. Treatment of GF-D8 and Mo7 cells with an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide directed against the translation initiation site of c-jun abolished the capacity of SCF to induce a proliferative response, whereas sense and nonsense oligomers had no effect. Taken together, our data indicate that the counteracting modulation of the binding activity of NF-jun by SCF and TGF-beta regulates the expression of the c-jun gene and thereby the proliferative state of the GF-D8 and Mo7 target.","['Sott, C', 'Dorner, B', 'Karawajew, L', 'Herrmann, F', 'Brach, M A']","['Sott C', 'Dorner B', 'Karawajew L', 'Herrmann F', 'Brach MA']","['Department of Medical Oncology and Applied Molecular Biology, Freie Universitat Berlin, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (nuclear factor-jun)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/chemistry/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, jun', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/09/15 00:00,1994/09/15 00:01,['1994/09/15 00:00'],"['1994/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Sep 15;84(6):1950-9.,['S0006-4971(20)76999-5 [pii]'],,,,,['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,['Blood. 1999 May 15;93(10):3573.

Consistent with the normal pattern of axl expression, axl RNA was found predominantly in diseases of the myeloid lineage: 39 of 66 (59%) patients with myeloproliferative disorders (acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase, CML in myeloid blast crisis, and myelodysplasia) showed significant axl transcription, as compared with 1 of 45 (2%) lymphoid leukemias (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and CML in lymphoid blast crisis). Treatment of K562 cells with the phorbol ester, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), administration of interferon alpha (IFN alpha) to normal monocytes, and treatment of U937 cells with TPA and IFN tau significantly induced axl expression, supporting a role for this kinase in the intracellular signaling of myeloid cells through a variety of biochemical pathways.

Both high- and low-affinity classes are expressed simultaneously in promyelocytes and neutrophils. The calculated kd for high-affinity receptors correlates with the concentrations of MIP-1 alpha required to induce a biologic effect on stem cells and neutrophils. Cross-linking studies show that MIP-1 alpha associates with two cell surface proteins with apparent molecular masses of 92 kD and 52 kD.

Although the G-CSFR belongs to the cytokine receptor superfamily, which lacks an intracellular kinase domain, G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins is critical for its biologic activities. We report here that JAK1 and JAK2 tyrosine kinases are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to G-CSF induction. We also demonstrate that the DNA-binding protein STAT3 (also called the acute-phase response factor [APRF], activated by interleukin-6) is an early target of G-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. G-CSF induces two DNA-binding complexes; the major complex contains tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3 protein and the minor complex appears to be a heterodimer of the STAT1 (previously p91, a component of DNA-binding complexes activated by interferons) and STAT3 proteins. Antiphosphotyrosine antibody interferes with the DNA binding activity of activated STAT3, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is important for the DNA binding activity.

CRKL, an adaptor protein consisting of SH2 and SH3 domains in the absence of a catalytic domain, is one potential in vivo substrate of BCR/ABL. Previous experiments have shown that CRKL is phosphorylated on tyrosine in the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562 and that CRKL is a substrate for ABL and for BCR/ABL in COS-1 cells. In the current study, we show that in peripheral blood cells a direct correlation exists between the presence of BCR/ABL and the phosphorylation status of CRKL. In Ph- peripheral blood cells, CRKL is present only in the nonphosphorylated form. In contrast, all BCR/ABL+ CML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient samples examined showed clear tyrosine-phosphorylation of CRKL.

The major IGFBPs in CSF are IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-4. Normally, IGFBP-3 is a minor component in CSF of healthy subjects, but may be increased in pathological states. We investigated IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 levels by specific RIAs in CSF from patients with central nervous system (CNS) tumor or leukemia and compared them with values in patients with meningitis. Further, as proteolysis of IGFBP-3 is part of the modulation of IGF activity, IGFBP-3 fragmentation was quantified by densitometric analysis of [125I]IGFBP-3 protease assays. We examined CSFs of 23 children with malignant CNS tumors, 18 children with leukemia, and 13 children with meningitis. The CSF from 38 children who received lumbar punctures to exclude meningitis was used to define the normal range for IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-3 protease activity in CSF. CNS tumor and leukemia patients had normal levels of IGF-I and IGF-II in CSF, whereas the IGF-II concentration in CSF of meningitis patients was elevated (P < 0.0001). Only 2 of 13 (15%) meningitis patients had elevation of CSF IGFBP-3 concentrations, despite high numbers of inflammatory cells. By comparison, elevated IGFBP-3 concentrations were found in the CSF of 16 of 23 (70%) CNS tumor patients and 6 of 7 (86%) CNS tumor patients with microscopically detectable malignant cells in CSF. Twelve of 13 (92%) patients with medulloblastoma or ependymoma and all 7 medulloblastoma/ependymoma patients with malignant cells in CSF had elevated IGFBP-3 concentrations. The IGFBP-3 protease activity in CSF was elevated in 15 of 16 (94%) patients with CNS tumors of high grade histological malignancy. Five of 6 patients (83%) with acute leukemia and microscopically detectable malignant cells in CSF at the time of diagnosis showed elevated IGFBP-3 concentrations, with normalization after chemotherapy. Leukemia patients without malignant cells in CSF had normal IGFBP-3 concentrations. We conclude that in CSF of children with highly malignant CNS tumor or CNS leukemia, IGFBP-3 is elevated. This phenomenon could be caused by disruption of the blood-CSF barrier and entry of IGFBP-3 from serum, although this appears unlikely, especially for CNS leukemia. More likely possibilities are 1) local production of IGFBP-3 by CNS tumor tissue and secretion into the CSF, or 2) local production of IGFBP-3 by malignant cells within the CSF.","['Muller, H L', 'Oh, Y', 'Gargosky, S E', 'Lehrnbecher, T', 'Hintz, R L', 'Rosenfeld, R G']","['Muller HL', 'Oh Y', 'Gargosky SE', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Hintz RL', 'Rosenfeld RG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins)', '0 (Somatomedins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 protease)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carrier Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endopeptidases/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Proteins', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Male', 'Meningitis/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Somatomedins/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1993 Nov;77(5):1113-9. doi: 10.1210/jcem.77.5.7521338.,['10.1210/jcem.77.5.7521338 [doi]'],,,['DK-36054/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On a univariate analysis, four different immunophenotypic blast cell characteristics were found to be associated with a poor prognosis: expression of CD34 ""bright"" (ratio > 10 between fluorescence emission of positive cells and that of negative (isotypic) control-P/N ratio: mean MESF value: 265,000) in > 15% blast cells, co-expression of CD34 and CD33 in > 60% blast cells, expression of CD14 in > 30% leukemic cells, the MDR+ (""multiple drug resistant"") phenotype. In contrast, the duration of remission, and overall survival of AML patients showing a ""dim"" CD34 expression (P/N ratio: 3-10: mean MESF value: 49,000) was similar to that of CD34- AML patients, irrespective of the percentage of positivity for CD34, which was, however, a predictive factor of survival in patients with higher CD34 fluorescence intensities in their blastic population. No correlation between FAB subtypes, prognosis and immunophenotype was found. The multivariate regression analysis showed that, besides age, only the combined expression of CD34 and CD33 had independent prognostic meaning. Indeed, in each FAB subtypes the CD34+/CD33+ phenotype was associated with a shorter survival and a lower mitotic rate. These data may contribute to the understanding of the discrepancies so far observed in the literature regarding the prognostic role played by the CD34 expression on leukemic AML blasts.","['Lanza, F', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Moretti, S', 'Latorraca, A', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Rigolin GM', 'Moretti S', 'Latorraca A', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994;13 Suppl 1:81-5. doi: 10.3109/10428199409052681.,['10.3109/10428199409052681 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the few cases of ALL reported so far were B-cell ALL, Burkitt's-type. DESIGN: We recently observed, with unexpected frequency, ALL cases in this setting: over a 5-year period, 5 of 25 HIV-positive patients referred to our center for hematological malignancies, had ALL. Three patients, who had previously been asymptomatic with regard to HIV infection, had typical Burkitt's-type ALL. Complete remission was achieved in all cases with high-dose lymphoma-type chemotherapy regimens, but 2 patients relapsed 3 and 27 months after diagnosis. Their clinical characteristics and outcome are discussed with reference to the cases reported thus far in the literature. One patient had common early pre-B ALL with the Philadelphia chromosome, and one had a T-cell ALL with an unusual CD7+, CD4-, CD8- phenotype. Prognosis was very poor in both cases. CONCLUSION: The exact incidence and the therapeutic management of B-cell ALL in HIV-positive patients warrants further evaluation. In addition, we show that there may be a heterogeneity among ALL cases in this setting, with the first description of 2 non-Burkitt's ALL with atypical features in HIV-positive patients.","['Geriniere, L', 'Bastion, Y', 'Dumontet, C', 'Salles, G', 'Espinouse, D', 'Coiffier, B']","['Geriniere L', 'Bastion Y', 'Dumontet C', 'Salles G', 'Espinouse D', 'Coiffier B']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Lyon-Sud, Pierre Benite, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'HIV Seropositivity/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prognosis']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994 May;5(5):437-40. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058876.,"['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a058876 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63108-X [pii]']",,,,,,,26,,,,,,,,,,

The beta 2 integrins are a group of adhesion molecules, mainly expressed on leukocytes, that mediate intercellular binding by recognizing their counterparts on endothelial cells, among others ICAM-1. In this study we have studied the regulation of this interaction in myelomonocytic cells treated with genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with several other biological functions. We show that genistein upregulates the surface expression of the beta 2-integrins in the monoblastic THP-1 and to a lesser extent in the promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cell lines. This upregulation leads to an increase in the adherence of THP-1 cells to ICAM-1. Genistein also modulates the expression of ICAM-1 on endothelial cells by potentiating the upregulating effect of TNF and IFN-gamma. Genistein may thus enhance intercellular binding by affecting both the endothelium and the circulating cells.","['Tiisala, S', 'Majuri, M L', 'Carpen, O', 'Renkonen, R']","['Tiisala S', 'Majuri ML', 'Carpen O', 'Renkonen R']","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*biosynthesis', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",1994/08/30 00:00,1994/08/30 00:01,['1994/08/30 00:00'],"['1994/08/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/30 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Aug 30;203(1):443-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1994.2202.,"['S0006-291X(84)72202-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1994.2202 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) augmented uptake of 3H-thymidine into the DNA of APL cells in a dose-dependent manner in all cases. This stimulatory effect was pronounced in some, but not all, cells treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). However, nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing activity was induced in a concentration-dependent manner by ATRA in all cases. The cytokines greatly enhanced NBT reduction of APL cells treated with ATRA, and a mixture of cytokines was more effective than a single cytokine. Although GM-CSF, IL-3 and IL-1 significantly modulated the ATRA-induced morphological changes, they did not induce CD14 expression, a typical marker of monocytic differentiation. In the presence of ATRA, GM-CSF potentiated production and secretion of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) in response to lipopolysaccharide, as well as interferon-gamma which is a potent inducer of monocytic differentiation in APL cells. On the other hand, production of TNF in ATRA-treated cells was not affected by G-CSF which significantly enhanced granulocytic differentiation.

Pretreatment with epoxybutene in vitro suppressed recombinant interleukin-3-stimulated colony formation in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, had no effect on colony formation with recombinant granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor or recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor alone, and completely blocked the synergism of recombinant c-kit ligand and granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor. Butadiene-induced leukaemogenesis, macrocytic anaemia and thymic atrophy are reminiscent of the conditions observed in mice bearing mutations at the W or Sl loci, which are deficient in the c-kit receptor and c-kit ligand, respectively. Epoxybutene did not suppress colony formation in cells from W/Wv and Sl/Sld mice, consistent with the absence of the population of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that is susceptible to butadiene in those genetically deficient strains. These findings indicate that the pathological conditions observed after either exposure to butadiene or W or Sl mutations are due to a functional defect in a subpopulation of primitive haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells that plays a major role in the pathogenesis of both T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma and anaemia in the mouse.","['Irons, R D', 'Colagiovanni, D B', 'Stillman, W S']","['Irons RD', 'Colagiovanni DB', 'Stillman WS']","['Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '478ERR5NKR (3,4-epoxy-1-butene)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Butadienes/*toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Epoxy Compounds/toxicity', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1993;(127):205-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MHH 225 cells have been growing exponentially without cytokines or conditioned media. About 90 per cent of MHH 225 cells are CD33+ CD34+ CD3- CD7- CD19- CD20- TdT- with 57.6 per cent, 28.3 per cent and 7.8 per cent of them being CD41+, glycophorin A+ and CD15+, respectively. After five days of treatment with erythropoietin, GM-CSF, G-CSF or IL-6 no change was observed in MHH 225 cell antigens expression. IL-3 (100 U/ml) induced a moderate increase in only CD13 and alpha naphthyl esterase positive cells from 6.5 +/- 1.9 per cent and 5.7 +/- 2.4 per cent in control cultures to 21.6 +/- 3.0 per cent and 19.1 +/- 2.8 per cent, respectively.

The present results showed that out of the six myelopoietic growth factors tested, IL-4 was the only one to inhibit selectively the proliferation of CD33+ CD41+ leukemic megakaryoblast cells suggesting that IL-4 may have a lineage regulatory effect in favour of a myeloblastic CD33+ CD13+ CD15+ at the expense of a megakaryoblastic CD33+ CD41+ amplification in human leukemia cells and with apparently no effect on leukemic erythroblast cells.

In addition, a phase I trial of topotecan given as a 5-day continuous intravenous infusion to patients with refractory leukemia has had promising antileukemic responses. A separate series of in vitro studies indicates that a modest degree of resistance to the cytotoxicity of topotecan can be mediated by P-glycoprotein. A phase I and pharmacology study of irinotecan given as a 90-min infusion every 3 weeks has defined an MTD of 240 mg/m2, with dose escalation being limited by several toxicities.

The induction of HL 60 cell differentiation along the granulocytic lineage by DMSO or HMBA had no effect on the level of CT transcripts. Induction of monocytic/macrophagic differentiation by TPA resulted in a transient, about 10-fold elevated expression of CT steady state mRNA after 24 h. In contrast to TPA, induction of HL 60 cell differentiation along the monocytic pathway by Vit D3 had no detectable effect on the level of the CT in RNA expression at corresponding time points.

The relative intensity was defined as the ratio of bcr-abl signal to that of beta-actin. The relationship between the semiquantified bcr-abl mRNA and the platelet/megakaryocyte counts was analyzed. A possible correlation was found between the semiquantified b3-a2 type mRNA and the platelet (p < .05, N = 28) and megakaryocyte (p < .05, N = 13) counts of these patients.

Initial concerns over potential aggravation of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and increase in the incidence of relapse in patients with myeloid leukemias influenced the number of studies using hematopoietic growth factors after allogeneic BMT. We report the experience with 50 patients treated at a single institution using granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) after allogeneic sibling (n = 30) and matched unrelated (n = 20) BMT. The time to an absolute neutrophil count > or = 500/microL was significantly faster in patients who received G-CSF and cyclosporine and prednisone for GVHD prophylaxis when compared with historical control patients receiving the same GVHD prophylaxis (10 v 13 days, P < .01). A similar accelerated myeloid engraftment was observed for those patients who received the addition of methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis when compared with historical control patients receiving the same GVHD prophylaxis regimen (16 v 19 days, P < .05). The median time to engraftment for patients receiving a matched unrelated BMT and G-CSF was 17 days (range 13 to 26). We did not observe any increase in GVHD or early mortality in the matched related sibling BMT. The incidence of acute GVHD in the matched unrelated BMT recipients was also low at 21%; however, 9 patients (45%) died within 100 days of the date of BMT, similar to the experience reported with granulocyte-macrophage CSF. This study confirms the efficacy of G-CSF in accelerating myeloid engraftment after allogeneic matched sibling BMT. The higher early mortality associated with patients receiving matched unrelated BMT suggests that randomized controlled trials using G-CSF after allogeneic BMT should be performed.","['Schriber, J R', 'Chao, N J', 'Long, G D', 'Negrin, R S', 'Tierney, D K', 'Kusnierz-Glaz, C', 'Lucas, K S', 'Blume, K G']","['Schriber JR', 'Chao NJ', 'Long GD', 'Negrin RS', 'Tierney DK', 'Kusnierz-Glaz C', 'Lucas KS', 'Blume KG']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/mortality', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Sep 1;84(5):1680-4.,['S0006-4971(20)77642-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we have recently shown that the IL-7R mediates activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase. Because PI-3 kinase activity can be immunoprecipitated with antiphosphotyrosine antibodies in most receptor systems studied, it has been examined that either PI-3 kinase or an associated protein become tyrosine-phosphorylated after ligand binding. We studied here the possibility that PI-3 kinase, which is directly linked to mitogenic responses in growth factor receptors, is tyrosine-phosphorylated after stimulation of the IL-7R. Using anti-p85 alpha or anti-p85 beta antibodies raised against the p85 subunit of PI-3 kinase for immunoprecipitation and subsequent blotting with antiphosphotyrosine clearly shows that IL-7-stimulated human precursor cells contain both p85 alpha and p85 beta proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Specific protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as tyrphostin AG-490 block total cell lysate phosphorylation and tyrosine phosphorylation on p85. Similar concentrations of this inhibitor also block in vitro and in vivo PI-3 kinase activity suggesting that this enzyme activation is dependent on the phosphorylation event of p85. In addition, AG-490 blocks IL-7-mediated proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a link between the early events of PI-3 kinase phosphorylation and activation with IL-7R-induced cell growth.","['Dadi, H', 'Ke, S', 'Roifman, C M']","['Dadi H', 'Ke S', 'Roifman CM']","['Division of Immunology/Allergy, University of Toronto, Hospital for Sick Children, ON.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '118409-60-2 (tyrphostin 47)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', '*Tyrphostins']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Sep 1;84(5):1579-86.,['S0006-4971(20)77629-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies indicated that the depressed hematopoiesis observed in LP-BM5-infected marrow cultures may be attributable to a defect of hematopoietic stroma. We report here the generation of permanent stromal cell lines from noninfected and LP-BM5-infected marrow cultures. Retrovirus infection was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction for viral genome. The ability of these cell lines to support in vitro hematopoiesis was studied. Results indicated that, when cocultured with normal or infected nonadherent mononuclear cells, noninfected cell lines efficiently supported the production of hematopoietic precursors, whereas viral-infected cell lines induced suppression of both normal and viral-infected progenitors. Expression of cytokine genes in stromal cell lines was also examined. All cell lines expressed equivalent levels of transcripts for stem cell factor and tumor necrosis factor alpha. However, infection was associated with higher levels of interleukin-4 and transforming growth factor beta 1 transcript expression. These findings suggest that infected stromal cell lines exhibit a defective hematopoietic microenvironment that produced altered cytokine expression resulting in faulty hematopoiesis. Further characterization of the defective cell lines should prove valuable for studies of the pathogenesis of murine AIDS.","['Tse, K F', 'Morrow, J K', 'Hughes, N K', 'Gallicchio, V S']","['Tse KF', 'Morrow JK', 'Hughes NK', 'Gallicchio VS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, gag', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology/physiology', 'Interleukin-3/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/microbiology', 'Nuclear Envelope/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1994/09/01 00:00,1994/09/01 00:01,['1994/09/01 00:00'],"['1994/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Sep 1;84(5):1508-18.,['S0006-4971(20)77620-2 [pii]'],,,,,['gsg'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Two forms of LIF cDNA, differing at their 5' ends, have been described encoding either diffusible (D-LIF) or matrix-associated (M-LIF) forms of the protein [Rathjen, Toth, Willis, Heath and Smith (1990) (Cell 62, 1105-1114]. The present report describes the DNA sequence and functional characterization of the murine LIF gene and its surrounding transcriptional regulatory elements. Transient transfection of constructs containing the LIF gene and various amounts of 5'-non-coding sequence failed to give detectable levels of expression, suggesting the presence of inhibitory sequences within the LIF gene. Stable cell lines were produced by transfection of experimental constructs containing various lengths of 5'-non-coding sequence of the LIF gene, or the heterologous phosphoglycerate kinase promoter, linked to an LIF/neomycin-resistance-hybrid-coding sequence. The frequency of recovery of stable clones indicated that sequences located in the first intron between the transcriptional start sites for D-LIF and M-LIF act to suppress expression of the gene in most genomic locations. This region is rich in GC residues and has been shown to be hypomethylated in vitro [Kaspar, Dvorak and Bartunek (1993) FEBS Lett. 319, 159-162]. Analysis of the LIF/neomycin-resistance transgene expression in these stable cell clones demonstrated that transcripts containing the M-LIF or D-LIF exons required the presence of sequences located between -1200 and -3200 in the LIF gene. In the absence of these sequences, transcription is initiated elsewhere within the first intron. These sequences can be replaced by the heterologous phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Deletion of the GC-rich region between the D-LIF and M-LIF transcriptional start sites results in the appearance of transcripts that do not splice out the first intron of the LIF gene. These may result from gene or promoter trapping of the LIF gene. Sequence analysis of the region between -1200 and -3200 revealed a number of minimal steroid-response elements, regions of similarity to DNAase I-hypersensitive sites in the uteroglobin gene and a region of alternating purine/pyrimidine sequence. This study therefore defines two important regulatory regions in the LIF gene: a GC-rich region in the first intron and a distal 'enhancer' located between -3200 and -1200.","['Hsu, L W', 'Heath, J K']","['Hsu LW', 'Heath JK']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA', 'Ribonucleases', 'Transfection']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Aug 15;302 ( Pt 1):103-10. doi: 10.1042/bj3020103.,['10.1042/bj3020103 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/S73374'],['LIF'],,,PMC1137196,,,,,,,,,

Downregulation of oncogenes H-ras, c-raf-2, c-kit, whose proteins are associated with cell surfaces or are cytosolar transducers, occurs before those oncogenes c-myc, c-myb, and c-fos, whose products are DNA binding proteins. This suggests a temporal perturbation of signal transduction by IFN. No change in oncogene expression occurred in non-treated cells nor were these oncogenes expressed in the non-transformed B-lymphoblast cell line, Wil-2, under the same treatment regimen.

For all samples examined, the CD34-positive rate obtained using the histogram method was higher than that obtained using the SSC-FL method. This finding was probably due to the fact that some monocytes non-specifically reacted with anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody, and the histogram method could not distinguish these non-specifically stained cells from CD34-positive precursor cells. On the other hand, the SSC-FL method seemed to yield a more accurate measurement of the percentage of CD34-positive cells in PBSCH samples. Based on this finding, it is recommended that the histogram method, which is currently used at most commercial laboratories, be reviewed in favor of the SSC-FL method when the CD34-positive cell rate of PBSCH is to be determined.","['Morii, T', 'Nishikawa, K', 'Shimoyama, T', 'Yamanaka, T', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Yagi, H', 'Samma, S', 'Fujimura, Y', 'Yoshioka, A', 'Narita, N']","['Morii T', 'Nishikawa K', 'Shimoyama T', 'Yamanaka T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Yagi H', 'Samma S', 'Fujimura Y', 'Yoshioka A', 'Narita N']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nara Medical University.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Separation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Middle Aged']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1994 Jul;35(7):649-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relationship to cytostasis induced in tumor cells by cytotoxic macrophages.,21891-7,"Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by macrophages inhibits tumor cell replication. NO also inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme essential for DNA synthesis, probably by quenching the catalytically active tyrosyl free radical of its R2 subunit. The role of this inhibition in NO-mediated cytostasis was thus evaluated. After a 4-h coculture with macrophages, quenching of the radical was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in transfected L1210-R2 cells over-expressing the R2 protein. Pronounced cytostasis was simultaneously observed. A NO synthase inhibitor greatly reduced both phenomena. Target cells withdrawn from macrophages partially recovered from cytostasis and radical loss within 90 min. Deoxyribonucleosides added to by-pass ribonucleotide reductase inhibition efficiently reversed cytostasis of K-562 cells. After a 24-h coculture, the quenched tyrosyl radical still reappeared in L1210-R2 cells withdrawn from macrophages, but DNA synthesis did not resume. Moreover, deoxyribonucleosides marginally reversed overnight cytostasis of K-562 cells mediated by macrophages but were efficient against cytostasis induced by hydroxyurea, a ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor. Autocrine cytostasis observed early in TA3-H2 cells committed to produce NO was closely correlated with quenching of the tyrosyl radical but not with formation of dinitrosyl-iron complexes. We thus propose that NO-dependent cytostasis begins with a rapid and reversible inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, progressively reinforced by other, long-lasting antiproliferative effects.","['Lepoivre, M', 'Flaman, J M', 'Bobe, P', 'Lemaire, G', 'Henry, Y']","['Lepoivre M', 'Flaman JM', 'Bobe P', 'Lemaire G', 'Henry Y']","['Unite 1116, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Universite Paris-Sud, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 1.4.- (Amino Acid Oxidoreductases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radicals', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*chemistry']",1994/08/26 00:00,1994/08/26 00:01,['1994/08/26 00:00'],"['1994/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Aug 26;269(34):21891-7.,['S0021-9258(17)31886-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individual cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) show well-defined variables in the extent and pattern of peripheral blood and nodal involvement. The L-selectin adhesion molecule (TQ1/Leu-8, LAM series and LECAM-1) initiates the attachment of lymphocytes to the high endothelial venules (HEVs), and as a consequence the entrance of lymphocytes from the blood into the peripheral lymph node (recirculation which may be operative in lymphoma/leukemia dissemination as well). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The constitutional expression of L-selectin molecules (LECAM-1) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from B-CLL (16 cases) was examined and correlated with receptor function in an HEV-binding assay and in a ligand immobilization test. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A correlation was found between constitutional expression and function of the L-selectins, namely the higher the number of cells expressing L-selectin molecules at a measurable level on the cell surface, the greater the number of cells showing attachment in the tests. It is suggested that many aspects of the biological and clinical heterogeneity of B-CLL will be explained by revealing the exact adhesion profile and function in different subtypes of the disease.","['Csanaky, G', 'Vass, J A', 'Milosevits, J', 'Ocsovszki, I', 'Szomor, A', 'Schmelczer, M']","['Csanaky G', 'Vass JA', 'Milosevits J', 'Ocsovszki I', 'Szomor A', 'Schmelczer M']","['Department of Pathology, University Medical School of Pecs, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Selectin', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1994 Mar-Apr;79(2):132-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deletion 20q in myeloproliferative diseases (MPD), the deletion of 5q and t(1;7) in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and t(3;3) in acute myeloid leukemia subtype M7 (AML-M7) were seen in all or at least in two myeloid lineages. These were interpreted as stem cell abnormalities.

In our experience, of the 300 cell lines examined more than one third was infected with mycoplasmas. Mycoplasma contamination can affect virtually every parameter and functional activity of a cultured cell. An alternative to the recommended disposal of infected cultures is an attempt to eliminate the contaminants. Adding antibiotics with strong activity against mycoplasmas to the culture medium is a simple, inexpensive and efficient decontamination method. Here, we studied the effectiveness of the new antibiotic enrofloxacin (Baytril) developed specifically for use against mycoplasmas. Baytril is a new synthetic agent from the group of quinolone derivatives that are DNA gyrase inhibitors. Thirty-two chronically infected cell lines (27 human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines) were treated with Baytril in a prospective study in direct comparison with three other well-established anti-mycoplasma regimens, the antibiotics BM-Cyclin, Ciprobay and MRA (Mycoplasma Removal Agent). Mycoplasmas were detected by DNA staining, agar colony growth, DNA-RNA hybridization, polymerase chain reaction, and monoclonal antibody staining. Treatment with Baytril eliminated the contaminants in 30/32 cultures (94%). The cure rates for Ciprobay, BM-Cyclin and MRA were 91%, 81%, and 75%, respectively. The IC50 values of Baytril for cell lines varied over a wide range depending on the type of hematopoietic cell lineage with T- and B-cell lines being more sensitive targets. Baytril-treated cell lines remained mycoplasma-negative over a 12-week antibiotic-free culture period. Low levels of mycoplasma infection were shown not to persist by repeat testing after growth without antibiotics. A retrospective analysis of anti-mycoplasma treatments with BM-Cyclin, Ciprobay, MRA or Baytril showed that 265/351 cultures (75%) were immediately cured of mycoplasma; however, all of the remaining, mycoplasma-positive cultures harboring mycoplasms resistant to the first antibiotic could be cleaned up by a second round with a different antibiotic. Baytril is an efficient anti-mycoplasma antibiotic and based on its high cure rate might be the treatment of first choice.","['Fleckenstein, E', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Drexler, H G']","['Fleckenstein E', 'Uphoff CC', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)', '0 (Fluoroquinolones)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (RNA, Bacterial)', '3DX3XEK1BN (Enrofloxacin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Techniques/*methods', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Decontamination/*methods', 'Enrofloxacin', '*Fluoroquinolones', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Mycoplasma/*drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Quinolones/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Aug;8(8):1424-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major drawback of the conventional nesting strategy is linked to the opening of the reaction tube between the two successive PCR reactions, giving a risk of contaminating the second mix with amplicons. In this paper, the application of a new protocol for NPCR without reopening the reaction tube between the two steps of the procedure is described for the research of residual leukemic cells in the peripheral blood of 14 CML patients treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or interferon (IFN). This assay which is both highly specific and sensitive, offers several advantages over the use of conventional NPCR: it is more sensitive, faster and decreases the risk of false-positive results. In addition, chemiluminescent detection of amplified DNA after transfer onto a nylon membrane, although comparable with radioactive hybridization in terms of sensitivity and speed, is more advantageous in safety and convenience.

In this study, maturation and proliferation of fresh APL cells were examined when induced in vitro by granulocyte or granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF or GM-CSF) in combination with ATRA. APL cells showed a low proliferating activity when induced by ATRA alone. In contrast, cells induced by G-CSF or GM-CSF alone showed increased DNA syntheses, the levels of which were not significantly affected by the combination of ATRA with CSFs. Interestingly, G-CSF or GM-CSF potentiated the capability of ATRA-induced cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), while G-CSF or GM-CSF alone induced no NBT reduction. Furthermore, in several patients examined, APL cells induced by ATRA with G-CSF showed an increased activity of chemotaxis and CD11a expression. These findings suggest that G-CSF or GM-CSF can potentiate differentiation of ATRA-induced APL cells while stimulating their proliferating activity as well, and that G-CSF, rather than GM-CSF, may be a useful adjunct to promote ATRA-induced differentiation of APL.","['Imaizumi, M', 'Sato, A', 'Koizumi, Y', 'Inoue, S', 'Suzuki, H', 'Suwabe, N', 'Yoshinari, M', 'Ichinohasama, R', 'Endo, K', 'Sawai, T']","['Imaizumi M', 'Sato A', 'Koizumi Y', 'Inoue S', 'Suzuki H', 'Suwabe N', 'Yoshinari M', 'Ichinohasama R', 'Endo K', 'Sawai T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Aug;8(8):1301-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific intracellular functions performed by p210 bcr-abl have recently been delineated. We considered the possibility that p210 bcr-abl may also regulate the abundance of inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) which is a rate-limiting enzyme for de novo guanylate synthesis. We performed studies of the inhibition of IMPDH by tiazofurin, which acts as a competitive inhibitor through its active species that mimics nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), i.e. thiazole-4-carboxamide adenine dinucleotide (TAD). The mean inhibitory concentration (IC50) of tiazofurin for cellular proliferation inhibition was 2.3-2.8-fold greater in cells expressing p210 bcr-abl than in their corresponding parent cells proliferating under the influence of growth factors or in growth factor-independent derivative cells not expressing detectable p210 bcr-abl. IMPDH activity was 1.5-2.3-fold greater within cells expressing p210 bcr-abl than in their parent cells. This increase in enzyme activity was a result of 2-fold increased IMPDH protein as determined by immunoblotting. In addition, an increase in the Km value for NAD utilization by IMPDH was observed in p210 bcr-abl transformed cells, but this increase was within the range of resident NAD concentrations observed in the cells. Increased IMPDH protein in p210 bcr-abl transformed cells was traced to an increased level of IMP dehydrogenase II messenger RNA. Thus, regulation of IMPDH gene expression is mediated at least in part by the bcr-abl gene product and may therefore be indicative of a specific mechanism of intrinsic resistance to tiazofurin.","['Gharehbaghi, K', 'Burgess, G S', 'Collart, F R', 'Litz-Jackson, S', 'Huberman, E', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Boswell, H S']","['Gharehbaghi K', 'Burgess GS', 'Collart FR', 'Litz-Jackson S', 'Huberman E', 'Jayaram HN', 'Boswell HS']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Poly A/analysis/biosynthesis', 'RNA/analysis/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Aug;8(8):1257-63.,,,,['CA 51770/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['abl', 'bcr']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the B6-derived Db mutant B6.CH-2bm13 (bm13) strain, part of the class I Db antigen-presenting groove is shaped by a class I Kb-encoded sequence. Like B6 mice, bm13 mice reject Moloney virus-induced tumors, but the protective CTL response is Kb restricted. In this study we show enhanced levels of Moloney MuLV-specific CTLp with a restriction for Kb in bm13 mice. Through the use of CTL clones from Moloney virus-immunized bm13 mice, the class I Kb-presented CTL epitope was identified. The epitope is located in the Moloney virus gp70 envelope protein region (Moloney envelope, amino acids 189 to 196 [Mol env (189-196)]), SSWDFITV and has the Kb allele-specific binding motif. The Dbm13 molecule does not present the env(189 to 196) epitope to Kb-restricted bm13 CTL. In B6 mice, Mol env(189-196)-specific CTL could be induced by peptide vaccination. B6 mice thus have CTL precursors specific for this epitope but at considerably lower levels than do bm13 mice. We hypothesize that additional positive selection of Kb-restricted CTL on the Dbm13 molecule in bm13 mice explains this difference in precursor frequencies.

The direct sequence analysis of these cells has indicated that they are oligoclonal and cannot, therefore, be responding to the complex mixture of antigens which are present in the lumen. The abundant expression of the CD8 accessory molecule by the IELs, in addition, indicates that these putative intestinal epithelial cell antigens are presented by MHC class I or I-like molecules. The expression of CD8 also suggests that these cells function biologically in part as cytolytic T lymphocytes which is consistent with a variety of functional studies. Taken together with their expression of the CD45RO isoform, these phenotypic and functional observations suggest that iIELs are cytolytic, memory cells which are responsive to an extremely limited number of antigens bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or class I-like molecules. Several non-polymorphic MHC class I-like molecules such as Qa, the thymus leukemia antigen (TL) and CD1 in the mouse and CD1 in human represent important candidate ligands for these oligoclonal iIELs. TL and CD1 are expressed specifically by murine intestinal epithelial cells. In humans, CD1d is constitutively expressed by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, we have isolated iIEL T cell clones which specifically recognize members of the CD1 gene family when expressed on a transfected B cell line that lacks HLA-A and B and have shown that the proliferation of peripheral blood T cells to intestinal epithelial cells is CD1d dependent. Thus, the evidence to date strongly implicate the nonpolymorphic, class Ib molecules as novel restriction elements for unique populations of lymphocytes within the intestinal epithelium.","['Blumberg, R S', 'Balk, S P']","['Blumberg RS', 'Balk SP']","[""Gastroenterology Division, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int Rev Immunol,International reviews of immunology,8712260,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD1', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'Epithelium', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Rev Immunol. 1994;11(1):15-30. doi: 10.3109/08830189409061714.,['10.3109/08830189409061714 [doi]'],,,,,,,94,,,,,,,,,,

Mutagenicity and carcinogenicity of topoisomerase-interactive agents.,109-42,"Drugs that interact with DNA topoisomerases I and II hold great promise for the treatment of cancer, however, like many other anti-cancer agents, they are a double-edged sword and may themselves cause mutation and cancer. In vitro studies show that clinically effective agents, such as etoposide, doxorubicin and others, stabilize a ternary complex where topoisomerase II is covalently linked to DNA. This complex represents an intermediate in the topoisomerase-II catalyzed DNA supercoil relaxation reaction. Camptothecin and its analogues stabilize a similar ternary complex, in vitro, consisting of topoisomerase I covalently linked to DNA at single-strand breaks. Short-term tests of genotoxicity confirm that topoisomerase-interactive agents are mutagenic and suggest common mechanisms by which they induce mutation and selectively kill tumor cells. These agents induce sister-chromatid exchange, chromosomal aberrations and mutations in specific mammalian genes. Their propensity to induce small colonies in the L5178/TK+/(-)-3.7.2C assay implies that topoisomerase-interactive agents induce large DNA rearrangements and deletions. These may result from topoisomerase-subunit exchange at drug-stabilized ternary complexes or from attempts by the cell to bypass the replication block caused by stabilized ternary complexes. Studies in bacterial mutation assays suggest that topoisomerase-interactive agents may also induce mutations, albeit at a lower rate, through simple DNA intercalation or via generation of oxygen free radicals. Second malignancies observed in patients previously treated with topoisomerase II interactive agents suggest these may be an important clinical consequence of their capacity to induce mutation. In particular, a unique form of acute myelogenous leukemia is observed at strikingly high frequencies after treatment with relatively high doses of the epipodophyllotoxins etoposide and teniposide. This form of AML has been reported after the uses of other classes of topoisomerase-interactive agents as well. Cancer induction is therefore a toxic consequence predicted by short-term tests of genotoxicity and should be weighed against the potential therapeutic benefits of topoisomerase-interactive agents.","['Anderson, R D', 'Berger, N A']","['Anderson RD', 'Berger NA']",['Ireland Cancer Center.'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Carcinogens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1994 Aug 1;309(1):109-42. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(94)90048-5.,"['0027-5107(94)90048-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(94)90048-5 [doi]']",,,['P30 CA43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,212,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between the four epitopes and the binding sites of high and low affinity IgE receptors (Fc epsilon RI and Fc epsilon RII, respectively) was studied using a monovalent Fab fragment of each mAb as a binding inhibitor. The IgE-Fc epsilon RII binding was clearly inhibited by the mAb recognizing the C epsilon 2/C epsilon 3 junction, suggesting that Fc epsilon RII binds to a rather limited area around the C epsilon 2/C epsilon 3 junction. The IgE-Fc epsilon RI binding, on the other hand, was scarcely inhibited by any single mAb. However, the binding was inhibited when the epitope in C epsilon 2 was blocked simultaneously with that at the C epsilon 2/C epsilon 3 junction or with that in C epsilon 3, indicating that these three distinct epitopes are related to the Fc epsilon RI binding sites. When these three epitopes were shown in the stereograph of human IgE, the Fc epsilon RI binding area was spread largely on the groove side between C epsilon 2 and C epsilon 3 domains. These results suggest that Fc epsilon RI acquires the high affinity through multiple bindings.","['Takemoto, H', 'Nishimura, S', 'Kosada, Y', 'Hata, S', 'Takagi, S', 'Hosoi, S', 'Ezumi, K', 'Ide, M', 'Harada, S']","['Takemoto H', 'Nishimura S', 'Kosada Y', 'Hata S', 'Takagi S', 'Hosoi S', 'Ezumi K', 'Ide M', 'Harada S']","['Shionogi Research Laboratories, Medical Science, Shionogi and Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/chemistry/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloma Proteins/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Receptors, IgE/classification/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1994;38(1):63-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1994.tb01745.x.,['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1994.tb01745.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several genetic loci of the host have been identified that affect erythroleukemia development, differentiation status of target cells and virus replication. Since age may change expression of these loci, age may affect FV disease. To explore this possibility, FV expression in four genetically diverse strains of mice of different ages was examined. Extent of viral replication and of disease were evaluated by measuring spleen focus forming units (SFFU), spleen weight and reverse transcriptase (RT) activity in target organs. Young DBA/2 and (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 mice exhibited a greater level of virus expression than their aged counterparts in all parameters investigated. Young CBA/Ca mice had slightly higher spleen weights and SFFU values than aged CBA/Ca mice, but a definitive age-related change was not observed in the RT activity of the target organs. C57BL/6 mice, which are genetically resistant to the development of FV-induced erythroleukemia, exhibited a limited degree of virus replication that was not effected by the age of the animal. Our results indicate that the age of the mouse, as well as the genetic background, can contribute to the level of susceptibility to FV.","['Stewart, D R', 'Kirschmann, D A', 'Blank, K J', 'Murasko, D M']","['Stewart DR', 'Kirschmann DA', 'Blank KJ', 'Murasko DM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical College of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19129.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Mech Ageing Dev,Mechanisms of ageing and development,0347227,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,"['Aging/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/pathology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mech Ageing Dev. 1994 Feb;73(2):145-55. doi: 10.1016/0047-6374(94)90063-9.,"['0047-6374(94)90063-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0047-6374(94)90063-9 [doi]']",,,"['AG08659/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG10905/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Groups of 10 SCID mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 2 x 10(6) human T-ALL HSB-2 cells followed seven days later by i.v. injection with either a single dose or with 3 doses of HB2-SPDP-Sap or HB2-SMPT-Sap given on alternate days. Control groups received equivalent sham injections of PBS or molar equivalent amounts of unconjugated HB2 antibody+saporin. Animals receiving a single dose of HB2-SMPT-Sap showed better survival than animals receiving a single dose of HB2-SPDP-Sap but the difference was not shown to be significant by log-rank analysis. When given as a triple dose both immunotoxins performed similarly. Comparison of single-dose with triple-dose IT therapy revealed that the therapeutic effect of a triple dose of HB2-SPDP-Sap was significantly better than that of single dose, but this was not the case with HB2-SMPT-Sap. Pharmacokinetic studies of HB2-SPDP-Sap and HB2-SMPT-Sap in normal and HSB-2 leukaemia bearing SCID mice failed to reveal any difference in clearance rates for these two IT's.

The importance of CAMs for normal lymphocyte growth and differentiation is underscored by the association between neoplastic disease states and abnormal CAM expression. In the present study we analysed the cell surface expression of several CAMs on peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type (B-CLL) (n = 21) and stable monoclonal B-lymphocytosis of undetermined significance (B-MLUS) (n = 20). The CAM expression was analysed on the B-cell clone and on normal T- and NK-cell populations separately using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). A phorbol ester-induced lymphocyte aggregation assay and blocking MAbs were also used. The B-cell clone in B-CLL expressed ICAM-1 (CD54) more frequently and at a higher density than in B-MLUS. The brightest CD54 expression was noted in patients with prominent lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly. The beta 2 integrin CD11a (Leu-CAMa, LFA-1) was detected on some B-cell clones and seemed to relate to tissue localization of the disease. T and NK cells showed a low expression of CD11a in B-CLL patients, while in B-MLUS a high proportion of non-clonal cells coexpressed CD11a with a high staining intensity. The relative numbers of both CD18+ as well as CD2+ cells showed a positive correlation with phorbol ester induced cell aggregation in B-MLUS patients (p < 0.05). The aggregation was blocked by adding MAbs against CD18 in most cases but to a greater extent in B-CLL. These results extend and corroborate our earlier findings on surface phenotypic characteristics of clonal and non-clonal lymphocytes in different clinical subtypes of B-CLL. CAM expression on the monoclonal lymphocytes may play a role in their interaction with regulatory immune cells and their tissue localization.","['Kimby, E', 'Rincon, J', 'Patarroyo, M', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Kimby E', 'Rincon J', 'Patarroyo M', 'Mellstedt H']","['Department of Medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD11 Antigens', 'CD18 Antigens', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Apr;13(3-4):297-306. doi: 10.3109/10428199409056294.,['10.3109/10428199409056294 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of CPE-C and DAC produced an additive effect on the growth inhibition of the cells following a treatment of 48-96 h. Cytotoxicity experiments measured by the cloning of cells in soft agar following 24 and 48 h exposures produced a more than additive effect when the drugs were used in combination. Evaluation of the effect of CPE-C and DAC on the induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells following a 48 h treatment revealed that the combination of the drugs produced a more than additive effect than when the drugs were used alone. Measurement of the intracellular pool of deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) showed that a 6 h exposure to 0.05 and 0.1 microM of CPE-C reduced the pool by 60 and 88%, respectively. The decrease in the dCTP pool was correlated with a higher incorporation of radioactive DAC into DNA.

We report here that CPE-C is a very poor substrate for cytidine deaminase as compared with cytidine.

A feature of this adhesion receptor is to be shed from the cell surface. We report here the presence of high levels of the shed form of L-selectin (sL-selectin) in plasma from patients with acute leukemia. We also show that sL-selectin purified from acute leukemia plasma exhibits functional activity. The mean (+/- 1 SD) plasma level of sL-selectin among 100 healthy individuals was 2.1 +/- 0.7 micrograms/mL. This value was increased (> 2 SD above the mean) in 63% of 58 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 59% of 93 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia ([AML] P < .001). Repeated measurements in 24 patients showed normal-range levels in 16 of 16 patients in complete remission and high levels in eight of eight patients with therapy-resistant acute leukemia or leukemia relapse. Furthermore, elevated sL-selectin levels were detected in cerebrospinal fluid of three patients with ALL suffering from a relapse limited to the central nervous system. Epitope mapping with monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that L-selectin shedding from leukemic blasts was accompanied by conformational changes of its epidermal growth factor-like domain. A functional role for sL-selectin purified from leukemic plasma was supported by its ability to completely inhibit L-selectin-dependent adhesion of blast cells to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated endothelium in vitro. These results suggest that sL-selectin may have an important role in the regulation of leukemic cell adhesion to endothelium. In addition, monitoring of the sL-selectin level may be useful for evaluating leukemia activity, in particular for the detection of leukemia relapse.","['Spertini, O', 'Callegari, P', 'Cordey, A S', 'Hauert, J', 'Joggi, J', 'von Fliedner, V', 'Schapira, M']","['Spertini O', 'Callegari P', 'Cordey AS', 'Hauert J', 'Joggi J', 'von Fliedner V', 'Schapira M']","['Division of Hematology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '126880-86-2 (L-Selectin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*blood', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'L-Selectin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values', 'Umbilical Veins']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Aug 15;84(4):1249-56.,['S0006-4971(20)78724-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic blasts from 17 untreated T-ALL patients were assayed for their ability to acquire mature T-cell markers, CD3/T-cell receptor (TCR) in particular, after incubation with one or a combination of recombinant human interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and CD2-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb). IL-7 or IL-2 induced the proliferation of some leukemic cells, whereas sequential cell treatment with CD2-MoAb and then IL-2 promoted CD3/TCR expression on nearly all CD2+ cells (15 of 16), except for 1 T-ALL that developed into CD3-CD16+CD56+ cells. Differentiation of T-ALL cells was also evidenced through the downregulation of CD34 precursor cell antigen, the generation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells from CD4+ CD8+ precursors, and the acquisition of mature T-cell functions. CD2 ligation induced a progressive increase of surface expression of IL-2 receptor alpha (IL-2R alpha) and IL-2R beta and an accelerated in vitro death of leukemic cells. The ligation of IL-2R by IL-2 rescued T-ALL cells from death and promoted their progression toward more mature cells expressing extracellular CD3/TCR alpha beta complexes. Intracellular analysis indicates that TCR alpha transcription and membrane translocation of both TCR alpha and TCR beta were promoted in these conditions. Analysis of intracellular signals transduced during T-ALL differentiation indicated that CD2-ligation induced Ca2+ influx and that the ligation of CD2 and IL-2R induced distinct tyrosine phosphorylation patterns. The addition of inhibitors of tyrosine phosphorylation abolished T-ALL cell differentiation, which suggests the involvement of tyrosine kinases in this phenomenon. Together, we showed the constant maturation of leukemic early T cells after stimulation of surface CD2 and the high-affinity IL-2R.","['Mentz, F', 'Ouaaz, F', 'Michel, A', 'Blanc, C', 'Herve, P', 'Bismuth, G', 'Debre, P', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Mossalayi, M D']","['Mentz F', 'Ouaaz F', 'Michel A', 'Blanc C', 'Herve P', 'Bismuth G', 'Debre P', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Mossalayi MD']","['Molecular Immuno-Hematology Group, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Aug 15;84(4):1182-92.,['S0006-4971(20)78714-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A majority of cells had a blast morphology with the phenotype of a myeloid hematopoietic progenitor, ie, CD34+, CD33+, CD13+, HLA-DR+, but CD38-, and the remaining cells (5% to 10%) expressed platelet restricted proteins such as CD41, CD42, CD36, CD61, and von Willebrand factor; some of them were polyploid (up to 32N) and exhibited demarcation membranes and alpha granules. No erythroid or other lineage-specific markers were detected. Proliferation of ELF-153 cells was highly stimulated by interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and to a lesser extent by stem cell factor and IL-6. In contrast, the cell line did not respond to erythropoietin, leukemia inhibitory factor, IL-7, IL-11, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor. ELF-153 cells could be separated by flow cytometry into three discrete cell populations (CD34+/CD61-, CD34+/CD61+, and CD34-/CD61+) with different proliferative and endomitotic properties corresponding to distinct stages of the mega karyocyte (MK) differentiation. This MK differentiation, which involved a minority of ELF-153, could be increased in the presence of 5-azacytidine and phorbol ester, but could not be significantly modified by growth factors. By contrast, cytochalasin B dramatically induced polyploidization without differentiation. It is noteworthy that association of 5-azacytidine to cytochalasin B dramatically induced the production of polyploid MK cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this MK differentiation, the expression of GATA-1 and GATA-2 was investigated in subpopulations of ELF-153. A high level of GATA-1 and GATA-2 mRNA was only present in the CD61+ cells. Therefore, these two transactivating factors may play an important role in the MK differentiation of ELF-153. We conclude that ELF-153 might be an important tool to investigate the mechanisms by which transcription factors control differentiation of MK progenitors.","['Mouthon, M A', 'Freund, M', 'Titeux, M', 'Katz, A', 'Guichard, J', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Mouthon MA', 'Freund M', 'Titeux M', 'Katz A', 'Guichard J', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W']","['INSERM U362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Aug 15;84(4):1085-97.,['S0006-4971(20)78703-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blot hybridization analyses demonstrated that GATA-1 and GATA-2 mRNAs are expressed abundantly in a set of cell lines established from human myelogenous leukemia cells, but the expression pattern of each factor is distinct. GATA-2 mRNA is expressed in all cell lines tested that express erythroid markers, and, in addition, the mRNA is also expressed in three CD34+ cell lines and two early myeloid cell lines. In contrast, the expression of GATA-1 mRNA showed tight correlation to that of the erythroid/megakaryocytic lineage markers. We also found that the GATA-2 probe identifies two types of mRNA. Structural analysis of genomic DNA clones encoding human GATA-2 coupled with RNA blot analysis demonstrated that there exists an alternative use of polyadenylation consensus sequences in a single exon and this causes the molecular heterogeneity among GATA-2 mRNAs. Through immunochemical and immunohistochemical analyses using anti-GATA-1- and anti-GATA-2-specific antibodies, GATA-2 protein was clearly shown to be present in the nuclei of leukemia-derived early myeloid and CD34+ cell lines, whereas both GATA-1 and GATA-2 proteins are expressed in erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines. Thus, the expression profile of GATA-2 is consistent with the hypothesis that GATA-2 plays unique roles for the transcriptional activation of genes in cells at an early stage of hematopoietic differentiation and in developing cells of the erythroid and myeloid lineages.","['Nagai, T', 'Harigae, H', 'Ishihara, H', 'Motohashi, H', 'Minegishi, N', 'Tsuchiya, S', 'Hayashi, N', 'Gu, L', 'Andres, B', 'Engel, J D']","['Nagai T', 'Harigae H', 'Ishihara H', 'Motohashi H', 'Minegishi N', 'Tsuchiya S', 'Hayashi N', 'Gu L', 'Andres B', 'Engel JD', 'et al.']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Exons', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Aug 15;84(4):1074-84.,['S0006-4971(20)78702-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor expression, tyrosine phosphorylation, functional activity, and c-fos gene expression were measured. Functional GM-CSF receptors were present throughout differentiation as both uninduced and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced HL-60 cells responded to GM-CSF, albeit in different ways. Uninduced promyelocytes proliferated in response to GM-CSF, whereas DMSO-induced cells lost the capacity to proliferate but did respond with increased expression of beta 2-integrins, enhanced respiratory burst activity, and metabolism of arachidonic acid. GM-CSF-stimulated upregulation of c-fos mRNA expression was not detected in immature cells but developed after 2 to 4 days with DMSO in line with a marked increase in responsiveness to stimulation with phorbol ester, showing that increased expression of c-fos is predominantly a feature of mature phagocytes. GM-CSF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a broadly similar range of proteins in both uninduced and DMSO-treated HL-60 cells, but protein bands were more heavily phosphorylated in DMSO-induced cells. Phosphorylation was rapid in onset and very transient in immature cells. Phosphorylation of several proteins, in particular a 130-kD band, was more sustained in DMSO-induced cells. These differences in signaling were not because of numerical differences in receptors, because reduction of GM-CSF concentration to trigger equivalent numbers of high-affinity receptors delayed the onset of phosphorylation in DMSO-induced cells. We conclude that there are maturation-related changes in signaling downstream from the GM-CSF receptor.","['Roberts, P J', 'Khwaja, A', 'Lie, A K', 'Bybee, A', 'Yong, K', 'Thomas, N S', 'Linch, D C']","['Roberts PJ', 'Khwaja A', 'Lie AK', 'Bybee A', 'Yong K', 'Thomas NS', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, fos', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Aug 15;84(4):1064-73.,['S0006-4971(20)78701-X [pii]'],,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,['c-fos'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to investigate 1) whether children with malignancies have elevated IGFBP-2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum, and 2) whether IGFBP-2 levels in these biological fluids could be useful markers for the diagnosis and follow-up of certain tumor types. We, therefore, measured IGFBP-2 levels in the CSF and serum of children with malignancies by Western ligand blot analysis; RIA with alpha IGFBP-2, a polyclonal antibody for human IGFBP-2; and immunoprecipitation with alpha IGFBP-2 and alpha Hec-1a, a polyclonal antibody that recognizes IGFBP-2 and -3. Furthermore, the expression of IGFBP-2 messenger ribonucleic acid in tumor tissue from three central nervous system (CNS) tumor patients was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. We examined CSF from 21 children with malignant CNS tumors, 25 patients with acute leukemia, and 4 patients with peripheral solid tumors and compared the IGFBP-2 levels with those in CSF from 21 patients who received a lumbar puncture to exclude meningitis. Serum was obtained from 7 patients with solid tumor, 12 patients with malignant CNS tumor, and 16 patients with acute leukemia. The serum IGFBP-2 levels were compared to serum levels in 5 patients with sarcoma who had reached complete remission and 13 normal control children. CSF and serum were collected at the same time, before initiation of therapy. Patients with malignant CNS tumors showed elevated IGFBP-2 levels in CSF (P < 0.001), whereas patients with solid peripheral tumor or acute leukemia had normal IGFBP-2 levels in CSF. CNS tumor patients with microscopically detectable malignant cells in the CSF had the highest CSF IGFBP-2 levels. Serum IGFBP-2 levels were increased in patients with solid peripheral tumors (P < 0.05), whereas patients in complete remission had normal serum IGFBP-2 levels. In summary, IGFBP-2 was elevated specifically in CSF from patients with CNS tumor, whereas IGFBP-2 serum levels were elevated in children with various peripheral tumors. We conclude that IGFBP-2 in CSF could be a specific marker for malignant CNS tumors. We detected high IGFBP-2 messenger ribonucleic acid expression in 1 of 3 CNS tumor tissues analyzed.","['Muller, H L', 'Oh, Y', 'Lehrnbecher, T', 'Blum, W F', 'Rosenfeld, R G']","['Muller HL', 'Oh Y', 'Lehrnbecher T', 'Blum WF', 'Rosenfeld RG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood/*cerebrospinal fluid/genetics', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Meningitis/cerebrospinal fluid', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1994 Aug;79(2):428-34. doi: 10.1210/jcem.79.2.7519190.,['10.1210/jcem.79.2.7519190 [doi]'],,,['HD-28703/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this present study, these factors were shown to specifically and differentially regulate levels of both muscarinic (subtypes m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5) and substance P receptor (SPR) mRNAs in sympathetic neurons of the rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) using solution hybridization/RNase protection analysis. In vivo, neonatal rat SCG expressed predominantly m2 (10.31 +/- 0.43 pg mRNA/micrograms total RNA) and some m1 (1.54 +/- 0.84 pg/microgram) muscarinic receptor mRNA, which increased developmentally to adult levels (m2 mRNA levels being 60% higher than those in neonates). By contrast, m3, m4, and m5 subtype mRNAs were much less abundant at all time points measured. A similar developmental regulation was found in dissociated SCG neurons in vitro. After 16 days in culture, m2 mRNA increased 334% to 15.76 +/- 0.68 pg/microgram, while m1 mRNA changed little (2.03 +/- 1.00 pg/microgram). However, LIF or CNTF treatment (5 ng/ml, 14 days) in sister cultures completely blocked this developmental increase. Further, LIF treatment blocked the normal muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in intracellular calcium (fura-2 imaging), indicating a functional change in receptor phenotype. By contrast, levels of SPR mRNA, which were low in untreated cultures (0.037 +/- 0.025 pg SPR mRNA/microgram total RNA), were elevated by LIF or CNTF treatment, to 0.866 +/- 0.034 pg/microgram and 0.662 +/- 0.148 pg/microgram, respectively. These observations indicate that muscarinic and SPR receptor expression are differentially regulated by the same factors in SCG neurons and that neuronal choice of receptor phenotype may be, at least in part, specifically regulated by cytokines/growth factors in the cellular milieu.","['Ludlam, W H', 'Zang, Z', 'McCarson, K E', 'Krause, J E', 'Spray, D C', 'Kessler, J A']","['Ludlam WH', 'Zang Z', 'McCarson KE', 'Krause JE', 'Spray DC', 'Kessler JA']","['Department of Neurology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*physiology', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Substance P/metabolism', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1994 Aug;164(2):528-39. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1994.1221.,"['S0012-1606(84)71221-8 [pii]', '10.1006/dbio.1994.1221 [doi]']",,,"['NS 20013/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 20778/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 21937/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTPR9 cells treated with Zn2+ hence exhibit levels of PML-RAR alpha protein as high as fresh acute promyelocytic leukemia blasts. In the absence of Zn2+, i.e., upon low level PML/RAR alpha expression, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3) and particularly D3 plus transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) induced terminal differentiation of MTPR9 cells (as observed in ""wild-type"" U937 cells), on the basis of morphology, membrane antigen pattern, and functional criteria. Conversely, in the presence of Zn2+, D3 and D3 plus TGF-beta 1 failed to induce terminal differentiation, as evaluated by the above parameters. Interestingly, retinoic acid (RA) treatment suppresses the differentiation blockade induced by high level PML-RAR alpha protein; indeed, Zn(2+)-treated MTPR9 cells incubated with RA plus D3 exhibited significant terminal monocytic maturation, comparable to that of cells treated with D3 alone or combined with RA in absence of Zn2+. Similar observations were made in NB4, a PML-RAR+ human acute leukemic line. As expected RA treatment of NB4 cells causes granulocytic differentiation. Interestingly, the cell line is only scarcely induced to mature monocytic cells by D3 or D3 plus TGF-beta 1 treatment, whereas it is effectively induced to monocytic maturation by combined treatment with D3 and RA. Accordingly, the rate of NB4 cell proliferation is only slightly affected by D3 or D3 plus TGF-beta 1 treatment, mildly inhibited by RA, and markedly decreased by D3 plus RA. These results indicate that in both U937 and NB4 cells high level PML/RAR alpha expression inhibits the monocytic terminal differentiation program triggered by D3 or D3 plus TGF-beta 1, whereas RA treatment effectively antagonizes this inhibitory PML-RAR alpha action and restores the D3 differentiative effect.","['Testa, U', 'Grignani, F', 'Barberi, T', 'Fagioli, M', 'Masciulli, R', 'Ferrucci, P F', 'Seripa, D', 'Camagna, A', 'Alcalay, M', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Testa U', 'Grignani F', 'Barberi T', 'Fagioli M', 'Masciulli R', 'Ferrucci PF', 'Seripa D', 'Camagna A', 'Alcalay M', 'Pelicci PG', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Lipopolysaccharides/metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1994/08/15 00:00,1994/08/15 00:01,['1994/08/15 00:00'],"['1994/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Aug 15;54(16):4508-15.,,,,,,['PML/RAR&agr;'],,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a similar pattern of expression for murine CD34 (mCD34) has not yet been determined. Two polyclonal anti-mCD34 antibodies that specifically recognize both endogenous and recombinant murine CD34 were developed to characterize the mCD34 protein and to determine its pattern of expression on murine cell lines and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis showed that mCD34 is expressed on NIH/3T3 embryonic fibroblasts, PA6 stromal cells, embryonic stem cells, M1 leukemia cells, and a subpopulation of normal bone marrow cells. Murine CD34 was found to be a glycoprotein expressed on the cell surface as either a full-length (approximately 100 kD) or truncated (approximately 90 kD) protein in NIH/3T3 and PA6 cells. Recombinant full-length CD34, when expressed in the CHO-K1 cell line, had a molecular weight of approximately 105 kD. Full-length CD34 expressed on M1 leukemia cells, had a higher apparent molecular weight (110 kD). These results suggest that there are glycosylation differences between CD34 expressed by different cell types. The full-length form, but not the truncated form, is a phosphoprotein that is hyperphosphorylated in response to 12-0-Tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate treatment, suggesting potential functional differences between the two forms.

A PML-RARA fusion message transcribed from the der(15) is thought to mediate leukemogenesis. Two APL patients with simple variants of this translocation, t(3;15)(q21;q22) and t(X;15)(p11;q22), have previously been reported who lack cytogenetic involvement of chromosome 17, although their breakpoint positions on chromosome 15 still suggest the involvement of the PML gene. Here we report on a combined analysis by molecular genetics and in situ hybridization of these two patients, in which we wanted to determine whether the PML gene has alternative fusion partners or whether cryptic rearrangement of the RARA locus has occurred instead.

At these subcytotoxic concentrations mAMSA induced the cells to accumulate at the G2 phase of the cycle, while cycle inhibition provoked by ABP was not phase specific. In addition, mAMSA caused an increase in the cell mass while ABP provoked cell shrinkage. This was consistent with the fact that ABP considerably inhibited protein synthesis, while mAMSA did not significantly affect this activity. SDS/K+DNA precipitation assays indicated that mAMSA, but not ABP, stimulated protein-DNA covalent complex formation. Finally, it was found that mAMSA, but not ABP, elicited the expression of differentiation markers, namely nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, activation of vimentin and leukocyte integrin (CD11b/CD18 and CD11c/CD18) expression, and downregulation of c-myc expression. The DNA intercalators doxorubicin and mitoxantrone, which like mAMSA induced the cells to accumulate at the G2 phase and increased the cell mass, induced the expression of differentiation markers. In contrast, the intercalators aclarubicin and caffeine and the non-intercalator novobiocin, which produced minor alterations on cell-cycle distribution and caused cell shrinkage, did not significantly elicit differentiation. These results support the conclusion that differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells by cytostatic drugs depends on the perturbations of the cell cycle, leading to disproportionate increases in cell mass.","['Perez, C', 'Campayo, L', 'Navarro, P', 'Garcia-Bermejo, L', 'Aller, P']","['Perez C', 'Campayo L', 'Navarro P', 'Garcia-Bermejo L', 'Aller P']","['Instituto de Quimica Medica, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '133825-72-6 (1,4-bis(butylamino)benzo(g)phthalazine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Phthalazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/05 00:00,1994/07/05 00:01,['1994/07/05 00:00'],"['1994/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Jul 5;48(1):75-82. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90225-9.,"['0006-2952(94)90225-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90225-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that interferon-alpha may restore normal adhesive interactions between CML progenitors and the bone marrow microenvironment and restore normal growth regulatory effects resulting from these progenitor-stroma interactions. We demonstrate that treatment with interferon-alpha induces a significant, dose-dependent increase in the adhesion of primitive long-term culture initiating cells and committed colony-forming cells (CFC) from CML bone marrow to normal stroma. Adhesion of CFC seen after interferon-alpha treatment could be inhibited by blocking antibodies directed at the alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 1 integrins and vascular cell adhesion molecule, but not CD44 or intracellular adhesion molecule, suggesting that interferon-alpha induces normalization of progenitor-stroma interactions in CML. Because FACS analysis showed that the level of alpha 4, alpha 5, and beta 1 integrin expression after interferon-alpha treatment is unchanged, this suggests that interferon-alpha may restore normal beta 1 integrin function. Normalization of interactions between CML progenitors and the bone marrow microenvironment may then result in the restoration of normal regulation of CML progenitor proliferation, and explain, at least in part, the therapeutic efficacy of interferon-alpha in CML.","['Bhatia, R', 'Wayner, E A', 'McGlave, P B', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Bhatia R', 'Wayner EA', 'McGlave PB', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Stromal Cells/physiology']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1994 Jul;94(1):384-91. doi: 10.1172/JCI117333.,['10.1172/JCI117333 [doi]'],,['J Clin Invest. 1994 Jul;94(1):3.

In the last decade, these properties have prompted several investigations of the effect of IFNs on various haematological malignancies. IFNs-alpha have been used most extensively. The response rate is dependent on the type of the disease. The most striking effects have been observed in hairy cell leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia. In both these malignancies the results are well consolidated and indicate that IFNs-alpha have modified the natural history of the disease. Results of IFN therapy in low grade lymphoma, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma suggest a beneficial role of IFNs-alpha in the induction, as well as the maintenance, phase. The efficacy of IFNs is now widely confirmed in treating patients with essential thrombocythaemia or polycythaemia vera.

However, the leukemic death of the mice was completely suppressed by the subcutaneous injections of rhG-CSF. In order to clarify the mechanism of the suppression, effects of rhG-CSF on C2M-A5 cells were studied in vitro. While C2M-A5 cells grew exponentially in the absence of rhG-CSF, the viability, the growth, and the self-renewal capacity of C2M-A5 cells were all suppressed in cultures in the presence of rhG-CSF. Preincubation with rhG-CSF for 48 h deprived C2M-A5 cells of the ability to induce leukemia in syngeneic mice. Morphological examination revealed the appearance of apoptotic changes of C2M-A5 cells in cultures containing rhG-CSF over the 2-day incubation period. In gel electrophoresis, the DNA from C2M-A5 cells incubated with rhG-CSF for 48 h showed a ladder of degradated DNA bands compatible with apoptosis. From these results, we concluded that the apoptosis of C2M-A5 cells played a key role in the antileukemic effect of rhG-CSF.","['Bessho, M', 'Yoshida, S', 'Sakate, K', 'Murohashi, I', 'Jinnai, I', 'Hirashima, K']","['Bessho M', 'Yoshida S', 'Sakate K', 'Murohashi I', 'Jinnai I', 'Hirashima K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Iruma-gun, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CHO Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jul;8(7):1185-90.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inbred mouse strains contain many endogenous sequences which are homologous to the polytropic env genes; however, the extent to which particular sequences participate in the generation of the recombinants is unknown. Previous studies have established antigenic heterogeneity among the env genes of polytropic MuLVs, which may reflect recombination with distinct endogenous genes. In the present study, we have examined many polytropic MuLVs and found that nearly all isolates fall into two mutually exclusive antigenic subclasses on the basis of the ability of their SU proteins to react with one of two monoclonal antibodies, termed Hy 7 and MAb 516. Epitope-mapping studies revealed that reactivity to the two antibodies is dependent on the identity of a single amino acid residue encoded in a variable region of the receptor-binding domain of the env gene. This indicated that the two antigenic subclasses of MuLVs arose by recombination with distinct sets of endogenous genes. Evaluation of polytropic MuLVs in mice revealed distinctly different ratios of the two subclasses after inoculation of different ecotropic MuLVs, suggesting that individual ecotropic MuLVs preferentially recombine with distinct sets of endogenous polytropic env genes.","['Lavignon, M', 'Walker, J L', 'Perryman, S M', 'Malik, F G', 'Khan, A S', 'Theodore, T S', 'Evans, L H']","['Lavignon M', 'Walker JL', 'Perryman SM', 'Malik FG', 'Khan AS', 'Theodore TS', 'Evans LH']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/classification/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Retroviridae Infections/*microbiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Aug;68(8):5194-203. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.8.5194-5203.1994.,['10.1128/JVI.68.8.5194-5203.1994 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/S71538'],,,,PMC236463,,,,,,,,,

It was shown earlier that these differences could not be mapped to the U3 region of the virus long terminal repeat, indicating the probable influence of structural genes and/or R-U5 sequences. In this study, reciprocal chimeras containing exchanged structural genes and R-U5 sequences from these two closely related viruses were analyzed for differences in ability to induce disease. Results showed that two regions of F-MuLV, psi-gag-PR and env, when substituted for those of M-MuLV were dramatically disease attenuating. The 5'-most region, which is widely distributed, overlaps with the 5' end of the env intron and includes the RNA packaging region, psi, the entire gag coding region, and the viral protease coding region (PR) of pol. It was also found that reciprocal constructs having substitutions of both of these regions of M-MuLV in an F-MuLV background allowed full reestablishment of promonocytic leukemia. These leukemias were positive for c-myb rearrangements which are characteristic of M-MuLV-induced promonocytic leukemias. Neither region alone, however, was sufficient to produce disease with a greater incidence than 13%. Further studies demonstrated that the inability of viruses with psi, gag, PR, or env sequences from F-MuLV to induce leukemia in this model system was not due to their inability to replicate in hematopoietic tissue, to integrate into the c-myb locus early on after infection in vivo, or to express gag-myb mRNA characteristic of M-MuLV-induced preleukemic cells and acute leukemia.","['Mukhopadhyaya, R', 'Richardson, J', 'Nazarov, V', 'Corbin, A', 'Koller, R', 'Sitbon, M', 'Wolff, L']","['Mukhopadhyaya R', 'Richardson J', 'Nazarov V', 'Corbin A', 'Koller R', 'Sitbon M', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Epitopes', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Precancerous Conditions/microbiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*microbiology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/immunology/*physiology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Aug;68(8):5100-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.8.5100-5107.1994.,['10.1128/JVI.68.8.5100-5107.1994 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/X02794'],"['c-myb', 'env', 'gag']",,,PMC236453,,,,,,,,,

We have used an in vitro model of this last step of reverse transcription to examine the role of the viral enzyme, reverse transcriptase (RT), in displacement synthesis. We show that Moloney murine leukemia virus RT possesses an activity which allows for displacement synthesis through a minimum of 1,334 bp of duplex DNA--an extent much greater than that required during in vivo reverse transcription and over 25-fold greater than has been previously demonstrated for a viral RT. RT does not function as a helicase in the classical sense but appears to closely couple duplex DNA melting with synthesis-driven translocation of the enzyme. In the absence of synthesis, the unwound region created by a primer-positioned RT appears to be no greater than 2 bp and does not advance along the template. Additionally, RT does not utilize ATP or any deoxynucleoside triphosphate not directly encoded by the template strand to catalyze processive duplex unwinding at a nick; nor does binding of the enzyme unwind duplex DNA in the absence of a 3' terminus. The approximate maximum chain elongation rate during strand displacement synthesis by Moloney murine leukemia virus RT falls between 0.73 and 1.5 nucleotides per s at 37 degrees C. The RNase H activity of RT does not appear to play a role in displacement synthesis; however, a 181-amino-acid C-terminal truncation of RT displays a dramatically reduced ability to catalyze synthesis through duplex DNA.","['Whiting, S H', 'Champoux, J J']","['Whiting SH', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Circular/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/ultrastructure', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Aug;68(8):4747-58. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.8.4747-4758.1994.,['10.1128/JVI.68.8.4747-4758.1994 [doi]'],,,"['5T32GM07266/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC236414,,,,,,,,,

Previously it has been shown that a 190-base RNA-DNA hybrid containing the Moloney murine leukemia virus polypurine tract can serve as a substrate for the priming reaction. To investigate the structural requirements for the reaction, a series of DNA oligonucleotides was hybridized to the 190-base single-stranded RNA and tested as substrates for RNase H. At low enzyme concentrations, the sites of cleavage are located 17-23 nucleotides from the 3'-end of the DNA oligonucleotide, consistent with the observations of others that binding of the DNA polymerase at a primer terminus fixes the position of cleavage by RNase H. At higher enzyme concentrations, additional cleavages are observed in the RNA 3' of these sites, but there is no preference for cleavage at the plus strand origin. In contrast to the results with DNA oligonucleotides, hybridization of RNA oligonucleotides containing the polypurine tract to the 190-base single-stranded DNA generates substrates that are cleaved at the origin and efficiently extended into DNA. An RNA oligonucleotide hybridized downstream of the polypurine tract is cleaved but not extended.

This DNA segment is capable of driving low level base-line transcription in undifferentiated K562 cells. It also contains elements which direct the markedly increased expression observed following megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells with phorbol dibutyrate. Analysis of hybrid alpha IIb-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene constructs indicates that at least three regions within the -598 to +32 region control differentiation-dependent alpha IIb transcription. Two enhancer elements as well as a silencer domain all regulate chloramphenicol acetyltransferase transcriptional activity in K562 cells. Gel mobility shift experiments revealed that nuclear binding proteins are able to interact with all three DNA regions. A small region lying between -124 and -99 bases is able to bind to nuclear proteins in undifferentiated cells but not in differentiated cells as evidenced by gel mobility shift and foot-printing studies and corresponds to the silencer element identified in the functional studies. Therefore, the tissue-specific expression of alpha IIb may be controlled transcriptionally by both positive and negative factors with the silencer element playing a major role in regulating differentiation-dependent expression.","['Fong, A M', 'Santoro, S A']","['Fong AM', 'Santoro SA']","['Department of Pathology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jul 15;269(28):18441-7.,['S0021-9258(17)32328-1 [pii]'],,,['F32 HL08686/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/S71136'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of its drawbacks, however, is the development of HU resistance. To study this problem, we developed a HU-resistant human KB cell line which exhibits a 15-fold resistance to HU. The characterization of this HU-resistant phenotype revealed a gene amplification of the M2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RR), increased levels of M2 mRNA and protein, and a 3-fold increase of RR activity. This HU-resistant cell line also expressed a ""collateral sensitivity"" to 6-thioguanine (6-TG), with a 10-fold decrease in the dose inhibiting cell growth by 50% as compared to the KB parental line. The mechanism responsible for this supersensitivity to 6-TG is believed to be related to an increasingly efficient conversion of 6-TG to its triphosphate form, which is subsequently incorporated into DNA. After passage of the resistant cells in the absence of HU, the cell line reverts. The revertant cells lose their resistance to HU and concomitantly their sensitivity to 6-TG. This phenomenon is due to the return of RR to levels comparable to that of the KB parental cell line. These observations and their relevance to cancer chemotherapy will be discussed in this paper. Our results suggest that a clinical protocol could be designed which would allow for a lower dose of 6-TG to be used by taking advantage of the increased RR activity in HU-refractory cancer patients. Two drugs which display collateral sensitivity are known as a ""Ying-Yang"" pair. Alternate treatment with two different Ying-Yang pairs is the rationale for the ""Ying-Yang Ping-Pong"" theory in cancer treatment. This rationale allows for effective cancer chemotherapy with reduced toxicity.","['Yen, Y', 'Grill, S P', 'Dutschman, G E', 'Chang, C N', 'Zhou, B S', 'Cheng, Y C']","['Yen Y', 'Grill SP', 'Dutschman GE', 'Chang CN', 'Zhou BS', 'Cheng YC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*pharmacology', 'KB Cells', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Thioguanine/*pharmacology']",1994/07/15 00:00,1994/07/15 00:01,['1994/07/15 00:00'],"['1994/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jul 15;54(14):3686-91.,,,,['CA 44358/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the appearance of surface CD14 and the acquisition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) responsiveness during maturation of mononuclear phagocytes. Immature THP-1 cells responded poorly to LPS in the absence or presence of serum. Treatment with the maturational agent calcitriol caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in CD14 mRNA and surface CD14 and enhanced the responsiveness of THP-1 cells to smooth and rough form LPS, complexes of LPS and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and LPS in low concentrations of serum. Monoclonal antibodies to CD14 blocked the responses of THP-1 to LPS, LPS-LBP complexes and LPS in serum. Immunodepletion of LBP from serum also inhibited the effect of LPS in serum. The data show that maturation of the response of THP-1 cells to LPS and LPS-LBP complexes depends on the appearance of CD14 on the cell surface. Maturation of the response to LPS in serum depends in large part on the appearance of CD14 on the cell surface and the presence of LBP in serum.","['Martin, T R', 'Mongovin, S M', 'Tobias, P S', 'Mathison, J C', 'Moriarty, A M', 'Leturcq, D J', 'Ulevitch, R J']","['Martin TR', 'Mongovin SM', 'Tobias PS', 'Mathison JC', 'Moriarty AM', 'Leturcq DJ', 'Ulevitch RJ']","['Research Service, Seattle Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis/genetics/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/analysis/pharmacology', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Culture Media/analysis/pharmacology', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endotoxins/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Lipopolysaccharides/analysis/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phagocytes/chemistry/*pathology/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1994 Jul;56(1):1-9. doi: 10.1002/jlb.56.1.1.,['10.1002/jlb.56.1.1 [doi]'],,,"['AI15136/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI29103/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL30542/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the major biologic effects of NKSF/IL-12 have been demonstrated on mature T and NK cells, in which it induces cytokine secretion, increased cytotoxicity, and proliferation, recent evidence in the murine system has suggested that NKSF/IL-12 may play a role in the differentiation of early lymphohematopoietic progenitor cells and thymocytes. In this paper, we have analyzed the effect of human rNKSF/IL-12 on the formation of colonies by highly enriched hematopoietic progenitor cells from human peripheral blood and bone marrow. At concentrations between 1 and 10 ng/ml, NKSF/IL-12 synergizes with a combination of steel factor and IL-3 to induce formation of mixed, erythroid, and myeloid colonies. Therefore, human NKSF/IL-12, like murine NKSF/IL-12, seems to belong to a small group of early acting cytokines, including IL-6, granulocyte-CSF, leukemia-inhibitory factor, and IL-11, which are able to synergize with steel factor and IL-3 to induce proliferation and differentiation of very early hematopoietic progenitor cells. However, in the presence of enriched preparations of NK cells cultured together with the progenitor cells, NKSF/IL-12 inhibits formation of hematopoietic colonies supported by IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage CSF, by inducing production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, two cytokines with synergistic inhibitory effects on hematopoietic colony formation. Because cell types that are able to produce NKSF/IL-12 are present in normal bone marrow and NKSF/IL-12 production in vivo and can be stimulated during bacterial or parasitic infection, it is possible that the direct stimulatory effect of NKSF/IL-12 on hematopoietic progenitor cells and the indirect inhibitory effect mediated by secondary cytokine production by lymphoid cells may play a role in the regulation of physiologic hematopoiesis and in its alterations during infection.","['Bellone, G', 'Trinchieri, G']","['Bellone G', 'Trinchieri G']","['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12', 'Interleukins/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology']",1994/08/01 00:00,1994/08/01 00:01,['1994/08/01 00:00'],"['1994/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Aug 1;153(3):930-7.,,,,"['CA 10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A range of normal and neoplastic tissue sections, both frozen and routinely fixed, were immunostained, using the microwave method of antigen retrieval for routinely fixed specimens. The antibody was also tested on blood and bone marrow specimens and a range of human cell lines. The molecular weight of the antigen recognised by the antibody was obtained by western blot analysis. FACS analysis was used to demonstrate the cellular location of the antigen and its presence on tonsil cell suspensions and myeloma cases. RESULTS: VS38 recognised normal and neoplastic plasma cells in all of the tissues, including all routinely fixed plasma cell neoplasms tested. The antibody also weakly stained epithelial elements within the tissue but was absent from haemopoietic cells of other lineages. CONCLUSION: Antibody VS38 is of potential value in identifying myeloma or plasmacytoma in bone marrow or other tissues.

However, it could not induce adhesion of any other cell lines tested including endothelial cells, normal fibroblasts, and tumor cells of sarcoma, carcinoma, neuroblastoma and leukemia origin. A monospecific polyclonal antibody against pp-vWF, but not against fibronectin, laminin, and von Willebrand factor (vWF), completely blocked the pp-vWF-mediated adhesion, indicating that the cell adhesion was due to the pp-vWF molecule and not due to possible contamination of these three well-known adhesive proteins. The cell-adhesion activity was also observed with human pp-vWF and, furthermore, the adhesion to both bovine and human pp-vWF was not affected by a peptide containing the Arg-Gly-Asp sequence while the peptide abolished the cell adhesion to vWF. The adhesion was completely dependent on Mg2+ and inhibited by Ca2+. Inhibition by an anti-(beta 1 integrin) mAb (4B4) indicates that the receptor for this protein belongs to the beta 1-integrin family. A monoclonal antibody (TC4) among several antibodies directed against bovine pp-vWF inhibited the B16 adhesion to immobilized pp-vWF. The epitope for this monoclonal antibody lies in a central 8-kDa portion of pp-vWF, suggesting that this region is important for the cell-adhesion activity. This idea was supported by the finding that purified 8-kDa fragment promoted adhesion of B16 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. As pp-vWF shows unique cell-type specificity in its adhesion activity, which is completely different from that of fibronectin, laminin, vWF and collagen, it may be a novel type of adhesive glycoprotein that utilizes a beta 1-integrin receptor.","['Takagi, J', 'Sudo, Y', 'Saito, T', 'Saito, Y']","['Takagi J', 'Sudo Y', 'Saito T', 'Saito Y']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Bioscience and Biotechnology, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '0 (von Willebrand factor propolypeptide)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Aorta', 'Calcium/pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Melanoma', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Precursors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'von Willebrand Factor/immunology/*metabolism']",1994/06/15 00:00,1994/06/15 00:01,['1994/06/15 00:00'],"['1994/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1994 Jun 15;222(3):861-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18933.x.,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1994.tb18933.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used this method (PY-Facs) to study activation of normal human T lymphocytes and cells of a leukemic T-cell line: Jurkat. In contrast to normal T cells, Jurkat cells as well as three other leukemic cell lines display a higher constitutive level of tyrosine phosphorylation. This level of tyrosine phosphorylation results from an equilibrium that can be up-regulated by the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate peroxide, and down-regulated by the tyrosine kinase inhibitors, genistein and staurosporine. We have also observed an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins after mitogenic stimulation of Jurkat cells via T-cell receptor triggering. In addition, the entry of normal purified T cells from G0 phase into the cell cycle after co-stimulation with a phorbol ester and an anti-receptor antibody is correlated with a pronounced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation. We thus confirmed that this biochemical event was tightly associated with the activation status of the cells. The rapidity and sensitivity of the method we describe here make it particularly convenient for routine use and processing of a large number of samples, e.g., during analysis of human tumors. Moreover, because it retains sufficiently the integrity of treated cells and does not alter expression of membrane antigens, this method is suitable for multiparametric analysis, particularly for simultaneous studies associating the measure of tyrosine phosphorylation levels with possible modifications of membrane or intracellular structures as well as with cell cycle status.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Far, D F', 'Peyron, J F', 'Imbert, V', 'Rossi, B']","['Far DF', 'Peyron JF', 'Imbert V', 'Rossi B']","['INSERM U364, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Muromonab-CD3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Muromonab-CD3/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1994 Apr 1;15(4):327-34. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990150408.,['10.1002/cyto.990150408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have therefore examined the role of HCV in 15 children with leukemia who developed severe liver damage shortly after the diagnosis of leukemia. All patients were tested for HCV-RNA by the polymerase chain reaction at the time of peak SGPT elevation and for anti-HCV on serial serum samples taken thereafter. Only one patient (6.6%) showed hepatitis C viremia and none developed confirmed anti-HCV positivity during follow-up, suggesting that HCV had not played a major role in causing these severe episodes of liver necrosis. This is in agreement with observations made in non-immunocompromised patients in whom fulminant hepatitis is only exceptionally due to HCV.","['Locasciulli, A', 'Pontisso, P', 'Cavalletto, D', 'Fraschini, D', 'Uderzo, C', 'Masera, G', 'Alberti, A']","['Locasciulli A', 'Pontisso P', 'Cavalletto D', 'Fraschini D', 'Uderzo C', 'Masera G', 'Alberti A']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology, University of Milano, S.

Twenty-two (15%) of the sera also contained IgG antibodies that bound specifically to the primitive myelomonocytic leukemia cell line KG1a. Twenty-five (17%) of the sera had IgG antibodies to myeloid cell lines in the absence of antibodies to mature neutrophils. There was a trend toward more severe neutropenia in patients with antibodies to K562 cells, without antineutrophil antibodies.

We determined the expression of FPGS activity in blasts from children with ALL at diagnosis and after treatment with MTX as a single agent, before conventional remission induction therapy.

A significant amount of G-CSF mRNA was induced by the culture of an interleukin-3/G-CSF-dependent murine myeloid leukemia cell line, NFS-60, on PA6 stromal cells for 16 hours. Using a G-CSF-dependent subline of DA-1 (DA-1N), the biologic activity of G-CSF was also detected in PA6/NFS-60 coculture supernatants, but not in the culture supernatant of PA6 or NFS-60 alone. Direct contact of NFS-60 cells with the PA6 stromal layer was essential for the induction of G-CSF mRNA, as indicated by the following observations: (1) NFS-60 cells efficiently adhered to PA6 cells; (2) medium conditioned by NFS-60 cells did not contain the activity to induce G-CSF mRNA in PA6 cells; and (3) induction of G-CSF mRNA was not observed when NFS-60 cells were separated from PA6 cells by a microporous membrane (0.45-microns pore size). Several other myeloid cell lines, including FDC-P2, 32Dcl3, WEHI-3, and DA-1, did not induce G-CSF mRNA expression after the coculture with PA6 cells, although significant numbers of these cells adhered to PA6 cells.

Both the fragmentation as well as the side effects are often attributed to cavitation. The hazardous potential of cavitation is not only of a physical nature but also of a chemical nature, because of the generation of free radicals, e.g. .OH, .H and .O2. After the application of shock waves, we have demonstrated cavitation-generated free radicals in cell-free solutions and also in the surviving and intact suspended MGH-U1 cells by hydroethidine measurements. Under electron microscopical inspection, the same cells exhibited perinuclear cisternae, damaged mitochondria and numerous intracellular vacuoles. The contribution of free radicals to cell damage was investigated by reducing the vitamin E level in rats by a tocopherol free diet and by incubating L1210 cells in a tocopherol enriched medium. After 250 shock waves, ex vivo erythrocytes revealed a 75% increase in total cell disruption over cells from non-depleted rats.

Similar aberrations occurring in bone-marrow cells may contribute to the increased incidence of leukemia seen in these populations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific DNA probes is a relatively new technique which shows promise for the identification of aneuploidy-inducing agents. In these studies, fluorescence in situ hybridization with several chromosome-specific DNA probes was used to investigate the ability of the benzene metabolite hydroquinone to induce hyperdiploidy in interphase human lymphocytes. Using a classical satellite probe specific for human chromosome 9, a significant dose-related increase in the frequency of cells containing 3 or more hybridization regions was observed following the in vitro exposure of lymphocytes to hydroquinone at concentrations from 75 to 150 microM. At the 100-microM concentration of hydroquinone, the frequency of nuclei containing 3 or more hybridization regions was determined using probes for chromosomes 1, 7 and 9. Significantly higher frequencies of affected nuclei were observed using the chromosome 1 and 9 probes when compared to the chromosome 7 probe. To establish whether this difference was due to the nonrandom involvement of these chromosomes in hydroquinone-induced hyperdiploidy or to chromosomal breakage within the chromosomal region targeted by these probes, a multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization approach was developed using probes to two adjacent regions on chromosome 1. Using this tandem-labeling approach, the frequency of nuclei with multiple hybridization regions and the origin of the regions was determined by scoring slides labeled simultaneously with the chromosome 7 alpha satellite probe and the adjacent alpha and classical satellite probes for chromosome 1. The results of these studies confirmed that hydroquinone exposure resulted in a significant increase in hyperdiploid nuclei, but indicated that the different frequency of nuclei containing 3 or more hybridization regions observed using the chromosome 1 and 7 probes, was due to breakage within the chromosomal region targeted by the chromosome 1 classical satellite probe. These results indicate that hydroquinone may contribute significantly to the numerical and structural aberrations observed in benzene-exposed workers. In addition, the multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization approach utilized in these studies promises to be a powerful technique for the detection of chromosomal breakage occurring in interphase human cells.","['Eastmond, D A', 'Rupa, D S', 'Hasegawa, L S']","['Eastmond DA', 'Rupa DS', 'Hasegawa LS']","['Department of Entomology, University of California, Riverside 92521.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Benzene/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Probes', '*Diploidy', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Mutagens/*toxicity']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1994 Jul;322(1):9-20. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(94)90028-0.,"['0165-1218(94)90028-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(94)90028-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, T-BAM/CD40-L is an activation-induced CD4+ T cell surface molecule known to be important in inducing B cell effector functions. This report demonstrates that T-BAM/CD40-L molecules on a Jurkat T cell leukemia subclone (D1.1) or nonlymphoid 293 kidney cell transfectants induce B cells or B-CLL cells to express CD80 (B7/BB-1) in a manner that is specifically inhibited by anti-T-BAM/CD40-L mAb 5C8. Because activation-induced B cell surface molecules, such as CD80, deliver costimulatory signals to T cells that augment T cell proliferation, the functional costimulatory capacity of T-BAM/CD40-L-primed B cells and B-CLL cells was studied. T-BAM/CD40-L-primed B cells or B-CLL cells augment the proliferative responses of allogenic T cells. Furthermore, T-BAM/CD40-L priming is specifically inhibited by mAb 5C8. Together, these studies demonstrate that T-BAM/CD40-L induces CD80 expression on resting B cells or B-CLL cells. Moreover, T-BAM/CD40-L signaling enhances B cell costimulatory capacity.

This protein has also been identified as the Duffy blood group antigen, a cell surface receptor for the malarial parasite Plasmodium vivax. In the present study, we have identified a chemokine receptor-like binding protein in a human erythroleukemic cell line (HEL), which, based on its molecular properties, may be related to the erythrocyte chemokine receptor. Saturation binding studies with 125I-IL-8 revealed a single class of IL-8 binding sites in HEL cells with a KD of 7.4 +/- 1.9 nM and a receptor density of 12,818 +/- 965 binding sites/cell. In competition studies unlabeled IL-8 MGSA, MCP-1, and RANTES were fully able to inhibit the binding of 125I-IL-8 to HEL cells. Chemical cross-linking with radiolabeled IL-8 resulted in a cross-linked species of 60 kDa in membranes from HEL cells. The labeling was specific since it was inhibited by pre-incubation with 1 microM unlabeled IL-8 or MGSA. A monoclonal antibody (Fy6) to the human erythrocyte Duffy blood group antigen/chemokine receptor blocked the binding of IL-8 and other chemokines to the HEL cell chemokine receptor-like binding protein. Cell membranes from HEL cells and from erythrocyte ghosts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Fy6.

This evaluation was performed under controlled conditions in a mouse model for MHC-matched unrelated-donor transplantation, employing Rauscher leukemic SJL/J mice as the recipients and leukemia-resistant B10.S mice as the donors. Selective donor cell depletion for CD3 and CD5 was accomplished ex vivo prior to transplantation by incubation with the appropriate monoclonal antibody plus complement. When untreated, Rauscher leukemia resulted in a 97% fatality incidence. This was reduced to 30% by the transplant of non-depleted B10.S cells, with another 37% recipients dying from GVHD and graft failure. CD3 depletion reduced the GVHd deaths to 6% but increased relapse to 62%. Conversely, CD5 depletion had no effect on relapse or on GVHD but did significantly increase graft failure, thus negatively affecting survival. Evaluation of the results, done in conjunction with flow cytometry analysis of the effects of CD3 versus CD5 depletion on the donor cells, suggests that the T cells involved in suppressing leukemic relapse in these studies, and hence contributing to the GVL response, most probably had a phenotype of CD3+, CD5-.","['Okunewick, J P', 'Kociban, D L', 'Machen, L L', 'Buffo, M J']","['Okunewick JP', 'Kociban DL', 'Machen LL', 'Buffo MJ']","['Allegheny-Singer Research Institute, Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15212.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/immunology/*surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae Infections/blood/immunology/surgery', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/blood/immunology/surgery']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1994 Jan;13(1):11-7.,,,,"['R01-AI28425/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA49437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phox transmembrane flavocytochrome b558 is composed of two peptides, gp91phox and p22phox. Mutations of gp91phox cause X-linked CGD, whereas mutations of p22phox cause one of the three autosomal recessive forms of CGD. We used the Maloney leukemia virus-based MFG retrovirus vector to produce replication defective retroviruses encoding gp91phox or p22phox. To maximize viral titer MFG retroviruses do not contain internal promoter or resistance elements. Epstein-Barr virus transformed B-lymphocyte cell lines (EBV-B) derived from normal individuals contain phox components and produce O2-., whereas those derived from CGD patients show the CGD defect. Transduction of gp91phox or p22phox-deficient CGD EBV-B lines resulted in correction of O2-. production from a barely detectable baseline to an average 7.2% and 13.8% of normal control, respectively, without any selective regimen to enrich for transduced cells. CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, the therapeutic target for gene therapy of CGD, were isolated from peripheral blood of CGD patients, transduced with MFG-phox retroviruses, and differentiated in culture to mature phagocytes. Transduction of progenitors corrected the gp91phox (seven patients) and p22phox (two patients) CGD phagocyte oxidase defect to 2.5% and 4.9% of normal O2-. production, respectively, representing an 87-fold and 161-fold increase.

HL60 cells induced with DMSO undergo defective neutrophil maturation, manifested by a coordinate failure of secondary granule protein gene expression. We observed a similar defect in granulocytic maturation in ATRA-induced NB4 cells. In addition, because normal promyelocytes are known to have bilineage potential, we have investigated differentiation along monocytoid lines induced with TPA. We observed a striking phenotypic change along monocytoid/macrophage lines with TPA induction. Flow cytometry showed a TPA-induced increase in HLA-DR expression, and Northern blot analysis showed induction of expression of CD18, c-fos, and human neutrophil gelatinase (HNG). HNG is unique among the neutrophil secondary granule protein genes in that it is expressed in both the neutrophil and monocyte lineages. This again parallels our findings in TPA-induced HL60 cells, which retain the ability to express HNG. These findings confirm bilineage potential in NB4 cells.

From a consecutive series of 350 cases of adult de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), we identified 20 cases (6%) with a unique immunophenotype: CD33+, CD56+, CD11a+, CD13lo, CD15lo, CD34+/-, HLA-DR-, CD16-. Multicolor flow cytometric assays confirmed the coexpression of myeloid (CD33, CD13, CD15) and NK cell-associated (CD56) antigens in each case, whereas reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays confirmed the identity of CD56 (neural cell adhesion molecule) in leukemic blasts. Although two cases expressed CD4, no case expressed CD2, CD3, or CD8 and no case showed clonal rearrangement of genes encoding the T-cell receptor (TCR beta, gamma, delta). Leukemic blasts in the majority of cases shared unique morphologic features (deeply invaginated nuclear membranes, scant cytoplasm with fine azurophilic granularity, and finely granular Sudan black B and myeloperoxidase cytochemical reactivity) that were remarkably similar to those of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); particularly the microgranular variant (FAB AML-M3v). However, all 20 cases lacked the t(15;17) and 17 cases tested lacked the promyelocytic/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RAR alpha) fusion transcript in RT-PCR assays; 12 cases had 46,XX or 46,XY karyotypes, whereas 2 cases had abnormalities of chromosome 17q: 1 with del(17)(q25) and the other with t(11;17)(q23;q21) and the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RAR alpha fusion transcript. All cases tested (6/20), including the case with t(11;17), failed to differentiate in vitro in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), suggesting that these cases may account for some APLs that have not shown a clinical response to ATRA. Four of 6 cases tested showed functional NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting a relationship between these unique CD33+, CD56+, CD16- acute leukemias and normal CD56+, CD16- NK precursor cells. Using a combination of panning and multiparameter flow cytometric sorting, we identified a normal CD56+, CD33+, CD16- counterpart cell at a frequency of 1% to 2% in the peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Our studies suggest that this form of acute leukemia may arise from transformation of a precursor cell common to both the myeloid and NK cell lineages; thus we propose the designation myeloid/NK acute leukemia. Recognition of this new leukemic entity will be important in distinguishing these ATRA-nonresponsive cases from ATRA-responsive true APL.","['Scott, A A', 'Head, D R', 'Kopecky, K J', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Theil, K S', 'Grever, M R', 'Chen, I M', 'Whittaker, M H', 'Griffith, B B', 'Licht, J D']","['Scott AA', 'Head DR', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Theil KS', 'Grever MR', 'Chen IM', 'Whittaker MH', 'Griffith BB', 'Licht JD', 'et al.']","['University of New Mexico (UNM) School of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Albuquerque.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):244-55.,['S0006-4971(20)78818-X [pii]'],,['Blood. 1994 Oct 15;84(8):2824-5.

Whereas negative RT-PCR signals were recorded for interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, tumor necrosis factor beta (TNF beta), and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, we detected the expression of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha. Furthermore, the constitutive expression of IL-8 mRNA was observed in all 17 B-CLL samples analyzed. mRNA expression was associated with the capacity of the leukemic cells to release IL-8 both constitutively (4.6 +/- 8.1 SD ng/mL) and, to a further extent, after stimulation (14.5 +/- 19.4 ng/mL). The circulating levels of IL-8 were also evaluated in 12 untreated B-CLL sera samples and the overall mean level was significantly higher (P < .01) than in normal sera. In addition, supernatants of purified B-CLL cells cultured in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate showed chemotactic activity towards neutrophils; this activity was neutralized in the presence of an anti-IL-8 antiserum. The mRNA for IL-8 was absent in five B-cell preparations from hairy cell leukemia cases and in four B-cell lines. Normal tonsil CD5+ B cells showed a low expression of IL-8 mRNA only in two of the nine preparations tested and the overall quantity of IL-8 released by these cells after 3 days' incubation was significantly lower compared with that released by B-CLL cells (0.4 +/- 0.3 and 1.6 +/- 0.9 ng/mL under basal and stimulated conditions, respectively). These findings point to an involvement of a member of the proinflammatory chemokine supergene family in human CD5+ B lymphocytes. The different IL-8 behavior observed between B-CLL cells and their normal counterpart is likely to reflect an activation state of the leukemic population.","['di Celle, P F', 'Carbone, A', 'Marchis, D', 'Zhou, D', 'Sozzani, S', 'Zupo, S', 'Pini, M', 'Mantovani, A', 'Foa, R']","['di Celle PF', 'Carbone A', 'Marchis D', 'Zhou D', 'Sozzani S', 'Zupo S', 'Pini M', 'Mantovani A', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Sezione Clinica, University of Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jul 1;84(1):220-8.,['S0006-4971(20)78815-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the susceptibility of leukemic clonogenic cells to individual growth factors was related to cytosine-arabinoside (Ara-C) sensitivity. The effects of interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and combinations of these recombinant hematopoietic factors were tested on blast cells of nine acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Growth factor responses were assessed in semi-solid clonogenic assay and in a 10-day liquid culture followed by clonogenic assay. Heterogeneity in growth factor response was observed in both test systems, resulting in a variable pattern for individual leukemias. In the majority of cases (six of nine) the response patterns in the semi-solid and liquid cultures were divergent. To test the Ara-C sensitivity, leukemic blasts were exposed in liquid to various concentrations of Ara-C in the absence and presence of preselected growth factors. After 10 days, the number of surviving leukemic colony-forming cells (CFU-L) was assessed. Exposure to Ara-C in the presence of optimal stimulatory factor(s) resulted in a 3- to 1000-fold increase of the Ara-C toxicity in seven patients. The Ara-C concentrations resulting in 50% inhibition of clonogenicity (ID50) were 0.48-123 x 10(-8) M Ara-C in the absence of stimulatory growth factors, versus only 0.12-0.40 x 10(-8) M Ara-C in the presence of these factors. In two patients, addition of one or more factors neither increased the number of CFU-L in liquid nor enhanced the Ara-C toxicity. Even in the absence of growth factors the ID50 values in these cases were as low as 0.20 and 0.28 x 10(-8) M Ara-C and in the same range as the ID50 values observed with maximum growth factor stimulation in the other seven patients. These results indicate that Ara-C cytotoxicity can be enhanced by individually selected, clonogenic cell growth-promoting hematopoietic factors.","['Van der Lely, N', 'De Witte, T', 'Wessels, J', 'Raymakers, R', 'Muus, P', 'Preijers, F']","['Van der Lely N', 'De Witte T', 'Wessels J', 'Raymakers R', 'Muus P', 'Preijers F']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1994 May;68(5):225-32. doi: 10.1007/BF01737421.,['10.1007/BF01737421 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Histology was diffuse large cell in 29 (60%) patients; immunoblastic, diffuse mixed cell and lymphoblastic in four each; follicular large cell, diffuse small cleaved cell and diffuse small non-cleaved cell in one each; and unclassified in four. Ann Arbor stage was IV in 44 patients, and IE or IIE in four. Tumour mass > or = 10 cm, performance status (ECOG scale) > 2 and increased LDH level were present in 69%, 20% and 76% of patients respectively. Fifteen patients (31%) had multiple intraparenchymal nodules, 14 (29%) had direct spread into the kidney from a perirenal mass, ten (21%) had a single intraparenchymal nodule and nine (19%) had diffuse infiltration. Twenty-one patients (43%) presented with bilateral lesions. Three patients (6%) presented with acute renal failure. Ten other patients (21%) had serum creatinine > 120 mumol l-1. In 12 of these 13 patients renal function was restored with chemotherapy. Twenty-eight patients (57%) achieved complete remission. Estimated 4 year disease-free survival was 39%. Disease-free survival and actuarial survival at 4 years were estimated to be 58% respectively. Two renal parameters had adverse prognostic significance for survival: renal hilum involvement (P = 0.02) and diffuse renal infiltration (P = 0.01). A Cox model identified only two independent prognostic factors for survival, namely performance status > or = 2 and tumour size > or = 10 cm. We conclude that alteration in renal function occurs in 27% of patients with renal involvement. Systemic chemotherapy improves renal function rapidly. Long-term outcome is similar to that expected in NHL patients presenting with the same prognostic factors.","['Morel, P', 'Dupriez, B', 'Herbrecht, R', 'Bastion, Y', 'Tilly, H', 'Delannoy, A', 'Haioun, C', 'Nouvel, C', 'Bouabdallah, K', 'Baumelou, E']","['Morel P', 'Dupriez B', 'Herbrecht R', 'Bastion Y', 'Tilly H', 'Delannoy A', 'Haioun C', 'Nouvel C', 'Bouabdallah K', 'Baumelou E', 'et al.']","['Service des Maladies du Sang, CHRU Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'RSA8KO39WH (Vindesine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'LNH 84 protocol', 'LNH87-2 protocol']",IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/physiopathology', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*drug therapy/physiopathology/*secondary', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vindesine/administration & dosage']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1994 Jul;70(1):154-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1994.267.,['10.1038/bjc.1994.267 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC2033328,,,,,,,,,

This method relies on the activities of a reverse transcriptase and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase to amplify specific nucleic acid sequences. We have modified this protocol to allow selective amplification of RNAs that catalyze a particular chemical reaction. During an in vitro RNA evolution experiment employing this modified system, a unique class of ""selfish"" RNAs emerged and replicated to the exclusion of the intended RNAs. Members of this class of selfish molecules, termed RNA Z, amplify efficiently despite their inability to catalyze the target chemical reaction. Their amplification requires the action of both reverse transcriptase and RNA polymerase and involves the synthesis of both DNA and RNA replication intermediates. The proposed amplification mechanism for RNA Z involves the formation of a DNA hairpin that functions as a template for transcription by RNA polymerase. This arrangement links the two strands of the DNA, resulting in the production of RNA transcripts that contain an embedded RNA polymerase promoter sequence.","['Breaker, R R', 'Joyce, G F']","['Breaker RR', 'Joyce GF']","['Department of Chemistry, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', '*Biological Evolution', 'DNA Primers', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/enzymology', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA/*biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping']",1994/06/21 00:00,1994/06/21 00:01,['1994/06/21 00:00'],"['1994/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jun 21;91(13):6093-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.13.6093.,['10.1073/pnas.91.13.6093 [doi]'],,,['AI30882/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC44144,,,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Exobiology', 'Non-NASA Center']",,,['Joyce GF'],"['Joyce, G F']","['Scripps Res Inst, La Jolla, CA']"

First, we compared two methods for isolating CD34+ cells from patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. Twenty-two samples (17 PB, 5 BM) were obtained from 19 patients, were density cut and, after incubation with My10 antibody, were separated by panning or by immunomagnetic beads. Beads allowed a significantly better separation, either in terms of purification of CD34+ cells (85.5% +/- 11.1% vs 55.7 +/- 23.8%, p = 0.003) or in terms of depletion of CD34+ cells from the negative fractions (3.9 +/- 7.6 vs 30.9 +/- 25.1%, p = 0.008). In a second study, 2 BMs from healthy subjects and 1 BM and 2 PBs from chronic myeloid leukemia patients were separated using immunomagnetic beads. The results confirmed the previous study the overall frequency of CD34+ cells in the isolated positive fractions was 85.0 +/- 10.6% (with a recovery of 64.0 +/- 5.7%), while it was only 2.7 +/- 6.6% in the negative fractions. In particular the purity in the two normal BMs was respectively 86 and 97%. According to these results, the great majority of clonogenic cells was separated in the CD34+ fractions. Chymopapain, that was used to detach the beads from the cells, was shown to be non-toxic to the clonogenic cells.

In the majority of cases, the growth factors appear to be involved in classical extracellular autocrine or paracrine loops with neutralizing antibodies to the relevant cytokine inhibiting growth. In a minority, however, antibodies do not inhibit growth despite evidence of secretion of the cytokine. There is evidence for intracellular autocrine loops in murine leukemic cell lines. In this study, we wished to investigate for the presence of such intracellular loops involving GM-CSF in AML blast cells. Blast cells from 11 patients with AML were cultured in the presence of either neutralizing GM-CSF antibody or an antisense oligonucleotide directed against GM-CSF. We also studied the effect of the oligonucleotide on the autonomous growth of cells whose production of GM-CSF had been apparently abolished by either interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) or following blast cell purification using the CD34 antigen. The autonomous growth of the blast cells from nine of the 11 patients was inhibited by the antisense oligonucleotide (but not by the control sense oligonucleotide). However, only six of the nine were inhibited by the anti-GM-CSF antibody. Similarly, in one patient whose CD34 purified blast cells continued to show a high degree of autonomous growth but did not produce detectable GM-CSF, growth was inhibited by the antisense oligonucleotide but not by antibody, while in another patient whose cells were inhibited by IL-1Ra with, again, loss of detectable GM-CSF, growth could be further inhibited by the addition of the oligonucleotide but not the antibody. These studies provide evidence that intracellular autocrine loops involving GM-CSF are involved in the autonomous growth of some AML blast cells.","['Rogers, S Y', 'Bradbury, D', 'Kozlowski, R', 'Russell, N H']","['Rogers SY', 'Bradbury D', 'Kozlowski R', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Jul;22(7):593-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the ligands tested, substance P was the most potent in both cell lines: binding affinities were 0.1 nM for IM9 cells, and 0.3 nM for U373 MG cells, respectively. The high-affinity dipeptide antagonist, FK888, bound to NK1 receptors in both cell lines with similar potencies: Ki values were 1.2 nM and 3.6 nM for IM9 cells and U373 MG cells, respectively. Of the non-peptide antagonists, as expected, (+/-)-CP-96,345 displayed higher affinity (0.4 nM in IM9 cells, and 1.2 nM in U373 MG cells) than did RP 67580 (33 nM and 223 nM in IM9 cells and U373 MG cells, respectively) in both cell lines. We conclude that the pharmacological profile of NK1 receptors is similar in the human lymphoblastoma and astrocytoma cells, i.e. if NK1 receptor subtypes exist in humans, these cell lines are likely to express a similar subtype. Because IM9 cells grow faster and are easier to maintain, this cell line may be preferable to the astrocytoma cells as a primary screen to identify NK1 receptor antagonists.","['Goso, C', 'Potier, E', 'Manzini, S', 'Szallasi, A']","['Goso C', 'Potier E', 'Manzini S', 'Szallasi A']","['Pharmacology Department, Menarini Ricerche Sud, Pomezia, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoindoles)', '0 (Receptors, Neurokinin-1)', '135911-02-3', '(7,7-diphenyl-2-(1-imino-2-(2-methoxyphenyl)ethyl)perhydroisoindol-4-one)', '138449-07-7 (FK 888)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', 'W22ILA2I52 (CP 96345)']",IM,"['Astrocytoma/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*metabolism', 'Dipeptides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*metabolism', 'Isoindoles', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Receptors, Neurokinin-1/*analysis', 'Substance P/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/21 00:00,1994/03/21 00:01,['1994/03/21 00:00'],"['1994/03/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/21 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1994 Mar 21;254(3):221-7. doi: 10.1016/0014-2999(94)90458-8.,"['0014-2999(94)90458-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-2999(94)90458-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, IgG1-IT appeared to be approximately 100-fold more potent than IgG2a-IT toward B-cell lines Daudi and KM3. Binding and internalization studies with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) revealed a higher cellular uptake of IgG1 compared to IgG2a, despite similar binding affinities. Following removal of the Fc part, both mAbs internalized at the same rate as IgG2a, indicating that the Fc part of IgG1 is involved in enhanced cellular uptake. The involvement of Fc gamma RII (CD32) in this process was demonstrated by a decreased cytotoxicity of IgG1-IT (and not IgG2a-IT) in the presence of Fc gamma RII-blocking mAbs AT10 or IV.3. To identify the isoform responsible for this phenomenon, internalization of IgG1 and IgG2a in 11 B-cell lines and malignant B-cells of 8 patients was compared with expression of Fc gamma RII subclasses. In addition to four cell lines (Daudi, KM3, Nalm6, and Raji), the malignant B-cells of two patients showed enhanced uptake of IgG1 relative to IgG2a. Only the Fc gamma RIIa transcript was found in all B-cells. Furthermore, enhanced uptake of IgG1 correlated with rosetting of erythrocytes sensitized with anti-glycophorin A mAb of IgG1 isotype rather than with Fc gamma RIIa membrane expression levels. These data support the idea that functional Fc gamma RIIa is involved in the enhanced IgG1 uptake observed in a subset of B-cells. Our study, therefore, points to an important role for the Fc region of IT in the delivery of cytotoxic effects.","['van Oosterhout, Y V', 'van den Herik-Oudijk, I E', 'Wessels, H M', 'de Witte, T', 'van de Winkel, J G', 'Preijers, F W']","['van Oosterhout YV', 'van den Herik-Oudijk IE', 'Wessels HM', 'de Witte T', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Preijers FW']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments/immunology/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Immunotoxins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism/therapy', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology/*metabolism', 'Ricin/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rosette Formation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jul 1;54(13):3527-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MC57 (H-2b) cells infected with either 623EnvVac or 247EnvVac could serve as targets for ARK/Gross virus-specific CTL. Cells infected with the rVV expressing MCF13 env, however, were lysed much less efficiently by these CTL. 13EnvVac was also ineffective in priming or stimulating retrovirus-specific CTL. Finally, experiments with synthetic peptides and minigenes suggested that the reduced immunogenicity of the MCF13 envelope protein likely resulted from a single amino acid substitution within an immunodominant epitope of the p15E (TM) protein. The region of MCF13 env that encodes this epitope is derived from an endogenous xenotropic virus, while the allelic sequences in MCF247 are of ecotropic virus origin.

In sheep at the asymptomatic stage, depending on the extent of progression of the disease, the proportions of CD2(+)-, CD4(+)-, CD8(+)-, and gamma delta TCR(+)-T cells that coexpressed CD5 decreased, but CD5+ sIgM+ cells as well as CD5- sIgM+ cells increased for a period. The number of CD5+ B cells, however, rapidly decreased in the lymphoma stage. On the other hand, neoplastic lymphocytes appeared to be a monoclonal population derived from a single cell with surface phenotypes of sIgM+, B-cell-specific molecule B2+, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II+, OvCD5-, OvCD2-, OvCD4-, OvCD8-, gamma delta TCR-, which suggests that only CD5- B cells proliferate clonally when the disease proceeds to the lymphoma stage. Thus, rapid decrease of CD5+ B cells may be used as a marker of lymphoma stage. To identify the BLV provirus in the CD5- B and CD5+ B cells throughout the course of disease, each fraction of CD5- B and CD5+ B cell was sorted from the peripheral blood by flow cytometry and nested double polymerase chain reaction was performed. In BLV-infected but healthy sheep, BLV integrated both CD5- B and CD5+ B cells. In lymphoma, however, BLV provirus was detected only in CD5- B cells but not in CD5+ B cells. Therefore it appears that a disappearance of BLV-infected CD5+ cells is one of the critical events leading to CD5- B cell lymphoma in sheep. This is in contrast to the BLV-induced lymphoma in cattle which shows CD5+ phenotype.","['Murakami, K', 'Okada, K', 'Ikawa, Y', 'Aida, Y']","['Murakami K', 'Okada K', 'Ikawa Y', 'Aida Y']","['Laboratory of Gene Technology and Safety, Tsukuba Life Science Center, Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens', 'DNA, Viral', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*physiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/immunology/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sheep']",1994/07/01 00:00,1994/07/01 00:01,['1994/07/01 00:00'],"['1994/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Jul;202(1):458-65. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1362.,"['S0042-6822(84)71362-6 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1362 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the same neurons from newborn rats do not express detectable vasoactive intestinal polypeptide when cultured with nerve growth factor. To further explore the mechanisms regulating neuropeptide expression in these cells, I compared the effects of nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukaemia inhibitory factor on substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and somatostatin expression in rat dorsal root ganglion cultures. As with neurons from adult animals, newborn rat sensory neurons required nerve growth factor for synthesis of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. This effect was independent of neuronal survival since most neurons capable of expressing these peptides appeared to survive without added neurotrophic factors. Neurons surviving in the absence of nerve growth factor also expressed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, suggesting that nerve growth factor suppresses vasoactive intestinal polypeptide expression in immature neurons. However, nerve growth factor withdrawal after eight days' culture failed to cause vasoactive intestinal polypeptide induction which therefore appears to depend on other factors also. Neither ciliary neurotrophic factor nor leukaemia inhibitory factor affected peptide levels when used alone, but both inhibited nerve growth factor-stimulated expression of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide in adult rat neurons. They also stimulated vasoactive intestinal polypeptide expression in newborn rat neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor but not to such high levels as those seen under conditions of nerve growth factor deprivation. Neither brain-derived neurotrophic factor nor neurotrophin-3 affected peptide expression significantly. Somatostatin was defected in adult rat neurons, but was unaffected by neurotrophic factors. No somatostatin was detected in newborn rat neurons. These results suggest that in immature animals at least, the increased expression of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide seen in sensory neurons following peripheral nerve injury in vivo, could result from deprivation of target-derived nerve growth factor in combination with increased availability of ciliary neurotrophic factor or leukaemia inhibitory factor from the injured nerve.","['Mulderry, P K']",['Mulderry PK'],"['MRC Brain Metabolism Unit, Royal Edinburgh Hospital, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neuropeptides)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)', 'JHB2QIZ69Z (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide)']",IM,"['Aging/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide/biosynthesis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Ganglia, Spinal/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neurons, Afferent/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neuropeptides/*biosynthesis', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Somatostatin/biosynthesis', 'Substance P/biosynthesis', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/biosynthesis']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1994 Apr;59(3):673-88. doi: 10.1016/0306-4522(94)90186-4.,"['0306-4522(94)90186-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-4522(94)90186-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between PGP expression, myeloperoxidase activity and immunophenotype of blast cells, karyotype and outcome was also analyzed. PGP expression was found in the blasts of 34 of the 82 patients (41%), the majority of blasts being stained in positive cases. PGP positivity was rare in 'low risk' MDS (RA and RARS: 2/12 cases) as opposed to 'high risk' MDS (RAEB, RAEB-T, CMML: 25/60 cases) and MDS-AML (7/10 cases) (p = 0.04). PGP expression was positively correlated to the presence of myeloperoxidase activity in less than 3% of blasts (p = 0.025), and CD34 antigen expression (p = 0.04), whereas CD33 antigen expression had borderline significance (p = 0.07), demonstrating that PGP expression predominated in blasts with an immature phenotype. An abnormal karyotype, and especially the presence of monosomy 7, was not correlated to a higher incidence of PGP expression, however. There was a trend for more frequent progression to AML and for shorter survival in PGP-positive cases, but differences with PGP-negative cases were not significant. Twenty patients received intensive anthracycline-Ara-C chemotherapy and ten (50%) achieved complete response, including 9/13 (69%) PGP-negative cases and 1/7 (14%) PGP-positive cases (p = 0.03). Twenty other patients were treated with low-dose Ara-C and ten (50%) responded (complete or partial response). PGP-positivity did not negatively affect response to low-dose Ara-C: 4/11 responses in PGP-negative, and 6/9 responses in PGP-positive patients (p = 0.18). Because the treatment choice in advanced MDS (especially between anthracycline-Ara-C or low-dose Ara-C, chemotherapy) is difficult, our preliminary therapeutic results suggest that the analysis of PGP expression could have practical importance in MDS. These findings however, will have to be confirmed on larger numbers of patients. Clinical trials using drugs potentially reverting mdr, activity could also be warranted in MDS.","['Lepelley, P', 'Soenen, V', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Lai, J L', 'Cosson, A', 'Fenaux, P']","['Lepelley P', 'Soenen V', 'Preudhomme C', 'Lai JL', 'Cosson A', 'Fenaux P']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/pathology/*physiopathology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):998-1004.,,,,,,['mdr<down>1</down>'],,,,,,,,,,,,

When CBMC were exposed to HTLV-1 infection by coculturing with lethally irradiated, virus-donor allogeneic MT-2 cells, they underwent a proliferative response, that peaked within the first week and then declined. PG treatment did not inhibit the initial proliferation (day 4) of cocultured CBMC, while multiple treatments with PGA1 and more efficiently with PGJ2, suppressed the late cell proliferation (from day 8 onward). The pharmacological effects of PGA1 and PGJ2 were reversible and therefore multiple treatments were required to maintain their antiproliferative activity. Increasing concentrations (20, 40, 80 IU/ml) of recombinant IL-2 did not affect the virus-associated proliferative response of CBMC, and exogenous IL-2 did not revert the antiproliferative effect of both PGs. Arrest of proliferation in cocultured CBMC occurred concomitantly with expression of high levels of HSP70 in the cells. In fact, though HSP70 expression was induced early (day 5) after exposure to HTLV-1, its expression was further increased after multiple PG treatments and high levels were found when the antiproliferative effect of PGs became manifest. Since HSP70 protein family is involved in the control of cell cycle as well as in antigen processing and presentation during the immune response against tumor cells and pathogens, the persistent expression of this protein in PG-treated cocultures suggested that, beside inhibiting the growth of virus-infected cells, HSP70 expression might play a role in modulating the immune function of CBMC. However, unlike in most virus infection models, in which cyclopentenone PGs exert clear antiviral effects by inhibiting the synthesis and maturation of virus proteins, no antiviral activity was found in this model of infection. This strongly suggests that the main effect of these PGs against HTLV-1 infected cells consists in inhibiting proliferation in vitro without affecting viral expression.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Franzese, O', 'De Marco, A', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Amici, C']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Franzese O', 'De Marco A', 'Bonmassar E', 'Amici C']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Prostaglandins A)', '60203-57-8 (9-deoxy-delta-9-prostaglandin D2)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)', 'VYR271N44P (prostaglandin A1)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blood Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/microbiology', 'Prostaglandin D2/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins/physiology', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):1045-56.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data may account for a high percentage of Leu-8 and CD44 expression and a low percentage of ICAM-1 and VLA-4 expression on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), which is considered to be a neoplastic counterpart of normal CD5+ B lymphocyte.","['Abe, M', 'Tominaga, K', 'Wakasa, H']","['Abe M', 'Tominaga K', 'Wakasa H']","['First Department of Pathology, Fukushima Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/physiology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/*cytology/pathology', 'Lymphadenitis/pathology', 'Palatine Tonsil/*cytology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Tonsillitis/pathology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Jun;8(6):1039-44.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we reported that there is prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of approximately 72-kDa proteins (pp72) and that the tyrosine kinase p72syk is one component of pp72. Here we studied further the relationship of p72syk to pp72. The aggregation of Fc epsilon RI induced the activation of p72syk which was parallel to its tyrosine phosphorylation. By in vitro kinase assay of immune complexes purified with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, p72syk was the major pp72 tyrosine kinase. However, by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, p72syk was a minor component of pp72. The heterogeneous nature of pp72 was indicated by different studies. Under optimum conditions of one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, pp72 consisted of a heterogeneous group of 69-, 71-, and 72-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. There were differences in the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins in cells activated in the absence of extracellular calcium or when stimulation was with the calcium ionophore A23187 or with phorbol myristate acetate. One of the proteins migrating at 69 kDa was p72syk. By two-dimensional gel electrophoresis pp72 was found to consist of multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated protens including 71-80-kDa proteins that associate with p53/56lyn. A 75-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, different from pp72, was identified as p75HS1 (SPY75). These results demonstrate the heterogeneous nature of the pp72 and that p72syk is activated after Fc epsilon RI aggregation.","['Minoguchi, K', 'Benhamou, M', 'Swaim, W D', 'Kawakami, Y', 'Kawakami, T', 'Siraganian, R P']","['Minoguchi K', 'Benhamou M', 'Swaim WD', 'Kawakami Y', 'Kawakami T', 'Siraganian RP']","['Laboratory of Immunology, NIDR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*enzymology/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism']",1994/06/17 00:00,1994/06/17 00:01,['1994/06/17 00:00'],"['1994/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jun 17;269(24):16902-8.,['S0021-9258(19)89475-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These receptors mediate a similar stimulation of gene transcription via separate regulatory elements of acute phase plasma protein genes. To identify the receptor regions within the cytoplasmic domains necessary for transcriptional regulation, the receptors were transiently expressed in rat hepatoma cells. Each receptor form reconstituted G-CSF-induced expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene construct containing the cytokine response element of the rat alpha 1-acid glycoprotein gene. This regulation required the presence of two conserved sequence motifs (referred to as box 1 and box 2) in the cytoplasmic domains of each receptor. With the exception of G-CSFR-MPL chimera, the receptors also mediated a similarly high stimulation via the IL-6 response element of the rat beta-fibrinogen and hemopexin genes. Regulation of the IL-6 response element required, however, in addition to boxes 1 and 2, a third sequence motif (box 3). This motif is absent in the cytoplasmic domain of c-mpl, possibly explaining its inability to activate the IL-6 response element. When cells which express receptor forms with prominent box 3 function were treated with suramin, a ligand-independent gene stimulation via the IL-6 response element was observed. The suramin effect probably involves a receptor dimerization mediated by the extracellular G-CSFR domain and by the intracellular regions that include box 3.","['Baumann, H', 'Gearing, D', 'Ziegler, S F']","['Baumann H', 'Gearing D', 'Ziegler SF']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Liver/*metabolism', '*Lymphokines', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Suramin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/10 00:00,1994/06/10 00:01,['1994/06/10 00:00'],"['1994/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Jun 10;269(23):16297-304.,['S0021-9258(17)34007-3 [pii]'],,,['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 164 patients with stage IA-IIA HD treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone or combined radio- and chemotherapy (CT) according to presenting features and their attendant prognostic significance. The RT group included 88 patients with favorable prognostic features; the combined modality group included 76 patients with one or more unfavorable features. In the RT group, 85% of patients received extended-mantle or STNI; in the combined modality group, RT consisted of mantle- (49%), extended mantle- (37%), and involved-field irradiation (14%); CT consisted of 6 cycles of MOPP before 1984; 3 cycles of ABVD were substituted for MOPP thereafter. RESULTS: Complete remission was obtained in 94% and 99% of patients of the RT and combined modality groups, respectively. The 10-year actuarial relapse-free survival (RFS) in the RT group was 62% and was influenced by stage (p = 0.04) and histology (p = 0.01); in the combined modality group, RFS was 88% and was influenced by the presence of bulky disease. Overall survival and tumor mortality between the therapy groups were comparable. RT-related toxicity consisted of mediastinal fibrosis (8 cases), myelitis (3), hypothyroidism (2); other long-term events included 2 cases of acute leukemia in the combined MOPP and RT group. Altogether, 8 of 20 patients who died were in their first complete remission. CONCLUSIONS: In stage IA-IIA HD, the combined modality therapy reduced the risk of relapse compared to radiation alone; long-term toxicity of RT was not negligible and relapses could occur late.","['Brusamolino, E', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Orlandi, E', 'Canevari, A', 'Morra, E', 'Castelli, G', 'Alessandrino, E P', 'Pagnucco, G', 'Astori, C', 'Livraghi, A']","['Brusamolino E', 'Lazzarino M', 'Orlandi E', 'Canevari A', 'Morra E', 'Castelli G', 'Alessandrino EP', 'Pagnucco G', 'Astori C', 'Livraghi A', 'et al.']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ABVD protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myocardial Infarction/etiology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1994;5 Suppl 2:101-6. doi: 10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_2.s101.,['10.1093/annonc/5.suppl_2.s101 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of KS is not well understood. KS tumor cells grow poorly in vitro and require medium conditioned by retrovirus-infected T lymphocytes. We observed that conditioned medium (CM) from type II human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-II)-infected T cells (HTLV-II CM) induces conversion of endothelial cells (ECs) to a KS tumor cell-like phenotype. ECs grown in HTLV-II CM acquired a spindle-shaped morphology, the ability to express factor XIIIa and other KS cell markers, and a cytokine production profile similar to that of KS cells. We found that HTLV-II CM contains large quantities of scatter factor (SF), an angiogenic cytokine that stimulates cell motility. SF induced ECs to become spindle-shaped and express factor XIIIa. Moreover, SF was found to be a mitogen for KS cells in vitro and was identified within KS lesions in vivo. SF mRNA was present in KS cells in vitro, and antibodies against SF inhibited the growth of KS cells. The receptor for SF, the c-met protein, was expressed by ECs, dermal dendrocytes, and KS tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. HTLV-II CM was highly angiogenic in vivo, which was blocked by antibodies against SF. Based on these findings, we suggest that SF plays a role in the initiation and maintenance of KS lesions.","['Naidu, Y M', 'Rosen, E M', 'Zitnick, R', 'Goldberg, I', 'Park, M', 'Naujokas, M', 'Polverini, P J', 'Nickoloff, B J']","['Naidu YM', 'Rosen EM', 'Zitnick R', 'Goldberg I', 'Park M', 'Naujokas M', 'Polverini PJ', 'Nickoloff BJ']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0602.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Factor XIII/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*physiology', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/pathology/*physiopathology']",1994/06/07 00:00,1994/06/07 00:01,['1994/06/07 00:00'],"['1994/06/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/07 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 Jun 7;91(12):5281-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.12.5281.,['10.1073/pnas.91.12.5281 [doi]'],,,"['AR01823/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR40065/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL39926/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC43978,,,,,,,,,

To clarify these issues, we examined LIF gene expression in the human uterus by Northern blot hybridization and by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Analysis of LIF mRNA showed two hybridization bands, with estimated mRNA sizes of about 4.0-kb pairs and 1.8-kb pairs. LIF mRNA was detected at high levels in endometrial tissue and decidua, but at low levels in the chorionic villus in first trimester and term placenta. In the secretory phase, the endometrial tissue showed higher LIF expression than in the proliferative phase (9.5-fold; p < 0.01). The endometrial tissues were separated into a stroma-enriched fraction (SF) and an epithelium-enriched fraction (EF), and the LIF mRNA levels in each fraction were examined by quantitative RT-PCR.

However, little is known about the precise mechanisms by which ECM molecules regulate proliferation of human hematopoietic progenitor cells. In this study, we have investigated the effects of ECM molecules, particularly of FN, on the proliferation of a myeloid leukemia cell line, M07E, which proliferates in response to either human granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or stem cell factor (SCF). The [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell enumeration assays showed that FN strikingly inhibited GM-CSF- or SCF-induced proliferation of M07E cells in a dose-dependent manner, whereas little or no inhibition was induced by collagen types I and IV. The growth suppression of M07E cells was not due to the inhibitory effect of FN on ligand binding or very early events in the signal transduction pathways from the GM-CSF or SCF receptors. DNA content analysis using flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide revealed that the treatment of M07E cells with FN did not block the entry of the cells into the cell cycle after stimulation with GM-CSF or SCF, whereas the treatment resulted in the appearance of subdiploid peak. Furthermore, FN was found to induce oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in the cells even in the presence of GM-CSF or SCF, suggesting the involvement of programmed cell death (apoptosis) in the FN-induced growth suppression. The growth suppression or apoptosis induced by FN was rescued by the addition of either anti-FN antibody, anti-very late antigen 5 monoclonal antibody (anti-VLA5 mAb), or GRGDSP peptide, but not by that of anti-VLA4 mAb or GRGESP peptide, suggesting that the FN effects on M07E cells were mediated through VLA5. In addition, the FN-induced apoptosis was detectable in VLA5-positive human hematopoietic cell lines other than M07E cells, but not in any of the VLA5-negative cell lines. These results suggest that FN is capable of inducing apoptosis via its interaction with VLA5, and also raise the possibility that the FN-VLA5 interaction may contribute, at least in part, to negative regulation of hematopoiesis.","['Sugahara, H', 'Kanakura, Y', 'Furitsu, T', 'Ishihara, K', 'Oritani, K', 'Ikeda, H', 'Kitayama, H', 'Ishikawa, J', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Kanayama, Y']","['Sugahara H', 'Kanakura Y', 'Furitsu T', 'Ishihara K', 'Oritani K', 'Ikeda H', 'Kitayama H', 'Ishikawa J', 'Hashimoto K', 'Kanayama Y', 'et al.']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Fibronectins/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Laminin/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1994 Jun 1;179(6):1757-66. doi: 10.1084/jem.179.6.1757.,['10.1084/jem.179.6.1757 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC2191510,,,,,,,,,

Only the pre-apheresis MNC count showed an independently significant correlation for both CE (P < .001). The higher CE in the G-CSF group can only be partly explained by a rise in MNC count during apheresis. These data suggest that the blood cell separator works better with leukocytosis, and especially with a higher MNC count.

Remarkably, B7+ tumor cells were able to induce cytotoxic responses both by CD4-depleted and by CD8-purified T cells, demonstrating that expression of B7 is at the same time necessary and sufficient to induce a cytotoxic response in the absence of T-helper cells and accessory cells.","['Dohring, C', 'Angman, L', 'Spagnoli, G', 'Lanzavecchia, A']","['Dohring C', 'Angman L', 'Spagnoli G', 'Lanzavecchia A']","['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology/therapy', 'Retroviridae', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Jun 1;57(5):754-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910570524.,['10.1002/ijc.2910570524 [doi]'],,,,,['B7'],,,,,,,,,,,,

One hundred and nineteen patients have been reviewed in terms of response to therapy and prognostic factors for survival; 18 patients were excluded either because lymph node biopsy was not compatible with the diagnosis of CLL (11 patients), or because the lymphocyte count at presentation was < 5 x 10(9)/l (seven patients). Patients were staged retrospectively according to both the Rai and Binet Classifications. Forty-eight per cent (57/119) were deemed not to be in need of any treatment at presentation, 36 per cent (43/119) have never received any specific therapy. The majority of patients received chlorambucil alone, at a dose of 10 mg daily given for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week interval, followed by three, 2-week cycles. The overall response rate (complete+partial remission) was 38 per cent. In terms of survival, there was a trend in favour of patients who responded to treatment in comparison with those who did not but this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07). Correlations with stage were highly significant, the median survivals for patients with stage A, B and C disease (Binet) were 12.5, 8 and 3.5 years respectively. On univariate analysis, the absolute lymphocyte count at presentation was the most significant prognostic factor for survival, patients presenting with an absolute lymphocyte count above 50 x 10(9)/l having a less favourable prognosis (P = 0.002). However, on multivariate analysis, older age, a low hemoglobin, low platelet count, and the presence of lymphadenopathy and fever at presentation correlated adversely with survival. Overall, 40 patients died as a consequence of CLL or from disease-related causes, 34/40 dying of infection. Twenty-one patients developed second cancers. With a median follow-up of 13 years, these results confirm that the two staging systems can separate patients into prognostic groups, however in practice, there is heterogeneity of outcome within stage. New approaches are urgently needed.","['Karmiris, T', 'Rohatiner, A Z', 'Love, S', 'Carter, M', 'Ganjoo, R K', 'Amess, J', 'Norton, A J', 'Lister, T A']","['Karmiris T', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Love S', 'Carter M', 'Ganjoo RK', 'Amess J', 'Norton AJ', 'Lister TA']","[""ICRF Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COP protocol 2']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Chlorambucil/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*epidemiology/pathology', 'London/epidemiology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prednisolone/therapeutic use', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1994 Jan-Feb;12(1):29-39. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900120105.,['10.1002/hon.2900120105 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD5- cells from cord blood resembled peripheral blood B-lymphocytes, and the protein synthesis profile of CD5- cells from tonsils was very complex. One protein was also identified which consistently appeared to be synthesised at a low level in CD5+ B-cells from tonsil but which was always more prominent in CLL cells and other non-malignant B-lymphocytes.

The chimaeric protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and migrated on SDS/PAGE as a 68 kDa band. A monomeric form of the chimaeric HIV-1 RT has been prepared by the coordinated applications of immobilized-metal-affinity chromatography and gel filtration on Superose 12 columns. The monomeric nature of this chimaeric HIV-I RT was further characterized by cross-linking studies using disuccinimidyl suberate. The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity of the monomeric chimaeric HIV-1 RT was 35% that of the heterodimeric (p66/p51) HIV-1 RT. These results support our recent studies on the monomeric polymerase domain (p51 RT) which exhibited an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity equal to 33% of that of the p66/p51 heterodimeric HIV-1 RT (Evans, Kezdy, Tarpley and Sharma [1993] Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 17, 91-102). The inability of the monomeric chimaeric HIV-1 RT to display polymerase activity like that of the heterodimeric HIV-1 RT is attributed to a decrease in the processive rate of DNA synthesis (75%) and DNA binding (65%). However, the monomeric chimaeric HIV-1 RT (p68) exhibited RNAase H activity like that of the heterodimeric form (p66/p51) of HIV-1 RT. These results suggest that the linker insertion from FLV RT does not interfere with the RNAase H activity associated with the monomeric HIV-1 RT.","['Sharma, S K', 'Basu, A', 'Fan, N', 'Evans, D B']","['Sharma SK', 'Basu A', 'Fan N', 'Evans DB']","['Upjohn Laboratories, Kalamazoo, MI 49001.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Succinimides)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', 'V9WYZ7QMDT (disuccinimidyl suberate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/chemistry/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polymers', 'Protein Engineering', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Succinimides/chemistry']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 1994 Apr;19(2):155-67.,,,,['U01 AI25696-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The working group on mammalian cell gene mutation assays discussed a wide range of protocol issues related to study design; in most cases the recommendations are reasonably consistent with existing guidelines. Agreement was reached on several issues as follows. The upper limit of concentration for testing non-toxic substances should be 10 mM or 5 mg/ml, whichever is lower. For testing toxic substances the criteria of an acceptable upper limit of concentration should yield 10-20% survival. Any of several established mammalian cell mutation assays (L5178Y TK+/-, CHO/HPRT, AS52/XPRT, V79/HPRT) can be used to evaluate mutagenesis in mammalian cells; the ouabain (Na/K-ATPase) system is not an acceptable mutation assay for routine evaluation of mutagenesis in mammalian cells. Ability to recover small colonies must be convincingly demonstrated when using the L5178Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma assay. In the mouse lymphoma assay (L5178Y TK+/-), colonies in positive controls and at least two (if available) representative positive doses of the test compound should be sized if a positive response is seen; in the event of a negative response due to the test compound, colony sizing of the positive control is necessary to validate the conduct of the assay. Testing both in the presence and absence of S9 metabolic activation is necessary. It was not possible to come to a firm conclusion about the length of treatment. There was a general agreement that extended treatment times (> 2 cell cycles) often bear more disadvantages than advantages and should only be used with adequate justification. It is not necessary to repeat clear positive or clear negative tests when the assay has been adequately performed; this recommendation differs significantly from the UK guidelines. If treatment groups are not replicated, the numbers of doses tested should be increased; this recommendation differs significantly from the UK guidelines. Each laboratory should establish a historical database for the performance of a given assay in that laboratory.","['Aaron, C S', 'Bolcsfoldi, G', 'Glatt, H R', 'Moore, M', 'Nishi, Y', 'Stankowski, L', 'Theiss, J', 'Thompson, E']","['Aaron CS', 'Bolcsfoldi G', 'Glatt HR', 'Moore M', 'Nishi Y', 'Stankowski L', 'Theiss J', 'Thompson E']","['Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, MI 49001.']",['eng'],"['Consensus Development Conference', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'CHO Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/genetics', 'Mammals/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/methods/*standards', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research Design']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1994 Jun;312(3):235-9. doi: 10.1016/0165-1161(94)90038-8.,"['0165-1161(94)90038-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1161(94)90038-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,4,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, cells exposed to hypotonic stress in a high K/low Na Hanks' solution not only failed to volume regulate, but displayed a secondary swelling. Thus, while an outward K gradient was required for RVD, the secondary swelling indicated that hypotonic stress increased permeability in the absence of a negative membrane potential. The K channel blocker quinine (1-4 mM) blocked RVD in both cell types. Gramicidin's ability to overcome the quinine block of RVD indicated that RVD is mediated by a quinine-sensitive cation transport mechanism that is independent of the swelling-induced anion transport mechanism. Barium (1-4 mM), another K channel blocker, slowed the rate of RVD, while 4-aminopyridine, charybdotoxin, tetraethylammonium chloride, tetrabutylammonium chloride, and gadolinium had no effect on RVD. Furthermore, RVD was not mediated by calcium-activated conductances, since it occurred normally in Ca-free medium, in medium containing cadmium, and in BAPTA-loaded cells. Gramicidin produced little or no volume change in isotonic medium, suggesting that basal C1 permeability of both THP-1 and HL-60 cells is low. However, swelling induced an anion efflux pathway that is permeable to both chloride and bromide, but is impermeable to methanesulfonate and glutamate. The anion channel blocker 3,5-diiodosalicylic acid (DISA) antagonized RVD in both cell types. In conclusion, RVD in THP-1 and HL-60 cells is mediated by independent anion and cation transport mechanisms that involve both a DISA-sensitive anion pathway and a quinine-inhibitable K efflux pathway, neither of which requires increases in intracellular calcium to be activated.","['Gallin, E K', 'Mason, T M', 'Moran, A']","['Gallin EK', 'Mason TM', 'Moran A']","['Department of Physiology, Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20889-5603.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Hypotonic Solutions)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '1405-97-6 (Gramicidin)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Anions/metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Survival', 'Fura-2', 'Gramicidin/pharmacology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Hypotonic Solutions', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/physiology', 'Quinine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*physiology']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Jun;159(3):573-81. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041590321.,['10.1002/jcp.1041590321 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ATP alone did not induce M1 cell differentiation, addition of ATP with the differentiation inducer, interleukin 6 (IL-6), enhanced the induction of differentiation by IL-6 about two-fold. Comparison among several adenine nucleotides revealed that the order of effectiveness on differentiation enhancement was ATP > ADP > AMP > or = adenosine. Using reactive blue 2, a P2 receptor antagonist, we confirmed that the effect of ATP on the stimulation of differentiation was mediated through the P2 purinergic receptor. Examination of cytosolic [Ca2+] elevation by ATP and comparison of potency of differentiation enhancement among several ATP analogs demonstrated that the effect of differentiation enhancement was mediated through P2y purinergic receptors expressed on M1 cell surface. Within 3 h of exposure, ATP alone slightly increased the expression of differentiation-related immediate early response genes, c-myc and JunB, and ATP also enhanced the IL-6-induced expression of these genes. Induction of JunB expression by ATP analogs correlated with their potency of differentiation enhancement, which suggested that induction of JunB by ATP is one of signaling pathways involved in the exertion of its differentiation-enhancing effect.","['Yamaguchi, M', 'Hirayoshi, K', 'Okuma, M', 'Nagata, K']","['Yamaguchi M', 'Hirayoshi K', 'Okuma M', 'Nagata K']","['Department of Cell Biology, Chest Disease Research Institute, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Triazines)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '5DV0L8V99J (Cibacron Blue F 3GA)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', 'Actins/biosynthesis', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Triazines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Jun;159(3):441-9. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041590308.,['10.1002/jcp.1041590308 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is proposed that an ANLL/MDS leukemia suppressor gene resides on 5q31. We have previously shown that the gene is most likely localized between FGF1 and PDGFRB/CSF1R loci. The region has also been linked to at least four other genetic diseases, Treacher Collins syndrome, diastrophic dysplasia, limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, and an autosomal dominant deafness, by linkage analysis. Here, we describe yeast artificial chromosomes (YAC) spanning 450 kb around the FGF1 gene. Six YAC clones were isolated from a human YAC library and their restriction enzyme maps were determined. The overlap of the clones with each other and with FGF1 cosmid and phage clones was characterized. Three of the YAC clones were found to contain the entire FGF1 gene, which spans more than 100 kb. Proximal and distal ends of several of these YAC clones were isolated for further overlap cloning. The proximal ends of both Y2 and Y4 were localized to previously isolated FGF1 DNA by sequence analysis. The distal ends of these two clones also hybridized to a human-hamster hybrid containing chromosome 5 as the only human genetic material. These results suggest that these YAC clones represent colinear DNA around the FGF1 locus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Chiu, I M', 'Gilmore, E C', 'Liu, Y', 'Payson, R A']","['Chiu IM', 'Gilmore EC', 'Liu Y', 'Payson RA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '104781-85-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Walking', '*Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Probes', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 1/*genetics', '*Genes', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1994 Feb;19(3):552-60. doi: 10.1006/geno.1994.1105.,"['S0888-7543(84)71105-0 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1994.1105 [doi]']",,,"['K04 CA01369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA45611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09498/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['FGF1'],,,,['Genomics 1994 Sep 1;23(1):305'],,,,,,,,

This phenomenon was designated as rosette formation. After induction of differentiation of ELM-I-1 cells, rosette formation was reduced, and no rosette formation was observed between erythrocytes and MS-5 cells. Studies on anti-adhesion molecule antibody treatment have revealed that CD44 plays a key role in rosette formation. Expression of CD44 on (the membrane of) ELM-I-1 cells was reduced after differentiation, and no CD44 expression was detected on erythrocytes. CD44 was also expressed on MS-5. Hyaluronate is known as the ligand of CD44, but neither hyaluronidase treatment nor addition of excess hyaluronate to the assay system affected rosette formation. These data indicate that hyaluronate is not responsible for rosette formation. Anti-CD44 antibody (KM81), which recognized the hyaluronate binding site of CD44, inhibited rosette formation. But other monoclonal antibodies against different epitopes except for the hyaluronate binding site, even those against CD44's hyaluronate binding site, did not inhibit rosette formation. Thus, rosette formation between MS-5 cells and ELM-I-1 cells is mediated by CD44 but not by the hyaluronate binding site of CD44.","['Sugimoto, K', 'Tsurumaki, Y', 'Hoshi, H', 'Kadowaki, S', 'LeBousse-Kerdiles, M C', 'Smadja-Joffe, F', 'Mori, K J']","['Sugimoto K', 'Tsurumaki Y', 'Hoshi H', 'Kadowaki S', 'LeBousse-Kerdiles MC', 'Smadja-Joffe F', 'Mori KJ']","['Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Niigata University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Hyaluronic Acid/physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Rosette Formation']",1994/06/01 00:00,1994/06/01 00:01,['1994/06/01 00:00'],"['1994/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Jun;22(6):488-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two Src-family protein-tyrosine kinases, the TCR-associated p59fyn (Fyn) and the CD4/8-associated p56lck (Lck), have emerged as the likely mediators of early tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells. Here, we show direct binding of a 120-kDa TCR-induced phosphotyrosyl polypeptide, p120, to glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins of the Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of Fyn, Lck, and p60src (Src) but not other proteins. While binding of p120 to Fyn SH2 domain was phosphotyrosine-dependent as expected, its binding to the SH3 domain was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation, as shown by lack of competition with a phosphotyrosyl competitor peptide. In contrast, an SH3-specific proline-rich peptide completely abolished p120 binding to SH3. p120 was tyrosine-phosphorylated within 10 sec following stimulation of Jurkat cells with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, with maximal phosphorylation at 30 sec. Importantly, p120 was found associated with Fyn and Lck proteins in unstimulated Jurkat cells and served as an in vitro substrate for these kinases. These results provide evidence for a role of the SH3 domains of Fyn and Lck in the recruitment of early tyrosine-phosphorylation substrates to the TCR-associated tyrosine kinases.","['Reedquist, K A', 'Fukazawa, T', 'Druker, B', 'Panchamoorthy, G', 'Shoelson, S E', 'Band, H']","['Reedquist KA', 'Fukazawa T', 'Druker B', 'Panchamoorthy G', 'Shoelson SE', 'Band H']","[""Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (FYN protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fyn', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism']",1994/05/10 00:00,1994/05/10 00:01,['1994/05/10 00:00'],"['1994/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1994 May 10;91(10):4135-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.91.10.4135.,['10.1073/pnas.91.10.4135 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC43739,,,,,,,,,

The mAb was generated against a cell membrane antigen preparation from human B prolymphocytic leukemia cells and found to define an extracellular epitope of the smaller component (beta chain) of a heterodimeric antigen on human B leukemia cells. The antigen from BALL-1, a human B leukemia cell line, and fresh (uncultured) B prolymphocytic leukemia cells was found to consist of a 44-49 kDa (alpha chain) and a 36-40 kDa (beta chain) component. An additional minor component of 34 kDa was detected in the reduced antigen from BALL-1. For chemical identification of the antigen, we isolated the antigen from a Triton X-100 lysate of BALL-1 by immunoaffinity chromatography using the mAb. Determination of the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta chains unequivocally identified them as the human mb-1 and B29 proteins, respectively. The sequence analyses indicate the molecular heterogeneity of the mb-1 protein and also perhaps the heterogeneity of the B29 protein.

Our sequence data allowed us to establish the authentic amino-terminal amino acid sequence of the human B29 protein which is different from those proposed by others based on cDNA sequence analyses. Comparison of the amino-terminal sequences of the human mb-1 and B29 proteins with those of the mouse mb-1 and B29 proteins showed that the majority of the conserved amino acids in the mb-1 proteins are hydrophobic amino acids. Such conservation of hydrophobic amino acids is not observed in the amino termini of the human and mouse B29 proteins. A beta-tubulin-like protein was found to be co-purified with the mb-1-B29 antigen in the present study. In addition, we found that there is a strong amino acid sequence homology between the microtubule-binding domains of certain human microtubule-associated proteins and an intracellular segment of the human mb-1 protein.","['Vasile, S', 'Coligan, J E', 'Yoshida, M', 'Seon, B K']","['Vasile S', 'Coligan JE', 'Yoshida M', 'Seon BK']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Tubulin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens/chemistry', '*Antigens, CD', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Disulfides/chemistry', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/*chemistry', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*chemistry', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tubulin/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1994 Apr;31(6):419-27. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(94)90061-2.,['10.1016/0161-5890(94)90061-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Delta (delta) assays were performed on the 2-h plastic-adherent fraction of mononuclear cells, by assaying the numbers of CFU-GM released into the culture supernatant during 1 week of incubation, to investigate the properties of the original progenitor cells. The plastic-adherent delta (P delta) progenitor cells all express CD34, and a variable proportion express Thy-1. The numbers of CFU-GM produced are directly related to the numbers of mononuclear cells used to initiate the cultures, and limiting dilution experiments indicate a frequency for P delta cells of 2.5-10/10(5) mononuclear cells. The numbers of CFU-GM produced by individual P delta cells at limiting dilution vary considerably within experiments but the distributions of CFU-GM per P delta progenitor show little variation between samples. On average, P delta cells generate 6-9 early CFU-GM scored on day 21 of culture; 10-23 CFU-GM scored on day 14, and 18-40 mature CFU-GM scored on day 7. These results show that plastic-adherent cells in human bone marrow are capable of sustained hematopoiesis in vitro and of producing a spectrum of clonogenic progeny.

To determine if the c-kit ligand mast cell growth factor (MGF) can improve progenitor growth in MDS, we evaluated in vitro responsiveness of bone marrow progenitors from 25 patients to MGF and/or GM-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and PIXY 321, and examined the relationship between progenitor response and cellular expression of the c-kit receptor. MGF and erythropoietin gave rise to macroscopic colonies and dose-dependently increased CFU-GEMM and BFU-E up to 27-fold in 15 (60%) and 20 (80%) patients, respectively. Among 17 patients with absent growth in lymphocyte-conditioned media, MGF stimulated CFU-GEMM recovery in 59%, compared to 23% with PIXY 321, 12% with IL-3 and 8% with GM-CSF. Cytokine combinations did not augment recovery of erythropoietin-dependent progenitors above that achieved with MGF alone. MGF and/or IL-3 were comparatively weak stimulants of CFU-GM formation, whereas GM-CSF and PIXY in combination with MGF increased colony number 2- to 15-fold in 60 and 70% of patients, respectively, while preserving maturation competence as evidenced by colony composition and increased colony/cluster ratio. The stimulatory effects of MGF were observed in all morphologic categories of MDS except chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. A mononuclear cell population expressing the c-kit receptor was identified by flow cytometry in 57% of cases. Neither SR-1 reactivity nor cytogenetic pattern predicted progenitor response to MGF. These data indicate that MGF improves the colony-forming capacity of hematopoietic progenitors in MDS and is a potent co-stimulant of multipotent and committed progenitor recovery. The heterogeneity in MGF responsiveness implies an intrinsic defect in growth regulation not explained by cellular loss of c-kit display.","['Glinsmann-Gibson, B', 'Spier, C', 'Baier, M', 'Taetle, R', 'Broudy, V C', 'List, A F']","['Glinsmann-Gibson B', 'Spier C', 'Baier M', 'Taetle R', 'Broudy VC', 'List AF']","['Sections of Hematology/Oncology and Biometry, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (PIXY321 fusion protein, recombinant)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):827-32.,,,,['328689/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis using genomic DNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow samples containing > or = 70% leukemic blasts and agarose gel electrophoresis of cDNA obtained by RT-PCR did not reveal gross rearrangements of the dCK gene. Sequencing of the dCK coding region showed point mutations in seven patients. Besides two silent mutations (or RFLPs) in codon 42 and 86, base pair mutations resulting in amino acid replacements were found in five patients affecting codon 20, 93, 98, 99, and 154, respectively. dCK cDNA clones from three patients with > or = 50% of sequenced clones revealing the specific base pair alteration were bacterially expressed in E. coli and analyzed for dCK activity. Normal enzyme activity was found in two patients (codon 20 and 98), and a complete loss of activity in one patient (codon 99). We conclude that structural alteration of the coding region of the dCK gene represents one possible mechanism for ara-C resistance in vivo, but, considering the frequency of this event, other mechanisms may play a more important role for clinical resistance to ara-C in patients with AML.","['Flasshove, M', 'Strumberg, D', 'Ayscue, L', 'Mitchell, B S', 'Tirier, C', 'Heit, W', 'Seeber, S', 'Schutte, J']","['Flasshove M', 'Strumberg D', 'Ayscue L', 'Mitchell BS', 'Tirier C', 'Heit W', 'Seeber S', 'Schutte J']","['Innere Klinik und Poliklinik (Tumorforschung) Universitatsklinikum Essen, Westdeutsches Tumorzentrum Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Codon', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):780-5.,,,['Leukemia. 2001 May;15(5):855-6.

While clinical trials based on this growth factor/chemotherapy combination (GF/CT) are progressing with discordant results, further information regarding the underlying mechanisms have been reported supporting this rationale and requiring additional investigation. To assess the role of cytokinetic changes in the GF/CT strategy and to evaluate if chemotherapeutic agents regimens other than Ara-C, when combined with GF, can enhance their cytotoxic effects, we have primed AML blasts with two cytokine combinations and then exposed these cells to the S-phase specific agent Ara-C as well as to the phase non-specific drug daunorubicin (DNR) and to the alkylating agent 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC). The two cytokine combinations used for priming AML blasts were: (i) interleukin-3 (IL-3) + granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) + granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF); and (ii) GM + G-CSF. Cytokinetic analysis in ten AML samples and clonogenic growth of leukemic colonies (CFU-L) in methylcellulose were used to detect proliferative and cytotoxic effects on AML samples. We report that in AML clonogenic cell growth can be stimulated by cytokines in 50% of the samples (4/8), and that Ara-C sensitization clearly occurs in two out of these four samples. Among the different cytokine combinations tested, the one containing IL-3 was the most effective through a cytokinetic mechanism consistent with recruitment (averaged G0 decrease p = 0.04; S-phase increase p = 0.005). Furthermore we observed increased cytotoxicity also to the phase non-specific drugs DNR and 4-HC, which may be mediated by other mechanisms recently described. We conclude that GF/CT combinations may also be beneficial in regimens containing drugs other than Ara-C, used for AML treatment, including bone marrow transplantation conditioning regimens.","['Tafuri, A', 'Lemoli, R M', 'Chen, R', 'Gulati, S C', 'Clarkson, B D', 'Andreeff, M']","['Tafuri A', 'Lemoli RM', 'Chen R', 'Gulati SC', 'Clarkson BD', 'Andreeff M']","['Leukemia Cell Biology Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):749-57.,,,,"['CA 05826/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human factor-dependent cell line MO7 has been used as a model to study the interaction of SF with other growth factors such as GM-CSF, because both factors support the proliferation of this cell line and are synergistic in combination. Previous studies have shown that this effect is not readily explained by the synergistic activation of early, cytosolic signal transduction intermediates such as tyrosine kinases, Raf-1, MAP2 kinase, or phospholipase C gamma. In an attempt to further explore the biological and biochemical mechanisms of the synergy between SF and GM-CSF, we examined the effects of these growth factors on the regulation of nuclear proto-oncogenes, cell cycle control genes, and G1-->S transition of MO7 cells. Individually, GM-CSF was a much more potent growth factor for MO7 cells than SF, particularly under serum-free conditions. Only GM-CSF, but not SF, was able to stimulate G1-->S transition of MO7 cells after factor deprivation for 24 h. Northern blot analyses showed also differential effects of GM-CSF and SF on the expression of some nuclear proto-oncogenes and G1 cyclins. GM-CSF (10 ng/ml), but not SF (20 ng/ml) increased the expression of c-myc and cyclin D2 mRNA, whereas both factors caused transient increases of c-fos and cyclin D3 mRNAs. When added simultaneously, GM-CSF and SF induced an at least additive increase of c-fos mRNA expression; this effect required the presence of fetal calf serum. No additive effects of GM-CSF and SF on c-myc, cyclin D2 or D3 mRNA expression were observed. C-jun and c-myb mRNAs were constitutively expressed in the MO7 cell line, but not further increased after stimulation with GM-CSF or SF for 15 min to 48 h. The inability of SF to induce growth promoting genes such as c-myc and cyclin D2 may explain why this cytokine does not support sustained proliferation of MO7 cells. These observations suggest that SF and GM-CSF exert different effects on the expression of genes involved in regulatory pathways of cell proliferation, but the molecular mechanism of synergy remains to be elucidated.","['Hallek, M', 'Ando, K', 'Eder, M', 'Slattery, K', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista, F', 'Griffin, J D']","['Hallek M', 'Ando K', 'Eder M', 'Slattery K', 'Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F', 'Griffin JD']","['Dana-Faber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'S Phase', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 May;8(5):740-8.,,,,"['CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 36167/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to its well characterized role in proteolysis, urokinase receptor binding per se promotes the adhesiveness of leukemic cell lines exposed to differentiating cytokines in vitro. We sought to determine if a serum or matrix component is involved in urokinase-dependent adhesion. We now report that cytokine-stimulated human myelomonocytic cells express a divalent cation- and Arg-Gly-Asp-independent high affinity receptor for urea-purified vitronectin (Kd < 10 nM). Soluble native vitronectin does not effectively bind to the receptor, while cellular adhesion was noted to both urea-purified and native vitronectin when adsorbed to plastic. The activity of this receptor is tightly coupled to urokinase receptor occupancy. Urokinase receptor binding thus induces selective and reversible cellular adhesion to the matrix form of vitronectin. Because transfer of vitronectin-bound plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 to urokinase promotes rapid turnover of receptor-bound enzyme, these results illuminate a novel binding cycle by which urokinase receptor occupancy coordinately regulates cellular adhesiveness and pericellular proteolysis.","['Waltz, D A', 'Chapman, H A']","['Waltz DA', 'Chapman HA']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', '*Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Vitronectin']",1994/05/20 00:00,1994/05/20 00:01,['1994/05/20 00:00'],"['1994/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 May 20;269(20):14746-50.,['S0021-9258(17)36688-7 [pii]'],,,['HL-44712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we discuss the roles, mechanisms, and clinical applications of cell-associated complement regulatory proteins in hematological malignancies.","['Seya, T', 'Matsumoto, M', 'Hara, T', 'Hatanaka, M', 'Masaoka, T', 'Akedo, H']","['Seya T', 'Matsumoto M', 'Hara T', 'Hatanaka M', 'Masaoka T', 'Akedo H']","['Department of Immunology and Hematology, Center for Adult Diseases Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3b)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'CD55 Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Receptors, Complement 3b/*analysis']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1994 Feb;12(5-6):395-400. doi: 10.3109/10428199409073780.,['10.3109/10428199409073780 [doi]'],,,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,

To help distinguish between these two possible causes of relapse, we used safety-modified retroviruses, which contain the bacterial resistance gene NEO, to mark autologous marrow cells that had been collected from patients early in the phase of hematopoietic recovery after in vivo chemotherapy. The cells were then subjected to ex vivo CD34 selection following collection and 30% of the bone marrow were exposed to a safety-modified virus. This marrow was infused after delivery of systemic therapy, which consisted of total body irradiation (1,020 cGy), cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg), and VP-16 (750 mg/m2). RT PCR assays specific for the bacterial NEO mRNA, which was coded for by the virus, and the bcr-abl mRNA showed that in two evaluable CML patients transplanted with marked cells, sufficient numbers of leukemia cells remained in the infused marrow to contribute to systemic relapse. In addition, both normal and leukemic cells positive for the retroviral transgenome persisted in the systemic circulation of the patients for at least 280 days posttransplant showing that the infused marrow was responsible for the return of hematopoiesis following the preparative therapy. This observation shows that it is possible to use a replication-incompetent safety-modified retrovirus in order to introduce DNA sequences into the hematopoietic cells of patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation. Moreover, this data suggested that additional fractionation procedures will be necessary to reduce the probability of relapse after bone marrow transplantation in at least the advanced stages of the disease in CML patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation procedures.","['Deisseroth, A B', 'Zu, Z', 'Claxton, D', 'Hanania, E G', 'Fu, S', 'Ellerson, D', 'Goldberg, L', 'Thomas, M', 'Janicek, K', 'Anderson, W F']","['Deisseroth AB', 'Zu Z', 'Claxton D', 'Hanania EG', 'Fu S', 'Ellerson D', 'Goldberg L', 'Thomas M', 'Janicek K', 'Anderson WF', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', '*Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1994/05/15 00:00,1994/05/15 00:01,['1994/05/15 00:00'],"['1994/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 15;83(10):3068-76.,['S0006-4971(20)69227-8 [pii]'],,,['P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A GIMEMA study.,23-8,"Thrombotic events have been reported in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients, especially during or after L-asparaginase administration. A so-called L-asparaginase associated coagulopathy has been well recognized, being characterized by a hypercoagulable state (decrease of antithrombin III, plasminogen, protein C, protein S and increase of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes and fibrinopeptide A). The aim of this study was to determine whether the supplementation of antithrombin III (AT-III) concentrates could improve the L-asparaginase associated coagulopathy, thereby blocking the activation of the haemostatic system. In 25 adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (M 19, F6, mean age 34 years) antithrombin III (AT-III) concentrates were administered at daily doses of 50 U/kg for 10 consecutive days from the beginning of L-asparaginase therapy (6,000 U/m2/day s.c. for 7 days), given according to the GIMEMA ALL 0288 trial. A marked increase of antithrombin III was recorded on days IV-VIII-XI (P < 0.001). No changes in protein C, protein S, plasminogen, alpha 2-antiplasmin, factor VII and platelet count were observed and there was no increase in markers of hypercoagulability. There was no evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation. In conclusion, AT-III concentrate supplementation during L-asparaginase therapy, by the achievement of high levels of antithrombin III, is associated with a lack of activation of the haemostatic system and appears to overcome the complex coagulopathy associated with L-asparaginase.","['Mazzucconi, M G', 'Gugliotta, L', 'Leone, G', 'Dragoni, F', 'Belmonte, M M', 'De Stefano, V', 'Chistolini, A', 'Tura, S', 'Mandelli, F']","['Mazzucconi MG', 'Gugliotta L', 'Leone G', 'Dragoni F', 'Belmonte MM', 'De Stefano V', 'Chistolini A', 'Tura S', 'Mandelli F']","['Haematology Department, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis,Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,9102551,"['0 (Protein C)', '0 (Protein S)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9000-94-6 (Antithrombin III)', '9001-25-6 (Factor VII)', '9001-91-6 (Plasminogen)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antithrombin III/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Factor VII/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Plasminogen/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Protein C/metabolism', 'Protein S/metabolism', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/metabolism']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Coagul Fibrinolysis. 1994 Feb;5(1):23-8. doi: 10.1097/00001721-199402000-00004.,['10.1097/00001721-199402000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of J774 cells with bacterial endotoxin (LPS, 1 microgram ml-1, 24 h) selectively increased the transport capacity for NG-monomethyl-L-[14C]arginine (L-NMMA), whereas transport of NG-nitro-L-[3H]arginine (L-NNA) was unaffected. Inhibition studies established that the cationic transport system y+ mediates uptake of L-arginine, L-NMMA and NG-iminoethyl-L-ornithine (L-NIO). A neutral transporter, with low substrate specificity and insensitive to LPS, mediates uptake of L-citrulline, L-NNA and its methyl ester L-NAME. We conclude that enhanced expression of the y+ transporter in LPS-stimulated macrophages may facilitate the targeting of selective inhibitors of inducible NO synthase to activated cells generating NO in endotoxin shock.","['Baydoun, A R', 'Mann, G E']","['Baydoun AR', 'Mann GE']","[""Vascular Biology Research Centre, King's College London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '2149-70-4 (Nitroarginine)', '27JT06E6GR (omega-N-Methylarginine)', '29VT07BGDA (Citrulline)', '36889-13-1 (N(G)-iminoethylornithine)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.4.- (Amino Acid Oxidoreductases)', 'V55S2QJN2X (NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Animals', 'Arginine/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Biological Transport, Active/drug effects', 'Canavanine/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Citrulline/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Nitroarginine', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Virus', 'omega-N-Methylarginine']",1994/04/29 00:00,1994/04/29 00:01,['1994/04/29 00:00'],"['1994/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Apr 29;200(2):726-31. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1994.1511.,"['S0006-291X(84)71511-7 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1994.1511 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of malignant hemopathies with interferons].,548-56,"Interferons (INF) are glycoproteins with protean antiviral, immunomodulator, and antiproliferative actions. In Haematology, IFN-alpha is the most widely used. Diffusion into the spleen, bone marrow and liver is good. Hairy cell leukemia is probably the malignant blood disorder which responds best to IFN. At some time during their treatment, nearly 90% of the patients require IFN. Treatment initiation is indicated when pancytopenia (polynuclear neutrophils below 1 x 10(9)/L) develops or in case of a very voluminous spleen. IFN-alpha 2a, 2b and 2c are active (leukocyte IFN is used less often, as is IFN-beta; IFN-gamma is ineffective). The standard dose is 3 x 10(6) U, three times a week for 12 weeks. Smaller doses and maintenance treatment is sometimes proposed. Haematological remission occurs in almost all cases, if not a misdiagnosis must be considered (villous lymphocyte lymphoma). Relapse usually occurs at the end of treatment, but sensitivity to IFN is not altered and final survival is improved. Nearly 90% of the patients are alive at 4 years. Although IFN is active in chronic myeloid leukemia, research in this area continues. Clinical trials have reported haematologic relapse in 90% and complete cytogenetic response in 15 to 35% of the patients. The effect on Ph+ cells is not observed with classical chemotherapies. Initial dose is generally 5 x 10(6) U/m2/day. High doses are not always well tolerated, but cytogenetic response is only seen in patients in haematologic and cytopenic remission. IFN therapy improves survival over classical treatments (median 62 versus 39 months). Survival is better after good cytogenetic response or complete remission. Combined chemo-IFN therapy is currently under study in an attempt to improve cytogenetic response. In terms of the molecular biology however, residual disease is almost always present and relapse is frequent.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Guilhot, F', 'Sadoun, A', 'Delwail, V']","['Guilhot F', 'Sadoun A', 'Delwail V']","[""Department d'Hematologie et Oncologie Medicale, CHU La Miletrie, Poitiers.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Med Interne (Paris),Annales de medecine interne,0171744,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Med Interne (Paris). 1993;144(8):548-56.,,,,,,,Les interferons.

More mature T-lineage blasts were also investigated in a comparative manner. In conclusion, the CD7+ CD5- CD2- blasts included four categories: undifferentiated blasts without lineage commitment, T-lineage blasts, T-/myeloid lineage blasts, and cyMPO-negative myeloblasts. The CD7+ CD5+ CD2- blasts included two categories; T-lineage and T-/myeloid lineage blasts. The 11 cases were of the germ-line gene (G) for TCR beta and IgH. Four cases were G for TCR delta and TCR gamma. The others were of the monoclonally rearranged gene (R) for TCR delta and G for TCR gamma or R for both TCR delta and TCR gamma. The expression or in vitro induction of CD13 and/or CD33 antigens correlated with the immaturity of these neoplastic T cells, since it was observed in all 11 CD7+ CD5- CD2- and CD7+ CD5+ CD2-, and some CD7+ CD5+ CD2+ (CD3- CD4- CD8-) cases, but not in CD3 +/- CD4+ CD8+ or CD3+ CD4+ CD8- cases. CD3 epsilon mRNA, but not CD3 delta mRNA, was detected in two CD7+ CD5- CD2- cases, while mRNA of neither of the two CD3 molecules was detected in the other tested CD7+ CD5- CD2- cases. In contrast, mRNA of both CD3 epsilon and CD3 delta were detected in all CD7+ CD5+ CD2- cases, indicating that CD7+ CD5- CD2- blasts at least belong to T-lineage. The blasts of two CD7+ CD5- CD2- cases with entire germ-line genes and without mRNA of the three molecules (MPO, CD3 epsilon, and CD3 delta) were regarded as being at an undifferentiated stage prior to their commitment to either T- or myeloid-lineage. The co-expression of the genes of MPO and CD3 epsilon in a CD7+ CD5- CD2- case MPO, CD3 epsilon, and CD3 delta in a CD7+ CD5+ CD2- case suggested the presence of some overlapping phase for T- and myeloid-lineage commitment during immature stages of differentiation. This helps understand the conversion of some T-ALL/LBL cases to acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Yoneda, N', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Teshigawara, K', 'Nagata, S', 'Nagano, T', 'Kishimoto, Y', 'Kimura, T', 'Yasunaga, K', 'Yamaguchi, N']","['Yoneda N', 'Tatsumi E', 'Teshigawara K', 'Nagata S', 'Nagano T', 'Kishimoto Y', 'Kimura T', 'Yasunaga K', 'Yamaguchi N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD7', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*analysis/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex/*analysis/genetics', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genotype', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Peroxidase/*analysis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*immunology/pathology']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1994 Apr;45(4):310-20. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830450408.,['10.1002/ajh.2830450408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore likely that genes encoding enzymes and other proteins involved in energy metabolism and biosynthetic pathways represent a major class of mitogen-induced genes. In the present study, we investigated in the non-established human fibroblast line WI-38 the induction by mitogens of 17 genes whose products play a role in different metabolic processes. We show that these genes fall into 4 different categories, i.e. non-induced genes, immediate early (IE) primary genes, delayed early (DE) secondary genes and late genes reaching peak levels in S-phase. In addition, we have analysed the regulation of these genes during normal cell cycle progression, using HL-60 cells separated by counterflow elutriation. A clear cell cycle regulation was seen with those genes that are induced in S-phase, i.e. thymidine kinase, thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase. In addition, two DE genes showed a cell cycle dependent expression. Ornithine decarboxylase mRNA increased around mid-G1, reaching maximum levels in S/G2, while hexokinase mRNA expression was highest in early G1. In contrast, the expression of other DE and IE genes did not fluctuate during the cell cycle, a result that was confirmed with elutriated WI-38 and serum-stimulated HL-60 cells. These observations suggest that G0-->S and G1-->S transition are distinct processes, exhibiting characteristic programmes of gene regulation, and merging around S-phase entry.","['Burger, C', 'Wick, M', 'Brusselbach, S', 'Muller, R']","['Burger C', 'Wick M', 'Brusselbach S', 'Muller R']","['Institut fur Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps-Universitat Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (Hexokinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Genes, Immediate-Early/drug effects', 'Hexokinase/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lung', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis', 'Thymidine Kinase/biosynthesis', 'Thymidylate Synthase/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1994 Jan;107 ( Pt 1):241-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, CD15/CD34 has been described as a rare phenotype in normal bone marrow (NBM) (< 0.10%). We used a triple immunofluorescence assay to investigate the expression of CD15, CD34 and class II antigens in normal (NMB) and leukemic (LBM) bone marrows. METHODS: A FACScan for quantitative fluorescence and the PAINT-A-GATE program for multiparametric analysis were utilized. Fifteen normal bone marrow and fifteen leukemic bone marrow samples were studied with a triple immunofluorescence assay. A FACSorter was used for sorting. RESULTS: Eleven out of 15 normal marrows contained less than 0.67% (range 0.01-0.66) cells which coexpressed CD15, CD34 and class II antigens. Three normal marrows contained more than 0.67% but less than 1.84% (range 1.05-1.83) triple stained cells. The entire group of leukemic marrows coexpressed triple stained cells with a frequency higher than 1% (range 1.1-48.6); furthermore, 10 samples contained the same population at frequencies higher than 10%. The difference between normal and leukemic marrows was statistically significant (p = < 0.001). Triple positive cells (TPc) from NBM were sorted for morphology, which proved to be consistent with myeloid progenitor features (early myeloblasts). This confirms that CD15+ CD34+ Class II+ precursors are commonly expressed in NMB, although at low frequency. Interestingly, 12 (80%) AMLs out of 15 were diagnosed as M1 (5) or M2 (7), while the remaining were M4 (2) and M5a (1). Additionally, all M2 cases were positive at percentages higher than 10%. Apparently CD15, CD34, class II expression correlates mainly with granulocyte differentiation. Two complete remission (CR) LBM, positive at onset for the triple combination, were regularly monitored. In one case the TPc percentage always remained near the normal values found in NBM (0.72%), and this patient is still in CR. In the other, overt relapse was preceded by a progressive increase in the TPc percentage. CONCLUSIONS: Although the presence in NBM of CD15+ CD34+ and class II+ precursors hinders minimal residual disease detection, we conclude that this unusual combination may distinguish a leukemic population and may allow monitoring of ""early relapse"".","['Venditti, A', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Stasi, R', 'De Fabriitis, P', 'Coppetelli, U', 'Bruno, A', 'Simone, M D', 'Papa, G']","['Venditti A', 'Del Poeta G', 'Stasi R', 'De Fabriitis P', 'Coppetelli U', 'Bruno A', 'Simone MD', 'Papa G']","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Ospedale S.

There is accumulating evidence, however, that murine stromal cells also promote maintenance and differentiation of very primitive human stem cells, which suggests the existence of novel stromal activities that cross species barriers. In this study, we show that a murine bone marrow-derived stromal cell line, MS-5, allows the proliferation of the human leukemic cell line UT-7. The long-term growth of UT-7 is usually supported only by human interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or erythropoietin (Epo). None of these three cytokines was involved in the observed effect, since murine GM-CSF and IL-3 do not act on human cells and MS-5 cells do not produce Epo. Soluble stem cell factor (SCF) induced UT-7 cell proliferation. However, S1/S1 mutant fibroblasts also supported UT-7 cell growth and anti-c-kit antibodies only partially abolished UT-7 cell proliferative response to MS-5 cells. These observations excluded a major role of SCF in this system. MS-5-derived growth-promoting activity was diffusible, but attempts to grow UT-7 cells in high levels of known soluble murine stromal-derived cytokines active on human cells showed no or minimal response, suggesting that MS-5's proliferative effect was not mediated by known cytokines. Finally, involvement of an autocrine loop of activation induced by MS-5 was excluded: RT-PCR analysis did not detect increased transcripts for GM-CSF, IL-3, IL-6, SCF, or Epo in UT-7 cells cocultured for 2 to 6 days with MS-5. In addition, UT-7 cell proliferation on MS-5 was not inhibited by neutralizing antibodies against the human GM-CSF receptor or the human IL-6 receptor alpha chain. Whether UT-7 cell proliferation triggered by MS-5 reflects the existence of novel stromal cytokines or results from synergistic interactions on the MS-5 cell surface between extracellular matrix proteins and cytokines will require further investigation.","['Auffray, I', 'Dubart, A', 'Izac, B', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Coulombel, L']","['Auffray I', 'Dubart A', 'Izac B', 'Vainchenker W', 'Coulombel L']","['INSERM U 362, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis/genetics', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Species Specificity', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 May;22(5):417-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we used several distinct differentiation inducers to measure changes in Q-family tRNA species during the erythroid differentiation of human K562 erythroleukemia cells. Treatment of K562 cells with 3.6 microM 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), 1 mM sodium butyrate, 0.1 mM hemin, or 5 microM 5-azacytidine resulted in growth inhibition, erythroid differentiation, and changes in queuine content of tRNA. In the presence of the irreversible inducer ara-C, the queuine content of tRNA increased markedly when the cells differentiated into benzidine-positive erythroid cells, and cell growth was inhibited. The increase in the queuine content of tRNA in differentiated K562 cells was an irreversible event. In cells incubated with the reversible inducer sodium butyrate, an increase in the queuine content of tRNA was correlated with the increase in benzidine-positive erythroid cells throughout the culturing period. After removal of the drug at 48 h, the queuine content of tRNA decreased concomitant with a decrease in benzidine-positive cells. Treatment with another reversible inducer, hemin, caused only a transient increase in the queuine content of tRNA, which was not correlated with the steady increase in benzidine-positive erythroid cells. The agent 5-azacytidine slightly inhibited cell growth but did not significantly change the percentage of benzidine-positive cells and the queuine content of tRNA. We further clarified the changes in queuine content of tRNA by analyzing the Q-containing isoacceptors of Q-family tRNA species including tRNA(Tyr), tRNA(His), tRNA(Asp), and tRNA(Asn) by RPC-5 chromatography, and found that the change in queuine content of tRNA(Tyr) was greater than the other Q-family tRNA species during induction by ara-C, sodium butyrate, and hemin. Our results indicate that the change in queuine content of tRNA is an irreversible event of terminal differentiation in ara-C induction and is a transient event of reversible differentiation in hemin induction. Sodium butyrate induction might represent a status between irreversible and reversible differentiation. Q-containing isoacceptors of tRNA might potentially play an important biological role during K562 cell differentiation.","['Chen, Y L', 'Wu, R T']","['Chen YL', 'Wu RT']","['Graduate Institute of Microbiology and Immunology, National Yang-Ming Medical College, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Asp)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, His)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Tyr)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '72496-59-4 (queuine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 6.1.1.12 (Aspartate-tRNA Ligase)', 'EC 6.1.1.22 (asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['*Aspartate-tRNA Ligase', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'RNA, Transfer, Amino Acyl/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Asp/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, His/metabolism', 'RNA, Transfer, Tyr/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Apr 15;54(8):2192-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Ph chromosome is a translocation chromosome which gains oncogenic potential through the fusion of the ABL oncogene of chromosome 9 with the BCR gene of chromosome 22. The Ph is believed to arise from random chromosome rearrangement with a subsequent selective advantage of the malignant cell line. However, alleles may be present in the population which predispose toward this specific rearrangement. We used a highly polymorphic CGG-repeat polymorphism within the first exon of the BCR gene to determine BCR allele frequencies among 26 leukemia patients with the Ph chromosome and 63 control individuals. Eight BCR alleles of variable CGG-repeat length were present in both groups at statistically similar frequencies and in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. We therefore concluded that there are no alleles of the BCR gene that have a major predisposing influence on the development of the Ph chromosome and subsequent leukemia.","['Riggins, G J', 'Sherman, S L', 'Phillips, C N', 'Stock, W', 'Westbrook, C A', 'Warren, S T']","['Riggins GJ', 'Sherman SL', 'Phillips CN', 'Stock W', 'Westbrook CA', 'Warren ST']","['Department of Biochemistry, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes, abl', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994 Feb;9(2):141-4. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870090211.,['10.1002/gcc.2870090211 [doi]'],,,,,"['ABL', 'BCR', 'HRAS']",,,,,,,,,,,,

I report that the cells' ability to produce leukotrienes is dependent on the cells' proliferative status or their provision with growth factors. Proliferating MC/9 and subconfluent RBL2H3 cells respond maximally to stimulation by 1 microM ionomycin with the production of 56 and 32 pmol of cysteinyl-leukotrienes/10(6) cells respectively. In contrast, confluent RBL2H3 or growth-arrested MC/9 cells lose their ability to generate leukotrienes in response to ionomycin treatment. This rapid down-regulation of leukotriene synthesis is also observed when proliferating RBL2H3 cells are transferred to growth-factor-free medium, wherein cellular leukotriene-synthesis capacity has an apparent half-lifetime of 60 min. Transfer back into growth medium results in the regeneration of leukotriene synthesis capacity within 6 h. In growth-arrested MC/9 cells, leukotriene production ability can at least partially be restored by priming the cells with interleukin 3, but not with interleukin 4. In RBL2H3 cells, pretreatment with protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein (5 min, 37 microM), herbimycin A (6 h, 3 microM) or tyrphostin 25 (16 h, 100 microM) completely inhibits leukotriene generation, whereas okadaic acid (15 min, 0.5 microM) has no effect. Under these conditions, both genistein and herbimycin A strongly impair ionomycin-induced protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Our study indicates that leukotriene generation in these tumour cells is tightly regulated by their proliferation status and supply with growth factors, and cell stimulation towards leukotriene synthesis appears to involve protein tyrosine kinase activity.","['Hagmann, W']",['Hagmann W'],"['Division of Tumor Biochemistry 0245, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '118409-60-2 (tyrphostin 47)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzoquinones', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Genistein', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', '*Tyrphostins']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Apr 15;299 ( Pt 2):467-72. doi: 10.1042/bj2990467.,['10.1042/bj2990467 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC1138295,,,,,,,,,

Initial studies indicated that when mice were treated with an anti-TJ6 binding mAb early in pregnancy, the pregnancies were completely ablated and that TJ6 expression is enhanced dramatically during pregnancy. In addition we have cloned the cDNA for TJ6 which encodes a possible transmembrane domain that may include six to seven transmembrane regions. Therefore, we examined TJ6 expression on PBL of pregnant and non-pregnant women and found that TJ6 is expressed primarily on CD19+ B cells from pregnant but not nonpregnant women. TJ6 was not expressed on CD3+ lymphocytes from either group but was expressed on CD56+ cells from a small population of pregnant women which preliminary data indicate may correlate with the occurrence of spontaneous abortion in these women. Here we also show that TJ6 transcripts are highly expressed in the developing fetoplacental unit as well as in the developing thymus. We also begin to characterize the expression of TJ6 isoforms in an acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line (SB), murine thymus, and the developing murine fetoplacental unit, as well as the expression of a membrane form of TJ6 present on human lymphocytes during pregnancy. All of these cells and tissues expressed TJ6 proteins which were smaller than predicted based on either the cDNA sequence or the in vitro translation even though they expressed mRNA similar in size. The TJ6 isoforms varied in size from the 45-kDa isoform in SB cells to the 52-kDa isoform of the fetoplacental unit to a 70-kDa isoform in murine thymus. Flow cytometric analysis also demonstrated that similar to the CD19+ B cells from pregnant women, TJ6 is expressed on the surface of SB cells.","['Nichols, T C', 'Kang, J A', 'Angkachatchai, V', 'Beer, A E', 'Beaman, K D']","['Nichols TC', 'Kang JA', 'Angkachatchai V', 'Beer AE', 'Beaman KD']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Health Sciences/The Chicago Medical School, North Chicago, Illinois 60064.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)', '0 (TJ6 immune suppressor factor, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*chemistry', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*analysis/genetics']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1994 Apr 15;155(1):219-29. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1994.1114.,"['S0008-8749(84)71114-2 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1994.1114 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly explanted cells had lymphoid morphology with a CD5+ CD45R (B220)- IgM- phenotype. They were not viable in unstimulated cultures, but formed IgM+ lymphoid colonies in response to interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, and Steel factor, and macrophage colonies in response to IL-3. IL-3-stimulated colonies had no recloning potential, but colonies from IL-7 cultures gave rise to large numbers of secondary macrophage colonies in IL-3-stimulated cultures and secondary lymphoid colonies in IL-7-stimulated cultures. The latter ones could be serially transferred in vitro for several months, and formed typical PGM-2 tumors in vivo. IL-7-stimulated colonies could therefore be used to measure leukemic stem cells in vitro. Supramaximal IL-3 stimulation (2,500 U/mL) of suspension cultures was followed by an increase in overall cell numbers and a disappearance of leukemic stem cells, compatible with differentiation induction. This could not be counteracted by simultaneous stimulation with IL-7. However, lower IL-3 concentrations (500 U/mL) induced an expansion of the stem cell pool, possibly by facilitating density-dependent autostimulatory mechanisms involving endogenous production of IL-7. The system described is a simple in vitro model for differentiation therapy. It shows that leukemic stem cells can be induced by hematopoietic growth factors to undergo terminal differentiation, but the concentrations required for differentiation induction in stem cells are much higher than those required for other biologic effects. Submaximal stimulation may favor expansion rather than repression of the leukemic cell population.","['Duhrsen, U', 'Knieling, G', 'Wu, H X', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Duhrsen U', 'Knieling G', 'Wu HX', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Abteilung fur Onkologie und Hamatologie, Universitatskrankenhaus Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-5/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2627-36.,['S0006-4971(20)70040-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD5 was expressed on leukemic cells in 21 of 26 cases (CD5+) but not in 5 cases (CD5-). Myelomonocytic marker, CD13 antigen was expressed on the leukemic cells in all 5 CD5- cases but in none of CD5+ cases. Leukemic cells in CD5- cases also expressed CD11b antigen more frequently than those in CD5+ cases (80% v 11%; P < .01). Another myeloid marker, CD33, was expressed neither on CD5+ nor CD5- leukemic cells. CD22, a restricted B-cell marker, was expressed more frequently on CD5- leukemic cells than on CD5+ leukemic cells (80% v 33%; P < .05). Another restricted B-cell activation marker, CD23, was expressed at similar frequency in both the CD5+ and CD5- groups (67% v 60%). Although CD45RA was expressed on the majority of leukemic B cells, the CD45RA expression level was significantly higher among CD5- cases than CD5+ cases (P < .01). In the analysis of VH gene expressed in chronic B-cell leukemias by polymerase chain reaction amplification, CD5+ cases preferentially used VH4 family members (48%; 10 of 21). CD5- cases, on the other hand, mainly used VH3 family (80%; 4 of 5). Thus, from our present observation of an albeit limited patient population, we have found an association between VH gene family use and CD5 antigen expression in chronic B-cell leukemias. We have also shown the differential expression of myelomonocytic markers in the CD5+ and CD5- chronic B-cell leukemias. These result are in agreement with previous suggestions that CD5 positivity is the hallmark for distinct clinical entity commonly referred to in the literature as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Ikematsu, W', 'Ikematsu, H', 'Okamura, S', 'Otsuka, T', 'Harada, M', 'Niho, Y']","['Ikematsu W', 'Ikematsu H', 'Okamura S', 'Otsuka T', 'Harada M', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2602-10.,['S0006-4971(20)70037-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human BM stromal cell membrane fractions have been prepared from Dexter-type cultures after cell lysis by sonification and differential centrifugations of the sonification contents. The 20,000 g pellets representing membrane fractions have been solubilized by 2% Triton X-100, 0.575% LDS, and 8 mol/L urea in sequential order. The protein extracts are fractionated by LDS-PAGE and screened for CAMs by the new cell-blotting technique. This led to identification of nine protein bands in lanes containing LDS extracts showing adhesion of KG1a (CD34+ progenitor myeloid) cells. Evidence that the BM proteins exhibiting KG1a cell adhesion are novel CAMs is based on the observations that these proteins, in comparison with known CAMs, specifically VCAM-1, CD54, and CD44, show (1) contrasting detergent-solubility properties, (2) different temperature requirement for mediating cell adhesion function, and (3) markedly distinct electrophoretic mobilities. The various cell types tested, notably KG1a, NALM-6, WIL-2, Ramos, HS-Sultan, K562, JY B lymphoblastoid cells, and T lymphoblasts, showed distinctive patterns of binding to different subsets of BM CAMs. These results demonstrate a new approach to studies of molecular mechanisms that may determine specificity of hematopoietic cellular localization within BM microenvironment and may play an important role in controlling hematopoiesis.","['Seshi, B']",['Seshi B'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Polyvinyls)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '24937-79-9 (polyvinylidene fluoride)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Polyvinyls', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 May 1;83(9):2399-409.,['S0006-4971(20)70013-3 [pii]'],,,['S7RR05403-29/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently identified a 150-kD glycoprotein ligand for E-selectin on mouse myeloid cells, using a recombinant antibody-like form of mouse E-selectin. Here, we report that this ligand does not bind to an analogous P-selectin fusion protein. Instead, the chimeric P-selectin-IgG protein recognizes a 160-kD glycoprotein on the mouse neutrophil progenitor 32D cl 3, on mature mouse neutrophils and on human HL60 cells. The binding is Ca(2+)-dependent and requires the presence of sialic acid on the ligand. This P-selectin-ligand is not recognized by E-selectin. Removal of N-linked carbohydrate side chains from the 150-kD and the 160-kD monospecific selectin ligands abolishes the binding of both ligands to the respective selectin. Treatment of HL60 cells with Peptide: N-glycosidase F inhibited cell binding to P- and E-selectin. In addition, glycoproteins of 230 and 130 kD were found on mature mouse neutrophils, which bound both to E- and P-selectin in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. The signals detected for these ligands were 15-20-fold weaker than those for the monospecific ligands. Both proteins were heavily sialylated and selectin-binding was blocked by removal of sialic acid, but not by removal of N-linked carbohydrates. Our data reveal that E- and P-selectin recognize two categories of glycoprotein ligands: one type requires N-linked carbohydrates for binding and is monospecific for each of the two selectins and the other type binds independent of N-linked carbohydrates and is common for both endothelial selectins.","['Lenter, M', 'Levinovitz, A', 'Isenmann, S', 'Vestweber, D']","['Lenter M', 'Levinovitz A', 'Isenmann S', 'Vestweber D']","['Hans Spemann Laboratory, Max Planck Institute for Immunology, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.57 (O-sialoglycoprotein endopeptidase)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.52 (Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'E-Selectin', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Metalloendopeptidases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'P-Selectin', 'Peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminyl) Asparagine Amidase', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1994 Apr;125(2):471-81. doi: 10.1083/jcb.125.2.471.,['10.1083/jcb.125.2.471 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC2120038,,,,,,,,,

The OA200 cells were cross-resistant not only to another PP1/PP2A inhibitor, calyculin A, but also to structurally unrelated anticancer drugs (such as vinblastine and taxol) and furthermore, overexpressed the verapamil-sensitive drug pump P-glycoprotein at both the protein and mRNA levels. The mutant, however, was not cross-resistant to several PKC inhibitors tested including cardiotoxin, mastoparan, staurosporine, and an alkylphospholipid. Cardiotoxin, at a subtoxic concentration, enhanced by 6-fold vinblastine cytotoxicity in OA200 cells. These findings indicate that the multidrug resistance phenotype can be induced by cytotoxic agents other than conventional anticancer drugs, show that the development of multidrug resistance is not necessarily associated with increased cPKC activity, and identify certain PKC inhibitors that have potential as resistance modulators.","['Zheng, B', 'Chambers, T C', 'Raynor, R L', 'Markham, P N', 'Gebel, H M', 'Vogler, W R', 'Kuo, J F']","['Zheng B', 'Chambers TC', 'Raynor RL', 'Markham PN', 'Gebel HM', 'Vogler WR', 'Kuo JF']","['Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cobra Cardiotoxin Proteins/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Poly A/analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/biosynthesis/deficiency/*metabolism', 'RNA/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*toxicity']",1994/04/22 00:00,1994/04/22 00:01,['1994/04/22 00:00'],"['1994/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 22;269(16):12332-8.,['S0021-9258(17)32720-5 [pii]'],,,"['CA-29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57470/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

De-N-glycosylation induces dissociation or altered association of alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits and concomitant loss of fibronectin binding activity.,12325-31,"Fibronectin (FN)-mediated cell adhesion is controlled mainly by alpha 5 beta 1 (recognizing the RGD sequence) and alpha 4 beta 1 (recognizing the CS-1 peptide sequence of FN) integrin receptors. Integrin-dependent cell adhesion to FN is greatly promoted by optimal GM3 concentration at the surface membrane (Zheng, M., Fang, H., Tsuruoka, T., Tsuji, T., Sasaki, T., and Hakomori, S. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2217-2222), and cell adhesion mediated by alpha 4 beta 1 (to FN) or alpha 6 beta 1 (to laminin) is inhibited by modifying N-glycosylation processing of the integrin receptor (e.g. Akiyama, S. K., Yamada, S. S., and Yamada, K. M. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 18011-18018). We therefore studied the specific role of N-glycosylation in alpha 5 beta 1 function. Key findings of the present study were as follows. (i) Adhesion of K562 cells to FN-coated plates, which is mediated solely by alpha 5 beta 1, was inhibited when cells were treated with a mixture of endo-N-acetylglucosaminidase F and peptide -N4-(N-acetylglucosaminyl)asparagine amidase F (endo-F/PNGase-F). (ii) The alpha 5 beta 1 receptor at the K562 cell surface tended to dissociate into alpha 5 and beta 1 subunits when an extract of cells treated with endo-F/PNGase-F was precipitated by integrin subunit-specific antibodies, i.e. the alpha 5 subunit was preferentially precipitated by anti-alpha 5 monoclonal antibody ZH5, and the beta 1 subunit was preferentially precipitated by anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibody ZH1. When intact cells were extracted and treated with either ZH5 or ZH1, both alpha 5 and beta 1 were coprecipitated, indicating that the two subunits are normally tightly associated with each other. (iii) Adhesion of alpha 5 beta 1-containing liposomes (phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol liposomes incorporating purified alpha 5 beta 1) to FN-coated plates was abolished by treatment of liposomes with endo-F/PNGase-F. Liposomes incorporating alpha 5 beta 1 pretreated with endo-F/PNGase-F also did not bind to FN. When purified alpha 5 beta 1 receptor was treated with endo-F/PNGase-F followed by ZH5 or ZH1, the alpha 5 or beta 1 subunit was precipitated separately, respectively. In contrast, both subunits were always coprecipitated when intact purified alpha 5 beta 1 receptor was directly treated with ZH5 or ZH1. These findings indicate that N-glycosylation of both the alpha and beta subunits of the alpha 5 beta 1 integrin receptor is essential for association of these subunits and for optimal binding to FN.","['Zheng, M', 'Fang, H', 'Hakomori, S']","['Zheng M', 'Fang H', 'Hakomori S']","['Biomembrane Institute, Seattle, Washington 98119.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Integrins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Structural', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/analysis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/22 00:00,1994/04/22 00:01,['1994/04/22 00:00'],"['1994/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 22;269(16):12325-31.,['S0021-9258(17)32719-9 [pii]'],,,['CA42505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison with pathways activated by granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor.,12084-91,"Steel factor (SF), also referred to as Kit ligand, stem cell factor, or mast cell growth factor, is essential for the development of hematopoietic stem cells in vivo. It is shown here that SF is mainly a survival factor for hemopoietic cells with little if any proliferative effect. In contrast, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) acts both as a survival factor and as a potent growth factor. We have probed the pathways activated by SF and GM-CSF in suppression of active cell death (apoptosis) using two classes of inhibitors: Tyrphostins that are specific inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinase, and amiloride derivatives (5-(N,N-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride) that have been designed as specific inhibitors of the Na+/H+ antiporter. Both SF-dependent and GM-CSF-dependent pathways are sensitive to inhibition by Tyrphostins with, nonetheless, a quantitative difference. All Tyrphostins tested are more potent inhibitors of c-Kit than of GM-CSF receptor triggered pathways, the most striking being Tyrphostin B42 that is 10 times more potent. In contrast to the discrepancy in Tyrphostin dose-response curves, titration curves for 5-(N-ethyl-n-isopropyl)amiloride and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride are comparable in SF- or GM-CSF-stimulated cells. Furthermore, SF induces a rapid and sustained alkalinization of the intracellular pH, as assessed with the pH-sensitive probe 2',7'-bis(2-carboxyethyl)-5-carboxyfluorescein. Taken together, our data indicate that input from two distinct pathways with discrepancy in immediate early events, that of c-Kit and GM-CSF receptor, results in a common output, activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter and suppression of apoptosis by the two ligands.","['Caceres-Cortes, J', 'Rajotte, D', 'Dumouchel, J', 'Haddad, P', 'Hoang, T']","['Caceres-Cortes J', 'Rajotte D', 'Dumouchel J', 'Haddad P', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '118409-60-2 (tyrphostin 47)', '1428-95-1 (5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'VW50CE070T (ethylisopropylamiloride)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Staurosporine', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Tyrphostins']",1994/04/22 00:00,1994/04/22 00:01,['1994/04/22 00:00'],"['1994/04/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/22 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Apr 22;269(16):12084-91.,['S0021-9258(17)32684-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A comparison of physicochemical properties of the hybrids poly(A)-poly(dT) and dinitrophenyl-poly(A)-poly(dT) shows that the hydrophobic dinitrophenyl groups stabilize double helical structures. These inhibitors were also found to be effective in keeping susceptible lymphocytes viable in the presence of HIV-1 (wild type).

Recently, it has been demonstrated that alpha 2M is also produced by cultured astrocytes from newborn rat brain and has neurite-promoting activity. Here, we found that the expression of the alpha 2M gene was significantly enhanced in the brain following intraperitoneal injection of the neurotoxicant, kainic acid (KA), suggesting that alpha 2M acts as an acute-phase protein in the brain, as in the case of the liver, and may be involved in neural repair processes. Expression of alpha 2M in cultured astrocytes was shown to be stimulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and/or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the presence of glucocorticoid. The amount of mRNAs for IL-6 and LIF increased in the brain of KA-injected rats prior to alpha 2M induction. These results strongly suggested that IL-6 and LIF are involved in alpha 2M induction in the brain, as in the case of the liver. Analysis of the cis-acting element(s) and the trans-acting factor(s) suggested that the regulatory mechanism for alpha 2M expression in astrocytes was similar to that in inflamed liver.","['Higuchi, M', 'Ito, T', 'Imai, Y', 'Iwaki, T', 'Hattori, M', 'Kohsaka, S', 'Niho, Y', 'Sakaki, Y']","['Higuchi M', 'Ito T', 'Imai Y', 'Iwaki T', 'Hattori M', 'Kohsaka S', 'Niho Y', 'Sakaki Y']","['Laboratory for Molecular Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha-Macroglobulins)', 'SIV03811UC (Kainic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*metabolism', 'Autoradiography', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Kainic Acid/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'alpha-Macroglobulins/*genetics']",1994/04/20 00:00,1994/04/20 00:01,['1994/04/20 00:00'],"['1994/04/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/20 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 1994 Apr 20;141(2):155-62. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(94)90565-7.,"['0378-1119(94)90565-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(94)90565-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from the PGP-negative parent cell line H69/P and the multidrug resistant (MDR)-variant H69/LX4 could be clearly distinguished by immunostaining with the anti-PGP monoclonal antibody MRK16. In leukaemic blasts, the differences in fluorescence intensities between samples incubated with the idiotypic nonspecific (control sample) and specific antibody (test sample) were small, resulting in nondisjunct distributions. Only in a few leukaemia specimens were PGP-expressing cells detectable by simple subtraction of histograms using a threshold. Therefore, an improved histogram subtraction analysis, based on curve fitting and a statistical test, was applied to distinguish antigen-positive from antigen-negative cells. Moreover, a multiparametric staining procedure employing propidium iodide (PI) and Hoechst 33342 was used to reduce staining artefacts. By this approach, leukaemic cells with low expression of PGP were detected in 39 out of 60 cases. Subpopulations with strong PGP expression, resulting in disjunct fluorescence distributions, were not observed. Only in 5 out of 60 specimens were PGP expressing cells detected by a conventional subtraction of histograms using a threshold. Comparison of data obtained with or without the multiparametric gating procedure indicated that the increase in sensitivity was mainly due to the application of the data analysis. However, exclusion of cell debris using PI and Hoechst staining properties reduced the deviation of data from mean values.

The synergic NK stimulatory effect was more commonly found in samples from patients with active disease, while the additive effect was more frequent in the patients in remission. The IL-2/IFN beta combination provoked a nonadditive nonsynergic NK-stimulatory effect in a further 19.8% samples. The targets of the IL-2/IFN beta combination were typical NK cells, as shown by the fact that there was increased cytotoxicity (synergic, additive or nonadditive nonsynergic) against the K562, but not the Daudi cell line in peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples treated with the combination of the two cytokines. When CD16+/CD56+ or CD57+/CD16+/CD56+ cells were removed, the NK-stimulatory effect was lost. The fact that the NK-cell-enhancing activity of the IL-2/IFN beta combination was reduced when Percoll fractions 2 and 3 were used, but still persisted in 66% of tests, may have been due to cytotoxicity being higher in the untreated fractions 2 and 3 than in the untreated unfractionated samples. One of the factors responsible for the NK-stimulatory effect appears to be the capacity of the IL-2/IFN beta combination to trigger an increase in IFN gamma synthesis. If similar experiments give like results in samples from patients suffering from other B-cell lymphoproliferative, or HIV-associated disorders, all of which are characterized by a deficiency in NK activity, it should be possible to use low-dose IL-2/IFN beta to treat these disorders and, perhaps, residual neoplastic disease without exposing the patient to undue toxicity. Further, by testing other combinations one should be able to identify the lowest IL-2 and IFN beta doses that would effectively boost the additive or synergic effect in a greater number of cases.","['Liberati, A M', 'De Angelis, V', 'Fizzotti, M', 'Schippa, M', 'Cecchini, M', 'Adiuto, D', 'Di Clemente, F', 'Palmisano, L', 'Micozzi, E', 'Zuccaccia, M']","['Liberati AM', 'De Angelis V', 'Fizzotti M', 'Schippa M', 'Cecchini M', 'Adiuto D', 'Di Clemente F', 'Palmisano L', 'Micozzi E', 'Zuccaccia M', 'et al.']","['Istituto Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'CD56 Antigen', 'CD57 Antigens', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1994 May;38(5):323-31. doi: 10.1007/BF01525511.,['10.1007/BF01525511 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD5, a 67-kd glycoprotein, has been reported to be a consistent feature of the malignant B cell membrane phenotype in CLL. We used an in vitro B cell colony assay to study the in vitro growth, differentiation, and cell surface properties of CLL B cells. Finally, a variety of standard clinical parameters were collated for each patient. Monoclonal antibodies to both CD5 and CD19 (pan B cell marker) were used to perform 2-color flow cytometry on freshly purified CLL B cells and on CLL B cells harvested after 7 days of in vitro culture. We demonstrate here that CLL B cells are heterogeneous with respect to their expression of CD5, and that this expression is not fixed but may vary both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro growth potential, as measured by the B cell colony assay, was also heterogeneous with three subgroups defined as low growth (< 10 colonies), intermediate (10-100 colonies) and high growth (> 100 colonies). Furthermore a T cell conditioned medium was not found to be a requirement for in vitro colony growth in the majority of CLL B cells. In addition, we evaluated the potential correlation of B cell CD5 phenotype or B cell colony growth on standard clinical parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hings, I', 'Kay, N E', 'Ranheim, E', 'Seroogy, C', 'Parson, R E']","['Hings I', 'Kay NE', 'Ranheim E', 'Seroogy C', 'Parson RE']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Dec;12(1-2):59-67. doi: 10.3109/10428199309059572.,['10.3109/10428199309059572 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In studies of BM purging with chemical agents, monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), or other agents, the emphasis has been on the efficacy of tumor cell removal and sparing of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Two commonly used methods of BM purging for patients with acute myeloid leukemia have been the drug 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC) and (MoAbs) directed to myeloid antigens such as CD14, CD15, and CD33. Although both methods of BM purging have potent activity against leukemia cells, 4-HC is also quite toxic to normal hematopoietic progenitor cells in the same concentrations that are used to deplete leukemia cells. To further characterize the cellular composition of BM after purging, we examined the effects of MoAbs plus complement and 4-HC on cells of the lymphoid lineage in the BM. 4-HC exerted a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity on clonogenic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and lymphokine (interleukin-2)-activated killer (LAK) cells, whereas the anti-CD14 and anti-CD15 MoAbs had little effect. At a concentration of 4-HC commonly used for BM purging (60 micrograms/mL), there were 4 to 5 logs of T-cell depletion and almost complete elimination of NK- and LAK-cell activity. In contrast, 4-HC at low concentrations (eg, 3 micrograms/mL) spared the majority of lymphoid cells suggesting that low concentration 4-HC combined with MoAb purging may be a desirable alternative to higher concentration 4-HC. These data indicate that purging with antimyeloid MoAbs, but not with 4-HC, spares the function of mature graft lymphocytes. Infusion of viable lymphocytes may be important for the transfer of immune memory against microbial and neoplastic antigens and may hasten immune reconstitution. In addition, mature graft lymphocytes may also be selectively activated and expanded in conjunction with interleukin-2 administration after BM transplantation.","['Zhong, R K', 'Donnenberg, A D', 'Rubin, J', 'Ball, E D']","['Zhong RK', 'Donnenberg AD', 'Rubin J', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center 15213.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 15;83(8):2345-51.,['S0006-4971(20)73246-5 [pii]'],,,"['AI27297/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In coculture, a significant percentage of cells from the human myeloid leukemic cell lines HL-60, PLB-985, and K562 adhere to fibroblastic KM-102 BM stromal cells. A sensitive two-color immunofluorescence assay was developed to monitor stromal cellular effects upon leukemic cell differentiation. After chemical induction with 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, strongly adherent HL-60 and PLB-985 cells were inhibited from differentiating into more mature monocytic cells, as measured by the monocytic surface marker CD14. In contrast, loosely adherent and nonadherent HL-60 and PLB-985 leukemic cells in the same cocultures, as well as both adherent and nonadherent K562 cells induced with phorbol ester, were not blocked in their capacity to differentiate. Scanning electron microscopy and intercellular dye transfer experiments correlated intimate stromal cell/leukemic cell interaction and intercellular communication with the blockade of leukemic cell differentiation.

Cloning and sequencing of the PCR products identified this Notch homologue as TAN-1, a member of the Notch family previously cloned from a T-cell leukemia with a translocation involving this gene. Subsequent evaluation of bone marrow hematopoietic cells for TAN-1 expression using a reverse transcription-PCR assay confirmed the expression of TAN-1 in CD34+ hematopoietic precursors, including the immature subset that lacks expression of lineage-associated antigens (CD34+lin-).

However, thrombocytopenia progressed when rhG-CSF administration was tapered. When the dose was increased again, leukemic blasts were found to proliferate. When rhG-CSF was discontinued, blasts rapidly decreased in the peripheral blood. Chromosomal analysis revealed a complex abnormality during the first relapse, a normal 46,XY karyotype during the partial response, and recurrence of the same complex abnormality during leukemic transformation. The stimulation index of marrow mononuclear cells cultured with rhG-CSF increased with disease progression. These findings suggest that rhG-CSF initially stimulated the selective proliferation of normal hemopoietic cells, but the evolution or selection of a leukemic clone responsive to rhG-CSF appears to have occurred subsequently.","['Ueda, T', 'Kawai, Y', 'Sugiyama, T', 'Takeuchi, N', 'Yoshida, A', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Wano, Y', 'Tsutani, H', 'Kamada, N', 'Nakamura, T']","['Ueda T', 'Kawai Y', 'Sugiyama T', 'Takeuchi N', 'Yoshida A', 'Iwasaki H', 'Wano Y', 'Tsutani H', 'Kamada N', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Dec;59(1):47-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has also been suggested that similar information can be obtained by CD34 immunostaining of bone marrow biopsy specimens. To test this hypothesis, the authors studied 59 conventionally fixed, paraffin-embedded bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens, representing the three phases of the disease (stable, accelerated, and blast crisis). Immunohistochemical staining for CD34 was performed using QBEnd10, a monoclonal antibody reactive in routine paraffin-embedded tissue. The differences in CD34 positivity among chronic, accelerated, and blastic phases of CML were highly significant (P = .0001). This study demonstrated that CD34 immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow biopsy specimens represents a reliable method for classifying patients with CML and may provide essential diagnostic and prognostic information when a marrow aspirate is unavailable.","['Orazi, A', 'Neiman, R S', 'Cualing, H', 'Heerema, N A', 'John, K']","['Orazi A', 'Neiman RS', 'Cualing H', 'Heerema NA', 'John K']","['Department of Pathology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*classification/immunology/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retrospective Studies']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1994 Apr;101(4):426-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/101.4.426.,['10.1093/ajcp/101.4.426 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that CNTF, LIF, OSM, and IL6 induce most of the same protein tyrosine phosphorylations, regardless of the cell type assayed or whether they initiate signaling by inducing homo- or heterodimerization of beta components. Although several of the protein tyrosine phosphorylations induced by the CNTF/LIF/OSM/IL6 family of factors may correspond to novel tyrosine kinase targets, we have been able to demonstrate the involvement of known signaling molecules, such as phospholipase C gamma, phosphoinositol 3-kinase, phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP1D), pp120, SHC, GRB2, STAT91, Raf-1, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, revealing substantial convergence not only between the pathways activated by this cytokine family and other cytokines, but with pathways previously known to be activated only by factors that utilize receptor tyrosine kinases.

An unusual variation of acute myelogenous leukemia associated with 8;21 chromosomal translocation and blast expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule.,2107-12,"This study reports on a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in remission who had a series of 11 granulocytic sarcomas (chloromas or myeloblastomas) appearing periodically over a 29-month interval in a variety of anatomic sites without evidence of bone marrow recurrence. This isolated extramedullary recurrence of AML is distinctly unusual with only 24 cases described previously. This patient had the greatest number and longest reported interval of recurrent granulocytic sarcomas (GS) before bone marrow relapse. Furthermore, he represents the first case of a patient with GS presenting with both an 8;21 chromosomal translocation and neural cell adhesion molecule (CD56) expression. The authors hypothesize that these two abnormalities identified previously as predisposing factors to GS may, in fact, be synergistic for this phenomenon. His case and the review of the literature demonstrate some of the important clinical and management features of a patient who develops GS while in complete marrow remission from previous AML. Although highly sensitive to radiation therapy, the onset of granulocytic sarcomas is almost always followed by bone marrow relapse and should be treated with aggressive reinduction chemotherapy and local irradiation. Such therapy is associated with the longest interval of disease-free survival.","['Byrd, J C', 'Weiss, R B']","['Byrd JC', 'Weiss RB']","['Department of Medicine, Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC 20307.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'CD56 Antigen', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal/*physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1994/04/15 00:00,1994/04/15 00:01,['1994/04/15 00:00'],"['1994/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Apr 15;73(8):2107-12. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940415)73:8<2107::aid-cncr2820730815>3.0.co;2-w.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19940415)73:8<2107::aid-cncr2820730815>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],,,['CA 26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,41,,,,,,,,,,

We now present data on the cloning and structural analysis of the murine D4 cDNA and confirm its preferential expression in hematopoietic tissues. The predicted murine and human D4 proteins are almost 90% identical, indicating that D4 and rhoGDI are different genes and that they are probably members of a related family of genes. Functional studies with the human D4 protein demonstrate that D4 has GDI activity against the CDC42Hs and rac I proteins, but binds to these proteins with a significantly weaker affinity than does the rho-subtype GDI. These data suggest that D4, which will in subsequent communications be denoted as GDI.D4, might be a GDI for other known or as yet unidentified ras-like GTP-binding proteins. Alternatively, D4 could have other biochemical functions. During murine embryogenesis, D4 transcripts are detected in yolk-sac cells, where the earliest hematopoietic precursors are found. When these precursors undergo proliferation and differentiation in vitro, a dramatic increase in D4 expression is seen. D4 probably has a significant function during the growth and development of hematopoietic precursors.","['Adra, C N', 'Ko, J', 'Leonard, D', 'Wirth, L J', 'Cerione, R A', 'Lim, B']","['Adra CN', 'Ko J', 'Leonard D', 'Wirth LJ', 'Cerione RA', 'Lim B']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Beth Israel Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (ARHGDIA protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor alpha)', '0 (rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Organ Specificity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Yolk Sac/metabolism', 'cdc42 GTP-Binding Protein', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'rho Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitor alpha', 'rho-Specific Guanine Nucleotide Dissociation Inhibitors']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993 Dec;8(4):253-61. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870080408.,['10.1002/gcc.2870080408 [doi]'],,,,,"['CDI.D4', 'D4', 'ECT2', 'GAP', 'RAS', 'RAS-GAP', 'RASGDS', 'VAV']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The ABL probe hybridized to both chromosomes 9 at band q34, while two other probes which map centromeric and telomeric of BCR on 22q11 hybridized solely with chromosome 22. For the first time, a BCR-ABL rearrangement is shown to take place on 9q34 instead of in the usual location on 22q11. A rearrangement in the latter site is found in all Ph-positive CML and in almost all investigated CML with variant Ph or Ph-negative, BCR-positive cases. The few aberrant chromosomal localizations of BCR-ABL recombinant genes found previously were apparently the result of complex and successive changes. Furthermore in patient 2, both chromosomes 9 showed positive FISH signals with both ABL and BCR probes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated that mitotic recombination had occurred on the long arm of chromosome 9 and that the rearranged chromosome 9 was of paternal origin. The leukemic cells of this patient showed a duplication of the BCR-ABL gene, analogous to duplication of the Ph chromosome in classic CML.

In a wide variety of solid tumor types, mutations of both groups of genes have been implicated in the tumorigenic process. In hematologic neoplasms, on the other hand, most attention has focused on illegitimate activation of oncogenes, e.g., deregulation leading to disturbed transcriptional activity and structural rearrangements resulting in hybrid genes. Whether loss or mutational inactivation of tumor suppressor genes also plays an essential role in the genesis of tumors of the hematopoietic system has received less attention. Because such inactivation can be the result of karyotypically detectable loss of chromosomal material, cytogenetic studies may prove helpful in pinpointing genomic sites that harbor tumor suppressor genes. The present study is based on a total of 12,473 cytogenetically abnormal hematologic neoplasms reported in the literature to date. Among these, we selected the 6,422 cases with sole clonal chromosomal abnormalities in order to include only aberrations of importance in the genesis, rather than in the progression, of these neoplasms. All tumors with monosomies or structural abnormalities resulting in loss of chromosomal material were compiled, and for every such structural aberration, i.e., deletion, unbalanced translocation, isochromosome, and ring chromosome, the chromosome bands lost were ascertained. This cytogenetic deletion mapping revealed that the most commonly lost chromosomes were Y and 7 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), and chronic myeloproliferative disorders (MPD); X, Y, 7, 20, and 21 in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL); X, Y, and 17 in chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (LPD); and X and Y in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Chromosome segments/bands lost due to unbalanced structural abnormalities in at least 5% of the cases were 5q13-33, 7q22-36, 9q13-31, 11q23-25, 12p12-13, 17p11-13, and 20q11-13 in AML; 5q13-35 and 20q11-13 in MDS; 5q22-23, 7q22, 13q12-22, 17p11-13, and 20q11-13 in MPD; 6q15-27, 9p11-24, 12p12-13, and 19p13 in ALL; 6q16-27, 11q21-25, 13q13-14, and 14q32 in LPD; and 6q21-27, 11q13-25, and 14q24-32 in NHL. Based on these findings, three conclusions can be drawn. First, there is no good correspondence between total and partial monosomies, the only exception being -7 and 7q-, both of which are common in myeloid neoplasms. This indicates different pathogenetic effects of total and partial losses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Johansson, B', 'Mertens, F', 'Mitelman, F']","['Johansson B', 'Mertens F', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', '*Sequence Deletion']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1993 Dec;8(4):205-18. doi: 10.1002/gcc.2870080402.,['10.1002/gcc.2870080402 [doi]'],,,,,"['BCR/ABL', 'CDC25C', 'FER', 'FMS', 'GM-CSF', 'IFN', 'IRF1', 'MYB', 'RB1']",,60,,,,,,,,,,

Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been generated in order to identify functional regions of gp46. We obtained three monoclonal antibodies (3F3F10, 4F5F6 and 7G5D8) by immunizing Balb/c mice with beta-propiolactone inactivated HTLV-I producing cells and partially purified gp46. The mAbs are of the IgG 1 subclass. They have been characterized by western blot analysis, reactivity with HTLV-I and HTLV-II producing cells and ELISA binding assays using synthetic peptides. The immunoblot analysis performed with sheets prepared with the virus released by HUT 102 and 2060 cells (an HTLV-I virus producing cell line established in our laboratory) indicate that the three mAbs recognize a 46 kDa product as did the anti -gp46 mAb 0.5 alpha (18). Reactivity of the three mAbs with various cell lines was examined by indirect immunofluorescence assay. The mAb 7G5D8 stained strongly the membrane of all HTLV-I producing cells (MT2, C91/PL, HUT102 and cells of seven lines established in our laboratory and by A. Gessain); uninfected lymphoid cells (HSB-2, MOLT 4, CEM and PHA activated lymphocytes from normal donors) were negative. Interestingly cells of a HTLV-II producing line (344 MO) were positive. The mAbs 3F3F10 and 4F5F6 reacted with the same cells as did 7G5D8 but the fluorescence intensity was much lower than that observed with this later. A long synthetic peptide corresponding to the immunodominant region of the gp46 defined by the amino acids 175-199 and 10-mer peptides overlapping this region were used in an approach to identify the recognized epitope(s). The long 175-199 peptide was recognized by the three mAbs. 3F3F10 and 4F5F6 recognized none of the 10-mer peptides whereas 7G5D8 bound to 186-195 and 182-191 peptides. In addition 7G5D8 did not inhibit either syncytia formation or virus infection. In view of the data concerning the previously described mAbs 0.5 alpha, LAT 27 (5) and KE36-11 (6), our results suggest that the epitope recognized by 7G5D8 is different from those recognized by the former ones. As the 183-191 sequence corresponds to a region in which HTLV-I and HTLV-II harbour six common amino acids and two similar ones, this is consistent with the observation that 7G5D8 stained the HTLV-II producing cells 344 MO as well as all HTLV-I producing ones.

To design an optimal vaccine against BLV infection, we chose an approach based on the use of synthetic peptides covering 78% of the gp51 sequence in order to select only those segments that could induce a protective response via cellular and humoral immunity. On the other hand, we built a model of the BLV env glycoprotein 3D organization, based upon the very sensitive hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA). The major information highlighted from this model is that the two loops, against which the most efficient neutralizing antipeptides antibodies are directed against, are in close proximity at the top of the ""head"" and could represent a potential site for receptor binding. These two peptides are of particular interest since they induce also a helper T-cell response.

In a human mast cell leukemia cell line (HMC-1), KitR was found to be constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, activated and associated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (P13K) in the absence of autocrine production of SCF. Sequencing of c-kit cDNA revealed that c-kit genes of HMC-1 cells were composed of a normal, wild-type allele and a mutant allele with two point mutations in codon 560 and codon 816, resulting in intracellular amino acid substitutions of Gly-560 for Val and Val-816 for Asp, respectively.

Following binding to the IL-2 receptor, the fusion toxin is internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis, and upon acidification of the endocytic vesicle, the T domain spontaneously inserts into the membrane, and facilitates the delivery of the C domain to the cytosol (3,4). In order to further study the process by which the C domain is delivered to the target cell cytosol, we genetically fused an eleven amino acid epitope derived from the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein to the N-terminal end of DAB389IL-2. The epitope labelled fusion toxin, VSV-G-DAB389IL-2, was found to retain IL-2 receptor specific binding and cytotoxic activity. Target cells were incubated for various times in the presence of VSV-G-DAB389, fixed and then treated with anti-VSV G and FITC conjugated secondary antibody. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to determine the location of the fluorescent signal. The VSV-G epitope tagged fusion toxin was found only to be associated with small vesicles that were situated adjacent to the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the C domain of the fusion toxin is associated with an early intracellular compartment and is rapidly delivered to the cytosol.

Such low concentrations of RA alone provoked only a small proportion of HL60 cells to differentiate, and G-CSF alone provoked no differentiation. In the presence of 30 microM indomethacin (an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase that catalyses the first step of prostanoid synthesis), the onset of differentiation provoked by RA plus G-CSF was more rapid, but the final proportion of mature cells was unchanged. Indomethacin also potentiated the growth arrest and differentiation of cells in response to 10 nM RA alone. Although the potentiating effect of indomethacin on RA-induced differentiation occurred at several indomethacin and RA concentrations, it was only apparent when the RA concentration used was alone sufficient to induce a small proportion of cells to differentiate. Indomethacin shifted the G-CSF dose-response curve of cells treated with 10 nM RA to lower G-CSF concentrations. 1 alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (VitD3) induces HL60 cells to differentiate to monocytes and indomethacin also potentiated the differentiation of HL60 cells in response to low doses of VitD3 5,8,11-eicosatriynoic acid, an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase and 12-lipoxygenase, neither potentiated neutrophil differentiation of HL60 cells, nor prevented indomethacin potentiation of the differentiation of RA-primed cells. Treatment of cells with dexamethasone, a steroid whose effects include inhibition of arachidonate mobilization by phospholipase A2, potentiated RA-primed neutrophil differentiation in a manner similar to indomethacin. These observations suggest that an arachidonate metabolite formed downstream of cyclooxygenase suppresses differentiation of HL60 cells both to neutrophils and monocytes, probably by inhibiting some event essential to commitment to differentiation.","['Bunce, C M', 'French, P J', 'Durham, J', 'Stockley, R A', 'Michell, R H', 'Brown, G']","['Bunce CM', 'French PJ', 'Durham J', 'Stockley RA', 'Michell RH', 'Brown G']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipoxygenase/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Apr;8(4):595-604.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By substituting a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) membrane anchor for part or all of the retroviral envelope transmembrane protein and creating several deletion variants of the TM subunit, we have begun to dissect the role of the TM protein in envelope function. We show that a GPI-anchored envelope can be incorporated into virions and binds receptor. We found that the envelope cytoplasmic tail, while not required, influences the efficiency of retroviral transduction at some step after membrane fusion (possibly by interacting with core). The membrane-spanning domain of TM is involved in membrane fusion, and this function is distinct from its role as a membrane anchor. As few as eight amino acids of the putative membrane-spanning domain are sufficient to achieve membrane anchoring of envelope but not to mediate membrane fusion. In addition, though not required, the membrane-spanning domain may have some direct role in the incorporation of envelope into virions. Finally, the extracellular domain of TM, besides containing the putative fusion domain and interacting with SU, may influence the synthesis or stability and the glycosylation of envelope, possibly by affecting oligomerization of the complex and proper intracellular transit.","['Ragheb, J A', 'Anderson, W F']","['Ragheb JA', 'Anderson WF']","['Molecular Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acute-Phase Proteins/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*biosynthesis/*metabolism']",1994/05/01 00:00,1994/05/01 00:01,['1994/05/01 00:00'],"['1994/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1994 May;68(5):3207-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.5.3207-3219.1994.,['10.1128/JVI.68.5.3207-3219.1994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC236812,,,,,,,,,

The Central Lymphoma Group.,779-87,"PURPOSE: The United Kingdom Central Lymphoma Group (CLG) has modified mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone/doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (MOPP/ABVD) by substituting mechlorethamine with chlorambucil and dacarbazine with etoposide in the treatment of patients with advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD). Prednisolone is included in the bleomycin-containing combination, and the vinca alkaloids have been switched to balance the myelotoxicity of the two component regimens. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The resulting ChlVPP/PABlOE regimen is as follows: on days 1 to 14, chlorambucil 6 mg/m2 orally, procarbazine 100 mg/m2 orally, and prednisolone 30 mg/m2 orally; on days 1 and 8, vinblastine 6 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.); on day 29, doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 i.v.; on days 29 and 36, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 (maximum, 2 mg) i.v., and bleomycin 10 mg/m2 i.v.; on days 30, 31, and 32, etoposide 200 mg/m2/d orally; on days 29 to 43, inclusive, prednisolone, 30 mg/m2 orally. The second full cycle restarts on day 50. Treatment continues to maximum response plus two full cycles, but with a minimum of three full cycles. Radiotherapy is administered, after chemotherapy, to sites of previously bulky disease. Since 1983, 216 patients with previously untreated, advanced Hodgkin's disease (HD) have entered this study. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rate after chemotherapy was 73% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67% to 79%), and after additional radiotherapy was 85% (95% CI, 80% to 90%). The failure-free survival (FFS) rate at 5 years was 68% (95% CI, 61% to 74%), and the overall actuarial survival at 5 years was 78% (95% CI, 72% to 84%). The CR rate in patients in the poorer prognostic categories was high: 81% in patients with albumin levels less than 37 g/L, 79% in patients older than 40 years of age, 84% in stages IIIB plus i.v. disease, and 79% in patients presenting with B symptoms. As expected, nausea and vomiting were not major problems, although infection, often in the context of myelosuppression, complicated almost half the cases, and 29% of patients required admission at some stage for treatment of infection. CONCLUSION: In this multicenter study, ChlVPP/PABlOE produced results comparable to those reported for MOPP/ABVD, but with less nausea and vomiting. Treatment duration was shorter than in the original MOPP/ABVD regimen, and than that used in the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) trial. It will now be compared with PABlOE alone.","['Cullen, M H', 'Stuart, N S', 'Woodroffe, C', 'Murphy, A', 'Fletcher, J', 'Blackledge, G R', 'Child, J A', 'Grieve, R J', 'Jones, E L']","['Cullen MH', 'Stuart NS', 'Woodroffe C', 'Murphy A', 'Fletcher J', 'Blackledge GR', 'Child JA', 'Grieve RJ', 'Jones EL']","['Birmingham Oncology Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'ChlVPP protocol', 'PABlOE protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Apr;12(4):779-87. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.779.,['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.779 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: After tumor removal and thorough surgical staging, patients were enrolled on this study and treated with three courses of cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin (BEP). Reassessment laparotomy was required of consenting, appropriate patients initially, but became an optional procedure in 1989. RESULTS: Of 93 patients assessable on this trial, 89 are continuously free of germ cell cancer. At second-look laparotomy, two other patients were found to have small foci of immature teratoma; both remain clinically free of recurrence. One received subsequent alternate chemotherapy and one did not. Thus, 91 of 93 patients are currently free of germ cell cancer. Follow-up duration ranges from 4.0 to 90.3 months, with 67 patients monitored for longer than 2 years. Acute toxicity was moderate. One patient developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia 22 months after diagnosis. Another patient was noted to have a malignant lymphoma 69 months after protocol treatment. CONCLUSION: Three courses of BEP will nearly always prevent recurrence in well-staged patients with completely resected ovarian germ cell tumors and should be given to all such patients. The development of acute leukemia as a complication of treatment is disturbing and mandates careful long-term follow-up, but is unusual and does not alter the risk-to-benefit ratio of treatment.","['Williams, S', 'Blessing, J A', 'Liao, S Y', 'Ball, H', 'Hanjani, P']","['Williams S', 'Blessing JA', 'Liao SY', 'Ball H', 'Hanjani P']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University Cancer Center, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'BEP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Germinoma/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Reoperation', 'Treatment Outcome']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Apr;12(4):701-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.701.,['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.701 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 112 patients with newly diagnosed AML (n = 69) or MDS (n = 43) received G-CSF 400 micrograms/m2/d 1 day before (presenting WBC count < 50,000/microL) and/or during (all patients) fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d and ara-C 2 g/m2/d for 5 days (FLAG). G-CSF continued until a CR was achieved. Results were compared with those in 85 newly diagnosed patients (54 AML, 31 MDS) previously treated with FA without G-CSF. RESULTS: Patients in both groups were relatively old (median age of all patients, 63 years), and were likely to have prognostically unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities (36% had abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and 7 [-5/-7]). G-CSF accelerated recovery to > or = 1,000 neutrophils (P < .0001; median, 34 days for FA, 21 days for FLAG), but logistic regression provided no evidence that the CR rate was higher with FLAG than with FA (P = .50), with unadjusted CR rates of 63% and 53%, respectively. This may reflect relatively high rates of death before neutrophil recovery in both groups. Rates of infection were similar in both groups. The follow-up duration in remission is short, and much of these data remain censored. To date, survival is similar with FA and FLAG. CONCLUSION: On average, G-CSF before, during, and after FA had no effect on CR or infection rates in this population, in which elderly patients and poor prognostic factors were prevalent. The use of FA and laminar airflow rooms rather than more usual therapy needs to be considered when analyzing the results.","['Estey, E', 'Thall, P', 'Andreeff, M', 'Beran, M', 'Kantarjian, H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Escudier, S', 'Robertson, L E', 'Koller, C', 'Kornblau, S']","['Estey E', 'Thall P', 'Andreeff M', 'Beran M', 'Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Escudier S', 'Robertson LE', 'Koller C', 'Kornblau S', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Apr;12(4):671-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.671.,['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.4.671 [doi]'],,['J Clin Oncol. 1997 Apr;15(4):1710-1.

RNA preparations from the spleens of normal uninfected C57BL/6 mice contain a transcript hybridizing with this sequence. Levels of the transcript in the kidney of C57BL/6 mice were higher than in the spleen, liver or thymus. Although BALB/c, NFS, DBA/2 and SL murine strains also contained genomic sequences hybridizing with the MAIDS virus-specific probe, no transcript hybridizing with the probe was detected in these strains of mice. The cDNAs carrying the transcript expressed in C57BL/6 mice were molecularly cloned. The complete nucleotide sequence of the clone indicates that the transcript is one of the endogenous murine leukaemia virus-related sequences containing large deletions from the R and U5 regions of the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) to gag p15, from the C-terminal region of pol p40 (integrase) to the N-terminal region of env p15E, and many short deletions in the 3' LTR U3 region. The nucleotide sequence in the gag p12 region of the transcript was closely similar to that of the MAIDS virus, but the amino acid sequence was less similar because of frameshifting, even when translated. As the MAIDS virus was isolated from C57BL/6 mice with radiation-induced leukaemia, this transcript may be the progenitor of the MAIDS virus. To determine whether the gag p12 region of the transcript contains a functional sequence, a recombinant virus was generated by replacing the gag p12 region of a replication-competent BM5eco virus with that of the endogenous transcript. The recombinant virus was replication-competent, and the p12 region of the transcript retained the functional sequence present in the BM5eco virus.","['Kubo, Y', 'Nakagawa, Y', 'Kakimi, K', 'Matsui, H', 'Higo, K', 'Wang, L', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Hirama, T', 'Ishimoto, A']","['Kubo Y', 'Nakagawa Y', 'Kakimi K', 'Matsui H', 'Higo K', 'Wang L', 'Kobayashi H', 'Hirama T', 'Ishimoto A']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, gag', 'Kidney/microbiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Liver/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/analysis/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology', 'Transfection']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1994 Apr;75 ( Pt 4):881-8. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-75-4-881.,['10.1099/0022-1317-75-4-881 [doi]'],,,,['GENBANK/L08395'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is induced by a variety of pro-inflammatory soluble substances including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In vitro studies of a large vessel endothelial cells demonstrate that stimulation with TNF or IL-1 leads to a rapid, but transient, induction of E-selectin expression that disappears within 24 hours. However, in vivo studies have shown that microvascular endothelial cells persistently express E-selectin in chronic inflammatory states, particularly in the skin where it serves as a homing receptor for memory T cells. Stimulation of dermal-derived microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs) with single doses of IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or LPS resulted in transient but slightly more persistent expression of E-selectin than seen after stimulation of large vessel derived umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, stimulation of either HDMECs or HUVECs with repetitive doses of IL-1 alpha, TNF alpha, or LPS in the presence of human serum or plasma resulted in persistent E-selectin expression in vitro. The persistent E-selectin cell surface expression was associated with persistent E-selectin mRNA expression and correlated with E-selectin-mediated HL-60 binding to endothelial cell monolayers. The effect of human plasma or serum was dose dependent, and fractionation of human plasma by gel filtration demonstrated that the E-selectin persistence activity resolved into high and low molecular peaks. These data demonstrate that human endothelial cells are capable of persistent E-selectin expression in vitro and that factors in human serum or plasma are critical in preventing cytokine refractoriness and loss of E-selectin expression. This study provides a basis to resolve the apparent discrepancies between previous in vivo and in vitro dynamics of E-selectin expression.","['Sepp, N T', 'Gille, J', 'Li, L J', 'Caughman, S W', 'Lawley, T J', 'Swerlick, R A']","['Sepp NT', 'Gille J', 'Li LJ', 'Caughman SW', 'Lawley TJ', 'Swerlick RA']","['Department of Dermatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Cytokines/blood', 'E-Selectin', 'Endothelium, Vascular/chemistry/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*blood', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*blood', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/chemistry', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*analysis', 'Umbilical Veins/chemistry']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1994 Apr;102(4):445-50. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12373008.,"['S0022-202X(94)96790-3 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12373008 [doi]']",,,['R01 AR 36632/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to PMA, cells of the THP-1 myeloid leukemia cell line acquire macrophage-like characteristics after treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). To analyze the signal transduction mechanisms induced by RA, we first compared the effects of PMA and RA on the expression of genes which are known to be regulated during monocytic differentiation. Both RA and PMA effectively down-regulated c-myc expression, while c-myb expression decreased only after PMA treatment. Expression of the beta 2-integrin genes, CD11a and CD11b, was clearly increased after both of these treatments. Their effects on the src-family tyrosine kinase genes were different: hck expression was similarly induced by these agents but lyn expression was stronger and more rapid after RA treatment. RA also enhanced lyn mRNA production rapidly in HL-60, indicating that the activation of lyn gene expression is common in monocytic and granulocytic maturation of myeloid leukemia cells. To examine whether the AP-1 enhancer activity is involved in RA-induced monocytic differentiation, THP-1 cells were transiently transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT)-reporter gene containing 5 copies of the AP-1 binding sites. In contrast to PMA, RA did not induce any CAT activity in these cells, thus suggesting that the RA-induced changes in the expression of those genes described above were not dependent on the AP-1 enhancer activity.","['Matikainen, S', 'Hurme, M']","['Matikainen S', 'Hurme M']","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['CD18 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, myc/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Monocytes/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1994 Apr 1;57(1):98-103. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910570118.,['10.1002/ijc.2910570118 [doi]'],,,,,"['c-myb', 'c-myc', 'hck', 'lym']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Nerve growth factor (NGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have previously been shown to produce changes in cell bodies of sympathetic neurons when applied to their peripheral neurites, and it is well established that NGF is retrogradely transported along sympathetic axons. In this study we show that 125I-LIF applied to terminal neurites of rat sympathetic neurons in compartmented cultures is retrogradely transported, but at a much lower level compared to the retrograde transport of 125I-NGF. Transport of 125I-LIF was competed by cotreatment with unlabeled LIF and was blocked by cotreatment with dinitrophenol. The rate of 125I-LIF transport was independent of NGF concentration. However, both 125I-LIF and 125I-NGF transport was reduced by pretreating neurons with LIF. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that retrogradely transported radiolabel which accumulated in cell body-containing extracts following transport of both 125I-LIF and 125I-NGF consisted of intact as well as partially processed species. Radiolabel also accumulated in the medium bathing the cell bodies and migrated near the dye front on SDS-PAGE, implying that both factors were extensively degraded and released by the neurons. These results are consistent with the suggestion that the retrograde transport of LIF, as thought for NGF, may be important for retrograde signaling mechanisms.","['Ure, D R', 'Campenot, R B']","['Ure DR', 'Campenot RB']","['Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dev Biol,Developmental biology,0372762,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Axonal Transport', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ganglia, Sympathetic/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dev Biol. 1994 Apr;162(2):339-47. doi: 10.1006/dbio.1994.1091.,"['10.1006/dbio.1994.1091 [doi]', 'S0012-1606(84)71091-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An aneuploid cell line (C15) was isolated from mouse myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B D+ cells. The C15 cells contained twice as much DNA as the parental cells but retained the morphology of myelomonocytic cells and the ability to differentiate into macrophage-like cells in response to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in vitro. When the C15 cells were inoculated into the peritoneal cavity of syngeneic Balb/c mice (10(6) cells/mouse), the mice died of leukemia within 19 days. The DNA content and differentiation antigen (Mac-1) of the cells in the peritoneal cavity were determined by dual-parameter flow cytometry. On day 12 after inoculation, the C15 cells were distinguishable from normal host cells in the peritoneal cavity by their different DNA content. The administration of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) (10 micrograms/day) to mice bearing C15 cells induced the leukemia cells to express Mac-1 antigen and to change morphologically into mature granulocytic cells. Because the C15 cells were not responsive to G-CSF in suspension culture in vitro, this result suggests that the cytokine's actions on the cells in vivo and in vitro are different. This experimental model for analyzing in vivo differentiation of leukemia cells will be useful for studying the therapeutic effects of potential differentiation-inducing agents.","['Hayashi, M', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Hozumi, M']","['Hayashi M', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Hozumi M']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Apr;22(4):393-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, CD5+ B cells are being held responsible for the production of autoreactive antibodies and seem to have signaling characteristics distinct from conventional B cells. On T cells, CD5 associates with the T cell receptor CD3 complex and ligation of CD5 leads to the generation of co-stimulatory signals, that act on T cell activation. We here demonstrate that CD5 is associated with the B cell receptor (BCR) complex and serves as substrate for BCR-induced tyrosine kinase activity.

In this investigation we examined the effect of Calphostin C (without prior exposure to light) on daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation and sensitivity to DNR in multidrug-resistant (MDR) murine leukemia P388/ADR and human myeloid leukemia HL60/AR cells. P388/ADR cells overexpress P-glycoprotein, whereas HL60/AR cells lack any expression of P-glycoprotein (both at mRNA and protein levels). Calphostin C, in a concentration-dependent manner, increased the accumulation of DNR in P388/ADR cells and partially reversed (threefold) the DNR resistance in P388/ADR cells but had no effect on either of the parameters in HL60/AR cells. Calphostin C-induced increased accumulation of DNR in P388/ADR cells was due to increased uptake and decreased efflux of DNR. Furthermore, Calphostin C increased the uptake and decreased the efflux of rhodamine 123 (a substrate for P-gp) in P388/ADR cells but had no such effect in P388 cells. In addition, Calphostin C without exposure to light did not inhibit PKC activity in any of the cell lines studied. Taken together, these data suggest that Calphostin C may reverse drug resistance via P-glycoprotein independently of its effect on PKC activity. Therefore, any data regarding the effect of Calphostin C on the reversal of MDR should be interpreted in the light of these findings.","['Gupta, S', 'Patel, K', 'Singh, H', 'Gollapudi, S']","['Gupta S', 'Patel K', 'Singh H', 'Gollapudi S']","['Division of Basic and Clinical Immunology, University of California, Irvine 92717.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Polycyclic Compounds)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacokinetics', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', '*Naphthalenes', 'Polycyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1994/01/30 00:00,1994/01/30 00:01,['1994/01/30 00:00'],"['1994/01/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/30 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1994 Jan 30;76(2-3):139-45. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(94)90390-5.,"['0304-3835(94)90390-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(94)90390-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies the authors were able to prove that this enzyme or an unknown homologous protein is localized also to the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes. In peripheral blood from healthy donors 11% of the mononuclear cells (PBMNC) expressed this surface antigen whereas in PBMNC of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia 76% of the MNC were positive. This value correlates well with the known B-cell markers CD19 and CD20. However, this antigen is different from all known clustered B-cell markers. Immunoprecipitation analysis of PHA-stimulated PBMNC and of cells from patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia revealed a membrane protein with the same molecular weight (61 kDa) as the TPO. These data suggest that this enzyme is present not only in the cytoplasm but also on the surface of B cells and that it is possibly involved in the regulation of the SH-SS status of the cell membrane proteins of B lymphocytes.","['Kroning, H', 'Kahne, T', 'Ittenson, A', 'Franke, A', 'Ansorge, S']","['Kroning H', 'Kahne T', 'Ittenson A', 'Franke A', 'Ansorge S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Otto von Guericke Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Epitopes)', 'EC 5.- (Isomerases)', 'EC 5.3.4.1 (Protein Disulfide-Isomerases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/enzymology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Isomerases/*blood/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/immunology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Protein Disulfide-Isomerases']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1994 Apr;39(4):346-50. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1994.tb03384.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1994.tb03384.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ADCC reaction was assessed by 4-h 51Cr-release assay. Highly purified lymphocytes (> 99%) and monocytes (> 99%) obtained from blood mononuclear cells (MNC) of healthy donors were used as effector cells. CsA decreased the cytotoxic activity of MNC against MDR cells, but enhanced their ADCC activity in the presence of anti-P-glycoprotein mAb MRK16. Lymphocyte-mediated ADCC and natural killer activity against MDR cells were also suppressed by addition of CsA. CsA induced a significant dose-dependent increase in monocyte-mediated ADCC activity. Interestingly, pretreatment of MDR cancer cells, but not of monocytes, with CsA significantly enhanced ADCC activity mediated by monocytes, but not by lymphocytes. A CsA analog (PSC833) and FK-506, but not verapamil also increased the sensitivity of MDR cells to ADCC by monocytes. CsA did not affect the binding of monocytes to MDR cells in the presence of MRK16 mAb. These results indicate that CsA may directly enhance the susceptibility of MDR cancer cells to the monocyte-mediated ADCC reaction.","['Yano, S', 'Sone, S', 'Nishioka, Y', 'Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Ogura, T']","['Yano S', 'Sone S', 'Nishioka Y', 'Naito M', 'Tsuruo T', 'Ogura T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokushima School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Biological Availability', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'KB Cells/drug effects', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1994 Feb;85(2):194-203. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1994.tb02082.x.,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1994.tb02082.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,PMC5919430,,,,,,,,,

The strong synergism observed in these cell types was not evident in two acute leukemia cell lines (K562 and GF-D8), in normal granulocytes, and in monocytes. In freshly isolated leukocytes derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), in the stable phase of the disease, a weaker interaction between ATRA and G-CSF was documented. The cross-talk between the cytokine and the retinoid was studied in detail in NB4, an immortalized APL leukemia cell line, retaining the 15-17 chromosomal translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor type alpha. The treatment of NB4 cells with G-CSF alone or ATRA alone leads to no increase and to minor induction in LAP activity, respectively. If the cells are treated with the two compounds simultaneously, a dramatic elevation of LAP is observed after 4 days. The synergism between G-CSF and ATRA is evident at concentrations of the retinoid between 10(-7) and 10(-5) mol/L and at concentrations of the cytokine between 1 and 10 ng/mL. The simultaneous presence of the two compounds is necessary to obtain maximal increase of LAP activity and the effect is cell density-dependent. Synergism is specific for G-CSF, and it is not observed with other cytokines and functional inducers of the granulocyte. The augmentation of LAP activity is the consequence of an increased transcriptional rate of the liver/bone/kidney-type (L/B/K-type) alkaline phosphatase gene, as determined by Northern blotting and nuclear run-on analysis using specific cDNA probes. Only one of the two possible alternatively spliced forms of L/B/K-type alkaline phosphatase transcript is detected in NB4 cells after stimulation with G-CSF and ATRA. This mRNA form, which is the one observed in normal polymorphonuclear leukocytes, contains the most upstream leader exon. In NB4 cells, ATRA induces G-CSF, alpha, and beta retinoic acid receptor transcripts, whereas G-CSF has minor effects on the expression of these mRNAs.","['Gianni, M', 'Terao, M', 'Zanotta, S', 'Barbui, T', 'Rambaldi, A', 'Garattini, E']","['Gianni M', 'Terao M', 'Zanotta S', 'Barbui T', 'Rambaldi A', 'Garattini E']","['Unita di Biologia Molecolare, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Apr 1;83(7):1909-21.,['S0006-4971(20)73834-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimation of the expression of CD21 antigen is useful for delineating stages of differentiation in T-ALL/LBL.

In addition, we also examined the toxicity of hydroquinone (HQ), a benzene metabolite, to these two cell lines. Both of the cell lines contain a basal level of cellular GSH, which is similar in the two cell lines. Although ML-1 cells contain much higher QR specific activity than HL-60 cells, which are relatively QR deficient, the GST specific activity of ML-1 cells is 1.8 times less than that of HL-60 cells. Immunoblot experiments showed that the GST in these two cell lines is GST pi. In addition, HL-60 cells exhibit 4.5 times more myeloperoxidase specific activity than ML-1 cells. Inclusion of D3T in the cultures could induce significant increases in cellular GSH content and QR activity, but not GST activity in either cell line. Treatment with HQ caused both inhibition of cell proliferation and loss of cell viability in these two myeloid cell lines. HQ treatment also resulted in a significant depletion of cellular GSH, which preceded the loss of cell viability. Pretreatment of both cell lines with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, markedly increased HQ-induced toxicity. In contrast, the presence of dicumarol, a QR inhibitor, failed to potentiate HQ-induced toxicity in ML-1 cells. On the other hand, pretreatment of these two myeloid cell lines with D3T significantly protected against HQ-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and cell death. Therefore, the above results suggest that GSH but not QR is an important factor involved in the toxicodynamics of HQ in these myeloid cells.","['Li, Y', 'Lafuente, A', 'Trush, M A']","['Li Y', 'Lafuente A', 'Trush MA']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Thiones)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '7QID3E7BG7 (Dicumarol)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'WT2QF220RR (1,2-dithiol-3-thione)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Dicumarol/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Glutathione/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Models, Chemical', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Thiones/*pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1994;54(13):901-16. doi: 10.1016/0024-3205(94)00626-1.,"['0024-3205(94)00626-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0024-3205(94)00626-1 [doi]']",,,"['ES03760/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05131/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, herbimycin A may provide an important insight into the oncogenic action of bcr/abl oncoprotein and the future development of oncoprotein-targeted therapeutic agents.","['Okabe, M', 'Kawamura, K', 'Miyagishima, T', 'Itaya, T', 'Goodwyn, D', 'Shoji, M', 'Vogler, W R', 'Sakurada, K', 'Uehara, M', 'Miyazaki, T']","['Okabe M', 'Kawamura K', 'Miyagishima T', 'Itaya T', 'Goodwyn D', 'Shoji M', 'Vogler WR', 'Sakurada K', 'Uehara M', 'Miyazaki T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Hokkaido University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1994 Mar;18(3):213-20. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(94)90117-1.,"['0145-2126(94)90117-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(94)90117-1 [doi]']",,,['CA29850/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In membranes, the IFN gamma-induced phosphorylation of this protein was detectable in 5 min, remained elevated for 3 h and declined thereafter, while a gradual decrease in the phosphotyrosine content was observed in cytosols. In parallel, a 40% increase in the phosphotyrosine phosphatase activity was detected in the later stages of IFN gamma treatment.

Attempts to overcome regrowth resistance during the treatment of the aggressive lymphomas by increasing the frequency of cytotoxic therapy appears to have failed. An alternative approach of significant potential would be to administer biologically active agents to directly slow the regrowth of neoplastic cells between courses of full dose cytotoxic therapy. To facilitate this approach a new system for classifying treatment failure in the leukemias and lymphomas is needed so that the extent of regrowth resistance and the effects of treatment on regrowth resistance can be directly assessed.

When nonhomologous RNA is present in the dimer RNA molecules, nonhomologous recombination can occur, although the rate is very low, only 0.1% of the rate of essentially homologous recombination (J. Zhang and H. M. Temin, Science 259:234-238, 1993). We found, as is found in naturally occurring highly oncogenic retroviruses (J. Zhang and H. M. Temin, J. Virol. 67:1747-1751, 1993), that the crossovers usually occur at a short region of sequence identity. We modified the previously studied vectors to study the effect of different lengths of short regions of sequence identity in the midst of otherwise nonidentical sequences. We found that the efficiency of recombination depends on the length of this sequence identity. However, the highest rate in such molecules remained lower than for recombination between essentially homologous molecules, even when there was extensive sequence identity. Junction sequences of the recombinants indicated that retrovirus recombination is not an error-prone process as was reported for human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase by using a cell-free system (J.

In myeloid cells, CD38 is expressed during early stages of differentiation. Virtually no information is available on regulation and functions of CD38. Recently we reported that all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) is a potent and highly specific inducer of CD38 expression in human promyelocytic leukemia cells. Here we report that ATRA-induced expression of CD38 antigen in myeloid cells is mediated through retinoic acid-alpha receptor (RAR alpha). ATRA failed to induce CD38 expression in a mutant subclone of the HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line (designated HL-60R) that is relatively resistant to ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation. Retroviral vector-mediated transduction of RA receptor (RAR alpha) into this HL-60R subclone completely restored the sensitivity of these cells to ATRA in terms of their ability to express CD38. In contrast, CD38 expression was not inducible by ATRA in HL-60R cells, transfected with a functional RAR beta, RAR gamma, or RXR alpha receptor. Induction of CD38 in acute promyelocytic and acute myeloblastic leukemia cells was independent of ATRA-induced cytodifferentiation. Following culture with ATRA, increased CD38 protein levels were also observed in normal CD34+ bone marrow cells, but not on normal circulating granulocytes. From these results, we conclude that CD38 is ATRA inducible in myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ bone marrow cells. This effect is independent of differentiation and is mediated by RAR alpha in HL-60 cells, suggesting a similar role for RAR alpha in CD38 expression in other hematopoietic cells.","['Drach, J', 'McQueen, T', 'Engel, H', 'Andreeff, M', 'Robertson, K A', 'Collins, S J', 'Malavasi, F', 'Mehta, K']","['Drach J', 'McQueen T', 'Engel H', 'Andreeff M', 'Robertson KA', 'Collins SJ', 'Malavasi F', 'Mehta K']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/biosynthesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Apr 1;54(7):1746-52.,,,,"['CA 55397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57369/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000923/FD/FDA HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The capacity of acute exposure to specific and nonspecific pharmacological inhibitors of PKC to promote apoptotic DNA fragmentation was examined both quantitatively and qualitatively and correlated with effects on cellular differentiation and proliferation. Incubation of HL-60 cells for 6 h with chelerythrine and calphostin C (highly specific inhibitors that act at the regulatory domain) or H7 and gossypol (nonspecific inhibitors that act at the PKC catalytic domain) produced concentration-dependent increases in DNA fragmentation. Induction of DNA fragmentation by chelerythrine, calphostin C, and gossypol was biphasic, resulting in a sharp decline in effect at concentrations above 5 microM, 0.1 microM, and 100 microM, respectively, whereas maximal and more stable effects were observed in response to H7 (100 microM). A 6-h exposure to staurosporine, a nonspecific but potent PKC inhibitor, failed to induce DNA fragmentation at concentrations generally used to achieve maximal inhibition of enzyme activity (e.g., 50 nM) but promoted fragmentation at considerably higher concentrations (e.g., > or = 200 nM). In contrast, 6-h exposures to the nonspecific protein kinase inhibitor hypericin (0.1 to 100 microM) or to the nonspecific inhibitor of protein kinase A, HA1004 (50 microM), were without effect on DNA fragmentation. DNA obtained from cells exposed to chelerythrine (5 microM), calphostin C (100 nM), H7 (50 microM), gossypol (50 microM), and staurosporine (200 nM)--but not hypericin (25 microM)--exhibited clear evidence of internucleosomal DNA cleavage on agarose gel electrophoresis; moreover, these cells exhibited the classical morphological features of apoptosis (cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies). All of the PKC inhibitors that induced apoptosis, and one of the inhibitors that did not (hypericin), substantially inhibited HL-60 cell clonogenicity at the concentrations evaluated. None of the agents tested induced cellular maturation as assessed by nonspecific esterase and nitro-blue tetrazolium positivity. DNA fragments obtained from cells exposed to specific and nonspecific PKC inhibitors possessed predominantly 5'-phosphate termini, consistent with the action of a Ca(2+)-/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease. Finally, Northern blot analysis revealed that exposure to calphostin C at a concentration that induced apoptosis (100 nM) failed to alter expression of bcl-2, an oncogene known to block apoptosis in both lymphoid and myeloid leukemia cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jarvis, W D', 'Turner, A J', 'Povirk, L F', 'Traylor, R S', 'Grant, S']","['Jarvis WD', 'Turner AJ', 'Povirk LF', 'Traylor RS', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298-0230.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Phenanthridines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Polycyclic Compounds)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'E3B045W6X0 (chelerythrine)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Alkaloids/toxicity', 'Anthracenes', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenanthridines', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Gossypol/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', '*Naphthalenes', 'Perylene/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Phenanthridines/toxicity', 'Piperazines/toxicity', 'Polycyclic Compounds/toxicity', 'Protein Kinase C/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Apr 1;54(7):1707-14.,,,,"['CA-09564-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the basis of the data by Solvason and Kearney in the human fetus and our data in the adult, and in agreement with the findings of Herzenberg et al. and Hardy et al. in the mouse, we propose that the human B cell repertoire includes at least three distinct B cell subsets: B-1a cells, which develop from progenitors in the fetal splanchnic district, namely the omentum, and are maintained in adult life by virtue of their self-replenishing nature; B-1b cells, progenitors of which can be found in the splanchnic district and, perhaps, adult bone marrow; and, finally, B-2 cells, which arise in the fetal liver and are continuously replenished in adult life by progenitors in the bone marrow (Figure 5). The different B cells types are distinguished by their differential expression of surface CD5 and, perhaps, CD11b and CD14, their differential expression of CD5 mRNA, and the different classes and specificities of the Ig they produce (Figure 5). B-1 lymphocytes play a major role in autoimmunity and constitute the physiological equivalent of the neoplastic forms in various lymphoproliferative disorders, such as CLL and SLL, which are often associated with the production of monoclonal antibodies to self antigens. Human B-1a (CD5+ B) and B-1b (CD5- CD45RAlo B) cells are responsible for the production of natural (polyreactive and monoreactive) antibodies in the fetus, neonate, and adult, and can give rise to the autoantibody-producing cells characteristic of several autoimmune disease states. Our recent findings suggest that while in healthy subjects the majority of natural polyreactive antibodies is encoded in V genes in germline configuration, some polyreactive antibodies are encoded in somatically mutated V genes, in a fashion consistent with an antigen-driven process of selection of such mutations. The nature of the antigen(s) involved in these selection processes remains to be determined. Under possibly different circumstances, the application of an antigen-driven process of clonal selection to B-1a and/or B-1b cells, previously committed to natural antibody production, can result in the generation of monoreactive high affinity and possibly pathogenic autoantibodies (Figures 5A and 5B).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kasaian, M T', 'Casali, P']","['Kasaian MT', 'Casali P']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Autoimmunity,Autoimmunity,8900070,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology', 'Autoimmunity/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Self Tolerance/*physiology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Autoimmunity. 1993;15(4):315-29. doi: 10.3109/08916939309115755.,['10.3109/08916939309115755 [doi]'],,,['AR-40908/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,94,,,,,,,,,,

In both experimental systems, dose-dependent inhibition of histamine release was observed at descarboxyethoxyloratadine and loratadine doses above 2 and 7 microM, respectively. In the RBL-2H3 experimental system, inhibition by loratadine increased when the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ was reduced from 1.8 to 0.45 mM. We further investigated the effect of loratadine and descarboxyethoxyloratadine on the increase in cytosolic calcium concentration (Ca2+)i, an early step in biochemical events leading to exocytosis. The effect of these two drugs upon (Ca2+)i changes was measured using the fluorescent probe fura-2 loaded into RBL-2H3 cells passively sensitized with DNP-specific IgE. Both drugs inhibited, in a dose-dependent manner (2.5-25 microM), the (Ca2+)i rise induced by DNP-BSA challenge in sensitized RBL cells, a process observed in both the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Loratadine also inhibited the Mn2+ influx into these cells, thus reflecting the Ca2+ influx. These results suggest that loratadine and descarboxyethoxyloratadine impair the increase in (Ca2+)i following cell activation by decreasing both the influx of extracellular Ca2+ and the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.","['Berthon, B', 'Taudou, G', 'Combettes, L', 'Czarlewski, W', 'Carmi-Leroy, A', 'Marchand, F', 'Weyer, A']","['Berthon B', 'Taudou G', 'Combettes L', 'Czarlewski W', 'Carmi-Leroy A', 'Marchand F', 'Weyer A']","['Unite de Physiologie et de Pharmacologie cellulaire, INSERM U 274, Universite Paris-Sud, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (2,4-dinitrophenyl-IgG)', '0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Dinitrobenzenes)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (anti-IgE antibodies)', '0 (des(ethoxycarbonyl)loratadine)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '7AJO3BO7QN (Loratadine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/pharmacology', 'Basophils/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/chemistry', 'Dinitrobenzenes/pharmacology', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Loratadine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/02 00:00,1994/03/02 00:01,['1994/03/02 00:00'],"['1994/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1994 Mar 2;47(5):789-94. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(94)90478-2.,"['0006-2952(94)90478-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(94)90478-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hybridization of total RNA with oligonucleotides (bases 1358-1333 of CD 14 sequence) showed increased steady state levels of the 1.75 kb CD 14 mRNA after 24 h when normalized to beta-actin. The nuclear accumulation of [3H]-vitamin D3/receptor complexes (VDR) in a nuclear translocation assay was significantly enhanced (by 3 h) in the presence of camptothecin. We conclude that inhibition of topoisomerase I enhances vitamin D3-stimulated CD 14 expression. Topoisomerase I might either be a negatively active transcription factor itself or maintenance of DNA-bending, local supercoiling and accessibility of responsive elements might lead to reduction of VDR turnover and produce a stimulatory effect on vitamin D3-responsive transcription.","['Jakob, F', 'Seufert, J', 'Sarrazin, C', 'Schneider, D', 'Kohrle, J', 'Tony, H P']","['Jakob F', 'Seufert J', 'Sarrazin C', 'Schneider D', 'Kohrle J', 'Tony HP']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, University of Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['*Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1994 Mar 15;199(2):531-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1994.1261.,"['S0006-291X(84)71261-7 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1994.1261 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inhibition was unaffected by the nature of the primer template used for DNA synthesis. The DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was inhibited to a lesser extent, whereas the ribonuclease H (RNase H) function associated with both HIV RTs was only slightly inhibited. The inhibition by the trihydroxyquinolone is reversible and noncompetitive with respect to both substrates--dTTP and the template primer poly(rA)n.oligo(dT)12-18. The inhibitor binds HIV-1 RT with a high affinity (Ki = 0.46 microM). This compound was shown also to inhibit the catalytic activities of the RT of murine leukemia virus, establishing the general inhibitory effect on retroviral RTs. Introductions of acetyl or methoxy moieties at positions with potential activity have generated three synthetic analogs of the natural compound. Only one analog, 5,8-dimethoxy-4-quinolone, exhibited an inhibition potency similar to that of the unmodified compound. Analysis of the three analogs has led us to the conclusion that the hydroxyl group at the ortho position to the carbonyl group in the pyridinone ring is a key structural element for the inhibitory activity. Thus, it could well be that the inhibitor interacts with the enzyme through a hydrogen bond of this hydroxyl group. We hope that the identification of the inhibitory site of the compound might be an important step toward the rational design of new potent anti-HIV RT drugs.","['Loya, S', 'Rudi, A', 'Tal, R', 'Kashman, Y', 'Loya, Y', 'Hizi, A']","['Loya S', 'Rudi A', 'Tal R', 'Kashman Y', 'Loya Y', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (3,5,8-trihydroxy-4-quinolone)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', '60164-00-3 (poly(rA).oligo(dT))', 'EC 2.7.7.- (reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/*enzymology', 'HIV-2/*enzymology', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'Porifera/metabolism', 'Quinolones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Ribonuclease H/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1994 Mar;309(2):315-22. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1994.1119.,"['S0003-9861(84)71119-2 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1994.1119 [doi]']",,,['AI31790/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Corresponding immunophenotyping data were reviewed with attention to the expression of CD14 (MY4) and CD24 (BA-1). Of 20 cases expressing CD24, 19 were M4 or M5, whereas all 14 cases expressing CD14 were of monocyte lineage. Therefore, CD14 was a highly specific (100%) but only moderately sensitive (58%) marker for distinguishing classes M1 or M2 from M4 or M5. By contrast and unexpectedly, CD24 was nearly as specific (97%), but more sensitive (79%) in marking M4 or M5 cells. This appears to be true even though CD24 is apparently not expressed on normal monocytes. When positive staining for either or both antibodies (CD24 or CD14) was considered indicative of a monocytic leukemia, the sensitivity of immunophenotyping in distinguishing M4/M5 from M1/M2 AML rose to 92%, while maintaining 97% specificity. The authors discuss a recent observation that may help explain the unexpected expression of CD24 in monocytic AML. They conclude that the usefulness of CD24 in identifying monocytic AML may exceed that of CD14, and that the use of CD24 and CD14 in combination improves the ability of flow cytometry to distinguish myeloid from monocytic acute leukemias.","['Raife, T J', 'Lager, D J', 'Kemp, J D', 'Dick, F R']","['Raife TJ', 'Lager DJ', 'Kemp JD', 'Dick FR']","['Department of Pathology, University of Iowa, Iowa City.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD24 Antigen)', '0 (CD24 protein, human)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD24 Antigen', 'Epitopes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*immunology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1994 Mar;101(3):296-9. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/101.3.296.,['10.1093/ajcp/101.3.296 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If some mutant progenitors or mutants grow more slowly than the wild-type cells during the expression period, there will be a decrease in the mutant to wild-type ratio with time and the mutant fraction will not accurately represent the number of mutational events that occurred. The mutant fraction may also inaccurately assess the number of mutations if these mutations are expressed over a number of generations during the time before selection. We previously showed that recovery of L5178Y mouse cell mutants is not complete when mutations are allowed to express in suspension because slowly growing mutants and/or mutant progenitors are diluted out during this time (Rudd et al., 1990). In order to more accurately quantitate the mutagenic response of the cells, we developed an in situ procedure which segregates and immobilizes cells during expression. Because of this immobilization, slowly growing mutant progenitors and mutants expressed at different times will have an equal probability of being scored as mutants. Thus, one mutation leads to one mutant colony and the measurement of the mutagenic response of the cells to the chemical accurately reflects the mutational events that occurred. We plated L5178Y tk+/- mouse cells in semisolid medium immediately after treatment. As the cells grew and formed microcolonies, the selective agent TFT was added as an overlay at specified times, permitting only TFTr cells to survive. In this procedure, each mutation was captured as an individual colony; consequently, the measured mutation fraction accurately reflected the mutational events that occurred at the selected locus. In addition, the induced mutant colonies arising in the agar are the result of independent mutational events. We previously described the in situ protocol for L5178Y cells and showed that the spontaneous mutation rate measured was 50-fold greater than when the cells expressed the phenotype in suspension (Rudd et al., 1990). From this we concluded that the slow growth phenotype was expressed before TFT resistance. In the present paper, we evaluate the effect of chemical treatment on the mutation fraction as a function of the time to TFT addition. Using the in situ protocol, we generated expression curves for three nucleotide analogs, 5-azacytidine, TFT and AraC. The numbers of TFTr colonies produced at various times after treatment indicated that chemically-treated cultures had higher mutation fractions than the solvent controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Spencer, D L', 'Hines, K C', 'Caspary, W J']","['Spencer DL', 'Hines KC', 'Caspary WJ']","['Laboratory of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Mutagens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'RMW9V5RW38 (Trifluridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Azacitidine/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Phenotype', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Trifluridine/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1994 Apr;312(2):85-97. doi: 10.1016/0165-1161(94)90013-2.,"['0165-1161(94)90013-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1161(94)90013-2 [doi]']",,,,,['tk'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic BMT for neoplastic disease, lenograstim significantly reduced duration of neutropenia and led to earlier hospital discharge.","['Gisselbrecht, C', 'Prentice, H G', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Biron, P', 'Milpied, N', 'Rubie, H', 'Cunningham, D', 'Legros, M', 'Pico, J L', 'Linch, D C']","['Gisselbrecht C', 'Prentice HG', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Biron P', 'Milpied N', 'Rubie H', 'Cunningham D', 'Legros M', 'Pico JL', 'Linch DC', 'et al.']","[""Hopital Saint Louis, Institut d'haematologie, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lenograstim', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",1994/03/19 00:00,1994/03/19 00:01,['1994/03/19 00:00'],"['1994/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1994 Mar 19;343(8899):696-700. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(94)91579-2.,"['S0140-6736(94)91579-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(94)91579-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,['Lancet 1994 Mar 26;343(8900):804'],,,,,,,,

Role of intracellular processing events.,2333-43,"We have assayed the sensitivity of Jurkat cells in different growth phases to an anti-CD5-ricin A chain (ST.1-RTA) immunotoxins (IT). Jurkat cells proliferated exponentially until a stationary growth phase was reached. Proliferating and stationary cells displayed marked differences in sensitivity to ST.1-RTA treatment; the time required to kill one log of target cells (T10) was 70 h in proliferating and 12 h in stationary cells, respectively. Differences in sensitivity to IT treatment were greatly diminished by the addition of the IT enhancer monensin (T10 = 4.9 and 3.5 h in proliferating and stationary cells, respectively). Binding and internalization studies carried out with fluoresceinated ST.1 mAb revealed that the higher sensitivity of stationary cells to ST.1-RTA treatment was not due to an increased uptake or to faster internalization kinetics of IT molecules in this cell population; rather, our data indicated that a different intracellular routing of IT molecules took place in the two cell populations. Mathematical modeling of experimental data allowed us to calculate the efficiency of the intracellular transport of IT molecules toward a subcellular compartment facilitating toxin translocation to the cell cytosol. The IT intracellular processing in stationary cells was 5.5-fold more efficient than in proliferating cells. This value strictly correlated with the higher sensitivity of the stationary cell population to ST.1-RTA treatment.","['Chignola, R', 'Anselmi, C', 'Franceschi, A', 'Pasti, M', 'Candiani, C', 'Tridente, G', 'Colombatti, M']","['Chignola R', 'Anselmi C', 'Franceschi A', 'Pasti M', 'Candiani C', 'Tridente G', 'Colombatti M']","['Institute of Immunology and Infectious Diseases, University of Verona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Ricin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/pathology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Mar 1;152(5):2333-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that FK506 suppressed the transcription of a chemotactic cytokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8) in a human T cell line, Jurkat cells, activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and calcium (Ca2+) ionophore (ionomycin). By deleted and mutated analysis of the IL-8 promoters, the AP-1 and kappa B-like sites were identified as the responsive elements for PMA and ionomycin. FK506 suppressed the transcriptions through the AP-1 or kappa B-like sites induced by PMA plus Ca(2+)-mobilizing agents, but not those induced by Ca(2+)-independent stimuli. In gel retardation analysis, FK506 had little effect on the binding to the AP-1 site of PMA/ionomycin-induced nuclear factors, which were recognized with anti-JunD or c-Fos antibody. In contrast, FK506 or EGTA (Ca2+ chelator) similarly affected the formation of kappa B-like site binding complexes, which were not recognized by any antibodies against the human Rel family proteins (c-Rel, p65, p50, and p49). Furthermore, we confirmed the previous report that FK506 suppressed the PMA/ionomycin-induced activation through authentic kappa B site of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene, to which NF-kappa B binding was also decreased by FK506, indicating that both IL-8 kappa B-like site and Ig kappa B site are FK506-sensitive in spite of the difference of binding factors. Our results indicate that not only the reported IL-2 NF-AT and NFIL-2A sites and Ig kappa B site, but also the IL-8 AP-1 and kappa B-like sites are terminals of FK506-sensitive pathway involving Ca2+ mobilization.","['Okamoto, S', 'Mukaida, N', 'Yasumoto, K', 'Rice, N', 'Ishikawa, Y', 'Horiguchi, H', 'Murakami, S', 'Matsushima, K']","['Okamoto S', 'Mukaida N', 'Yasumoto K', 'Rice N', 'Ishikawa Y', 'Horiguchi H', 'Murakami S', 'Matsushima K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kanazawa University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Suppression, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tacrolimus/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/18 00:00,1994/03/18 00:01,['1994/03/18 00:00'],"['1994/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 18;269(11):8582-9.,['S0021-9258(17)37234-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aggregation cross-blocking analysis suggested that mAb 19H8 belonged to the group of mAbs that react with the B2 epitope of the alpha 4 subunit (alpha 4.B2 epitope); however, unlike the alpha 4.B2-specific mAb L25, mAb 19H8 did not immunoprecipitate alpha 4 beta 7. In addition, mAb 19H8 did not bind to beta 1-positive cells unless transfected with alpha 4 cDNA. These results indicated that mAb 19H8 was not specific for an individual alpha 4, beta 1, or beta 7 subunit but reacted with an epitope formed from the association of alpha 4 with beta 1. Separating the alpha 4 from the beta 1 subunit, by removing divalent cations or by treatment with high pH, disrupted mAb 19H8 binding. In contrast, the alpha 4-specific mAb L25 and the beta 1-specific mAb 18D3 could react with their respective subunits without subunit association.

DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. PATIENTS: Nine patients who have undergone SLT for end-stage lung disease: four patients with sarcoidosis; two patients with limited scleroderma; and three patients with prior malignancies (two with prior lymphoma and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and one who received two bone marrow transplants for acute lymphocytic leukemia and subsequently developed chemotherapy-induced pulmonary fibrosis). MEASUREMENTS: Pulmonary function testing, exercise oximetry, quantitative ventilation-perfusion lung scanning. Actuarial survival. RESULTS: All patients had marked improvement in pulmonary function, exercise oximetry, and quantitative ventilation perfusion to the SLT. One patient with scleroderma died 90 days postoperatively from Pseudomonas pneumonia with a sepsis syndrome. One patient with sarcoidosis died 150 days postoperatively from disseminated aspergillosis. At autopsy, there was no evidence of recurrent fibrosis or sarcoidosis in the transplanted lungs in either of these two patients. The seven surviving patients have returned to work or school and are conducting all activities of daily living without pulmonary disability. The 1- and 2-year actuarial survival rates in these nine patients is 68.6 percent as compared with the 1- and 2-year actuarial survival rates of 66.3 percent and 55.8 percent in the remainder of our SLT group as a whole (n = 49). Despite pharmacologic immunosuppression, there is no evidence of recurrent malignancy in the 3 patients with prior malignancies.

RBL-2H3 cells sensitized with DNP-specific monoclonal IgE antibody were stimulated with multivalent antigen (DNP conjugate of bovine serum albumin). Analysis of phosphotyrosine-containing proteins in their lysates by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting revealed that these two inhibitors efficiently inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins (32, 42, 56, 66, 72, 92, 150 kDa) including phospholipase C-gamma 1. The inhibitors also caused parallel inhibitions of the histamine release, the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and the increase in cytosolic calcium ion concentration at the late sustained phase. A digital imaging fluorescence microscopic analysis of antigen-dependent calcium signals in individual cells showed that these two tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibited the calcium influx from the external medium more powerfully than the mobilization of calcium ion from internal stores. In contrast, the inhibitors did not affect the increase in the cytosolic calcium ion concentration or the histamine release induced by the calcium ionophore A23187. Taken together, our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation following antigen stimulation regulates phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and the influx of extracellular calcium.","['Teshima, R', 'Ikebuchi, H', 'Sawada, J', 'Furuno, T', 'Nakanishi, M', 'Terao, T']","['Teshima R', 'Ikebuchi H', 'Sawada J', 'Furuno T', 'Nakanishi M', 'Terao T']","['Division of Biochemistry and Immunochemistry, National Institute of Hygienic Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '0 (Sulfides)', '107761-24-0 (ST 638)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cinnamates/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fura-2', 'Histamine Release/*drug effects', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinones/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgG/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Sulfides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/analogs & derivatives/analysis']",1994/03/10 00:00,1994/03/10 00:01,['1994/03/10 00:00'],"['1994/03/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/10 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1994 Mar 10;1221(1):37-46. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(94)90213-5.,"['0167-4889(94)90213-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(94)90213-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the polymerase chain reaction method, we showed that Moloney murine leukemia virus can be efficiently internalized in nonproliferating fibroblasts, although reverse transcription of the viral RNA in these cells remains incomplete. It seems likely that a lower availability of deoxyribonucleotides in G0-arrested cells is responsible for this premature termination of the reverse transcription step. Accordingly, the addition of high concentrations of nucleosides to the culture medium of nondividing cells simultaneously with infection enables them to complete the reverse transcription process, without re-initiating the cell cycle. Inhibition of reverse transcription by hydroxyurea confirms the dependence of this retroviral step on the intracellular nucleotide pool rather than on the precise arrest point of the host cell cycle. Furthermore, the pyrimidine nucleotide pool, and more particularly the cytidine pool, appears to play a central regulatory role in this step.","['Goulaouic, H', 'Subra, F', 'Mouscadet, J F', 'Carteau, S', 'Auclair, C']","['Goulaouic H', 'Subra F', 'Mouscadet JF', 'Carteau S', 'Auclair C']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie et Pharmacologie des Macromolecules Biologiques, URA 0147 CNRS, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleotides)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Fibroblasts', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*growth & development', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Virus Replication']",1994/04/01 00:00,1994/04/01 00:01,['1994/04/01 00:00'],"['1994/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1994 Apr;200(1):87-97. doi: 10.1006/viro.1994.1166.,"['S0042-6822(84)71166-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1994.1166 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggest that these factors also promote hematopoietic cell growth. The major group of angiogenic growth factors is the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family. Two prototypes, acidic FGF and basic FGF, have been demonstrated to interact with granulopoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis. Basic FGF stimulates granulopoiesis in long term bone marrow cultures while acidic and basic FGF promote megakaryocytopoiesis. These effects are presumably mediated via specific FGF receptors, that have been identified in bone marrow and leukemia cell lines. Besides the FGF family, angiogenic inhibitors such as platelet factor-4 (PF-4) have been found to exhibit an inhibitory effect on megakaryocytopoiesis. In contrast, it has been demonstrated that hematopoietic growth factors including granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or erythropoietin promote angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro. In light of these recent observations and the common origin of endothelial cells and hematopoietic cells, it is suggested that angiogenic factors are hematopoietic growth factors and vice versa.

These data indicate in six late-stage (week 5 or week 7) cultures G-CSF messenger concentrations 10(3)-fold less than in 5637 control cells (for an identical amount of total cellular RNA). A similar conclusion may be drawn for Steel factor in three late-stage cultures. For IL-3 our negative results indicate a messenger concentration 10(5)-fold less than in activated T lymphocytes. These results suggest a crucial role for GM-CSF and M-CSF in the maintenance of granulomonopoiesis in human long-term cultures. The role of G-CSF and Steel factor may be more marginal. Eventually IL-2 may not be involved in the regulatory process.","['Deschaseaux, M L', 'Herve, P', 'Charbord, P']","['Deschaseaux ML', 'Herve P', 'Charbord P']","['Centre Regional de Transfusion Sanguine, Besancon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/analysis', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):513-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Steel Factor (SF) has a similar effect on colony formation by CD34+ cells, we tested whether this factor acts by blocking the inhibitory effects of TGF-beta. That this is not generally the case was demonstrated by the finding that the combination of TGF-beta 1 antisense with SF in cultures of CD34+ bone marrow cells yielded enhanced colony formation that was more than additive when compared to cultures containing the single agents. This combination also yielded enhanced colony formation by CD34+ umbilical cord blood cells, but in this case, the effect was slightly less than additive. Thus in cord blood, some, but not all, of the progenitors that are maintained in quiescence by TGF-beta can be triggered into cycle by SF. However, the absolute number of CFU-GEMMs found in the antisense TGF-beta plus SF cultures of cord blood was 4-fold higher than that found in comparable bone marrow cultures. These data correlate well with our previous observations that umbilical cord blood contains 4-fold more CD34+ CD38- cells, the population found to respond to TGF-beta 1 antisense oligodeoxynucleotides.","['Li, M L', 'Cardoso, A A', 'Sansilvestri, P', 'Hatzfeld, A', 'Brown, E L', 'Sookdeo, H', 'Levesque, J P', 'Clark, S C', 'Hatzfeld, J']","['Li ML', 'Cardoso AA', 'Sansilvestri P', 'Hatzfeld A', 'Brown EL', 'Sookdeo H', 'Levesque JP', 'Clark SC', 'Hatzfeld J']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, UPR 272, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):441-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, a correlation between T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements and chromosomal aberrations has been implicated in this leukemia. We present a case of HTLV-1 infected adult T-cell lymphoma that initially presented with a normal karyotype and germline J beta I/J beta II loci. As the disease evolved to the aggressive stage, a complex chromosomal rearrangement with a duplication of chromosome 6p23-->pter translocated to a derivative chromosome 16, was identified by molecular cytogenetic techniques. The nature of this complex abnormality would have been difficult to determine if only conventional banding techniques were performed. Rearrangement involving one J beta allele was also detected at that time. After initiation of chemotherapy, no germline J beta loci were detected, suggesting a possible second rearrangement involving this locus that was homologous. Although no known immune response genes are located at the breakpoints involved in this abnormality, the chromosomal aberration concurred with the initial J beta rearrangement.","['Macera, M J', 'DiPillo, F', 'Szabo, P', 'Ramirez, R', 'Gogineni, S', 'Verma, R S']","['Macera MJ', 'DiPillo F', 'Szabo P', 'Ramirez R', 'Gogineni S', 'Verma RS']","['Department of Medicine, Long Island College Hospital, SUNY, New York.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BACOD protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/administration & dosage', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/methods', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):420-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA was given at 45 mg/m2/day p.o. from week 1-12 and G-CSF at 5 micrograms/kg/day s.c. from week 5-12 with dose modifications according to the absolute neutrophil counts (ANC). A total of 15 patients, predominantly with refractory anemia, were treated. During initial ATRA therapy, a bilineage response with increases of both ANC and platelet counts occurred in three patients. During combined ATRA/G-CSF therapy, ANC increased in all patients, and platelets increased in three out of 14 evaluable patients. An increase in hemoglobin concentration and a decrease in transfusion requirements occurred in one patient each. In the bone marrow, the myeloid-to-erythroid ratio increased during ATRA treatment and remained increased during concomitant G-CSF administration, while the maturation index of myeloid cells increased only in response to ATRA therapy, but returned to baseline during ATRA/G-CSF treatment. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated persistence of the abnormal clones in all patients. The number of circulating progenitor cells CFU-GM increased in all patients studied. Serum concentrations of the soluble TNF receptor and IL-2 receptor both increased, while TNF-alpha--already elevated prior to therapy--and soluble ICAM-1 concentrations did not significantly change. Adverse effects included dermatitis and cheilosis in most patients, and a drop in platelet counts related to G-CSF in one patient. The pilot study demonstrates that the combination treatment with ATRA/G-CSF is well tolerated, leading to normalization of ANC in most, and improvement of platelets and red blood cells in a subgroup of patients.","['Ganser, A', 'Seipelt, G', 'Verbeek, W', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Maurer, A', 'Kolbe, K', 'Hess, U', 'Elsner, S', 'Reutzel, R', 'Wormann, B']","['Ganser A', 'Seipelt G', 'Verbeek W', 'Ottmann OG', 'Maurer A', 'Kolbe K', 'Hess U', 'Elsner S', 'Reutzel R', 'Wormann B', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/blood/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Mar;8(3):369-75.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the relationship between the epitopes they identify, and their effects on SLF binding, receptor internalization, and signal transduction are compared. Epitope mapping studies carried out on the high P145c-kit-expressing cell line HEL-DR showed that SR-1 identifies an epitope independent of those bound by YB5.B8 and 17F11, while the latter two antibodies bound to distinct but interacting epitopes. SR-1 potently blocked the binding of SLF to P145c-kit on these cells and also on cells of the factor-dependent line MO7e. In contrast, YB5.B8 and 17F11 had minimal effects on ligand binding. Conversely, SLF partially blocked the binding of SR-1 and YB5.B8 to cells, while binding of 17F11 was actually enhanced by SLf on some target cells. Preincubation of HEL-DR and MO7e cells with MAbs prior to exposure to SLF revealed that 17F11 itself brought about partial down-regulation of P145c-kit and did not inhibit SLF-mediated down-regulation. SR-1 caused minimal down-regulation and inhibited SLF-mediated receptor internalization. YB5.B8 had minimal effects on either cell line in this assay. To determine whether the antibodies had any agonist activity, they were compared with SLF for their ability to bring about receptor phosphorylation in intact MO7e cells. All three antibodies induced detectable tyrosine phosphorylation with 17F11 being the most effective, while YB5.B8 was the least effective. Finally, the ability of the antibodies to influence the proliferation of the MO7e cells was examined. As expected, SR-1 potently inhibited the proliferative response to SLF, while 17F11 weakly inhibited and YB5.B8 had negligible effect. In the absence of SLF both 17F11 and YB5.B8 displayed very weak but reproducible agonist activity.","['Ashman, L K', 'Buhring, H J', 'Aylett, G W', 'Broudy, V C', 'Muller, C']","['Ashman LK', 'Buhring HJ', 'Aylett GW', 'Broudy VC', 'Muller C']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'CHO Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Endocytosis', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', '*Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*immunology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1994 Mar;158(3):545-54. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041580321.,['10.1002/jcp.1041580321 [doi]'],,,['DK 44194/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This method makes it possible to estimate very low levels of serum G-CSF. In the present study, serum samples from 25 patients in chronic phase and 16 in blastic crisis, as well as samples from 33 healthy volunteers were investigated. The serum G-CSF levels in chronic phase of CML (2.95 +/- 3.91 pg/ml) were significantly lower than those in normal controls (15.92 +/- 6.53 pg/ml) and in blastic crisis of CML (15.52 +/- 17.65 pg/ml) within a range of very low levels (p < 0.001, p < 0.02). Moreover, a reverse correlation between blood neutrophil counts and serum G-CSF levels were clearly demonstrated for CML including blastic crisis (r = 0.405, p < 0.02). Interestingly, a sequential parallel relation was observed between serum G-CSF levels and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) scores for a patient with CML in chronic phase. Our observations indicate that a negative feedback mechanism exists between peripheral neutrophils and serum G-CSF levels in the chronic phase of CML, and that very low levels of G-CSF in chronic phase of CML might be an important cause for the low NAP scores.","['Saitoh, H', 'Shibata, A']","['Saitoh H', 'Shibata A']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/blood', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Neutrophils/enzymology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Nov;11(5-6):443-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199309067938.,['10.3109/10428199309067938 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To select the isotype of a CD19 MoAb most suitable for radioimmunotherapy of patients with B-cell malignancies, we studied the influence of MoAb isotype on modulation, after binding of the MoAb to different cell-line cells. The CD19-IgG1 MoAb was found to induce modulation of CD19 antigens on Daudi cell line cells more rapidly than did its IgG2a switch variant. We provide evidence that this difference in modulation rate is caused by the expression of Fc gamma receptor II (Fc gamma RII) on these cells. Experiments aimed at elucidating the mechanism of Fc gamma RII involvement in modulation induction by CD19-IgG1 showed that Fc gamma RII did not comodulate with CD19 MoAbs. However, cocrosslinking of CD19 and Fc gamma RII with CD19-IgG1 MoAb resulted in enhanced calcium mobilization in Daudi cells. This increased signal induction accompanies the enhanced capping and subsequent modulation of CD19 antigens. Because Fc gamma RII is expressed in varying densities on malignant B cells in all differentiation stages, our results have implications for the MoAb isotype most suitable for use in MoAb-based therapy of patients with B-cell malignancies.","['Vervoordeldonk, S F', 'Merle, P A', 'van Leeuwen, E F', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'von dem Borne, A E', 'Slaper-Cortenbach, I C']","['Vervoordeldonk SF', 'Merle PA', 'van Leeuwen EF', 'van der Schoot CE', 'von dem Borne AE', 'Slaper-Cortenbach IC']","['Central Laboratory of the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Class Switching', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/analysis/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/15 00:00,1994/03/15 00:01,['1994/03/15 00:00'],"['1994/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Mar 15;83(6):1632-9.,['S0006-4971(20)77040-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve on existing methods of detection, we have developed a reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for keratin 19 (K19) transcripts to identify mammary carcinoma cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with breast cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Peripheral-blood or bone marrow samples obtained from 34 patients with stages I to IV breast cancer and 39 control subjects without breast cancer were screened for K19 mRNA by nested primer PCR. RESULTS: In reconstitution experiments, K19 RT-PCR reliably detected 10 mammary carcinoma cells in 1 million normal peripheral-blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells. Four of 19 patients with stage IV breast cancer had detectable K19 transcript in peripheral blood. Five of six patients with histologically negative bone marrow biopsies following preablative chemotherapy and before autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) were positive by this assay. Stem-cell apheresis harvests obtained from one of these patients and three additional patients immediately before BMT were all K19-negative. K19 RT-PCR analysis of CSF from a breast cancer patient with known carcinomatous meningitis was also positive. Thirty-eight of 39 non-breast cancer patients had negative K19 RT-PCR assays. The one exception was a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR of K19 is a sensitive, specific, and rapid method for detection of occult mammary carcinoma cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with breast cancer. The presence of residual breast cancer cells in histologically normal bone marrow aspirates but not in stem-cell apheresis harvests is a frequent finding. This assay may be useful in diagnosing metastatic disease, as well as in monitoring the effectiveness of systemic therapy.","['Datta, Y H', 'Adams, P T', 'Drobyski, W R', 'Ethier, S P', 'Terry, V H', 'Roth, M S']","['Datta YH', 'Adams PT', 'Drobyski WR', 'Ethier SP', 'Terry VH', 'Roth MS']","['Department of Medicine, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '68238-35-7 (Keratins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Keratins/*analysis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/diagnosis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1994 Mar;12(3):475-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.475.,['10.1200/JCO.1994.12.3.475 [doi]'],,,['R29DK43470-03/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A single peak of MAPKK activity, four peaks of activity against the S6 synthetic peptide, RRLSSLRA (S6 peptide), and three distinct peaks toward myelin basic protein (MBP) were observed after Mono-Q chromatography of LIF-stimulated cell extracts. Two of the MBP kinase activities correlated with the stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2. Interestingly, down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by chronic treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with phorbol ester was found to attenuate, but not block, the LIF-mediated stimulation of MAPKK, MAPK, and S6K activities in 3T3-L1 cells. Treatment of 3T3-L1 cells with epidermal growth factor increased MAPKK, MAPK, and S6K activities to a similar extent as LIF, but this activation was not attenuated by down-regulation of PKC. Our results suggest that the full activation of the MAPK cascade by LIF may require inputs from multiple signaling pathways, one of which is dependent upon the presence of functional PKC.","['Schiemann, W P', 'Nathanson, N M']","['Schiemann WP', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Myelin Basic Protein)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '24928-17-4 (phorbol-12,13-didecanoate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelin Basic Protein/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1994/03/04 00:00,1994/03/04 00:01,['1994/03/04 00:00'],"['1994/03/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/04 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Mar 4;269(9):6376-82.,['S0021-9258(17)37382-9 [pii]'],,,"['GM07750/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS26920/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinetics of reverse transcriptase inhibition by inophyllum B were characterized using recombinant purified enzyme, a heteropolymeric RNA template, and a scintillation proximity assay. Preincubation of inhibitor with the enzyme-template-primer complex for 11 min was required for maximal inhibition of reverse transcriptase to occur, suggesting that inophyllum B had a slow on-rate and that template-primer must bind to reverse transcriptase prior to inhibitor binding. Inhibition of reverse transcriptase by inophyllums was shown to be reversible. When thymidine triphosphate was the variable substrate, inophyllum B inhibited reverse transcriptase noncompetitively with a Ki of 42 nM. Enzyme inhibition with respect to template-primer was uncompetitive with a Ki of 26 nM. Reverse transcriptase enzymes containing point mutations in which tyrosine 181 was changed to either cysteine or isoleucine exhibited marginal resistance to inophyllums but were resistant to (+)-(5S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-9-chloro-5-methyl-6- (3-methyl-2-butenyl)-imidazo[4,5,1-j,k][1,4]benzodiazepin-2-(1H)-t hione (TIBO R82913). A mutant enzyme in which tyrosine 188 was changed to leucine was cross-resistant to both inophyllum B and TIBO R82913, as was HIV type 2 reverse transcriptase. These studies suggest that inophyllum B and TIBO R82913 bind to distinct but overlapping sites. Inhibition of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase by inophyllum B was detectible, suggesting that these inhibitors may be more promiscuous than other previously described non-nucleoside inhibitors.

Commun. 180, 393-400). We show, in this study, that the intermediate filament protein vimentin is retinoylated in HL60 cells during a 24-h exposure to 100 nM [3H]RA. We found that a retinoylated protein of M(r) 55,000 coeluted on anion exchange chromatography and comigrated on either one- or two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a protein that also was stained on immunoblots by an anti-vimentin antibody. About 50% of the [3H]RA was released from this M(r) 55,000 retinoylated protein after hydrolysis with either NH2OH (1 M, pH 10) or CH3OH, 0.1 M KOH. These results indicated that a large fraction of the RA was bound to vimentin by an ester bond. Both the M(r) 55,000 retinoylated protein and immunoreactive vimentin were associated with cell nuclei isolated by two procedures. They were detached during exposure to a nonionic detergent buffer, suggesting that they are bound to the nuclear envelope. These results indicate that retinoylation is a new modification of vimentin that may be an early event in RA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR']","['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (Rosaniline Dyes)', '0 (Vimentin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '78642-64-5 (Coomassie blue)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Rosaniline Dyes', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1994/02/25 00:00,1994/02/25 00:01,['1994/02/25 00:00'],"['1994/02/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/25 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 25;269(8):5913-7.,['S0021-9258(17)37548-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using 44 different probes to cytokines, growth factors, and their receptors, we tested 21 melanoma and 5 melanocyte cultures for RNA transcript expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. With 30 amplification cycles, expression of the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), IL-7, gro alpha, IL-8 and the p35 chain of IL-12 was detected in more than 60% of melanomas.

IL-1 alpha, IL-5, Rantes, IL-10, interferon (IFN)-beta, tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, G-colony-stimulating factor (CSF) and GM-CSF were expressed at lower levels. Melanocytes showed greatly reduced cytokine RNA transcripts, and only gro alpha was consistently detected. No expression of IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-9, the p40 chain of IL-12, IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma RNA transcripts was detected in melanomas or melanocytes.

CML progenitor cells have been shown to be defective in adherence to marrow stroma. The present study investigated at the cytogenetic level marrow-derived CML clonogenic cells generated from the stroma-adherent cell fraction. On direct cytogenetic analysis, the overall mean (+/- SEM) percentage of Ph- metaphases was 3% +/- 1%. Mononuclear marrow cells from CML patients (n = 18) were incubated with mafosfamide (100 micrograms/mL) or control medium, seeded onto marrow stromal layers and allowed to adhere (2 hours, 37 degrees C). After a short-term (3-day) liquid culture, the cells were harvested, incorporated in methyl-cellulose, and individual colonies were analyzed by single colony karyotyping. The mean (+/- SEM) percentage of Ph- colonies generated from the stroma-adherent fraction was 35% +/- 6%. As compared with marrow colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage plated before any manipulation, the mean (+/- SEM) percentage of Ph- clones was significantly increased by stroma adherence (35% +/- 6% v 15% +/- 4%, P < or = .005) and mafosfamide (100 micrograms/mL) incubation of marrow cells before stroma adherence (58% +/- 9% v 35% +/- 6%, P < or = .005). An additive effect was observed by combining mafosfamide treatment and stroma adherence. Single-colony transfer experiments showed that 50% +/- 4% stroma-adherent and 70% +/- 4% stroma-adherent mafosfamide-treated progenitors gave rise to secondary colonies. To further characterize the stroma-adherent fraction, experiments were performed in which CD34+ marrow cells were used. The mean (+/- SEM) output of progenitors generated by 10,000 CD34+, stroma-adherent cells was 888 +/- 188 and 570 +/- 258 for untreated and mafosfamide-treated cells, respectively.

Also, constitutive expression of c-myb in CD34-negative human glioblastoma cells induces expression of CD34 mRNA and synthesis of the surface membrane antigen.

In contrast, only a small difference was found between human and rhesus monkey IL-3 in relative binding affinity for receptors on human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells, which confirmed that the species specificity of IL-3 is largely unidirectional. The biological significance of the findings was demonstrated by direct in vivo comparison of the effects of high-dose recombinant rhesus monkey and human IL-3. The binding characteristics of IL-3 receptors on rhesus monkey bone marrow and peripheral blood cells were further characterized by specific binding of radiolabeled rhesus monkey IL-3.

Two RNAs corresponding to the 5' and 3' regions of the genome were used to perform reverse transcription assays. The role of the nucleocapsid protein NCp10, which is tightly bound to the genome in the virus, was investigated in this system as well as the requirement of the 5' and 3' terminal repeats (R sequences) and the poly(A) tail. The results show that NCp10 drastically enhances the strand transfer reaction and that interactions between reverse transcriptase, nucleocapsid protein and viral RNA may be important. Both R sequences are required for an efficient and accurate DNA strand transfer and the poly(A) tail facilitates this reaction. Furthermore, it is probable that both intra- and intermolecular DNA strand transfers occur when the 5' and 3' ends of the genome are present on the same molecule.","['Allain, B', 'Lapadat-Tapolsky, M', 'Berlioz, C', 'Darlix, J L']","['Allain B', 'Lapadat-Tapolsky M', 'Berlioz C', 'Darlix JL']","['LaboRetro INSERM, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Genome, Viral', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Poly A/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism']",1994/02/15 00:00,1994/02/15 00:01,['1994/02/15 00:00'],"['1994/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1994 Feb 15;13(4):973-81.,,,,,,,,,PMC394899,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment with cycloheximide (1 microgram/ml) for 1 h significantly inhibited the antigen-induced histamine release (36% inhibition). The cycloheximide-induced inhibition of histamine release was abolished when the cells were further incubated in the absence of cycloheximide for 2 h. Pretreatment with puromycin (3 and 10 micrograms/ml), an inhibitor of protein synthesis, or actinomycin D (0.1-1 microgram/ml), an inhibitor of DNA-dependent RNA synthesis, also inhibited the antigen-induced histamine release in a concentration-dependent manner. Both ionomycin- and thapsigargin-induced histamine release were also inhibited by pretreatment with cycloheximide. Measurement of intracellular Ca2+ levels using quin 2 revealed that cycloheximide inhibits the increase in Ca2+ levels induced by the antigen, ionomycin or thapsigargin.

In this report, we show that, in murine (NFS-60) and human (OCI-AML 1) myeloid leukemia cell lines and in murine pro-B-lymphocytic cells, BAF/B03, transfected with the murine G-CSFR, proliferative responses to G-CSF are associated with rapid activation of p42 and p44 MAP kinases and p21ras. Truncation of the cytoplasmic portion of the murine G-CSFR at residue 646 but not at residue 739 abolished G-CSF-induced stimulation of cellular proliferation as well as activation of MAP kinase and p21ras in transfected BAF/B03 cells. G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation of the murine leukemic cell line 32DC13(G) occurred in the absence of detectable activation of p42 MAP kinase. Nonproliferative responses to G-CSF in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 and in human neutrophils were similarly associated with no MAP kinase activation.

G-CSF treatment resulted in a rapid and transient elevation of cAMP content of NFS-60 cells. G-CSF treatment of NFS-60 cells also resulted in the activation of A-kinase parallel to the increase in cAMP concentration. A low concentration (0.2-10 nM) of forskolin augmented the G-CSF-dependent cell proliferation, although forskolin by itself had no effect on NFS-60 cell growth. Forskolin did not affect the IL-3-induced proliferation of this cell line. Addition of forskolin resulted in further increases in the cAMP level, activation of A-kinase in NFS-60 cells stimulated by G-CSF. Proliferation of NFS-60 cells by G-CSF, but not by IL-3, was blocked by the axial diastereoisomer of adenosine 3',5'-phosphorothioate (Rp-cAMPS), a competitive cAMP antagonist.

Treatment of all cell lines with YM1, 3, 4 and 6 produced a dose-dependent decrease in DNA, RNA and protein synthesis as measured by [3H]-thymidine, [3H]-uridine and [3H]-leucine uptake respectively. YM1 was more effective than YM3, YM4 or YM6 against the drug sensitive cells. The antitumor effects of all these DOX-analogues on macromolecule synthesis in U937 and CCRF-CEM cells were lower than that of DOX and epirubicin (EDR). A rapid accumulation of the novel anthracyclines was found in all cell lines compared with DOX or EDR. However, the maximal accumulation of the DOX-analogues was lower than that of EDR. There is a greater efflux from CCRF-CEM sensitive cells and less from CEM/VLB100 resistant cells of the DOX-derivatives when compared with EDR and DOX. Drug-induced cytotoxicity significantly correlated (P < 0.05) with drug retention levels in CCRF-CEM and U937 drug sensitive cells as indicated by an inverse correlation curve between anthracycline retention and drug-induced IC50 value. It was demonstrated that an increased level of drug retained within the sensitive cells would therefore produce a more cytotoxic effect of the drug. However, no such correlation was observed in CEM/VLB100 resistant cells. YM3 was shown to have an increased antitumor activity against CEM/VLB100 resistant cells compared with DOX with a lower resistance factor. These results showed that the antitumor effects of four novel DOX-analogues, like DOX or EDR, were associated with inhibition of DNA replication, transcription and translation. The finding that resistant leukemic cells are more susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of YM3 than DOX warrants further investigation to identify the intrinsic mechanism of resistance.","['Jiang, X R', 'Macey, M G', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Collins, P W', 'Gutteridge, C N', 'Miki, T', 'Adachi, K', 'Yamabe, S', 'Newland, A C']","['Jiang XR', 'Macey MG', 'Kelsey SM', 'Collins PW', 'Gutteridge CN', 'Miki T', 'Adachi K', 'Yamabe S', 'Newland AC']","['Department of Haematology, London Hospital Medical College, Whitechapel, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Chemother,"Journal of chemotherapy (Florence, Italy)",8907348,"['145785-62-2 (N-(3-pyridylmethyl)adriamycin)', '145785-63-3 (N-(3-pyridylmethyl)dihydroepidoxorubicin)', '145785-64-4 (N,N-bis(3-pyridylmethyl)adriamycin)', '145843-38-5 (N-(3-pyridylmethyl)epidoxorubicin)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Epirubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA/biosynthesis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Chemother. 1993 Oct;5(5):334-43. doi: 10.1080/1120009x.1993.11741079.,['10.1080/1120009x.1993.11741079 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IFN alpha-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was time- and dose-dependent, confirming the specificity of the process. IFN alpha-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of p95vav was also observed in other hematopoietic cell lines of B-cell origin (Daudi), T-cell origin (MOLT-4), and promyelocytic origin (HL-60). Immunoprecipitation experiments performed with 32P-labeled U-266 cells and phosphoaminoacid analysis of the bands corresponding to p95vav showed that p95vav is phosphorylated on serine residues prior to IFN alpha stimulation of the cells.

Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins released at these sites may promote or modulate PMN adhesion, motility, oxidant generation, degranulation, and phagocytosis, but their role in these processes is not well defined. Of particular interest are thrombospondin (TSP), a 450 kD ECM protein released by activated platelets, and vitronectin (VN), a major constituent of plasma. Low concentrations of soluble TSP prime for both N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP)-mediated O2- generation and chemotaxis, whereas VN suppresses FMLP-mediated O2- generation but primes for FMLP-mediated chemotaxis. TSP alone, at high concentrations, stimulates chemotaxis of PMNs, whereas VN, at the same concentrations, fails to stimulate chemotaxis. In contrast to soluble ECM proteins, substrate bound TSP, laminin, and VN promote PMN adhesion and random migration. As functional studies suggest, unactivated PMNs express receptors for both TSP and VN, and both TSP and VN receptor expression increases substantially following PMN activation. PMN-like HL-60 cells interact similarly with ECM proteins, and thus provide an important model for studying the expression of ECM receptors and the acquisition of ECM-mediated functional responses during blood cell differentiation. The ability of PMNs to interact with ECM proteins and modulate ECM protein receptors suggests that these proteins, alone or in synergy with chemotactic peptides, play an important role in regulating PMN diapedesis.","['Suchard, S J']",['Suchard SJ'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Thrombospondins)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)']",IM,"['*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Extracellular Matrix/*physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Fibronectins/physiology', 'Gelatinases/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Laminin/physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Thrombospondins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*physiology', 'Vitronectin']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Blood Cells. 1993;19(2):197-221, discussion 221-3.",,,,"['AI26863/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'MO1RR0042/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of these cytokines, namely interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), play a key role in orchestrating the mechanisms responsible for inflammation. These two cytokines induce production by many cells of lipid mediators, proteases, and free radicals, all of which play a direct role in development of the deleterious effects of inflammation. IL-1 and/or TNF exert cytotoxic effects on the vascular endothelium, cartilage, bone, muscle, or pancreatic beta-cell islets. Cytokines, including interferon gamma (IFN), IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), amplify the inflammatory response by increasing production of IL-1 and TNF by macrophages. Macrophages also produce other cytokines, such as IL-8 and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), with chemoattractant properties that contribute to draw leucocytes to the site of inflammation. IL-6, produced in large amounts during inflammatory processes, induces the production of acute phase proteins by hepatocytes. IL-1, TNF, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta) share this effect. TGF beta also has a number of anti-inflammatory effects. TGF beta, IL-4, and IL-10 inhibit production of IL-1 and TNF. Glucocorticoids also have this effect. Glucocorticoids can be produced as a result of a chain of events initiated by IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 and involving the neuro-endocrine axis. Other substances, such as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1 ra) or soluble forms of the TNF receptors, can specifically inhibit the effects of IL-1 and TNF. Cascade production of cytokines, inhibition, negative feed-back, and synergistic mechanisms are parameters that illustrate the concept of ""cytokine network"" and aptly characterize the role of these mediators in the mechanisms of inflammation.","['Cavaillon, J M']",['Cavaillon JM'],"[""Unite d'Immuno-Allergie, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.""]",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects', 'Cytokines/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Endopeptidases/biosynthesis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/drug effects', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*chemically induced/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Interleukin-1/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/adverse effects/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 1993 Oct;41(8 Pt 2):799-811.,,,,,,,La participation des cytokines au cours des mecanismes inflammatoires.,110,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report its use in human HL60 cells to detect aneuploidy induced by the benzene metabolite, 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT). Human centromeric probes specific for chromosomes 9 and 7 were used. Untreated HL60 cells were 0.72 +/- 0.29% hyperdiploid for chromosome 9. Treatment with 5 microM BT increased this level 3-fold to 2.20 +/- 0.87% and 50 microM increased it 4-fold to 2.96 +/- 0.74%. Similar results were obtained with the chromosome 7 probe. The induction of aneuploidy by BT is therefore not chromosome-specific nor is it artifactual. Immunocytochemical staining with anti-tubulin antibodies also showed that BT disrupted microtubule organization at these concentrations. Thus, mitotic spindle disruption probably plays an important role in BT-induced aneuploidy. Trisomy and not tetrasomy accounted for the majority of the hyperdiploidy induced by BT in the two C-group chromosomes 7 and 9. Since trisomy of C-group chromosomes is commonly observed in leukemia, BT-induced aneuploidy may be involved in benzene-induced leukemia.","['Zhang, L', 'Venkatesh, P', 'Creek, M L', 'Smith, M T']","['Zhang L', 'Venkatesh P', 'Creek ML', 'Smith MT']","['Department of Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '173O8B04RD (hydroxyhydroquinone)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Colchicine/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*toxicity', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/03/01 00:00,1994/03/01 00:01,['1994/03/01 00:00'],"['1994/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1994 Mar;320(4):315-27. doi: 10.1016/0165-1218(94)90084-1.,"['0165-1218(94)90084-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1218(94)90084-1 [doi]']",,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because S phase cells are selectively sensitive to these drugs, and during differentiation there is a reduction in the proportion of cells in S phase, the reported decrease in the number of apoptotic cells could simply be a reflection of the paucity of sensitive cells in these cultures. Using cytometric methods which allow apoptosis to be related to cell cycle position, we have compared the apoptotic response of HL-60 cells growing exponentially and induced to myeloid differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The cells were treated with: (i) the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin (CAM), which selectively triggers apoptosis or S phase cells; (ii) the nucleoside antimetabolite 5-azacytidine (AZC) and hyperthermia, both of which preferentially affects G1 cells; and (iii) gamma radiation, which causes apoptosis predominantly of G2 + M cells. The cells exposed to 1.4% DMSO for 24 or 48 h were significantly more resistant to response by apoptosis, regardless of the nature of the agent and regardless of their position in the cell cycle. Thus, induction of differentiation lowers the cell's ability to respond to a variety of damaging agents by apoptosis and this effect is not correlated with cell cycle position. In addition, the difference in response was unrelated to expression of the apoptosis-modulating protein bcl-2, which appeared unchanged following 48 h exposure to DMSO. On the other hand, when the cells were pretreated with low concentrations of CAM or AZC, washed free of drug, and then treated with DMSO, the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis was markedly increased, relative to drug-treated cells returned to DMSO-free medium. The present data may indicate that while the drug-induced damage screening mechanisms, which are linked to triggering apoptosis, may be more proficient in proliferating cells, the effectors of apoptosis are more expressed in cells undergoing differentiation. The data also suggest that the efficiency of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation may be reduced if a differentiating agent is used in combination therapy and is administered first. An enhancement of apoptosis, however, may be expected if the differentiating drug is administered in the reverse sequence.","['Del Bino, G', 'Li, X', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Del Bino G', 'Li X', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Laboratoire de Cytologie et de Cancerologie Experimentale, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology/radiation effects']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):281-8.,,,,['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro treatment of 20 patient samples of acute myeloid leukemias in a 4 days culture system with 10 nM bryostatin 5 induced strongly adherent macrophage-like cells in all cases. Bryostatin 5 induced a significant (p = 0.00006) increment in esterase activity in a majority of the samples, which was further enhanced by vitamin D3. CD14 expression was significantly (p = 0.035) enhanced with the combination of bryostatin 5 and vitamin D3. Nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reducing ability was, however, nearly abolished (p = 0.0007). A loss of CD34 expression occurred during cell culture; this loss was enhanced by vitamin D3, but prevented partly by bryostatin 5. Together these findings indicate that exposure to bryostatin 5 leads to a strong macrophage-like cell differentiation in human myeloid leukemia and that VD3 has an additional effect. These findings strengthen the potential role of bryostatins as possible antileukemic agents.","['van der Hem, K G', 'Drager, A M', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Tol, C', 'Deville, W', 'Langenhuijsen, M M']","['van der Hem KG', 'Drager AM', 'Huijgens PC', 'Tol C', 'Deville W', 'Langenhuijsen MM']","['Department of Hematology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Macrolides)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '97850-04-9 (bryostatin 5)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (butyrylesterase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/immunology/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors', 'Macrolides', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1994 Feb;8(2):266-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BFU-E growth induced by rEPO or rIL-3 + rEPO was enhanced by rSCF in about 50% of cases, in linear correlation with the levels of patients' hemoglobin. rSCF did not increase CFU-E growth, whereas it slightly stimulated CFU-Mk in 33% of the cases. EPO, SCF and, particularly, their combination, enhanced the recovery of normal CFU-E and BFU-E after 7 days of liquid culture. This was less evident in cultures of MDS patients. Conversely, CFU-GM generation in long term liquid cultures, although highly variable, was stimulated by rSCF and, above all, by rSCF + rG-CSF, similarly to what was observed with normal bone marrow samples.

Elevated levels of the angiogenic peptide basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) have been significantly correlated with the status and extent of disease in bladder cancer. PURPOSE: We measured the bFGF levels in patients with cancer in organs other than the bladder to determine whether elevated levels accompany these cancers. METHODS: Urine samples were collected from 950 patients having a wide variety of solid tumors, leukemia, or lymphoma and from a control group of 87 healthy volunteers and 198 patients with non-cancer-related diseases. Levels of bFGF in samples prepared from the urine were measured using an enzyme bioassay. RESULTS: Male control subjects had a median bFGF level of 151 pg/g and female control subjects a median of 237 pg/g, with a combined 90th percentile of 619 pg/g. An elevated level of bFGF was found in the urine of some of the patients with every type of tumor studied except cervical carcinoma. For example, patients with active local cancers had a median level of 312 pg/g. Those with active, metastatic cancers had a median level of 479 pg/g and a 90th percentile level of 14143 pg/g. After ""elevated"" was defined to mean higher than the 90th percentile level for controls, 31% of patients with local active and 47% of patients with metastatic active cancers showed elevated bFGF levels. Survival among cancer patients at the median follow-up time was 85%-88% for those with ""normal"" and 71%-72% for those with ""elevated"" urine bFGF levels. IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that bFGF in urine deserves further evaluation of its potential use as a monitor of therapy or as a predictor of outcome once a cancer has been diagnosed.","['Nguyen, M', 'Watanabe, H', 'Budson, A E', 'Richie, J P', 'Hayes, D F', 'Folkman, J']","['Nguyen M', 'Watanabe H', 'Budson AE', 'Richie JP', 'Hayes DF', 'Folkman J']","[""Department of Surgery, Children's Hospital, Boston, Mass.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)'],IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*urine', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*urine', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*urine', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis']",1994/03/02 00:00,1994/03/02 00:01,['1994/03/02 00:00'],"['1994/03/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/03/02 00:01 [medline]', '1994/03/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Mar 2;86(5):356-61. doi: 10.1093/jnci/86.5.356.,['10.1093/jnci/86.5.356 [doi]'],,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1994 Mar 2;86(5):328-9.

Using probes derived from each ligand and a variety of cell adhesion and ligand-receptor binding assays, we have investigated the relationship between the mechanisms of fibronectin and VCAM-1 interaction with alpha 4 beta 1. CS1 peptide, which represents the dominant active site from the HepII/IIICS recognition domain in fibronectin, was found to inhibit VCAM-1-dependent adhesion in three different assays: MOLT-4 T lymphoblastic leukaemia cell attachment to immobilized recombinant soluble VCAM-1 (rsVCAM-1), MOLT-4 cell attachment to monolayers of VCAM-1-transfected COS-1 cells, and A375-SM melanoma cell spreading on immobilized rs VCAM-1. Half-maximal inhibition required CS1 concentrations of 1.7-3.0 mg/ml, some 3-7-fold higher than that needed to autoinhibit adhesion to CS1-IgG conjugate. Using a more sensitive solid-phase receptor-ligand binding assay, CS1 was found to be a potent inhibitor of the binding of rsVCAM-1 to alpha 4 beta 1 (half-maximal inhibition at 13 micrograms/ml). In agreement with cell-based assays, severalfold lower concentrations of CS1 were required to inhibit binding of recombinant HepII/IIICS region of fibronectin (half-maximal inhibition at 3 micrograms/ml). VCAM-1-alpha 4 beta 1 binding was blocked not only by CS1 peptide but also by the recombinant HepII/IIICS region of fibronectin. Kinetic analysis of CS1 inhibition of VCAM-1 binding revealed that it was directly competitive in nature, indicating that VCAM-1 and fibronectin recognize either identical or spatially overlapping binding sites on alpha 4 beta 1. The implications of these results for the future design of VCAM-1 antagonists are discussed.","['Makarem, R', 'Newham, P', 'Askari, J A', 'Green, L J', 'Clements, J', 'Edwards, M', 'Humphries, M J', 'Mould, A P']","['Makarem R', 'Newham P', 'Askari JA', 'Green LJ', 'Clements J', 'Edwards M', 'Humphries MJ', 'Mould AP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*metabolism', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1994/02/11 00:00,1994/02/11 00:01,['1994/02/11 00:00'],"['1994/02/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/11 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1994 Feb 11;269(6):4005-11.,['S0021-9258(17)41734-0 [pii]'],,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two groups of set cDNAs (alpha and beta) with different translation initiation sites and open reading frames of 867 and 831 bp, respectively, were found. The predicted protein products are 33,385 and 32,085 Da in size and contain approximately 30% acidic residues, over half of them clustered at the COOH terminal, thus forming a long acidic tail. No signal peptide or membrane-spanning domains were identified, suggesting an intracellular protein product. By ribonuclease protection assay, both alpha and beta variants of set were expressed in kidney. On Northern blots of total kidney RNA, 3.0- and 2.2-kb mRNAs hybridized with the labeled set cDNA probe. Expression of both transcripts was four- to eightfold greater in neonatal compared with adult rat kidney.

Because apoptosis is also evoked in target cells by cytolytic T cells, we investigated whether the Fas pathway is involved in CD4+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Analysis of Fas expression in APC, such as the B lymphoma A20.2J and MHC class II-transfected fibroblasts RT2.3, revealed a correlation between the degree of expression and sensitivity to cytotoxic attack, high level of Fas expression in A20.2J being associated with efficient lysis. To examine whether increased Fas expression in RT2.3 would render these cells more susceptible to CD4+ CTL lysis, they were transfected with a Fas gene expression vector. Indeed, Fas- but not mock-transfected RT2.3 proved to be more sensitive to lysis by either Ag specifically or nonspecifically activated CD4+ CTL. Similarly, MHC class II-negative, Fas-transfected L1210 leukemia cells were lysed with nonspecifically activated CD4+ CTL. The importance of the Fas engagement in CD4+ CTL-mediated cytotoxicity is further substantiated by the failure of both cloned and normal CD4+ CTL to lyse B cell blasts from Ipr mice. These mice are known to have a defect in functional Fas expression. Although the bulk of CD4+ T cell-mediated lysis appears to be Fas induced, the fact that the effector phase of A20.2J lysis is only partially Ca2+ independent indicates that other pathways also contribute to target cell death.","['Stalder, T', 'Hahn, S', 'Erb, P']","['Stalder T', 'Hahn S', 'Erb P']","['Institute for Medical Microbiology, University of Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/*immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Calcium/physiology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'fas Receptor']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Feb 1;152(3):1127-33.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lytic properties of several clones of rat basophilic leukemia cells transfected with either cytolysin (perforin) alone (RBL-cy) or a combination of cytolysin and granzyme A (RBL-cy-gza) were compared with cloned CTL. Analysis of the kinetics of target cell 125I-DNA vs 51Cr release with three tumor targets showed negligible DNA release with RBL-cy, less extensive 125I-DNA release relative to 51Cr release with RBL-cy-gza effector cells, whereas CTL caused greater or equal DNA release than 51Cr release at all time points. Using three different tumor target cells, comparison of RBL-cy-gza and RBL-cy clones in multiple experiments shows that RBL-cy-gza are on average more than threefold more lytic than RBL-cy. This distinction was not seen with red cell targets, in which an internal disintegration pathway does not operate. A second approach to this issue consisted of cytoplasmic loading of tumor target cells with aprotinin, a macromolecular protease inhibitor known to inhibit granzyme A and probably other granzymes. Although the control BSA-loaded target cells were essentially identical to nonloaded targets in all cases, aprotinin-loaded targets showed substantially lower release of both 51Cr and 125I-DNA with both CTL and RBL-cy-gza effector cells. In contrast, aprotinin-loaded targets were lysed with the same efficiency as control targets by RBL-cy effector cells. We conclude that secreted granzymes contribute to target lysis by triggering a target cell internal disintegration pathway that leads to both lysis and DNA breakdown.","['Nakajima, H', 'Henkart, P A']","['Nakajima H', 'Henkart PA']","['Experimental Immunology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['9087-70-1 (Aprotinin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aprotinin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA Damage', 'Granzymes', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mast Cells', 'Rats', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*enzymology', 'Transfection']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Feb 1;152(3):1057-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) enriched for immature cells by differential agglutination using the lectin soybean agglutinin (SBA) were subjected to multiparameter fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) based on light-scattering properties, the expression of the c-kit protein and the CD34 antigen, and the retention of the vital fluorescent dye, Rhodamine 123 (Rh123). Sorted populations were assayed for their content of directly clonogenic progenitor cells (colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage [CFU-GM], burst-forming units-erythroid [BFU-E], and multipotential colony-forming units [CFU-Mix]) and for the presence of more primitive progenitor cells (""pre-CFU""). The latter were assayed by (1) their ability to initiate and sustain hematopoiesis in a standard stromal cell-dependent culture system and (2) their capacity for de novo generation of clonogenic progenitors in response to a combination of six recombinant hematopoietic cytokines in a stroma-independent suspension culture assay. A mean of 76% of CD34+ cells were found to coexpress c-kit. The majority of directly clonogenic cells (98% of CFU-GM, 98% of CFU-Mix, and 85% of BFU-E) were found in the CD34+c-kit+ fraction. Similarly, all pre-CFU were recovered in the CD34+c-kit+Rh123dull fraction, irrespective of whether the cells were maintained on marrow stromal cells or in cytokine-supplemented liquid culture. A mean of 87% (range 70-100%) of the CD34+Rh123dull cells also expressed c-kit. Since SCF has been reported to act as a growth factor for early lymphoid cells as well as myeloid cells, we looked for coexpression of c-kit and early lymphoid markers in the CD34+ population by multiparameter flow cytometry. Coexpression of c-kit on a minority of cells with markers of B or T lineages was observed. The majority of early lymphoid cells, however, appeared to lack c-kit expression. This was confirmed by the finding that only 4% of c-kit+CD34+ cells showed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity, compared with 25% of the c-kit-CD34+ cells.","['Simmons, P J', 'Aylett, G W', 'Niutta, S', 'To, L B', 'Juttner, C A', 'Ashman, L K']","['Simmons PJ', 'Aylett GW', 'Niutta S', 'To LB', 'Juttner CA', 'Ashman LK']","['Leukaemia Research Unit, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Feb;22(2):157-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that additional cross-linking of B cell antigens, using Sepharose beads coated with anti-mu, anti-(IL)-4 mAb (but not soluble mAb) or anti-CD40 antigen counteracted the inhibitory activity of IL-4. More importantly, cell contacts between B cells and activated T cells (but not unstimulated T cells) were sufficient to counteract IL-4-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis. In addition, the inhibitory activity of IL-4 on chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cells stimulated with anti-mu and IL-2 was itself reduced by the presence of fixed activated T cells. Our data suggest that a major role for IL-4 would be to prepare B cells to receive additional mitogenic signals through cell contact interactions with activated T lymphocytes.

Lymphoblastic lymphoma of B-cell origin (B-lymphoblastic lymphoma) has been relatively poorly described. Whether B-lymphoblastic lymphoma should be managed like its T-cell counterpart remains to be clarified. METHODS: From 1983 to 1991, 10 adult patients were diagnosed as having B-lymphoblastic lymphoma at National Taiwan University Hospital by using the histomorphologic criteria of international working formulation. B-cell phenotype was determined by the immunohistochemistry method. Clinicopathologic features of these 10 patients were reviewed. RESULTS: Seven patients were grouped as typical type and were characterized by an aggressive clinical course with lymph node (7 of 7), bone marrow (6 of 7), liver (3 of 7), spleen (3 of 7), and central nervous system (2 of 7) involvement. The median survival time was 8 months. In contrast, three patients had an atypical clinical picture. They were older patients (64-73 years) and were characterized by a relatively less aggressive course with predominantly bulky nodal involvement. Two of these three patients are alive (31 and 49 months, respectively) and well at this report, with one of them being repeatedly experiencing disease remission with the use of simple salvage chemotherapeutic regimens. Further studies revealed that tumor tissues of these three atypical cases had strong expression of CD5 (Leu-1) marker. CONCLUSION: B-lymphoblastic lymphoma diagnosed by histomorphologic criteria should be further distinguished from a relatively favorable subtype, which probably represents a variant of blastic lymphocytic lymphoma of intermediate differentiation as described by Lardelli et al. Clinical features of typical B-lymphoblastic lymphoma, except for the lack of mediastinal involvement, is similar to its T-cell counterpart.","['Cheng, A L', 'Su, I J', 'Tien, H F', 'Wang, C C', 'Chen, Y C', 'Wang, C H']","['Cheng AL', 'Su IJ', 'Tien HF', 'Wang CC', 'Chen YC', 'Wang CH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Rate']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1994 Feb 1;73(3):706-10. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3<706::aid-cncr2820730334>3.0.co;2-u.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19940201)73:3<706::aid-cncr2820730334>3.0.co;2-u [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some genes appear to be of particular importance in these complex processes and are therefore potential targets for molecularly based therapeutics. The rationale for such treatment is that, if the function of critical genes can be efficiently and specifically perturbed, then the ensuing disruption might lead to preferential leukemic cell death. Several technologies for carrying out targeted gene disruption now exist. One approach, the ""antisense"" gene strategy, appears to be particularly well suited to the treatment of human leukemia ex vivo and perhaps in vivo as well.

To examine whether c-kit product is possibly involved in the pathogenesis of human lymphomas, we analyzed the expression of the c-kit protein in neoplastic cells from a variety of lymphoid tumors by immunostaining of lymph node frozen sections with the 17F11 antibody, detecting an extracellular epitope of the c-kit receptor, and of c-kit RNA by Northern blot hybridization. Of 24 nonHodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) of B- and T-cell phenotype, none expressed immunodetectable c-kit protein that was also not evidenced in lymphoid cells of reactive lymph nodes and normal tonsils. In contrast, c-kit protein was expressed by Reed-Sternberg cells and their mononuclear variants from 11 of 21 Hodgkin's disease (HD) cases, and in tumor cells from 11 of 16 cases of CD30+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). c-kit specific mRNA was also detected in lymph node tissues from HD and ALCL cases but not in neoplastic tissues from NHL other than ALCL. In addition, c-kit/CD30+ tumor cells were evidenced by flow cytometry in a patient displaying massive bone marrow involvement by ALCL.

By scanning electron microscopy, both normal and leukemic cells seeded onto stroma were surrounded by folds of stromal cells or were linked to the stroma by fine tendrils and uropods. Separation of normal B progenitors from stroma by use of microporous membranes led to significantly lower cell recoveries compared with results when contact was unimpeded. For instance, 22.5% +/- 1.8% (mean +/- SEM) of CD19+, CD34+ cells (most immature subset) were recovered after a 7-day culture directly on stroma, compared with 5.2% +/- 0.7% after growth on membranes (P < .001 by Student's t test). In 6 of 11 cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, separation of progenitors from stroma resulted in apoptosis and a greater than 60% reduction in cell recovery. In the remaining 5 cases, however, this effect was much less pronounced, with reductions in cell recoveries ranging from 48.5% to less than 1% (median, 39.0%) of control values. Inhibition of very late antigen-4, a surface molecule critical for adhesion of B lymphoblasts to stroma, was associated with a greater loss of normal CD34+ B progenitors compared with that for equivalent leukemic cells. These results establish direct contact with stroma as a survival requirement of normal B lymphoblasts and show marked heterogeneity in stromal dependency among B-lineage leukemic cells.","['Manabe, A', 'Murti, K G', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Kumagai, M', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Campana, D']","['Manabe A', 'Murti KG', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Kumagai M', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Very Late Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD19', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*blood/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Receptors, Very Late Antigen/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/physiology/ultrastructure']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Feb 1;83(3):758-66.,['S0006-4971(20)75772-1 [pii]'],,,"['P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of leukemia cells is supported by a small subpopulation, leukemic blast progenitors. Leukemic blast progenitors make leukemic blast colonies in methylcellulose culture. To determine the mechanism by which leukemia cells proliferate, we studied the role of several cytokines in the proliferation of leukemic blast progenitors in vitro. The findings indicated that there are at least three types in the regulation by cytokines of the leukemic cell growth. One is the stimulation of leukemic blast progenitors by colony-stimulating factors(CSFs) or interleukins(ILs) added in culture. These cytokines include granulocyte-CSF(G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), IL-3 and IL-1. The second is the autocrine growth mechanism. Leukemia cells by themselves produce and secrete G-CSF and GM-CSF, which stimulate the growth of leukemic blast progenitors. The third is a complex mechanism. IL-1, produced by leukemia cells or other cells, enhances the production of GM-CSF by leukemia cells, which stimulates the growth of leukemic blast progenitors.

While H-2d/H-2z heterozygosity acts as one major predisposing genetic element for autoimmune disease, H-2z/H-2z homozygosity acts as an element for B-CLL. In the H-2z/H-2z homozygotes, there was an age-dependent increase in frequencies of CD5 B cells in the blood and spleen, and such CD5 B cells showed oligoclonal to monoclonal expansion, giving rise to B-CLL. B-CLL cells from these mice had surface phenotypes typical of CD5 B lineage cells, and expressed high levels of proto-oncogene bcl-2. Elevated bcl-2 expression was also observed in premalignant B cells in the aged mice, thereby suggesting that apoptosis-resistant, long-surviving CD5 B cells with a self-renewal capacity form the basis of malignant transformation. This model not only provides clues for analyzing multiple steps of genetic alterations involved in the generation of B-CLL, but also sheds light on the correlation between B-CLL and autoimmune disease.","['Okamoto, H', 'Nishimura, H', 'Shinozaki, A', 'Zhang, D', 'Hirose, S', 'Shirai, T']","['Okamoto H', 'Nishimura H', 'Shinozaki A', 'Zhang D', 'Hirose S', 'Shirai T']","['Department of Pathology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD5 Antigens', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mice, Inbred NZB/genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 Dec;84(12):1273-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02834.x.,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02834.x [doi]'],,,,,['bcl-2'],,,PMC5919115,,,,,,,,,

The P3E8 mAb2 was difficult to classify. Based on relative efficiency in these assays, .1C7 was chosen for further study, and upon injection was able to induce Ab3 responses in C57BL/6, BALB/c, and CBA mice. The fact that the Ab3 activity was detected in a competitive ELISA in which the hyperimmune antisera blocked the binding of Ab1 to Ab2, plus the ability to raise Ab3 neutralizing antibodies in three different mouse strains were consistent with .1C7 as an internal image Ab2 beta anti-Id.

Remission induction therapy consisted of cytarabine 3 g/m2 (1.5 g/m2 for age > 50 years) intravenously over 1 hour every 12 hours for 12 doses and idarubicin 12 mg/m2 over 30 minutes on days 2, 3, and 4 of cytarabine, followed by 10 micrograms/kg granulocyte colony-stimulating factor subcutaneously daily until the absolute neutrophil count increased to > or = 5.0 x 10(9)/L on 2 consecutive days. Twenty-seven patients received all the planned doses of chemotherapy. The complete remission (CR) rate to a single course of therapy was 65% in 20 patients with de novo AML (median age, 60.5 years; age range, 26 to 78 years); for those aged less than 60 and > or = 60 years, the CR rates were 90% and 40%, respectively. In contrast, only two of 10 patients with secondary AML (median age, 68 years; age range, 35 to 77 years) achieved a CR. The median time from initiation of chemotherapy to recovery of 0.5 x 10(9)/L neutrophils in de novo AML patients achieving CR was 20 days (range, 18 to 23 days). Median times to last platelet transfusion and to 100 x 10(9)/L platelet count were 23 days (range, 18 to 41 days) and 28 days (range, 24 to 97 days), respectively. The major nonhematologic toxicity was transient hyperbilirubinemia, which was observed in 64% of patients. Reversible cerebellar toxicity was seen in three patients. Thus, idarubicin at full dose (12 mg/m2 x 3 days) may be safely administered with high-dose cytarabine, even in elderly patients. The use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is associated with rapid neutrophil recovery without obvious toxicity. The CR rate for de novo AML patients treated with a single course of high-dose cytarabine, idarubicin, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is at least comparable to CR rates achieved with standard-dose cytarabine and anthracycline regimens.

This is attributed to the error-prone nature of HIV-1 replication and its proclivity for recombination. During replication and recombination, reverse transcriptase (RT) must polymerize DNA to the 5' ends of multiple RNA and DNA template termini while converting HIV-1 RNA to double-stranded DNA. We have determined the fidelity of HIV-1 RT in vitro during polymerization to the 5' ends of HIV-1 long terminal repeat DNA template sequences and to the end of a partial HIV-1 genomic RNA template that mimics a recombination intermediate. HIV-1 RT readily extended recessed DNA primers to form full-length blunt-end DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA duplexes. In addition, HIV-1 RT catalyzed high yields of products with one to four extra nucleotides at the 3' ends of the nascent DNAs. These products were formed processively via a nontemplated mechanism that is highly specific for the addition of purine nucleotides (A > G >> T > or = C). Thus, HIV-1 RT is extremely unfaithful at both DNA and RNA template ends, introducing errors (extra nucleotides) in one out of every two or three nascent strands processively polymerized.

These results raise the possibility that signal transduction pathways which are controlled by SCF in FDC-P1 cells, can be activated by M-CSF if its receptor is illicitly expressed. FDC-P1 cells that expressed the M-CSFr were responsive to as little as 100 U/ml of M-CSF when added in combination with IL-3 or GM-CSF. This sensitive assay was used to demonstrate that transforming deletions of the C-terminal tail of the M-CSFr and two-point mutations within the same region that converted tyrosine 969 to either phenylalanine or to cysteine, allowed the mutant M-CSF receptors to synergize with IL-3 or GM-CSF in the absence of M-CSF.

Endogenous TNF release by LPS/TNF/IFN treated HL60 cells was postulated to play a role with the above findings. In these studies, HL60 cells expressed CD14 when treated with TNF, IFN, and LPS. CD14 mediates TNF release in monocytes/macrophages in response to binding of LPS with LPS binding protein (LBP). CD14 was not expressed in either untreated or LPS only treated HL60 cells. CD14 expression was present and greater with HL60 cells cultured with LPS/TNF/IFN vs TNF/IFN (47.47% vs 9.07% positive, respectively) suggesting synergism for LPS in CD14 induction. CD14 expression was associated with endogenous TNF release, and with significantly higher levels by HL60 cells treated with LPS/TNF/IFN vs TNF/IFN (p < 0.001). Addition of anti-CD14 antibody significantly reduced release of TNF in TNF/IFN (p < 0.001) and LPS/TNF/IFN (p = 0.0013) treated cells.

HXB-Luc contains the Photinus pyralis luciferase gene in place of the nef gene and provides a highly sensitive, simple assay for HIV infection and expression. To circumvent any superinfection block in latently infected cells, we also generated viruses pseudotyped with murine leukemia virus amphotropic envelope (HXB-Luc:ampho). The parental uninfected lines, U937 and A3.01, from which the latently infected cell lines U1 and ACH-2, respectively, were derived could be readily infected with pseudotyped or nonpseudotyped reporter viruses. However, superinfection of U1 cells with either HXB-Luc or HXB-Luc:ampho resulted in only low levels of luciferase activity. Like the endogenous provirus, HXB-Luc provirus could be efficiently activated by phorbol ester treatment of HXB-Luc:ampho-superinfected U1 cells. In contrast, superinfection of ACH-2 cells resulted in active expression of the secondarily introduced virus even in unstimulated cells and luciferase production higher than in the parental cell line A3.01. Thus, the proviral latency in U1 cells appears to result from a defect in the cellular environment (a trans effect), whereas the latency in ACH-2 is specific to the integrated provirus and is probably a cis effect due to the site of integration. These results demonstrate distinct modes of proviral latency in these two cell line models and may have implications in our understanding of the regulation and significance of cellular latency in HIV infection.","['Chen, B K', 'Saksela, K', 'Andino, R', 'Baltimore, D']","['Chen BK', 'Saksela K', 'Andino R', 'Baltimore D']","['Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line/microbiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase', 'HIV-1/genetics/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Phenotype', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Proviruses/genetics/*growth & development', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Superinfection', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Activation/drug effects', '*Virus Latency']",1994/02/01 00:00,1994/02/01 00:01,['1994/02/01 00:00'],"['1994/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Feb;68(2):654-60. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.2.654-660.1994.,['10.1128/JVI.68.2.654-660.1994 [doi]'],,,['NIAID AI22346/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC236499,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report a new retrovirus, STLV-II, which we have identified in spider monkeys (Ateles fusciceps), a New World primate species. Initially, a recombinant HTLV-II envelope protein (RP-IIB) was used to identify anti-STLV-II antibodies in New World monkeys by Western blot (immunoblot) assays. Subsequently, the virus was characterized by Southern blot hybridization, which showed that STLV-II and HTLV-II have a high degree of nucleotide sequence homology but have different restriction enzyme patterns. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the pX-II region of STLV-II provirus revealed 3% variation with the corresponding region of HTLV-II. Electron micrographic studies revealed HTLV-like, type C retrovirus particles outside the cell membranes of STLV-II-infected cells. This study describes the first link between HTLV-II and a simian reservoir in the New World. Further molecular studies of STLV-II infection in different species of New World monkeys, especially from the wild, may provide valuable information about the origin and intragroup relationships of South American monkeys.

A review of its pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties and therapeutic potential in haematological malignancies.,872-94,"Cladribine (2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine) is an adenosine deaminase-resistant analogue of deoxyadenosine. In the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia, cladribine has demonstrated excellent efficacy (complete response in 33 to 92% of patients) in noncomparative studies. Cladribine appears to compare favourably with other systemic agents in this indication as it achieves a high degree of efficacy after a single 7-day course, with an acceptable tolerability profile. However, long term data and direct comparative studies with interferon-alpha and pentostatin (deoxycoformycin) are required to confirm the finite advantages offered by cladribine. Preliminary results obtained in other indications including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphoma, Waldenstrom's macroglobinaemia and acute myeloid leukaemia in children have been sufficiently encouraging to warrant further study. Early pharmacokinetic data suggest that cladribine may be administered by oral and subcutaneous routes, both of which permit convenient outpatient therapy. Myelosuppression, the dose-limiting toxicity of cladribine, and culture-negative fever are the most common adverse effects associated with therapy. However, cladribine appears to be only rarely associated with many of the other adverse effects that characterise antineoplastic therapy. In the weeks post-treatment, there is a small but definite risk of serious infection; infections with a fatal outcome have been reported in a number of studies with cladribine. In conclusion, preliminary data concerning cladribine have been extremely encouraging. Should early response rates in patients with hairy cell leukaemia be sustained, the efficacy of the drug, together with a short treatment regimen, a favourable tolerability profile, and the possibility of oral therapy, suggest that cladribine is likely to supersede other agents available for this indication.","['Bryson, H M', 'Sorkin, E M']","['Bryson HM', 'Sorkin EM']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,['47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cladribine/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 1993 Nov;46(5):872-94. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199346050-00007.,['10.2165/00003495-199346050-00007 [doi]'],,,,,,,125,,,,,,,,,,

Input are eight list mode data files acquired with a FACScan flow cytometer. For each cell, four parameters are measured: forward light scatter, orthogonal light scatter, fluorescein fluorescence, and phycoerythrin fluorescence. Eight data files are acquired in the following sequence: unstained, isotype controls, CD10/CD19, CD20/CD5, CD3/CD22, CD7/CD33, HLADR/CD13, and CD34/CD38. First, each of the data files 3 to 8 are clustered independently employing an algorithm based on nearest neighbors. Next, the clusters are associated across the data files to form cell populations, using the assumption of light scatter invariance across tubes for each population. The mean positions of each cell population are fed into a decision tree. The decision tree first identifies normal cell populations, i.e., monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, NK cells, T-lymphocytes, and B-lymphocytes. After elimination of the normal cell populations from the data space, the residual cell populations are classified as B-lineage ALL, T-lineage ALL, AML, AUL, B-CLL, or unknown. The effectiveness of this novel approach is shown with case studies of B-lymphoid, T-lymphoid, and Myeloid acute leukemias.","['Verwer, B J', 'Terstappen, L W']","['Verwer BJ', 'Terstappen LW']","['Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, California.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD20', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Cell Separation', 'Eosinophils/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1993 Nov;14(8):862-75. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990140804.,['10.1002/cyto.990140804 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrotransposon expression was either unchanged or decreased during the progressive stages of the cycle compared to virgin tissue.

We investigated the ability of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) to stimulate the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 to adhere to fibronectin, either in its undifferentiated state (HL60) or after dimethylsulfoxide-induced differentiation along the granulocytic pathway (dHL60). PMA stimulated little adherence of undifferentiated HL60 to fibronectin or to the 120-kD chymotryptic cell-binding domain (CBD) of fibronectin. In contrast, PMA stimulated dHL60 cells to rapidly adhere to both fibronectin- and to CBD-coated plastic. PMA-stimulated dHL60 adherence to fibronectin was largely mediated by both alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1, whereas PMA-stimulated dHL60 adherence to CBD was largely mediated by alpha 5 beta 1. There was little contribution from beta 2 integrins to PMA-stimulated dHL60 adherence to fibronectin or CBD. The inability of undifferentiated HL60 to adhere to fibronectin and CBD did not result from lack of expression of alpha 4 beta 1 or alpha 5 beta 1 because HL60 and dHL60 express similar amounts of both alpha 4 beta 1 and alpha 5 beta 1 on their surface. In addition, 1 mmol/L Mn2+ induced similar amounts of alpha 5 beta 1-dependent adherence of both HL60 and dHL60, showing that alpha 5 beta 1 on undifferentiated HL60 is capable of binding to its ligand. These data suggest that activation of protein kinase C cannot functionally upregulate these beta 1 integrins on undifferentiated HL60 cells. The development of PMA-stimulated beta 1-dependent adherence after granulocytic differentiation of HL60 cells suggests that the differentiated HL60 cell is a useful model for investigating functional coupling of protein kinase C to beta 1 integrin in myeloid cells.","['Bohnsack, J F', 'Chang, J']","['Bohnsack JF', 'Chang J']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City 84132.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):543-52.,['S0006-4971(20)77683-4 [pii]'],,,['AI26733/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, these Cs also enhanced the cytotoxicity of the more potent T101 F(ab')2 RTA-IT (ninefold and eightfold, respectively).

Neither CsA nor SDZ PSC 833 affected the rate of RTA-IT binding, internalization, intracellular trafficking, or degradation. Analysis of internalized T101 RTA-IT molecules showed that these were essentially intact, which suggests that these enhancers may act only on a small population of RTA-ITs that escapes present investigational techniques.

Two naturally occurring isoforms of the Kit receptor, termed Kit and KitA, were originally described in mouse cells and, subsequently, in human cells. These isoforms differ by the presence (KitA) or absence (Kit) of four amino acids (Gly-Asn-Asn-Lys) that lie immediately outside the transmembrane domain. RNase protection was used to measure the levels of Kit and KitA mRNA in normal bone marrow and the blast cells from individuals with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Although both isoforms were present in all the AML samples tested, there was considerable heterogeneity in the relative levels of the two transcripts, with Kit to KitA RNA ratios varying from as low as 1.3 to as high as 12. In contrast, the ratio of Kit to KitA transcripts in normal bone marrow was tightly clustered between 4.4 and 5.5. Because alterations in the relative levels of expression of Kit and KitA may affect the ability of a cell to respond to the Kit ligand, Steel factor, we examined the Kit/KitA RNA ratio in AML patients that differed with respect to a number of diagnostic, prognostic, and biologic parameters. The relative levels of Kit to KitA RNA was independent of French-American-British subtype, response to therapy, and primary and secondary plating efficiencies in vitro. Thus, these data suggest that the relative levels of the two isoforms of the Kit receptor in AML are not associated with any obvious biologic or clinical parameters and, therefore, may reflect naturally occurring changes in splicing mechanisms as stem cells differentiate.","['Piao, X', 'Curtis, J E', 'Minkin, S', 'Minden, M D', 'Bernstein, A']","['Piao X', 'Curtis JE', 'Minkin S', 'Minden MD', 'Bernstein A']","['Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/*analysis/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 15;83(2):476-81.,['S0006-4971(20)77674-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used the promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line to examine TSP receptor expression during differentiation of leukocytes along either the monocyte/macrophage or the polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) pathway. 125I-labeled TSP binding to undifferentiated or differentiated HL-60 cells was time-dependent reaching saturation by 45 min. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells expressed a single class of heparin-inhibitable TSP receptors. Treating HL-60 cells with PMA induced their differentiation to macrophage-like cells and resulted in a concomitant 10-fold increase in TSP receptor expression. As with undifferentiated cells, a single class of heparin-inhibitable receptors was observed. Treating HL-60 cells with DMSO induced their differentiation to PMN-like cells and resulted in a fivefold increase in TSP receptor expression. However, in this case two classes of binding sites were apparent on PMN-like cells, only 40% of which were heparin inhibitable. This is reminiscent of TSP binding to normal peripheral blood PMN (S.J. Suchard, L.A. Boxer, and V.M. Dixit. 1991. J. Immunol. 147:651). In parallel studies, we also examined TSP synthesis during HL-60 cell differentiation. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells synthesized and secreted TSP as assessed by immunoprecipitation. TSP synthesis increased about fourfold when cells were differentiated toward PMN-like cells. In contrast, TSP was not detected in macrophage-like cells. RNase protection assays showed that TSP transcript levels paralleled TSP protein expression during differentiation. These findings suggest that expression of both TSP and TSP receptors are differentially regulated during blood cell maturation.","['Suchard, S J', 'Mansfield, P J', 'Dixit, V M']","['Suchard SJ', 'Mansfield PJ', 'Dixit VM']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoadhesin)', '0 (Thrombospondins)']",IM,"['CD36 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macrophages/cytology/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytoadhesin/*metabolism', 'Thrombospondins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1994 Jan 15;152(2):877-88.,,,,"['AI26863/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58182/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that the quality of such grafts from transplantation candidates may be improved by hematopoietic cytokine support, especially if purified CD34-positive progenitors are cultured. The aim of this preclinical work was to quantitate ex vivo recovery of myeloid progenitors (colony-forming units-granulocyte/macrophage [CFU-GM]) in STLMC before and after short-term, in vivo treatment with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF), or interleukin-3 (rhIL-3). EXPERIMENTAL SETUP: Twenty-two sequential patients in marrow remission for hematological malignancies and eligible for autologous marrow transplantation received rhG-CSF or rhGM-CSF for 5 days or rhIL-3 for 10 days before marrow harvest. Marrow samples before and after in vivo priming were studied for CFU-GM in pre- and post-STLMC. RESULTS: After priming with rhG-CSF, rhGM-CSF, or rhIL-3, the number of isolated light-density cells increased nine-, six-, and two-fold, respectively. The total number of sampled (18 mL marrow) myeloid progenitors preculture (day 7/14 CFU-GM x 10(4) increased significantly from median 0.7/1.1 before to 37.3/26.7 after priming with rhG-CSF (n = 8) and from 5.6/3.4 before to 46.6/44.9 after priming with rhGM-CSF (n = 8) but remained unchanged (3.7/1.5 to 3.6/5.7) after priming with rhIL-3 (n = 6). The number of myeloid progenitors postculture (day 7/14 CFU-GM x 10(4) per 18 mL marrow) in cytokine-supported STLMC significantly increased from median 0.3/0.6 before to 7.0/5.3 after priming with rhG-CSF and from 1.9/1.6 before to 24.4/14.4 after priming with rhGM-CSF but remained unchanged (0.4/0.6 to 0.4/0.2) after priming with rhIL-3. Cytokine-primed and purified CD34+ marrow cells may be expanded in STLMC by a cytokine-driven differentiation into late myeloid progenitors and endstage cells. CONCLUSION: In vivo priming of bone marrow cells by hematopoietic cytokines significantly increases the recovery of harvested pre- and postculture myeloid progenitors. During cytokine-supported STLMC, early myeloid progenitors may differentiate into a ""very late"" progenitor pool with a potential for fast marrow regeneration. The number of such progenitors in cytokine-supported short-term liquid cultures may be sufficient for fast myeloid engraftment and complete peripheral blood or marrow stem-cell support after high-dose chemotherapy.","['Johnsen, H E', 'Jensen, L', 'Gaarsdal, E', 'Hansen, P B', 'Ersboll, J', 'Hansen, N E']","['Johnsen HE', 'Jensen L', 'Gaarsdal E', 'Hansen PB', 'Ersboll J', 'Hansen NE']","['Department of Medicine and Haematology L, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Jan;22(1):80-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562YO had a higher capability of erythroid differentiation by hemin and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) than its parent K562 (KIT-). We obtained the transfectant expressing c-kit by introducing c-kit cDNA into K562 (KIT-). The differentiation of the transfectant was similar to that of the parent cell. Thus the difference described above was not due to the expression of c-kit. Next, we investigated the effects of stem cell factor (SCF) on the differentiation of the K562 cell expressing c-kit. SCF did not enhance the cell growth of K562YO. On the other hand, SCF suppressed induction of benzidine-positive cells when c-kit-positive cells were treated with hemin and Ara-C, especially at a low concentration. Furthermore, c-kit mRNA and protein were down-regulated during erythroid differentiation. SCF also downregulated the c-kit proteins. Our results suggest that the SCF/c-kit signals could act negatively for erythroid differentiation of the K562 cells expressing c-kit. K562YO is also useful for studying the mechanism that controls the expression of the c-kit gene because there is a K562 counterpart cell line that does not express this gene.","['Ogawa, K', 'Tashima, M', 'Toi, T', 'Sawai, H', 'Sawada, H', 'Fujita, J', 'Maruyama, Y', 'Okuma, M']","['Ogawa K', 'Tashima M', 'Toi T', 'Sawai H', 'Sawada H', 'Fujita J', 'Maruyama Y', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry/*pathology/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1994 Jan;22(1):45-51.,,,,,,['c-kit'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial results suggest that in the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia pentostatin achieves a more rapid response and higher frequency of complete remission with longer duration than interferon-alpha 2a, although it is still not known if some patients experiencing complete remission have been cured. The drug has yet to be directly compared with other promising purine analogues such as cladribine and fludarabine, and results of such comparisons are required before the ultimate role of pentostatin in the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia can be clearly established.

Karyotype at diagnosis was abnormal in 25/30 CD34+ AML patients, of which nine had major karyotype aberrations (MAKA). Clonal chromosome changes were detected in 9/30 patients with CD34- AML. The most frequent chromosome aberration in CD34+ patients was -5/5q-, an aberration showing a strong association with the M2 FAB subtype of AML. Other recurring chromosome changes involved chromosome 16q (four cases) and chromosome 17p (three cases). Total or partial monosomy 7q was detected in three cases. Among CD34- AML, two patients had the classical t(15;17) and two had structural aberrations of 6q. Among patients with CD34+ AML, nine had MAKA in association with trilineage myelodysplasia (TMDS). TMDS was infrequent in CD34+ AML without MAKA and in CD34- AML. Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 8/30 CD34+ AML (26%), as compared with 22/30 CD34- AML (73%), and median survival was 2 months in the former group and 8 months in the latter.

Adhesion of blast cells from 10 cases of AML to unstimulated and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1) stimulated HUVECs was similar to or greater than that of control neutrophils. The extent to which endothelial E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were involved in this adhesive process was investigated using blocking monoclonal antibodies to these proteins. In the majority of cases studied (7/8), anti-E-selectin significantly inhibited adhesion to IL-1 stimulated endothelium (26-65% inhibition) and in 5/8 cases so did anti-VCAM-1 (maximum of 31% inhibition). All cases were found to express the sialylated Lewis x antigen and very late activation antigen-4, ligands for E-selectin and VCAM-1 respectively.

Such adhesive interactions are likely to confer on AML blast cells the ability to migrate across the vascular wall and so to establish extravascular disease.","['Cavenagh, J D', 'Gordon-Smith, E C', 'Gibson, F M', 'Gordon, M Y']","['Cavenagh JD', 'Gordon-Smith EC', 'Gibson FM', 'Gordon MY']","[""Division of Haematology, St George's Hospital Medical School, London.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (E-Selectin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/immunology/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'E-Selectin', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Oct;85(2):285-91. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03168.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03168.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was shown in malignant cells from patients with multiple myeloma. In this study the influence of IFN on the viability of primary malignant cells from patients with different malignancies was studied. As previously described a direct cytotoxic effect of IFN on multiple myeloma cells was observed. No major effects on cell viability could be found in malignant cells from patients with lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, hairy cell leukaemia, chronic myelogenous leukaemia and carcinoma. This indicates that the direct cytotoxic effect of IFN in multiple myeloma may be relatively specific for this malignancy. It could be due to a specific differentiation stage in the myeloma cells, specific genetic alterations and/or abrogation of an autocrine/paracrine loop.","['Grander, D', 'Xu, B', 'Einhorn, S']","['Grander D', 'Xu B', 'Einhorn S']","['Division for Experimental Oncology, Radiumhemmet, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,['9008-11-1 (Interferons)'],IM,"['Cell Count', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/*therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(14):1940-3. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90448-o.,"['0959-8049(93)90448-O [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90448-o [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The regulatory role of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) in this process was explored by studying the effects of a powerful PTPase inhibitor, vanadate peroxide (pervanadate), on the activation cascade of Jurkat human leukaemic T-cells. Pervanadate induced activation of the tyrosine kinases lck and fyn (4- and 3-fold respectively) and a dramatic increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins, notably phospholipase C gamma 1. After this event, we observed a rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, corresponding to an influx. This effect required surface expression of the CD45 PTPase and was not observed in CD45-deficient variants of Jurkat cells. In the CD45-negative variant, the effect of pervanadate on tyrosine phosphorylation was globally decreased and some phosphorylated substrates were specifically missing. Pervanadate also stimulated transcription of the c-fos gene and accumulation of its mRNA as well as several other hallmarks of T-lymphocyte activation such as surface expression of the CD69 antigen and the interleukin 2 receptor alpha-chain (CD25). Pervanadate synergized with signals delivered by T-cell antigen receptor engagement or by a phorbol ester to induce interleukin 2 production. Pervanadate activated NF-kappa B, as shown by an increase in DNA-binding activity of this transcription factor. We thus conclude that PTPases play a crucial role in the negative regulation of signal transduction culminating in T-lymphocyte activation. Moreover, induction of tyrosine phosphorylation appears sufficient per se to initiate a complete activation programme.","['Imbert, V', 'Peyron, J F', 'Farahi Far, D', 'Mari, B', 'Auberger, P', 'Rossi, B']","['Imbert V', 'Peyron JF', 'Farahi Far D', 'Mari B', 'Auberger P', 'Rossi B']","['INSERM U364, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (peroxovanadate)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Genes, fos', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Vanadates/*pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1994 Jan 1;297 ( Pt 1):163-73. doi: 10.1042/bj2970163.,['10.1042/bj2970163 [doi]'],,,,,['c-fos'],,,PMC1137806,,,,,,,,,

Identification and functional analysis of cysteine-90.,577-83,"Treatment of murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase with benzophenone 4-maleimide inactivates DNA polymerase activity, but has no effect on the RNAase H function. Kinetic measurements indicated that benzophenone 4-maleimide is a competitive inhibitor with respect to template-primer binding, but is non-competitive with respect to dNTP binding. Enzyme modified with benzophenone 4-maleimide cannot bind template-primer or primer alone, as judged by u.v.-mediated cross-linking of radiolabelled substrates. Of the eight cysteine residues in murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase, only two were modified by benzophenone 4-maleimide, which were identified as Cys-90 and Cys-310 by comparative tryptic-peptide mapping and amino acid composition analysis. Inclusion of template-primer or primer alone in the modification mixture protected only Cys-90 from modification by benzophenone 4-maleimide. To investigate the role of Cys-90 in detail, we converted it to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzyme, however, exhibited no loss either of DNA polymerase or of RNAase H activity. These results indicate that Cys-90 is located in a domain of murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase that binds template-primer, but may not have a direct role in the enzymic function of the enzyme. Ala-90 mutant murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase is at least 10-fold more susceptible to heat inactivation than is the wild-type enzyme, which suggests that Cys-90 in murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase may play a role in maintaining structural integrity.","['Basu, S', 'Basu, A', 'Modak, M J']","['Basu S', 'Basu A', 'Modak MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Benzophenones)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '92944-71-3 (benzophenone-4-maleimide)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Benzophenones', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cysteine/*analysis/physiology', 'DNA Primers/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*enzymology', 'Maleimides', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Peptide Mapping', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*analysis', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Trypsin', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Dec 15;296 ( Pt 3):577-83. doi: 10.1042/bj2960577.,['10.1042/bj2960577 [doi]'],,,['AI-26052/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,PMC1137737,,,,,,,,,

This common biochemical signaling pathway involves the rapid activation of the Src family tyrosine kinase LCK (p56lck), which is physically associated with the CD19 receptor, and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates leading to stimulation of phosphoinositide turnover, and activation of protein kinase C. Importantly, engagement of the CD19 receptor promoted radiation-induced apoptosis in radiation-resistant B-lineage ALL cells in a cell type-specific fashion.

Both the exogenous H-2Kb and the endogenous H-2Dk genes behaved in the same manner and were not stimulated by IFNs. The lack of response to IFNs by clone Kb-S27 also resulted in its resistance to the antiproliferative effects of IFNs. This lack of IFN-induction by clone Kb-S27 was not simply due to a change in its surface interferon receptors. Gel-retardation assay and northern blot analysis both demonstrated the lack of induction of the IRF-1 DNA-binding factor in clone Kb-S27. In addition, northern blot analysis showed that the IRF-2 gene expression in clone Kb-S27 was upregulated when compared with the other IFN-inducible clones.","['Lim, S P', 'Hui, K M']","['Lim SP', 'Hui KM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Irf2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*biosynthesis', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interferon/analysis', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1994;39(3):168-77. doi: 10.1007/BF00241257.,['10.1007/BF00241257 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the effects of stem cell factor (SCF) on the growth and sensitivity to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C) of blast progenitors in acute myelogenous leukemia. SCF stimulated both colony formation and self-renewal of blast progenitors and, when used in combination with other HGFs, synergistic enhancement of colony formation was noted in 8 of the 15 patients examined. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated no unique growth dependency on SCF in either CD34+ or CD34- populations. Blast cells of patients that displayed synergistic growth enhancement with SCF displayed the highest Ara-C sensitivity when HGFs were used in combination with SCF. The tritiated thymidine suicide test (20-min exposure) revealed that the proportion of blast progenitors in the S phase of the cell cycle was highest when SCF and another HGF were simultaneously present, although 24-h exposure killed most or all of the blast progenitors. These data indicate that SCF enhances growth and sensitivity to Ara-C of acute myelogenous leukemia blast progenitors in a closely correlated fashion and that the cell cycle changes as well as other mechanisms are involved in the Ara-C sensitivity modulation by SCF.","['Inatomi, Y', 'Toyama, K', 'Clark, S C', 'Shimizu, K', 'Miyauchi, J']","['Inatomi Y', 'Toyama K', 'Clark SC', 'Shimizu K', 'Miyauchi J']","[""Clinical Laboratory, National Children's Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1994/01/15 00:00,1994/01/15 00:01,['1994/01/15 00:00'],"['1994/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1994 Jan 15;54(2):455-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the possibility that this interaction can explain the pathophysiology of the changes in iron metabolism in the course of chronic disease, subsequently leading to anemia in chronic disease (ACD), we examined the effect of alpha 1-AT on cells of the erythroid cell line. alpha 1-AT completely prevented tf binding to tfR on K562 human erythroleukemic cells and on reticulocytes. This inhibitory potency was dose-dependent and competitive, as proved in equilibrium saturation and kinetic studies. The cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha showed no such effect. Internalization of the tf-tfR complex was inhibited with alpha 1-AT in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, alpha 1-AT profoundly reduced the growth of K562 cells as well as their proliferation, albeit to a lesser degree. Growth of early erythroid progenitor cells (burst-forming units-erythroid) was significantly suppressed by alpha 1-AT, but no effect on the growth of late erythroid progenitor cells (colony-forming units-erythroid) was detected. These inhibitions of alpha 1-AT were seen in high physiologic concentrations attained in the course of acute-phase situations. These data show that alpha 1-AT might be a mediator of the changes in iron metabolism that are characteristic of clinical findings in the course of ACD.","['Graziadei, I', 'Gaggl, S', 'Kaserbacher, R', 'Braunsteiner, H', 'Vogel, W']","['Graziadei I', 'Gaggl S', 'Kaserbacher R', 'Braunsteiner H', 'Vogel W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/pharmacology', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/*pharmacology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1994 Jan 1;83(1):260-8.,['S0006-4971(20)77302-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In culture, LIF alters the transmitter phenotype of sympathetic neurons, inducing cholinergic function, reducing noradrenergic function, and altering neuropeptide expression. In vivo, a noradrenergic to cholinergic switch occurs in the developing sweat gland innervation, and changes in neuropeptide phenotype occur in axotomized adult ganglia. We find that the gland innervation of LIF-deficient mice is indistinguishable from normal. In contrast, neuropeptide induction in ganglia cultured as explants or axotomized in situ is significantly suppressed in LIF-deficient mice.

Cell viability was also retained in the presence of quercetin, whereas untreated cells did not survive past 6 days of growth.

Although CEM/MTX cells were highly resistant (162- to 300-fold) to assorted antifolate substrates for the classical transporter, including methotrexate, aminopterin, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, ICI D1694, and 1843U89, they were only 3.6-fold resistant to (6R)-5,10-dideaza-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (DDATHF). These divergent antifolate sensitivities were not associated with appreciable differences in the levels of dihydrofolate reductase, thymidylate synthase, and 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide (GAR) transformylase, or the expression of a high affinity membrane folate binding protein receptor in either line. The initial rate of [14C]DDATHF influx was increased 2.9-fold over that for [3H]methotrexate in parental cells (at 2 microM). Whereas [14C]DDATHF initial uptake was, likewise, increased over [3H]methotrexate in CEM/MTX cells (5.3-fold), influx of both compounds was impaired substantially (95-97%). For the parent, influx of [14C]DDATHF was inhibited by substrates for the classical transporter including unlabeled DDATHF, methotrexate, (6R,S)-5-formyl tetrahydrofolate, 10-ethyl-10-deazaaminopterin, ICI D1694, 1843U89, and folic acid. The synthesis of a modified transporter in CEM/MTX cells was accompanied by significant changes in the binding of all these transport substrates. In spite of its impaired transport, [14C]DDATHF (at 2 microM), unlike methotrexate, continued to accumulate in CEM/MTX cells, eventually reaching 62% of the parental drug levels after 4 hr. At this time, 53% (parent) and 71% (CEM/MTX) of the intracellular radioactivity from [14C]DDATHF was identified as polyglutamates. DDATHF polyglutamates in CEM/MTX cells after 4 hr reached 90% of the levels measured in parental cells. While significant levels of methotrexate polyglutamates were detected in the parental line, methotrexate polyglutamylation was negligible in intact CEM/MTX cells. The specific activity of folylpolyglutamate synthetase was measured in cell-free extracts from parental and CEM/MTX cells using aminopterin, methotrexate, and DDATHF as substrates; in each case, CEM/MTX cells showed 2-fold higher enzyme activity than parental cells. These data show that even for tumor cells with severely impaired antifolate transport, the extensive conversion of DDATHF to polyglutamyl forms required for GAR transformylase inhibition preserves high levels of antitumor activity.","['Matherly, L H', 'Angeles, S M', 'McGuire, J J']","['Matherly LH', 'Angeles SM', 'McGuire JJ']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Methotrexate/metabolism', 'Peptide Synthases/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/14 00:00,1993/12/14 00:01,['1993/12/14 00:00'],"['1993/12/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/14 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Dec 14;46(12):2185-95. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90608-y.,"['0006-2952(93)90608-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90608-y [doi]']",,,"['CA-53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present paper we report that mouse PGC death in vitro occurs with all the hallmarks of programmed cell death or apoptosis. We found that after 4-5 hours in culture many PGCs isolated from 12.5 dpc fetal gonads assumed a nuclear morphology and produced membrane bound fragments (apoptotic bodies) typical of apoptotic cells. In addition, PGCs in culture accumulated high level of tissue transglutaminase (tTGase; an enzyme that is induced and activated during apoptosis) and showed extensive degradation of DNA to oligonucleosomal fragments, which is characteristic of apoptosis. The physiological relevance of this mechanism of PGC death is supported by the finding that some PGCs undergoing apoptosis, as revealed by the high level of tTGase expression, were detected in the embryo. Most importantly, we show that the addition of stem cell factor (SCF) or leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to the culture medium, two cytokines known to favour PGC survival and/or proliferation in vitro, markedly reduced the occurrence of apoptosis in PGCs during the first hours in culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Pesce, M', 'Farrace, M G', 'Piacentini, M', 'Dolci, S', 'De Felici, M']","['Pesce M', 'Farrace MG', 'Piacentini M', 'Dolci S', 'De Felici M']","['Dipartimento di Sanita Pubblica e Biologia Cellulare, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Germ Cells/cytology/enzymology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Growth Inhibitors/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*physiology', 'Immunohistochemistry', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Stem Cell Factor', 'Time Factors', 'Transglutaminases/metabolism']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1993 Aug;118(4):1089-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper reports the consequence of direct in vitro treatment with IFN-alpha/beta or IFN-gamma on acute rejection of leukemia cells in lethally irradiated hosts. This type of rejection has the characteristics of NR, although it is specific and genetically regulated. The data were obtained injecting intravenously FLC (FLC-745 and FLC-3C18 clones; H-2d) and EL-4 (H-2b) leukemia lines in lethally irradiated syngeneic mice and evaluating proliferation 4 days later by 125IUdR uptake. Overnight pretreatment with 100 U/ml of IFN-gamma protected tumor cells from NR-induced rejection in mice. This was evident by higher 125IUdR incorporation in spleens of mice inoculated with IFN-gamma pretreated leukemia cells, as compared to that detected in the spleens of hosts injected with untreated cells, in mice with high levels of NR, but not in hosts depressed for NR. Treatment with 1,000 U/ml of IFN-alpha/beta induced protection only of FLC-745 cells, injected in Poly I:C stimulated hosts. On the other hand, a lower 125IUdR uptake after IFN-alpha/beta incubation, as compared with control cells, was evidenced with FLC-745 and EL-4 lines inoculated in mice with normal or depressed NR. The IFN-induced alterations of leukemia cells to in vivo NR susceptibility were not associated with substantial changes of binding ability to NR effectors or of MHC-antigen expression.","['Neri, M', 'Zei, T', 'Tentori, L', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Affabris, E', 'Iorio, A M']","['Neri M', 'Zei T', 'Tentori L', 'Bonmassar E', 'Affabris E', 'Iorio AM']","['Department of Hygiene, University, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun,Natural immunity,9206126,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Immunity, Innate/drug effects', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1993/11/01 00:00,1993/11/01 00:01,['1993/11/01 00:00'],"['1993/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Immun. 1993 Nov-Dec;12(6):302-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The action of G-CSF is mediated through a specific membrane receptor, however it is not clear if all of the effects of G-CSF are direct or indirect. As a step towards addressing this problem, a recombinant diphtheria toxin (DT)-related human G-CSF fusion protein has been constructed and purified from E. coli. The 70,000 dalton chimeric protein has immunologic determinants characteristic of both DT and G-CSF. At high concentrations, DAB486-G-CSF is cytotoxic towards G-CSF-dependent OCI/AML1 cells, but not factor independent OCI/AML3 cells; colony formation by G-CSF-responsive leukemic blasts from a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) was also inhibited. The G-CSF fusion toxin displayed ADP-ribosyltransferase activity in a cell-free system. Genetic conjugation of G-CSF to an enzymatically inactive DT mutant, CRM197, resulted in a 200-fold reduction in the ability of G-CSF to stimulate normal bone marrow colony formation. These results suggest that fusion of G-CSF to DT sequences interferes with some of the activity but not the specificity of the ligand binding domain of the molecule. Nevertheless, DAB486-G-CSF may be included with the increasing number of other toxin-hormone fusion proteins whose toxicity is directed towards specific receptor-bearing cells, and may represent a novel approach towards the study and treatment of leukemia.","['Chadwick, D E', 'Williams, D P', 'Niho, Y', 'Murphy, J R', 'Minden, M D']","['Chadwick DE', 'Williams DP', 'Niho Y', 'Murphy JR', 'Minden MD']","['Division of Molecular and Cell Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993 Oct;11(3-4):249-62. doi: 10.3109/10428199309087002.,['10.3109/10428199309087002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have sought to optimize conditions for priming, collection, and engraftment of the leukapheresis product. Fifty-four consecutive adult patients were eligible, 31 with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of poor prognosis, 12 with Hodgkin's disease in chemosensitive relapse, and 11 with poor prognosis acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Filgrastim was administered after routine chemotherapy with VAPEC-B or HiCCOM to mobilize PBPC. A rapidly increasing white blood cell count was used to predict the time of peak PBPC release and plan leukapheresis. Forty-five patients underwent leukapheresis. A median of 14 L of blood was processed at a single apheresis. A median of 2.4 x 10(8)/kg mononuclear cells (MNCs), 1.04 x 10(6)/kg granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFCs), and 10.6 x 10(6)/kg CD34+ cells were obtained. Slightly fewer MNCs were obtained from the heavily pretreated Hodgkin's disease group. There were no other significant differences in the size or composition of the leukapheresis harvest in the three patient groups. Forty patients underwent high-dose therapy and PBPC transplantation. Filgrastim was administered by daily subcutaneous injection until the absolute neutrophil count was > or = 1 x 10(9)/L for 2 consecutive days. Rapid and sustained hematopoietic engraftment occurred in all patients. The median time to achieve a neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was 9 days (range, 8 to 16 days); to achieve a platelet count > or = 20 x 10(9)/L was 10 days (range, 6 to 88 days); and to achieve a platelet count > or = 50 x 10(9)/L was 15.5 days (range, 10 to 100 days). Neutrophil recovery was faster than that of a historical control group treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation and filgrastim, but platelet recovery times were halved in the PBPC group. There was no secondary engraftment failure. Requirements for blood and platelet transfusions, antibiotic use, and parenteral nutrition were similar in the three patient groups.

However, the relatively large quantity of unfixed tissue required for epidermal growth factor radioligand binding assays (RLBA) has precluded its application to cytologic specimens and small biopsy specimens. For this reason we evaluated reverse transcription intron differential polymerase chain reaction (RTIDPCR) as an assay of EGFR gene expression. Squamous cell carcinoma (A431 and SiHa), transitional cell carcinoma (HT1376, T24, RT4), mammary (MCF7) and endocervical (HeLa) adenocarcinoma, and leukemia (K562) cell lines were used to compare RTIDPCR and RLBA. RTIDPCR involved reverse transcription of RNA and amplification of cDNA using primers for beta-actin and EGFR. Good agreement was observed between the RLBA and RTIDPCR results. RNA extracted from fresh cells, Diff-Quik-stained smears and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cell pellet sections yielded similar results. These data suggest that RTIDPCR may be useful in evaluating gene expression by cells processed as cytologic specimens.","['Gramlich, T L', 'Fritsch, C', 'Shear, S', 'Sgoutas, D', 'Tuten, T', 'Gansler, T']","['Gramlich TL', 'Fritsch C', 'Shear S', 'Sgoutas D', 'Tuten T', 'Gansler T']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anal Quant Cytol Histol,Analytical and quantitative cytology and histology,8506819,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Transitional Cell/genetics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Quant Cytol Histol. 1993 Oct;15(5):317-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to common CD5+ B cell CLL, this variant leukemia cell population displays intraclonal diversity in its expressed Ig V genes, similar to that noted for follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Also, in contrast to common B cell CLL, these leukemia cells rapidly undergo cell death hours after being placed in tissue culture. We find that addition of Ag (aggregated human IgG) enhances significantly the survival of these cells in vitro. Leukemia cell survival also could be enhanced by exogenous IFN-gamma or anti-CD40 presented on Fc gamma RII (CDw32)-expressing L cells, but not by exogenous IL-4, IL-6, or monomeric human IgG. We find that Ag acts directly on the leukemia B cells to inhibit apoptosis. This effect could be mimicked by cross-linking the leukemia cells' surface IgM receptors with immobilized murine mAb specific for human Ig mu-chains, but not by immobilized mAb of irrelevant specificity. In contrast to most follicular NHL, this leukemia B cell population does not have evidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement. Also, in contrast to non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and most B cell CLL, these cells do not express detectable amounts of bcl-2. Finally, although capable of inhibiting apoptosis, surface Ig receptor cross-linking does not induce expression of bcl-2 in these variant leukemia cells. We hypothesize that the lack of bcl-2 expression may render these leukemia cells particularly dependent upon the survival signal(s) derived from surface Ig receptor cross-linking. This state may represent an early stage in leukemia/lymphomagenesis, possibly accounting for the intraclonal diversity observed in the Ig V genes expressed by certain CD5- B cell leukemias and lymphomas.","['Kobayashi, R', 'Rassenti, L Z', 'Meisenholder, G', 'Carson, D A', 'Kipps, T J']","['Kobayashi R', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Meisenholder G', 'Carson DA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '9009-79-4 (Rheumatoid Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*immunology', '*Autoantigens', 'Base Sequence', 'CD5 Antigens', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Rheumatoid Factor/*biosynthesis']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Dec 15;151(12):7273-83.,,,,"['CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57868/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['bcl-2'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), although ineffective on its own in regulating APP genes, modulates the action of the IL-type cytokines. In growing cultures, the IL-6 and IL-11 stimulation of thiostatin and hemopexin is enhanced by TGF-beta, whereas the stimulation of other APP is reduced. The effects of leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, IL-1, and TNF-alpha are generally attenuated by TGF-beta. Enhancement by TGF-beta of the IL-6-induced response can be explained in part by the fact that TGF-beta, in combination with dexamethasone, stimulates severalfold the expression of the 80-kDa ligand-binding subunit of IL-6R. Serum deprivation of H-35 cells for 3 days leads to an enhanced basal and cytokine-stimulated level of APP gene expression concomitant with a loss of the divergent regulatory effect of TGF-beta. In growth-arrested H-35 cells, TGF-beta still enhances the IL-6R expression but it attenuates all IL-6 effects on APP genes. These data suggest that TGF-beta influences the signal transduction of the IL-type cytokines by separate mechanisms and that the manifestation of the TGF-beta action is modulated by the growth state of the cell culture.","['Campos, S P', 'Wang, Y', 'Koj, A', 'Baumann, H']","['Campos SP', 'Wang Y', 'Koj A', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Interleukin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Dec 15;151(12):7128-37.,,,,['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['APP'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrate that somatically mutated VH5 and VH6 regions are ubiquitously expressed in IgM-bearing B cells in all peripheral adult human lymphoid organs, and that the occurrence of somatic mutations does not segregate with either CD5+ or CD5- B cell populations.

It is also expressed in other types of leukemic cells and in a variety of normal hematopoietic cells under both physiological and artificial conditions. The role of this distinctive enzyme is still unknown. TRAP hydrolyzes several chemical compounds, but its physiological substrate remains to be elucidated. Here, the insertion of a human TRAP cDNA into mammalian expression vector pSBC-2 yielded a construct that encoded enzymatically active TRAP in transfected baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21). TRAP was expressed transiently, as shown by Northern blot analysis, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing and cytochemical staining. BHK-21 cells over-expressing the enzyme had a growth rate that was approximately 50% of that observed in control cells. A stable expression could not be achieved. Recent evidence suggested that TRAP might function as a protein tyrosine phosphatase. The effect of TRAP on protein tyrosine phosphorylation was examined by immunoblotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (MoAb). The level of tyrosine phosphorylation was clearly lower in transfected BHK-21-TRAP cells than in the control cultures. Phorbol ester-mediated induction of protein tyrosine phosphorylation could overcome the status of reduced phosphorylation in BHK-21-TRAP cells. Furthermore, upon treatment with 12-O-tetra-decanoylphorphol-13-acetate tyrosine phosphorylation reached similar levels to stimulated control cells, indicating the existence of a functional endogenous phosphorylation network. Thus, TRAP might function as an antagonistic counterpart of cellular protein tyrosine kinases and could be involved in the control of cellular activation, proliferation, and differentiation.","['Nuthmann, V', 'Dirks, W', 'Drexler, H G']","['Nuthmann V', 'Dirks W', 'Drexler HG']","['German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Tartrates)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'W4888I119H (tartaric acid)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Gene Expression', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kidney/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pilot Projects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/physiology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'Tartrates/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1960-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared these changes to those for mRNA for other proteins which are known to be synthesized by HEL cells and megakaryocytes and are known to be localized to alpha granules within platelets. PMA caused a large increase in mRNA for serglycin within two hours of treatment of the cells, and the increase persisted for at least 72 hours. DMSO did not cause a significant change in mRNA levels. mRNA for platelet factor 4, transforming growth factor-beta, and P-Selectin (PADGEM, GMP-140) were also increased by PMA treatment. The mRNA for platelet factor 4 was substantially reduced in the presence of DMSO. The increase of mRNA for serglycin induced by PMA was consistent with our previous observation that synthesis of proteoglycans from [35S]sulfate was greatly stimulated by PMA in HEL cells. The data suggest that up-regulation of synthesis of proteoglycans is induced by PMA in cells which have the capacity to differentiate along the megakaryocytic lineage, as opposed to cell lines such as HL-60 in which proteoglycan synthesis is reduced in the presence of this differentiation-inducing agent.","['Schick, B P', 'Thornton, R D']","['Schick BP', 'Thornton RD']","['Cardeza Foundation for Hematologic Research, Department of Medicine, Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (P-Selectin)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)', '0 (serglycin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'P-Selectin', 'Platelet Factor 4/genetics', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Proteoglycans/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Vesicular Transport Proteins']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Dec;7(12):1955-9.,,,,['HL 29282/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes a retroviral vector system that presents such native epitopes on chimeric glycoproteins in which protein fragments of interest are fused to the C terminus of the N-terminal domain of the murine leukemia virus surface protein, gp70. The system was used to express two disulfide-bonded domains from gp120, the surface protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), that include potent neutralization epitopes. The resulting fusion glycoproteins were synthesized at high levels and were efficiently transported and secreted. A fusion protein containing the HXB2 V1/V2 domain was recognized by an HIVIIIB-infected patient serum as well as by 17 of 36 HIV-1 seropositive hemophiliac, homosexual male and intravenous drug user patient sera. Many of these HIV+ human sera reacted with V1/V2 domains from several HIV-1 clones expressed in fusion glycoproteins, indicating the presence of cross-reactive antibodies against epitopes in the V1/V2 domain. Recognition of gp(1-263):V1/V2HXB2 by the HIVIIIB-infected human patient serum was largely blocked by synthetic peptides matching V1 but not V2 sequences, while recognition of this construct by a broadly cross-reactive hemophiliac patient serum was not blocked by individual V1 or V2 peptides or by mixtures of these peptides. A construct containing the V3 domain of the IIIB strain of HIV-1, gp(1-263):V3HXB2, was recognized by sera from a human and a chimpanzee that had been infected by HIVIIIB but not by sera from hemophiliac patients who had been infected with HIV-1 of MN-like V3 serotype. The reactive sera had significantly higher titers when assayed against gp(1-263):V3HXB2 than when assayed against matching V3 peptides. Immunoprecipitation of this fusion glycoprotein by the human serum was only partially blocked by V3 peptide, indicating that this infected individual produced antibodies against epitopes in V3 that were expressed on the fusion glycoprotein but not by synthetic peptides. These data demonstrated that the chimeric glycoproteins described here effectively present native epitopes present in the V1/V2 and V3 domains of gp120 and provide efficient methods for detection of antibodies directed against native epitopes in these regions and for characterization of such epitopes.","['Kayman, S C', 'Wu, Z', 'Revesz, K', 'Chen, H', 'Kopelman, R', 'Pinter, A']","['Kayman SC', 'Wu Z', 'Revesz K', 'Chen H', 'Kopelman R', 'Pinter A']","['Laboratory of Retroviral Biology, Public Health Research Institute, New York, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HIV Antibodies)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Cell Line', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Antibodies/blood', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/immunology', 'HIV-1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/immunology']",1994/01/01 00:00,1994/01/01 00:01,['1994/01/01 00:00'],"['1994/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1994/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1994/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1994 Jan;68(1):400-10. doi: 10.1128/JVI.68.1.400-410.1994.,['10.1128/JVI.68.1.400-410.1994 [doi]'],,,"['AI23884/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI34217/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI72659/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC236300,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of NO on the activity of iron regulatory factor (IRF), a cytoplasmic protein which modulates both ferritin mRNA translation and transferrin receptor mRNA stability by binding to specific mRNA sequences called iron responsive elements (IREs). Murine macrophages were activated with interferon-gamma and lipopolysaccharide to induce NO synthase activity and cultured in the presence or absence of NG-substituted analogues of L-arginine which served as selective inhibitors of NO synthesis. Measurement of the nitrite concentration in the culture medium was taken as an index of NO production. Mitochondria-free cytosols were then prepared and aconitase activity as well as IRE binding activity and induction of IRE binding activity were correlated and depended on NO synthesis after IFN-gamma and/or LPS stimulation. Authentic NO gas as well as the NO-generating compound 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1) also conversely modulated aconitase and IRE binding activities of purified recombinant IRF.

However, the degree of response ranges from no 'hematologic' response to complete suppression of the leukemic clone. The mechanism(s) by which IFN-alpha elicits these responses is unknown, but in vitro studies have indicated that IFN-alpha might function by (1) selective toxicity against the leukemic clone, (2) enhancement of 'immune' regulation, and (3) modulation of bone marrow microenvironmental regulation of hematopoiesis. Using in vitro clonogenic assays we were unable to demonstrate that IFN-alpha selectively inhibited the proliferation of CML progenitor cells. We also found no difference in the expression of LFA-3 on normal or CML CD34+ cells. However, by panning and co-culturing hematopoietic cells on monolayers of bone marrow stromal cells, grown with and without IFN-alpha, we found that IFN-alpha enhanced the adhesion of CML progenitors to stromal cells, whereas adhesion by normal progenitor cells was essentially unaffected. This enhanced adhesion by CML progenitor cells was associated with a reduction in neuraminic acid levels in the extracellular matrix overlying stromal cells. Therefore, it is possible that one of the mechanisms by which IFN-alpha exerts its regulatory effect on the leukemic clone is through enhancement of hematopoietic cell-microenvironmental cell interactions.","['Dowding, C', 'Gordon, M', 'Guo, A P', 'Maison, D', 'Osterholz, J', 'Siczkowski, M', 'Goldman, J']","['Dowding C', 'Gordon M', 'Guo AP', 'Maison D', 'Osterholz J', 'Siczkowski M', 'Goldman J']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Neuraminic Acids)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'CD58 Antigens', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/biosynthesis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Connective Tissue/drug effects', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Glycosaminoglycans/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Neuraminic Acids/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1993;11 Suppl 1:185-91. doi: 10.3109/10428199309047884.,['10.3109/10428199309047884 [doi]'],,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,

Our initial studies targeted the c-myb protooncogene and were carried out on cells derived from patients in CML blast crisis.

We found that c-myb AS ODN inhibited growth of CML CFU-GM in a dose dependent, sequence specific manner in approximately 75% of cases evaluated. Bcr-abl expression was either greatly decreased or nondetectable in the residual colonies and no residual leukemic CFU were demonstrable upon re-plating of treated cells. AS ODN that target the c-kit protooncogene also inhibit CML CFU and lead to downregulation of bcr-abl in responding cells in approximately 50% of cases. Therefore, AS ODN may prove to be useful purging agents. Most recently, we have treated SCID mice engrafted with bcr-abl expressing human K562 cell leukemia with phosphorothioate modified AS ODN. We have found that treated mice survive three to eight times longer than their untreated or sense treated controls.

A-T cells are sensitive to ionizing radiation and radiomimetic drugs, offering the possibility of cloning A-T genes by phenotypic complementation. We have used this sensitivity to isolate the first human cDNAs reported to complement A-T cells in culture. Complementation group D A-T fibroblasts were transfected with an episomal vector-based human cDNA library, approximately 610,000 resultant transformants were treated with the radiomimetic drug streptonigrin-resistant, and nine unrelated cDNAs were recovered from 29 surviving streptonigrin-resistant clones. Five cDNAs were mapped, but none localized to 11q23, the site of A-T complementation group A and C loci. Four of the mapped cDNAs conferred mutagen resistance to A-T D fibroblasts on secondary transfection. One cDNA was identified as a fragment of dek, a gene involved in acute myeloid leukemia. The dek cDNA fragment and pCAT4.5, a 4.5-kb cDNA that mapped to 17p11, independently complemented three different phenotypic abnormalities of A-T D fibroblasts (mutagen sensitivity, hyper-recombination, and radio-resistant DNA synthesis). The pCAT4.5 cDNA did not complement the mutagen sensitivity of an A-T group C fibroblast line, suggesting that it represents a candidate disease gene for group D A-T. Our results indicate that phenotypic complementation alone is insufficient evidence to prove that a candidate cDNA is an A-T disease gene. The complementing cDNAs may represent previously uncharacterized genes that function in the same pathway as does the A-T gene product(s) in the regulation of cellular responses to DNA damage.","['Meyn, M S', 'Lu-Kuo, J M', 'Herzing, L B']","['Meyn MS', 'Lu-Kuo JM', 'Herzing LB']","['Department of Genetics, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hum Genet,American journal of human genetics,0370475,"['261Q3JB310 (Streptonigrin)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics/pathology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/radiation effects/*ultrastructure', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Humans', 'Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA/analysis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Streptonigrin/pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Transformation, Genetic']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hum Genet. 1993 Dec;53(6):1206-16.,,,,,,"['A-T', 'dek', 'lacZ']",,,PMC1682482,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated changes in T cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins by HTLV-I expressing cell lines and human peripheral blood lymphocytes infected with HTLV-I by cocultivation.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha has a similar, though less potent, action. Since interleukin-1 was ineffective in raising the concentration of substance P in pure neuronal cultures, the existence of a non-neuronally derived intermediate was postulated and found to exist in interleukin-1-conditioned medium. Antibody neutralization of either nerve growth factor or ciliary neurotrophic factor failed to affect the ability of interleukin-1 to induce substance P. Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis was equally ineffective. However, immunoprecipitation of leukemia inhibitory factor from interleukin-1-conditioned medium eliminated substance-P-inducing activity, suggesting leukemia inhibitory factor as a possible interleukin-1-induced intermediate. The ability of interleukin-1 to induce leukemia inhibitory factor mRNA strengthens this conclusion.

Tax, the transactivating protein, stimulates the long terminal repeat to promote viral transcription and may be involved in tumorigenesis. Rex is involved in the transition from early expression of regulatory proteins to later expression of viral structural proteins. We have targeted ribozymes against the mRNA encoding Rex and Tax. The ribozymes consist of the hammer-head catalytic motif flanked by antisense sequences that hybridize with the complementary rex/tax mRNA. To evaluate cleavage in a cell-free system, we transcribed portions of rex/tax mRNA and incubated them with synthetic RNA ribozymes. A ribozyme was identified that cleaves > 80% of the target RNA. Synthetic DNA encoding this ribozyme was cloned into the expression vector pRc/RSV and transfected into BLV-infected bat lung cells. Intracellular cleavage of rex/tax mRNA was confirmed by reverse transcriptase PCR. In cells expressing the ribozyme, viral expression was markedly inhibited. Expression of the BLV core protein p24 was inhibited by 61%, and reverse transcriptase activity in supernatant was inhibited by 92%. Ribozyme inhibition of BLV expression suggests that cattle expressing these sequences may be able to control BLV replication.","['Cantor, G H', 'McElwain, T F', 'Birkebak, T A', 'Palmer, G H']","['Cantor GH', 'McElwain TF', 'Birkebak TA', 'Palmer GH']","['Department of Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State University, Pullman 99164-7040.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Base Sequence', 'Chiroptera', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Genes, pX', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Catalytic/*administration & dosage', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Dec 1;90(23):10932-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.23.10932.,['10.1073/pnas.90.23.10932 [doi]'],,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Dec 1;90(23):10898-900.

It has previously been shown that granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is constitutively expressed in HTLV-1 infected cells and in cells artificially expressing tax. We show here that the GM-CSF promoter is tax responsive in fibroblasts and T cells, whereas the granulocyte (G)-CSF promoter is tax responsive only in fibroblasts. The tax protein can activate cellular genes through a least two families of transcription factors; the NF-kB/rel and CREB/ATF families. We have used mutant tax proteins to show that the activation of NF-kB proteins is essential for tax trans-activation of both the GM-CSF and G-CSF promoters. The ability of tax to activate CREB/ATF proteins is also essential for GM-CSF transactivation. We have identified a 44 bp region of the GM-CSF promoter that contains tax responsive elements. This region contains a classical NF-kB site, a CK-1 element that can bind the NF-kB p65 protein, as well as a putative ATF binding site. The tax response of the G-CSF promoter requires not only the conserved CK-1 sequence but also an adjacent NF-IL6 binding site that may explain the cell restricted function of the G-CSF promoter.","['Himes, S R', 'Coles, L S', 'Katsikeros, R', 'Lang, R K', 'Shannon, M F']","['Himes SR', 'Coles LS', 'Katsikeros R', 'Lang RK', 'Shannon MF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'DNA/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics/metabolism', 'Genes, pX/genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology']",1993/12/01 00:00,1993/12/01 00:01,['1993/12/01 00:00'],"['1993/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Dec;8(12):3189-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

G-CSF markedly enhanced RA-induced granulocytic differentiation in APL cells obtained from all four cases. In cells in which TGF beta inhibited DNA synthesis, it also inhibited RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of APL cells and, to a greater degree, granulocytic differentiation induced by RA plus G-CSF.

We have shown previously that the Fli-1 gene codes for a sequence specific transcriptional activator which contains two autonomous transcriptional activation domains, one at the amino terminal region and the other at the carboxy terminal region. Recently human Fli-1 gene was shown to be involved in Ewing's sarcoma and related subtypes of primitive neuroectodermal tumors which share t(11;22) (q24;q12) chromosome translocation. In these tumors the carboxyl terminal region of Fli-1 was found to be fused with the amino terminal region of a putative RNA binding protein, EWS. Because part of the amino terminal transcriptional activation domain of Fli-1 was replaced with the amino terminal domain of the EWS (NTD-EWS) which shares homology with RNA polymerase II, it was speculated that NTD-EWS may interfere with RNA pol II function. Alternatively, NTD-EWS could also contribute to the transcriptional activation function of EWS/Fli-1 chimeric protein by providing either a modulatory/regulatory domain or a novel transcriptional activation domain. Here we show that EWS/Fli-1 chimeric protein functions as a transcriptional activator. Deletion analysis reveals that the EWS domain functions as a modulatory/regulatory domain for the transcriptional activation properties of the carboxy terminal transcriptional activation domain of EWS/Fli-1. We therefore propose that replacement of the amino terminal transcriptional activation domain of the Fli-1 protein with the regulatory domain of NTD-EWS results in the activation of the carboxy terminal transcriptional activation domain of Fli-1 which may be the molecular mechanism involved in these human tumors.","['Ohno, T', 'Rao, V N', 'Reddy, E S']","['Ohno T', 'Rao VN', 'Reddy ES']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Jefferson Cancer Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107-5541.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*physiology', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*physiology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology']",1993/12/15 00:00,1993/12/15 00:01,['1993/12/15 00:00'],"['1993/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Dec 15;53(24):5859-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we describe an assay that may prove useful in augmenting this relatively static assessment of drug action. The assay relies upon the substitution of 4-fluoro-L-ornithine (Fl-Orn) for ornithine as a polyamine precursor to provide a means to measure metabolic flux through polyamine pools. At concentrations up to 500 microM, the analog did not inhibit the growth of L1210 murine leukemia cells during incubations of up to 72 hr. Using HPLC, the analog was processed metabolically over time to what was deduced to be 2-fluoroputrescine, 6-fluorospermidine and 6-fluorospermine. The relative proportion of fluorinated polyamine analog to the natural polyamine increased with time and Fl-Orn concentration. The sum of the two was found to be nearly identical to the respective polyamine pool of control cells exposed instead to 500 microM ornithine. This indicates that Fl-Orn was recognized and utilized as a precursor at a rate very similar to that of ornithine itself. Using L1210 cells at different stages of cell growth, it was determined that the metabolic flux through the pools, as indicated by the rate of appearance of individual fluorinated polyamine species, reflected the proliferation status of the cells--non-growing cells failed to incorporate the analog. Likewise, in cell types with varying polyamine pool profiles, such as polyamine enzyme overproducers or those with constitutively different spermidine of spermine ratios, the incorporation of the fluorinated analogs into pools was found to be proportional to the size to the natural polyamine pool. In cells treated with inhibitors of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, Fl-Orn incorporation indicated a total blockade of polyamine synthesis at that enzyme site. Overall, the Fl-Orn assay has demonstrated that polyamine pool profiles generally reflect the rate of flux through the pathway in proliferating cells, suggesting that most intracellular polyamines are freely exchangeable with those undergoing metabolic flux.","['Kramer, D', 'Stanek, J', 'Diegelman, P', 'Regenass, U', 'Schneider, P', 'Porter, C W']","['Kramer D', 'Stanek J', 'Diegelman P', 'Regenass U', 'Schneider P', 'Porter CW']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (4-fluoroornithine)', '0 (Biogenic Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Biogenic Polyamines/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Melanoma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/10/26 00:00,1995/10/26 00:01,['1995/10/26 00:00'],"['1995/10/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/26 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Oct 26;50(9):1433-43. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)02037-3.,"['0006-2952(95)02037-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)02037-3 [doi]']",,,['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intracellular drug accumulation (1 micrograms/mL) and retention were measured by flow cytometry. Mean intracellular steady-state concentration (Css, fluorescence units/cell) and area under the intracellular drug concentration x time curve (AUC, Fl.U/cell.min) were calculated. Relative to the values for the respective drugs in HL-60/W cells, the Css and AUC of IDA were much higher than those of DNR in the MDR cell lines, with Css and AUC of IDAol intermediate between IDA and DNR. In the MDR cell lines, the MDR modulator cyclosporine A (CsA), in concentrations of 0.3 to 30 mumol/L, caused minimal effects on 3-hr IDA accumulation, intermediate enhancement of IDAol accumulation, and greatest enhancement of DNR accumulation. The MDR cell lines were much less resistant to IDA (3- to 16-fold) than to DNR (65- to 117-fold). This difference was not the result of IDA being more potent than DNR, since the sensitivity of HL-60/W cells to IDA differed from their sensitivity to DNR by < 2-fold. The cellular pharmacokinetics and cytotoxicity of IDA in MDR human breast carcinoma cells MCF-7/AdrVp, which overexpress the putative MDR transporter P-95, were far superior to those of DNR, and were comparable to these parameters for IDA in parental MCF-7/W cells. These studies demonstrate that the cellular pharmacology and cytotoxicity of IDA in MDR cell lines that overexpress MRP, Pgp, or P-95 are more advantageous than those of DNR, suggesting that IDA is less susceptible to the transport-mediated MDR mechanism manifested. IDA is not completely invulnerable to MDR, however, since the MDR sublines studied did display a demonstrable level of resistance to IDA, compared with their drug-sensitive counterparts. IDAol, the major plasma metabolite of IDA, demonstrated behavior intermediate between the MDR-susceptible drug DNR and its parent compound, suggesting that its cytotoxic action is subject to transport-mediated cellular defenses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ross, D D', 'Doyle, L A', 'Yang, W', 'Tong, Y', 'Cornblatt, B']","['Ross DD', 'Doyle LA', 'Yang W', 'Tong Y', 'Cornblatt B']","['University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '86189-66-4 (idarubicinol)', 'YDU8YIP30L (daunorubicinol)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Stability', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/11/09 00:00,1995/11/09 00:01,['1995/11/09 00:00'],"['1995/11/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/09 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1995 Nov 9;50(10):1673-83. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(95)02069-1.,"['0006-2952(95)02069-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(95)02069-1 [doi]']",,,['R01-CA 52178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A common explanation is the in vitro release of K from leukocytes undergoing lysis during the clotting process. Since in clinical practice blood electrolytes are now being evaluated in plasma or whole heparinized blood rather than in serum, this source of error should almost have disappeared. Another mechanism may be prolonged storage of blood at room temperature or in the cold before performing the test, most likely since unphysiological conditions and/or shortage of metabolic fuels may impair Na/K-ATPase activity in leukocytes, ensuing in K release from these cells. For these reasons, it is commonly advised that patients with extreme leukocytosis should have K levels determined on plasma samples that are separated promptly from the cellular elements. We have recently observed a case of pseudohyperkalemia in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia which was unrelated to both of these mechanisms, and was instead related to a common mode of drawing blood, i.e. with vacuum tubes.","['Colussi, G', 'Cipriani, D']","['Colussi G', 'Cipriani D']","[""Division of Nephrology, Niguarda-Ca' Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Am J Nephrol,American journal of nephrology,8109361,['RWP5GA015D (Potassium)'],IM,"['Blood Preservation', 'Blood Specimen Collection/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/*etiology', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Leukocytosis/blood/*complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Potassium/blood']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Nephrol. 1995;15(5):450-2. doi: 10.1159/000168883.,['10.1159/000168883 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, the clearance of HDE showed a pattern of splenic hypofunction in 4 out of 7 patients, based on reduced values for the parameters C20 (overall clearing function of the spleen), K (the rate constant of HDE irreversibly trapped) and K/K1 + K (the fraction of HDE entering the spleen undergoing permanent removal). After successful treatment, the pit counts decreased in all reassessed patients, returning to normal values in 10 out of 12 patients with high pit counts at diagnosis. Additionally, two patients with normal pit counts at diagnosis presented borderline results for the parameters C20 and K, which may suggest a slight splenic hyperactivity in these patients.

We report here that galectin-1, expressed by stromal cells in human thymus and lymph nodes, is present at sites of cell death by apoptosis during normal T-cell development and maturation. Galectin-1 induced apoptosis of activated human T cells and human T leukaemia cell lines. Resting T cells also bound galectin-1, but did not undergo apoptosis. Human endothelial cells that expressed galectin-1 induced apoptosis of bound T cells. Galectin-1-induced apoptosis required expression of CD45, and was decreased when N-glycan elongation was blocked by treatment of the cells by swainsonine, whereas inhibition of O-glycan elongation potentiated the apoptotic effect of galectin-1.

One class of neurotrophic factor acts through receptor complexes involving the low-affinity leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor subunit (LIF-R). Members of this family of cytokines, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), have profound effects on the survival and maintenance of motor neurons. Recently it was reported that mice lacking LIF-R die shortly after birth unlike mice lacking CNTF or LIF which are viable. Here we describe histopathological analyses of lifr mutants that reveal a loss > 35% of facial motor neurons, 40% of spinal motor neurons and 50% of neurons in the nucleus ambiguus.

An incubation with DDA and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or hemin synergistically induced more benzidine-positive cells than in the presence of DDA alone, although IFN-alpha did not trigger differentiation by itself. The erythroid differentiation and growth inhibition were, however, not related to a decreased intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentration induced by DDA.

(1995) Leukemia Res. 19(10), 733) is a case of a patient with constitutional trisomy 8 mosaicism who developed myelodysplasia with trisomy 8 in 95-100% of bone marrow cells.

Both SS and SMS inhibited spontaneous leukemic cell growth in approximately 1/3 of cases (i.e. 7/19). G-CSF stimulated AML cells were inhibited by SMS in 11/21 cases. AML cell proliferation induced by IL-3 or GM-CSF was suppressed in only 3/21 and 6/21 cases, respectively. In ALL cells, IL-7-induced proliferation was suppressed by SMS in 3/7 cases. The effect of SMS seemed to depend on the type of the hematopoietic growth factor, and on their concentrations. In fact, high concentrations of G-CSF could override SMS blocking completely. Colony formation by normal marrow progenitors and DNA synthesis by HL-60 and T11/65 leukemic cell lines were not affected by SMS.

Treatment of U-937 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) which is associated with the induction of a monocytic differentiation program and growth arrest, revealed an initial up-regulation of c-myc, c-max, and mxi1 mRNAs after 1-6 h. Thereafter expression of these genes significantly declined to barely detectable levels when the cells ceased to grow after 12-24 h of TPA treatment. Between 7 and 11 days of TPA-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, expression of the c-max and mxi1 genes continuously increased up to 8-fold until 32 days and declined to control levels when the cells regained proliferative capacity by 36 days. In contrast, c-myc mRNAs remained down-regulated during periods of growth arrest and increased only during re-entry into the cell cycle after 36 days. This effect is consistent with a retrodifferentiation process, whereby previously differentiated cells revert back to the undifferentiated phenotype and re-enter the cell cycle. Different results were obtained during serum starvation-induced cell death of U-937 cells. After 48-72 h of serum-starvation, expression of the c-myc and c-max genes were significantly down-regulated by 4-fold and 3-fold, respectively, while there was little, if any, change in mxi1 mRNA levels. Analysis of cell death in serum-starved U-937 cells demonstrated progressively increasing DNA fragmentation reaching 45.4% +/- 0.9% after 72 h. Synchronization of proliferating U-937 cells throughout distinct phases of the cell cycle exhibited little, if any, change in c-myc, c-max and mxi1 mRNAs. Furthermore, like c-myc, c-max and mxi1 mRNA transcripts appeared to be regulated primarily by post-transcriptional mechanisms, and c-max and mxi1 half-lives exceeded 4 h in contrast to < 60 min for the c-myc gene. Taken together, these findings suggested differential regulation and inverse expression levels of c-myc compared to c-max and mxi1 during differentiation, retrodifferentiation and cell death.","['Meinhardt, G', 'Hass, R']","['Meinhardt G', 'Hass R']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MXI1 protein, human)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/10/01 00:00,1995/10/01 00:01,['1995/10/01 00:00'],"['1995/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1995 Oct;19(10):699-705. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00040-u.,"['014521269500040U [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00040-u [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The range of cell cycle times amongst the leukemia cells present within individual patients differs between patients, with some leukemia cell populations characterized by narrow and others by broad ranges.

Firstly, APL represents a model for the new therapeutic approach of differentiation therapy, taking advantage of the ability of APL cells to respond to retinoic acid treatment by terminal differentiation. Secondly, the 15;17 chromosomal translocation specific for APL leads at the molecular genetic level to a chimeric gene fusing the PML and RAR alpha genes and appears to be an instrumental, if not actually the causative event, in the neoplastic process. These unique characteristics of an otherwise rather rare disease have recently attracted intense research interest. As in other types of leukemia where continuous cell lines are powerful research tools, studies using APL-derived cell lines have contributed a large body of relevant data in efforts to unravel the pathobiology and leukemogenesis of APL. Three cell lines have been reported to be derived from patients with APL: HL-60, NB-4 and PL-21. Both HL-60 and PL-21 lack t(15;17) while NB-4 carries this cytogenetic hallmark pathognomonic for APL. Morphological and immunophenotypical examinations of the cell lines do not permit a clear assignment to any stage of myelomonocytic differentiation. Some additional data, such as expression of myeloperoxidase, monocyte-specific esterase and annexin VIII, together with the cytogenetic and molecular biological information, suggest that NB-4 is the only genuine promyelocytic leukemia cell line, whereas HL-60 may represent a discrete stage of differentiation between the late myeloblasts and the promyelocyte; PL-21 has distinct features associated with monocytic cells.

The patients subjected to the VII/(81) scheme showed, throughout the observation period of five years from the beginning of the therapy, a height normal for their age group. Contrary to this observation, the patients subjected to the LSA2L2 scheme experienced a significantly different growth in the period under observation and continually lost height in comparison to the normal population. The same results were experienced with a smaller group of patients whose growth was followed up for eight years from the beginning of therapy. 16 patients (VII/81 n = 4/LSA2L2 n = 12) reached their final height.

It belongs to a family of distantly related cytokines that includes interleukin 6, ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia-inhibitory factor, and interleukin 11. These cytokines initiate signaling by inducing either homodimerization of gp130 or heterodimerization of gp130 with leukemia-inhibitory factor receptor beta components. Such dimerization in turn activates receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. In the present study using U266B1 human multiple myeloma cells, we show that OSM induces tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of JAK2, but not JAK1 or Tyk2, kinases. The results also demonstrate that OSM induces direct interaction of JAK2 kinase with Grb2, an SH2/SH3 domain containing adaptor protein. The SH2 domain of Grb2 is directly associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2. Furthermore, the presence of Sos in the JAK2-Grb2 complex suggests a role for Ras in OSM-transduced signaling.","['Chauhan, D', 'Kharbanda, S M', 'Ogata, A', 'Urashima, M', 'Frank, D', 'Malik, N', 'Kufe, D W', 'Anderson, K C']","['Chauhan D', 'Kharbanda SM', 'Ogata A', 'Urashima M', 'Frank D', 'Malik N', 'Kufe DW', 'Anderson KC']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Son of Sevenless Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'ErbB Receptors/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Son of Sevenless Proteins', 'src Homology Domains']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1995 Dec 1;182(6):1801-6. doi: 10.1084/jem.182.6.1801.,['10.1084/jem.182.6.1801 [doi]'],,,"['CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 50947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC2192257,,,,,,,,,

We studied here whether the cytotoxicity is caused by induction of apoptosis, using mouse EL-4 lymphoma and human MOLT-4 leukemia lines as targets. The rat calprotectin sample inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation into these cells by partially 24 h and almost completely in 48 h of culture at concentrations of 100-200 micrograms/ml. Morphological changes, that is, loss of cell volume and nuclear condensation and/or fragmentation, appeared in both cell types cultured with calprotectin from 20 h, and such apoptotic cells subsequently increased in number to compose the great majority of the cells at 40 h. Cell death, measured by stainability with trypan blue, lagged behind the emergence of the apoptotic morphology by about 2 and 10 h in EL-4 and MOLT-4 cells, respectively. DNA fragmentation was observed in EL-4 cells cultured with calprotectin, whereas it was not observed in MOLT-4 cells, consistent with results of flow cytometry showing that loss of cell DNA content caused by the factor was greater in EL-4 cells. The data indicate that calprotectin induces the apoptosis of certain tumor cells but that the occurrence of DNA fragmentation is dependent on cell type. Finally, the apoptosis-inducing activity of the calprotectin sample was abrogated by the presence of 10 microM zinc, whereas it was not affected by 5 mM calcium or magnesium.","['Yui, S', 'Mikami, M', 'Yamazaki, M']","['Yui S', 'Mikami M', 'Yamazaki M']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Teikyo University, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex)', '0 (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Exudates and Transudates', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules/*pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1995 Dec;58(6):650-8. doi: 10.1002/jlb.58.6.650.,['10.1002/jlb.58.6.650 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although mammalian transport activity has been characterized by kinetic studies, the actual protein itself has yet to be identified, purified, or cloned. As one approach to this problem, we attempted photoaffinity labeling of plasma membrane proteins using two specifically designed and synthesized polyamine conjugates as photoprobes. The first is a spermidine conjugate bearing the photoreactive moiety 4-azidosalicylic acid at the N4 position via an alkyl linkage, and the second is a norspermine conjugate with 4-azidosalicylic acid at the N4 position via an acyl linkage. Labeling of murine L1210 lymphocytic leukemia cells was carried out at 4 degrees C to promote selective alkylation of cell surface proteins. Separation of plasma membrane proteins from cells cross-linked with the N4-spermidine conjugate by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed two heavily labeled proteins at approximately 118 and approximately 50 kDa (designated p118 and p50, respectively). Band p118 was more well defined and much more intensely labeled. Analogous proteins were also observed in human U937 lymphoma cells. Specificity of labeling was strongly suggested by competition with polyamines and analogs during labeling and further indicated by the nearly identical labeling of the same protein by the N1-norspermine photoprobe but not by the unconjugated photoreagent. Neuraminidase pretreatment of L1210 cells increased mobility of the p118, suggesting that it was glycosylated and, thus, of plasma membrane origin. In transport-deficient L1210 cells, p118 and p50 were found to have a slightly higher molecular mass and were accompanied by a less distinct protein band (approximately 100 kDa). These findings indicate the presence of a polyamine binding protein at the surface of murine and human leukemia cells, which could be directly or indirectly related to the polyamine transport apparatus.","['Felschow, D M', 'MacDiarmid, J', 'Bardos, T', 'Wu, R', 'Woster, P M', 'Porter, C W']","['Felschow DM', 'MacDiarmid J', 'Bardos T', 'Wu R', 'Woster PM', 'Porter CW']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Polyamines)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Dec 1;270(48):28705-11. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.48.28705.,"['10.1074/jbc.270.48.28705 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)87826-7 [pii]']",,,"['CA01072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax deregulation of gene expression is mediated through interaction with a variety of structurally unrelated cellular transcription factors, as Tax does not bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Although most of these cellular transcription factors have been shown to mediate activation by Tax, we have recently demonstrated that members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors, which play a critical role in progression through the cell cycle, mediate repression by Tax. In this report, we examined whether Tax might repress transcription of the tumor suppressor p53, as the p53 gene has recently been demonstrated to be regulated by the bHLH protein c-Myc. Furthermore, loss or inactivation of the p53 gene has been shown to be causally associated with oncogenic transformation. We show that Tax represses transcription of the p53 gene and that this repression is dependent upon the bHLH recognition element in the p53 promoter. Together, these results suggest that Tax may promote malignant transformation through repression of p53 transcription.","['Uittenbogaard, M N', 'Giebler, H A', 'Reisman, D', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Uittenbogaard MN', 'Giebler HA', 'Reisman D', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Microbiology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Dec 1;270(48):28503-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.48.28503.,"['10.1074/jbc.270.48.28503 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)87794-8 [pii]']",,,"['R01 CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA59986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the function of asparagine-linked carbohydrates in neutrophil serine proteases, we constructed a mutant cDNA, coding for human cathepsin G deficient of a functional glycosylation site, for use in a transgenic cellular model. Wild type and mutant cDNA were stably expressed in the rat basophilic/mast cell line RBL and in the murine myeloblast-like cell line 32D. Biosynthetic labeling, followed by immunoprecipitation, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and fluorography, showed that carbohydrate-deficient cathepsin G was synthesized as a 29-kDa proform in both cell lines. The proform was proteolytically processed into a stable form with an apparent molecular mass of 27.5 kDa, indicating removal of the carboxyl-terminal prodomain. The mutant cathepsin G was enzymatically activated as determined by acquisition of affinity to aprotinin, a serine protease inhibitor. As for wild type cathepsin G, small amounts of the unprocessed form of the mutated enzyme were released from the cells, while the major part was transferred to a granular compartment as demonstrated by subcellular fractionation. Thus, neither processing leading to enzymatic activation nor granular sorting was obviously affected by the lack of oligosaccharides on the mutant cathepsin G. Our results therefore indicate that glycosylation is not essential for these processes. In addition to the previously utilized cell line RBL, we propose the 32D cell line as a suitable cellular model for transgenic expression of human neutrophil serine proteases.","['Garwicz, D', 'Lindmark, A', 'Gullberg, U']","['Garwicz D', 'Lindmark A', 'Gullberg U']","['Department of Medicine, Lund University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'EC 3.4.- (Cathepsins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (CTSG protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Cathepsin G)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.21.20 (Ctsg protein, rat)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cathepsin G', 'Cathepsins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Glutamine', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Serine Endopeptidases', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/24 00:00,1995/11/24 00:01,['1995/11/24 00:00'],"['1995/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Nov 24;270(47):28413-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.47.28413.,"['10.1074/jbc.270.47.28413 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)87947-9 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe here the identification and characterization of an initiator element in the TATA-containing human beta-globin promoter. Mutagenesis of the beta-globin initiator element at positions +2/+3 and +4/+5 abrogates transcription in a heterologous construct. Interestingly, we have found a beta-globin initiator binding activity in nuclear extracts whose presence or absence correlates with function of the beta-globin initiator. Accordingly, this binding activity may be part of the machinery required for beta-globin initiator-dependent transcription. Our analysis further describes a previously uncharacterized beta-thalassemia mutation at the +1 site as a mutation that decreases beta-globin initiator activity. Finally, consistent with other initiator elements, the beta-globin initiator requires a TFIID-containing fraction for in vitro activity. Thus, the human beta-globin promoter contains an initiator element whose function, as revealed by a beta-thalassemia mutation, is of physiological relevance.","['Lewis, B A', 'Orkin, S H']","['Lewis BA', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor TFIID)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '*TATA Box', 'Transcription Factor TFIID', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/24 00:00,1995/11/24 00:01,['1995/11/24 00:00'],"['1995/11/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/24 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Nov 24;270(47):28139-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.47.28139.,"['10.1074/jbc.270.47.28139 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)87904-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for a role for inhibition of phospholipase C activity.,27829-33,"To define the molecular mechanisms of cross-regulation among chemoattractant receptors, we stably coexpressed, in a rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cell line, epitope-tagged receptors for the chemoattractants formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (fMLP), a peptide of the fifth component of the complement system (C5a), and interleukin-8 (IL-8). All the expressed receptors underwent homologous phosphorylation and desensitization upon agonist stimulation. When co-expressed, epitope-tagged C5a receptor (ET-C5aR) and epitope-tagged IL-8 receptor (ET-IL-8RA) were cross-phosphorylated by activation of the other. Activation of epitope-tagged fMLP receptor (ET-FR) also cross-phosphorylated ET-C5aR and ET-IL-8RA, but ET-FR was totally resistant to cross-phosphorylation. Similarly, C5a and IL-8 stimulation of [35S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S) binding and Ca2+ mobilization were cross-desensitized by each other and by fMLP. Stimulation of [35S]GTP gamma S binding by fMLP was also not cross-desensitized by C5a or IL-8, however, Ca2+ mobilization was, suggesting a site of inhibition distal to G protein activation. Consistent with this desensitization of Ca2+ mobilization, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate release in RBL-2H3 cells expressing both ET-C5aR and ET-FR revealed that fMLP and C5a cross-desensitized each other's ability to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Taken together, these results indicate that receptor cross-phosphorylation correlates directly with desensitization at the level of G protein activation. The ET-FR was resistant to this process. Of note, cross-desensitization of ET-FR at the level of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization was demonstrated in the absence of receptor phosphorylation. This suggests a new form of chemoattractant cross-regulation at a site distal to receptor/G protein coupling, involving the activity of phospholipase C.","['Richardson, R M', 'Ali, H', 'Tomhave, E D', 'Haribabu, B', 'Snyderman, R']","['Richardson RM', 'Ali H', 'Tomhave ED', 'Haribabu B', 'Snyderman R']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Complement C5a/*pharmacology', 'Epitopes', 'Gene Expression', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a', 'Receptors, Complement/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Receptors, Peptide/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1995/11/17 00:00,1995/11/17 00:01,['1995/11/17 00:00'],"['1995/11/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/17 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1995 Nov 17;270(46):27829-33. doi: 10.1074/jbc.270.46.27829.,"['10.1074/jbc.270.46.27829 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)88028-0 [pii]']",,,['DE-03738/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two proteins with approximate molecular masses of 35 and 75 kDa were found to bind to this region as determined by UV cross-linking studies. Absence of specific protein binding is correlated with a high level of proximal promoter expression. Competitive gel retardation analysis identified a 9-base pair binding site within the proximal lck promoter that is necessary for repression of transcription in cells that contain specific binding activity.

This modification selectively reduces interaction with anoxal vs mititotic microtubules and may account for the lower neurotoxicity with improved antitumor activity that has been observed in clinical trials with breast, lung and ovarian cancer. We were interested in whether the structural modification in NVB would also alter the drug resistance profile. Specifically, our aim was to determine whether NVB, like vinblastine (VBL), participates in P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated multidrug resistance (MDR). NVB-resistant, murine P388 cells (P388/NVB), were derived in vivo and used in conjunction with a battery of drug-resistant P388 cell lines in vivo and murine and human tumor cell lines in vitro to develop a resistance profile for NVB. P388/NVB bells were cross-resistant to drugs involved in MDR (doxorubicin, etoposide, amsacrine, vinblastine, vincristine and actinomycin D), but not to the alkylating agents, cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and cisplatin, or to the antimetabolites, 5-fluorouracil and methotrexate. P388/NVB cellular resistance to NVB was stable without drug pressure during continuous passage in vivo for more than ten weeks and in vitro for at least five weeks. These cells exhibited increased expression of P-gp, and a 30-fold level of resistance of NVB in vitro, which was completely reversable with verapamil.

Lentinan augmented intradermal reactions against bradykinin. Induction of acute phase proteins (APP) and the vascular dilatation hemorrhage (VDH) reaction on the ears have been reported to reflect the host responses to lentinan. The strain difference in the intensity of skin reactions coincided with those observed in VDH responses and with lentinan-induced antitumor effects against Sarcoma 180.

In one leukemia cell strain out of 7 such cases, RFLP of an allele of the interleukin-3 gene was found. Sequence analysis after cloning from the genomic library showed that a type I delta 2 IAP element was inserted in the region upstream of the IL-3 gene in the head-to-head orientation. This suggests that the locus in myeloid cells is sensitive for integration of IAP elements.

The proliferation of three of the cell lines was supported by BM FB. Three of the myeloid cell lines were inhibited 40-70%. The co-culture supernatants were tested for the secretion of hematopoietic cytokines by bioassays. Except for IL-6, which was already produced constitutively by BM FB, only little amounts of interleukin-1 (IL-1), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) could be detected in several co-culture supernatants. It could be shown that, according to cytologic and functional criteria, the myeloid leukemic cell lines ML-2 and PLB-985 differentiate along the monocyte-macrophage pathway after co-culture with BM FB. They revealed a histiocytic phenotype and could be induced to produce reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) after stimulation with zymosan or phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA). Additional proof for differentiation was obtained from flow cytometric analysis of surface differentiation antigens and adhesion molecules. The neutralization of IL-6 activity in the co-cultures by antibodies resulted in prevention of differentiation of PLB-985 cells, while differentiation of ML-2 cells in the co-cultures was not affected by addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies. Furthermore, in co-culture experiments with fibroblasts from skin and foreskin, we found a differentiation of PLB-985 cells comparable to that in co-cultures with BM FB, but poor differentiation of ML-2 cells. These data suggest that different mechanisms are involved in the differentiation of ML-2 and PLB-985 cells.","['Stolze, B', 'Emmendorffer, A', 'Corbacioglu, S', 'Konig, A', 'Welte, K', 'Ebell, W']","['Stolze B', 'Emmendorffer A', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Konig A', 'Welte K', 'Ebell W']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/analysis/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Respiratory Burst/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(13):1378-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we used the murine B cell leukemia (BCL1) model system to examine the possible secretion of inhibitory factors from irradiated leukemic spleen cells. It was found that under culture conditions, irradiated spleen cells obtained from leukemic mice produce factors capable of suppressing BCL1 cell proliferation in vitro. The release of an inhibitory factor from nonirradiated cells was also observed, albeit to a lower extent. Supernatants collected from cultured nonirradiated and irradiated cells derived from animals at the first week after BCL1 cell inoculation did not affect the proliferation capacity of cells at any stage of the disease, whereas supernatants obtained at more advanced stages exhibited an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cells derived from the same stages. The suppressive effect of supernatants of irradiated cells was more pronounced when those of 7 days' culture were used, compared to those of nonirradiated cells. The difference in suppression observed between supernatants of irradiated and nonirradiated BCL1 cells may be attributed either to the same factor produced in a larger amount following irradiation or to two (or more) factors--one produced spontaneously, the other induced by irradiation.","['Bessler, H', 'Hart, J', 'Slavin, S', 'Djaldetti, M']","['Bessler H', 'Hart J', 'Slavin S', 'Djaldetti M']","['Hematology and Immunology Research Laboratory, Hasharon Hospital, Golda Medical Center, Petah-Tiqva, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1995 Dec;23(13):1353-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

R-verapamil caused a dose-dependent inhibition of AML blast proliferation in the presence of stem-cell factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin 4, interleukin 6, and interleukin 10 when these cytokines were tested both alone and in different combinations. R-verapamil also inhibited the growth of clonogenic AML blast cells. The antiproliferative effect was not specific for AML blast cells, because r-verapamil also inhibited cytokine-dependent proliferation of blast cells derived from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The inhibitory effects of r-verapamil and anti-IL1 serum were additive, suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of r-verapamil does not depend solely on inhibition of IL1-mediated effects. Although r-verapamil inhibited spontaneous AML blast proliferation, for a majority of patients it caused only minimal, if any, inhibition of spontaneous cytokine secretion (IL1 alpha, IL1 beta, TNF alpha, IL6) by AML blast cells. Thus, although inhibition of IL1 effects may contribute in certain patients to the antiproliferative effect of r-verapamil, mechanisms other than IL1 inhibition seem to be more important in mediating the effects of r-verapamil.","['Bruserud, O', 'Nesthus, I', 'Pawelec, G']","['Bruserud O', 'Nesthus I', 'Pawelec G']","['Medical Department B, Haukeland University Hospital, University of Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1995;37(1-2):70-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00685631.,['10.1007/BF00685631 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro cytotoxic strength of HO-221 was investigated, as measured by IC50 values, compared with those of other drugs with different action mechanisms, using Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells, mouse leukemia L1210 cells and human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Morphological alterations following treatment were observed under a phase contrast microscope, and the mitotic index was determined at regular intervals to check for accumulation of metaphase cells. HO-221 was found to have a very strong toxic effect on all cell types, equal to that of the spindle poisons used as controls. HO-221 also produced the same specific morphological changes as the spindle poisons, with a significant accumulation of metaphase cells. A chromosome analysis of treated cells showed that HO-221 frequently induced polyploid and aneuploid cells, but without accompanying chromosome-breaking activity. An in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay was also carried out. The assay allowed the in vivo identification of a chromosome breaker or a spindle poison through the measurement of the relative sizes of micronuclei produced and erythrocytes. HO-221 was found frequently to induce relatively large micronuclei, an action regarded as specific to spindle poisons. It was thus demonstrated that HO-221 acts as a spindle poison both in vitro and in vivo. In order to investigate the mechanism of this action, a study of tubulin assembly using purified calf brain tubulin was carried out, which demonstrated clearly that HO-221 inhibits microtubule assembly. A detailed investigation of the action mechanism of HO-221 as a spindle poison is now called for.","['Ando, N', 'Nakajima, T', 'Masuda, H', 'Kawabata, Y', 'Iwai, M', 'Watanabe, M', 'Kagitani, Y', 'Yamada, N', 'Tsukagoshi, S']","['Ando N', 'Nakajima T', 'Masuda H', 'Kawabata Y', 'Iwai M', 'Watanabe M', 'Kagitani Y', 'Yamada N', 'Tsukagoshi S']","['Safety Evaluation Laboratory, Green Cross Corporation, Hyogo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '105128-93-6', ""(N-(4-(5-bromo-2-pyrimidinyloxy)-3-chlorophenyl)-N'-(2-nitrobenzoyl)urea)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cricetinae', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Metaphase/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Nitrobenzenes/*pharmacology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1995;37(1-2):63-9. doi: 10.1007/BF00685630.,['10.1007/BF00685630 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study included 15 adults undergoing marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Plasma samples were obtained at various times over a 24-h period, and concentrations of thioTEPA and TEPA were measured by gas chromatography. At 22-24 h after initiation of a 4-h infusion, the mean +/- SE plasma concentration of thioTEPA was 124 +/- 63 ng/ml, while that of TEPA was 235 +/- 69 ng/ml. For CFU-GM and BFU-E growth in vitro, the IC50(s) of thioTEPA were 83 ng/ml and 16 ng/ml, respectively, and the IC50(s) of TEPA were 141 ng/ml and 47 ng/ml, respectively. Using a two-compartment model, the mean thioTEPA Vc was 47.4 +/- 4.7 1/m2, t1/2 alpha 19 +/- 5 min, t1/2 beta 3.7 +/- 0.5 h, and plasma clearance 302 +/- 21 ml/min per m2. The mean AUCs were 6.9-16.2 mg h/1 for thioTEPA and 8.9-21.2 mg h/1 for TEPA, while the mean peak concentrations were 0.95-2.08 micrograms/ml for thioTEPA and 0.88-1.90 micrograms/ml for TEPA. There was a significant association of grades 2-4 maximum regimen-related toxicity (RRT) with TEPA peak > 1.75 micrograms/ml and with combined thioTEPA and TEPA AUC > 30 mg h/1 (5/6 vs 0/9, P = 0.01 for both comparisons), suggesting that drug exposure was an important determinant of toxicity and, potentially, efficacy. ThioTEPA Vc correlated best with adjusted body weight (r = 0.74, P = 0.0015). In an evaluation of 74 adults receiving thioTEPA 750 mg/m2 in combination with busulfan and cyclophosphamide, the maximum RRT for patients at ideal weight was significantly greater than that for obese patients dosed on ideal weight (mean RRT grade 1.7 vs 1.0, P = 0.004) but did not differ from the maximum RRT for obese adults dosed on actual or adjusted weights. We recommend that for obese patients thioTEPA be dosed on adjusted body weight.

Recently, a granule-independent cytolytic mechanism involving the interaction of the apoptosis-triggering Fas antigen (CD95) with Fas ligand (FasL) has been revealed in T cells. However, whether the Fas lytic pathway also functions in NK cells has not been established. We purified human peripheral NK cells (> 98% CD56+) and found that PMA and ionomycin treatment upregulated FasL message and stimulated the NK cells to lyse a Fas+ TC. This lysis was partially inhibited by the anti-Fas-blocking antibody M3 or by Fas.Fc fusion protein. We also found that FasL is constitutively expressed on the human NK-like leukemia cell line YT-INDY and that YT-INDY utilizes a Ca(2+)-independent Fas lytic pathway, as well as the granule pathway. We have previously shown that CD28/B7 interactions are involved in TC recognition by YT-INDY. K562 cotransfected with Fas and B7-1 (K562/Fas/B7) was lysed by YT-INDY at a higher level than a vector-transfected K562 line, whereas K562 transfected with Fas alone was not. Lysis of K562/Fas/B7 cotransfectants was partially Fas-mediated, as indicated by the presence of Ca(2+)-independent, M3-inhibitable lysis. Ca(2+)-independent, Fas-mediated lysis of several TC by YT-INDY was inhibited by anti-CD28 antibody. Anti-LFA-1 also inhibited Fas-mediated cytotoxicity in YT-INDY. Thus, fresh human NK cells and the human NK-like cell line YT-INDY are capable of using the Fas lytic pathway. In YT-INDY, CD28/B7 and LFA-1/ICAM interactions appear to influence the Fas lytic pathway.","['Montel, A H', 'Bochan, M R', 'Hobbs, J A', 'Lynch, D H', 'Brahmi, Z']","['Montel AH', 'Bochan MR', 'Hobbs JA', 'Lynch DH', 'Brahmi Z']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['B7-1 Antigen/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'CD28 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/analysis/*physiology']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Dec;166(2):236-46. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1995.9974.,"['S0008-8749(85)79974-1 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1995.9974 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the major effector cells are known to be T-cell subsets, detailed characterization of such T cells remains to be investigated. In the present study, we characterized them, especially as to whether they are thymus-derived T cells or extrathymic T cells, and how self-reactive clones were distributed among the above T-cell subsets. BALB/c mice (Mls-1b2a) were irradiated (9 Gy), subjected to bone marrow transplantation, and then treated with cyclosporin A (CsA) for 6 weeks. From 2 weeks after the cessation of CsA, these mice displayed signs of GVH disease. The major target organs included the liver and colon. Two-color staining for CD3 and IL-2R beta was applied to identify CD3-IL-2R beta+ NK cells, CD3-intermediate +IL-2R beta+ cells (i.e., intermediate CD3 or TCR cells of extrathymic origin) and CD3-high+IL-2R beta- cells (i.e., high CD3 cells of thymic origin). It was demonstrated that the major expanding lymphocytes were intermediate TCR cells and that self-reactive clones (V beta 3+ and V beta 11+ cells in this strain of mice) were confined to this population. Interestingly, these self-reactive clones had ability to respond to immobilized anti-V beta 3 and anti-V beta 11 mAbs. Liver MNC in mice with GVH disease which contained the highest proportion of intermediate TCR cells were able to mediate the adoptive transfer of GVH disease to other irradiated (6.5 Gy) mice. Intermediate TCR cells also showed potent cytotoxic activity against syngeneic leukemia cells. These results suggest that intermediate TCR cells are the major effector cells for the induction of syngeneic GVH disease.","['Osman, Y', 'Watanabe, T', 'Kawachi, Y', 'Sato, K', 'Ohtsuka, K', 'Watanabe, H', 'Hashimoto, S', 'Moriyama, Y', 'Shibata, A', 'Abo, T']","['Osman Y', 'Watanabe T', 'Kawachi Y', 'Sato K', 'Ohtsuka K', 'Watanabe H', 'Hashimoto S', 'Moriyama Y', 'Shibata A', 'Abo T']","['Department of Immunology, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Colon/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*analysis', 'Spleen/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1995 Dec;166(2):172-86. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1995.9980.,"['S0008-8749(85)79980-7 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1995.9980 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared the results of cytogenetic analysis and double-color FISH detection of bcr/abl genes fusion in 13 CML patients on IFN-alpha therapy (marrow sampling for cytogenetic and FISH analysis was carried out after 12 months in all patients and repeated after 18 months of IFN therapy in patients 4, 6, and 8).

Through retrospective and prospective methods, it was shown that the apparent spread of the disease was likely an artifact, resulting from changes in the distribution of fish farms throughout the province and corresponding changes in the intensity of regional disease surveillance. When viewed over a 5-year period, there were no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of the disease amongst fish sampled from each of the major salmon farming regions of British Columbia. By increasing the intensity of surveillance for the disease in apparently negative regions or chinook farms, one could routinely find cases of the disease.

Western blot (immunoblot) analysis using recombinant tax demonstrated the presence of anti-tax antibodies in 96% of patients (25 of 26) with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, 43% of those (20 of 46) with adult T-cell leukemia, and 61% of asymptomatic HTLV-I blood donors (40 of 66); only one of the HTLV-II specimens reacted with the recombinant tax protein.

The APSCT process involves harvesting of autologous progenitor cells from a patient's circulating blood (via leukapheresis), cryopreservation of the cells, and subsequent intravenous infusion for bone marrow hematopoietic reconstitution (HR). Although pluripotent stem cells, capable of multilineage differentiation, cannot be distinguished by morphologic criteria, they can be characterized as being CD34+ cells capable of indefinite self-renewal in situ and long-term self-renewal in cell cultures. Bone marrow and peripheral blood are common sources of autologous progenitor cells. Current techniques to identify and separate CD34+ cells for use in APSCT have resulted in fewer tumor cells being infused than if unseparated peripheral stem cells (PSC) were transplanted, with no differences noted in HR. Chemotherapy- and cytokine-induced mobilization results in increases in progenitor cells, necessitating fewer phereses to harvest sufficient numbers of progenitor cells for engraftment. This assessment addresses the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the use of PSC for HR and improving patient outcome, as well as the indications and criteria for patient selection for the use of APSCT. Available information from study panels, research centers, institutions, and government agencies is reviewed; randomized clinical tests (or lack thereof) are discussed; and comparisons are made between APSCT and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), an accepted therapy in treatment of some malignancies (e.g., leukemia and lymphoma). The author concludes that existing evidence indicates that PSC can provide satisfactory HR, and the rate of HR via PSC does not seem consistently different from that of ABMT. The clinical importance of HR continues to be secondary to the primary issue of the patient benefits of HDCT in terms of antitumor response, palliation, or survival.","['Handelsman, H']",['Handelsman H'],"['U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Rockville, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Health Technol Assess (Rockv),Health technology assessment,9501929,,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Technology Assessment, Biomedical', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality']",1995/08/01 00:00,1995/08/01 00:01,['1995/08/01 00:00'],"['1995/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Health Technol Assess (Rockv). 1995 Aug;(5):1-16.,,,,,,,,196,,,,,,,,,,

During the last decade, several techniques have been proposed and used for detecting minimal residual disease (MRD). Each approach is characterized by advantages and limitations, mainly related to its sensitivity and specificity. The general limitations of such tests originates from the size of the sample which can be analysed and the heterogeneous distribution of leukemia after treatment. Clinically useful methods for detecting residual leukemia require not only sensitivity but also speed and reproducibility. The rate of false negative tests is low with polymerase chain reaction as well as flow cytometric analysis. Usually, patients without persistent cells carrying leukemia-associated markers have a lower risk of relapse. However, the detection of a persistent marker at one time point in complete remission cannot be considered a reliable indicator of MRD, whereas increase of positive signals or reappearance of leukemic markers usually precedes relapse. It is likely that one single approach will not allow the monitoring of the majority of patients and that a combination of techniques will be needed. Definitive results will be obtained only through prospective studies in patients receiving standardised therapy. Studies in which therapeutic strategies are designed according to the results provided by techniques for detecting MRD will be necessary to assess the relevance of their contribution to the treatment of leukemia.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Mangoni, L', 'Dotti, G P', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Mangoni L', 'Dotti GP', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:75-80. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075308.,['10.3109/10428199509075308 [doi]'],,,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of AML M7 requires more than 30% of the nucleated bone marrow cells being megakaryoblasts. The more common types of AML MO-M6 have to be excluded by morphological and cytochemical analysis whereas immunology is needed to exclude ALL. The megakaryocytic nature of the leukemia has to be proven by ultrastructural demonstration of platelet peroxidase or by immunological demonstration of CD61, CD42, CD41 on the surface of the leukemic blasts. Megakaryocytic/megakaryoblastic leukemias show a wide morphologic spectrum. In some instance small cells dominate, clearly showing megakaryocytic differentiation with scant amounts of cytoplasm and with nuclei showing dense chromatin. On the other hand, there are cases with larger cells resembling ALL-L2 blasts with moderate amounts of rather basophilic cytoplasm which in some instances contain azurophilic granules. Cytoplasmic blebs and protrusions are the most prominent feature of many cases. The nuclei of these cells are round with more finely reticulated chromatin and with prominent nucleoli. The megakaryoblastic nature of these cells can be suggested by morphology. However, according to our experience there are cases of c-ALL with the very same morphologic picture. Consequently, immunologic phenotyping of these cases is necessary in any instance. Cytochemistry is of limited diagnostic value in megakaryoblastic leukemias.

In 10 cases (19% of the total) granules stained metachromatically in percentages of promyelocytes ranging from 16 to 60. In these cases peroxidase positivity was weaker than in the classic hypergranular and microgranular M3 and activities of esterases were usually present; at the ultrastructural level granules contained particulate material. Immunophenotypic and cytogenetic characteristics seemed not to differ from those of other M3 cases. Coagulopathy was usually life-threatening, notwithstanding the low white cell count, and the median survival was short. Hyperhistaminemia-related symptoms were not observed. Cytochemical, immunologic and cytogenetic findings are useful to differentiate this form from M2 with basophilic differentiation and from mast cell leukemia.","['Invernizzi, R', 'Iannone, A M', 'Bernuzzi, S', ""D'Alessio, A"", 'Fiamenghi, C', 'Fenoglio, C', 'Rossi, A', 'Bergamaschi, G', 'Ascari, E']","['Invernizzi R', 'Iannone AM', 'Bernuzzi S', ""D'Alessio A"", 'Fiamenghi C', 'Fenoglio C', 'Rossi A', 'Bergamaschi G', 'Ascari E']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Interna, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['15XUH0X66N (Tolonium Chloride)'],IM,"['Cytoplasmic Granules/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tolonium Chloride']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:57-60. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075304.,['10.3109/10428199509075304 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotype showed HLA-DR-, CD13+, CD33+, CD2+, CD9+; promyelocytic features were also detected by electron microscopy. However, leukemic cells lacked both translocation t(15;17) and RAR alpha/PML genes rearrangement. These cases were considered to be 'M2 atypical' subtypes and they contribute to point out how cytogenetics and molecular biology are mandatory for a correct diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) particularly because therapy with all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is now the best treatment for APL. Nevertheless these 3 cases indicate that the atypical M2 subtype may be confused with the M3v if only cytochemistry, immunophenotype and electron microscopy are used in the defining the FAB subtypes.","['Fenu, S', 'Carmini, D', 'Mancini, F', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Alimena, G', 'Riccioni, R', 'Barsotti, P', 'Mancini, M', 'Avvisati, G', 'Mandelli, F']","['Fenu S', 'Carmini D', 'Mancini F', 'Guglielmi C', 'Alimena G', 'Riccioni R', 'Barsotti P', 'Mancini M', 'Avvisati G', 'Mandelli F']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:49-55. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075303.,['10.3109/10428199509075303 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relevance of immunophenotyping in AML is debated because of the lack of a clear prognostic impact and the necessity of uniform diagnostic criteria and standardised methodologies. Several authors, studying the morpho-immunological characteristics of AML blasts by flow cytometry, suggested the necessity for the definition of clusters of cells with similar morphological patterns and intensity of expression. In this respect we reviewed blast CD34 and CD33 intensity of expression in 65 AMLs classified according to the FAB criteria. Four morphological groups could be identified: 1) low side scatter (SSC) and forward scatter (FSC); 2) intermediate SSC and FSC; 3) high SSC and FSC; 4) combination of pattern 2 plus 3. Five immunological patterns were defined: a) high CD34 expression with negative or weak CD33; b) high CD34 and CD33 expression; c) weak to negative CD34 with high CD33 expression; d) coexistence of 2 different subpopulations; e) negative to weak CD34 and CD33 expression. Based on this morpho-immunological analysis we were able to subdivide AML patients into 5 homogeneous subgroups and a comparison with FAB classification showed a concordance of 73.9%. Regarding CD34 and CD33 intensity of expression, a correlation with prognosis was demonstrated among all M1-M2 patients and in the M2 and M4 subgroups. In conclusion even if immunophenotype cannot substitute the FAB approach to AML, we feel that a flow cytometry morpho-immunological analysis could be helpful in achieving a greater understanding and agreement between different Institutions and assist in the definition of more precise prognostic subgroups.","['Rigolin, G M', 'Lanza, F', 'Ferrari, L', 'Castoldi, G']","['Rigolin GM', 'Lanza F', 'Ferrari L', 'Castoldi G']","['Institute of Haematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,"['*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, CD34', '*Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:43-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075302.,['10.3109/10428199509075302 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparison of clinical and hematological features between CD34 positive (24/45) and CD34 negative (21/45) patients showed that the former were of older age, had more pronounced lymphoid organ involvement and higher serum LDH levels. Immunophenotypic analysis of marrow blast cells revealed a significant predominance of the 'null' phenotype in the CD34 positive group, together with a strong expression of the VLA-4 and VLA-5 integrins (fibronectin receptors). CD34 positive ALL were also more frequently associated with either aberrant myeloid-related antigens (CD13, CD33) or the P-gp/MDR-1 phenotype. Only 11 out of 24 (45%) CD34 positive patients achieved complete remission after induction chemotherapy, compared to 20/21 (95%) CD34 negative cases. Furthermore, survival was significantly shorter in the CD34 positive group (6.6 mo. vs 13.5 mo.). These results suggest that in ALL, as in AML, CD34 positivity may predict a poor prognosis.","['Cacciola, E', 'Guglielmo, P', 'Cacciola, E', 'Stagno, F', 'Cacciola, R R', 'Impera, S']","['Cacciola E', 'Guglielmo P', 'Cacciola E', 'Stagno F', 'Cacciola RR', 'Impera S']","['1st and 2nd Chair of Hematology, University of Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ploidies', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1995;18 Suppl 1:31-6. doi: 10.3109/10428199509075300.,['10.3109/10428199509075300 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
