MCL1 is an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that could limit the efficacy of anticancer agents as recombinant human tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (rh-TRAIL). Here, we investigated MCL1 expression in TNBC tissues and cells. We found MCL1 differentially expressed (upregulated or downregulated) in TNBC tissues. Furthermore, in comparison to the human mammary epithelial cells, we found that MDA-MB-231 cells show similar messenger RNA levels but higher MCL1 protein levels, whereas it resulted downregulated in MDA-MB-436 and BT-20 cells. We evaluated the effects of rh-TRAIL and A-1210477, a selective MCL1 inhibitor, on cell viability and growth of MDA-MB-231 cells. We demonstrated that the drug combination reduced the cell growth and activated the apoptotic pathway. Similar effects were observed on three-dimensional cultures and tertiary mammospheres of MDA-MB-231 cells. In MDA-MB-231 cells, after MCL1 silencing, rh-TRAIL confined the cell population in the sub-G0/G1 phase and induced a drop in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. To understand the molecular mechanism by which the loss of MCL1 function sensitizes the MDA-MB-231 cells to rh-TRAIL, we analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, the expression of genes related to apoptosis, stemness, cell cycle, and those involved in epigenetic regulation. Interestingly, among the upregulated genes through MCL1 silencing or inhibition, there was TNFRSF10A (DR4). Moreover, MCL1 inhibition increased DR4 protein levels and its cell surface expression. Finally, we demonstrated MCL1-DR4 interaction and dissociation of this complex after A-1210477 treatment. Overall, our findings highlight the potential MCL1-roles in MDA-MB-231 cells and suggest that MCL1 targeting could be an effective strategy to overcome TNBC's rh-TRAIL resistance.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['De Blasio, Anna', 'Pratelli, Giovanni', 'Drago-Ferrante, Rosa', 'Saliba, Christian', 'Baldacchino, Shawn', 'Grech, Godfrey', 'Tesoriere, Giovanni', 'Scerri, Christian', 'Vento, Renza', 'Di Fiore, Riccardo']","['De Blasio A', 'Pratelli G', 'Drago-Ferrante R', 'Saliba C', 'Baldacchino S', 'Grech G', 'Tesoriere G', 'Scerri C', 'Vento R', 'Di Fiore R']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Centre for Molecular Medicine and Biobanking, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.', 'Department of Pathology, aculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.', 'Department of Pathology, aculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Department of Physiology and Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, University of Malta, Msida, Malta.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technologies, University of Palermo, Polyclinic, Palermo, Italy.', 'Associazione Siciliana per la Lotta contro i Tumori (ASLOT), Palermo, Italy.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8308-4830'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190325,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (A-1210477)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DR4 receptor', '*MCL1', '*cancer stem cells', '*rh-TRAIL', '*triple-negative breast cancer']",2019/03/27 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28479 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(10):18432-18447. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28479.

Observations: Patient presented to clinic with a visual acuity (VA) of 20/200 in the right eye (OD) after several months of progressive monocular vision loss and was found to have dense pre-retinal hemorrhage. Patient underwent 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy to clear the preretinal hemorrhage along with a complex macula-off retinal detachment repair to address retinal tear and multilayer retinal hemorrhage. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with CML as she was found to be positive for the fusion protein of break point cluster gene (BCR) with Abelson tyrosine kinase (ABL1), BCR-ABL1, upon systemic work-up. Imatinib therapy resulted in complete hematologic and cytogenetic resolution after one month, however, the patient's vision remained unchanged six months after surgery. Conclusion and importance: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of unilateral leukemic retinopathy secondary to low risk CML, as determined by the Sokal and Hasford prognostic scoring systems.

WP1130 has shown potent activity against a variety of cancer but whether WP1130 has anti-T-ALL activity is not clear. USP24, one target of WP1130, is one of the largest deubiquitinases and its detailed mechanism is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to explore whether WP1130 could suppress T-ALL and the role of USP24 in T-ALL. Methods: Molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay were performed to determine whether and how WP1130 directly interact with USP24. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential assay was measured via Rhodamine 123 staining. USP24 was reactivated using the deactivated CRISPR-associated protein 9 (dCas9)-synergistic activation mediator (SAM) system. The in vivo results were examined by tumor xenografts in NOD-SCID mice. All statistical analyses were performed with the SPSS software package. Results: WP1130 treatment decreased the viability and induces apoptosis of T-ALL cells both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that knockdown of USP24 but not USP9X could significantly induce growth inhibition and apoptosis of T-ALL cells. Oncomine database showed that USP24 expression was upregulated in T-ALL samples and Kaplan-Meier results indicated that the USP24 was negatively but USP9X was positively associated with survival in T-ALL patients. Additionally, we proposed that WP1130 directly interacts with the activity site pocket of USP24 in T-ALL cells, which leads to the decrease of its substrates Mcl-1. Mechanistically, WP1130 induces apoptosis by accelerating the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential via USP24-Mcl-1 axis. Conclusions: Altogether, using WP1130 as a chemical probe, we demonstrate that USP24 but not USP9X is a novel target in T-ALL cells. Moreover, we uncovered that WP1130 induces apoptosis by accelerating the collapse of mitochondrial transmembrane potential via USP24-Mcl-1 axis. These results provide that USP24-Mcl-1 axis may represent a novel strategy in the treatment of T-ALL and WP1130 is a promising lead compound for developing anti-T-ALL drugs.",,"['Luo, Hao', 'Jing,

Osteopenia and osteoporosis were detected in nine patients (23.1%) and three patients (7.7%), respectively, according to previously published data of healthy age- and sex-related Turkish children's BMD values. The mean age at diagnosis of patients with ALL, having the Z-score above -1 was lower than in patients having bone defect (Z score <-1). Conclusion: Early detection and intervention strategies to optimize bone health are essential in pediatric patients with ALL.",,"['Donmez, Arzu Duygu', 'Isik, Pamir', 'Cetinkaya, Semra', 'Yarali, Nese']","['Donmez AD', 'Isik P', 'Cetinkaya S', 'Yarali N']","[""Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", ""Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Dr. Sami Ulus Obstetrics and Gynecology, Children's Health and Disease Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey."", ""Ankara Children's Hematology and Oncology Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9119-3113', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9618-5008', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3974-2872', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5488-2385']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181130,Turkey,Eurasian J Med,The Eurasian journal of medicine,101557701,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'bone mineral density', 'osteopenia', 'osteoporosis']",2019/03/27 06:00,2019/03/27 06:01,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.5152/eurasianjmed.2018.18196 [doi]', 'eajm-51-1-38 [pii]']",ppublish,Eurasian J Med. 2019 Feb;51(1):38-41. doi: 10.5152/eurasianjmed.2018.18196.

Given the growing trend on the application of ML techniques in precision medicine, here we present an ML technique which predicts the likelihood of complete remission (CR) in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we explored the question of whether ML algorithms designed to analyze gene-expression patterns obtained through RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) can be used to accurately predict the likelihood of CR in pediatric AML patients who have received induction therapy. We employed tests of statistical significance to determine which genes were differentially expressed in the samples derived from patients who achieved CR after 2 courses of treatment and the samples taken from patients who did not benefit. We tuned classifier hyperparameters to optimize performance and used multiple methods to guide our feature selection as well as our assessment of algorithm performance. To identify the model which performed best within the context of this study, we plotted receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Using the top 75 genes from the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (K-NN) model (K = 27) yielded the best area-under-the-curve (AUC) score that we obtained: 0.84. When we finally tested the previously unseen test data set, the top 50 genes yielded the best AUC = 0.81. Pathway enrichment analysis for these 50 genes showed that the guanosine diphosphate fucose (GDP-fucose) biosynthesis pathway is the most significant with an adjusted P value = .0092, which may suggest the vital role of N-glycosylation in AML.",,"['Gal, Ophir', 'Auslander, Noam', 'Fan, Yu', 'Meerzaman, Daoud']","['Gal O', 'Auslander N', 'Fan Y', 'Meerzaman D']","['Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'Cancer Data Science Laboratory, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.', 'Center for Biomedical Informatics & Information Technology, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7473-6104'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190315,United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)', 'gene expression profiling', 'machine Learning (ML)', 'remission induction']",2019/03/27 06:00,2019/03/27 06:01,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1176935119835544 [doi]', '10.1177_1176935119835544 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Inform. 2019 Mar 15;18:1176935119835544. doi: 10.1177/1176935119835544. eCollection 2019.,PMC6423478,"['Declaration of conflicting interest:The author(s) declared no potential conflicts', 'of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this', 'article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using leukaemia cell lines and primary acute myeloid leukaemia patient samples, we show that low expression of the iron exporter ferroportin results in a susceptibility of these cells via an increase in intracellular iron from ferumoxytol. The reactive oxygen species produced by free ferrous iron lead to increased oxidative stress and cell death. Ferumoxytol treatment results in a significant reduction of disease burden in a murine leukaemia model and patient-derived xenotransplants bearing leukaemia cells with low ferroportin expression.

To explain their drivers, we analyzed the genomic and gene expression profiles of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts purified from patients at serial time-points during their disease history. We identified a transcriptional signature specific for post-transplantation relapses and highly enriched in immune-related processes, including T cell costimulation and antigen presentation. In two independent patient cohorts we confirmed the deregulation of multiple costimulatory ligands on AML blasts at post-transplantation relapse (PD-L1, B7-H3, CD80, PVRL2), mirrored by concomitant changes in circulating donor T cells. Likewise, we documented the frequent loss of surface expression of HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP on leukemia cells, due to downregulation of the HLA class II regulator CIITA. We show that loss of HLA class II expression and upregulation of inhibitory checkpoint molecules represent alternative modalities to abolish AML recognition from donor-derived T cells, and can be counteracted by interferon-gamma or checkpoint blockade, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the deregulation of pathways involved in T cell-mediated allorecognition is a distinctive feature and driver of AML relapses after allo-HCT, which can be rapidly translated into personalized therapies.",,"['Toffalori, Cristina', 'Zito, Laura', 'Gambacorta, Valentina', 'Riba, Michela', 'Oliveira, Giacomo', 'Bucci, Gabriele', 'Barcella, Matteo', 'Spinelli,

In the majority of patients, KIT D816V is not only detected in mast cells but also in other hematopoietic lineages. We sought to investigate the effects of the KIT-inhibitors midostaurin and avapritinib on single-cell-derived myeloid progenitor cells using granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming-units of patients with KIT D816V positive advSM. Colonies obtained prior to treatment were incubated in vitro with midostaurin (n = 10) or avapritinib (n = 11) and showed a marked reduction (>/=50%) of KIT D816V positive colonies in 3/10 (30%) and 7/11 (64%) patient samples, respectively. Three of those 7 (43%) avapritinib responders were resistant to midostaurin in both, in vitro and in vivo. Colonies from four patients with high-risk molecular profile and aggressive clinical course were resistant to both drugs. The in vitro activity of midostaurin strongly correlated with clinical and molecular responses, e.g., relative reduction of KIT D816V allele burden and the proportion of KIT D816V positive colonies obtained after six months midostaurin-treatment in vivo.

A higher proportion of early-differentiated Memory Stem (TSCM) and Central Memory BM-T cells express multiple IR in relapsing patients than in CR patients. Exhausted BM-T cells at relapse display a restricted TCR repertoire, impaired effector functions and leukemia-reactive specificities. In 57 patients, early detection of severely exhausted (PD-1(+)Eomes(+)T-bet(-)) BM-TSCM predicts relapse. Accordingly, leukemia-specific T cells in patients prone to relapse display exhaustion markers, absent in patients maintaining long-term CR.

We found that NKT cells operate distinct metabolic programming from CD4 T cells. NKT cells are less efficient in glucose uptake than CD4 T cells with or without activation. Gene-expression data revealed that, in NKT cells, glucose is preferentially metabolized by the pentose phosphate pathway and mitochondria, as opposed to being converted into lactate. In fact, glucose is essential for the effector functions of NKT cells and a high lactate environment is detrimental for NKT cell survival and proliferation. Increased glucose uptake and IFN-gamma expression in NKT cells is inversely correlated with bacterial loads in response to bacterial infection, further supporting the significance of glucose metabolism for NKT cell function. We also found that promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger seemed to play a role in regulating NKT cells' glucose metabolism.

We define an immunosuppressive role for tumor-expressed CTLA-4 using chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as a disease model. CLL cells, among other cancer cells, are CTLA-4(+) Coculture with activated human T cells induced surface CTLA-4 on primary human CLL B cells. CTLA-4 on CLL-derived human cell lines decreased CD80 expression on cocultured CD80(+) cells, with restoration upon CTLA-4 blockade. Coculture of CTLA-4(+) CLL cells with CD80-GFP(+) cell lines revealed transfer of CD80-GFP into CLL tumor cells, similar to CTLA-4(+) T cells able to trans-endocytose CD80. Coculture of T cells with CTLA-4(+) CLL cells decreased IL-2 production. Using a human CTLA-4 knock-in mouse lacking FcgammaR function, antitumor efficacy was observed by blocking murine CTLA-4 on tumor cells in isolation of the T cell effect and Fc-mediated depletion. These data implicate tumor CTLA-4 in cancer cell-mediated immunosuppression in vitro and as having a functional role in tumor cells in vivo.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Do, Priscilla', 'Beckwith, Kyle A', 'Cheney, Carolyn', 'Tran, Minh', 'Beaver, Larry', 'Griffin, Brittany G', 'Mo, Xiaokui', 'Liu, Yang', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Hertlein, Erin', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Byrd, John C']","['Do P', 'Beckwith KA', 'Cheney C', 'Tran M', 'Beaver L', 'Griffin BG', 'Mo X', 'Liu Y', 'Lapalombella R', 'Hertlein E', 'Muthusamy N', 'Byrd JC']","['Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Hendrix College, Conway, AR 72032.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and.', ""Children's National Health System, Washington, DC 20010."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; raj.muthusamy@osumc.edu john.byrd@osumc.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; raj.muthusamy@osumc.edu john.byrd@osumc.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8025-2512', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9697-7585', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0351-4504']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190325,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology']",,,2019/03/27 06:00,2019/12/31 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801359 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801359 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 May 1;202(9):2806-2816. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801359.

However, the mechanisms underlying its transport into target cells have remained elusive. The protein encoded by SLC43A3_1 [equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1)] has recently been shown to transport endogenous nucleobases. A splice variant (SLC43A3_2), encoding a protein with 13 additional amino acids in the first extracellular loop, is also expressed but its function is unknown. We hypothesized that 6-MP is a substrate for both variants of ENBT1. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells (lacking endogenous ENBT1 activity) were transfected with each of the coding region variants of SLC43A3. ENBT1 function was assessed via the rate of flux of [(3)H]adenine and [(14)C]6-MP across the plasma membrane. Both SLC43A3 variants encoded proteins with similar functional properties. [(14)C]6-MP and [(3)H]adenine had K m values (+/-S.D.) of 163 +/- 126 and 37 +/- 26 microM, respectively, for this system. Decynium-22, 6-thioguanine, and 6-methylmercaptopurine inhibited 6-MP uptake with K i values of 1.0 +/- 0.4, 67 +/- 30, and 73 +/- 20 microM, respectively. ENBT1 also mediated adenine-sensitive efflux of 6-MP from the SLC43A3-HEK293 cells. MRP4 also contributed to the efflux of 6-MP in this model, but was less efficient than ENBT1 in this regard. Furthermore, transfection of HEK293 cells with SLC43A3 increased the sensitivity of the cells to the cytotoxic effects of 6-MP by more than 7-fold. Thus, both variants of ENBT1 are key players in the transfer of 6-MP into and out of cells, and changes in SLC43A3 expression impact 6-MP cytotoxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental', 'Therapeutics.']","['Ruel, Nicholas M', 'Nguyen, Khanh H', 'Vilas, Gonzalo', 'Hammond, James R']","['Ruel NM', 'Nguyen KH', 'Vilas G', 'Hammond JR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada james.hammond@ualberta.ca.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190325,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (SLC43A3 protein, human)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Transport Systems/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Transfection']",,,2019/03/27 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['mol.118.114389 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.118.114389 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2019 Jun;95(6):584-596. doi: 10.1124/mol.118.114389.

In phase I, doses of bortezomib (.7, 1.0, and 1.3 mg/m(2)) with BuMel were administered to groups of 3 patients each. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib was 1.3 mg/m(2)/day. A subsequent cohort with 41 patients was analyzed in a phase II trial to identify safety and efficacy. The phase II trial showed a 75% response rate, including very good partial response (VGPR) or better, and a 55% rate of complete response (CR) at 3 months; For post-transplantation best response, an 83% rate of VGPR or better (68% CR) was observed. With a median follow-up of 31.4 months, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 26.8 months. The probability of 2 year-PFS was 56.5%, and median overall survival (OS) could not calculated. Specifically, high-risk cytogenetics were associated with adverse survival outcomes compared with standard-risk cytogenetics (median PFS, 12.2 months versus 35.7 months, P=.039; median OS, 26.7 months versus 73.3 months; P=.086). With a median of 11 days to neutrophil engraftment and 10 days for platelet engraftment, no graft failure or delayed engrafting were observed. The most common grade 3 or severe nonhematologic adverse events included neutropenic fever (73.2%) and stomatitis (14.6%). Except for 3 patients with transplantation-related mortality due to sepsis, other adverse events were manageable. These findings demonstrate that bortezomib is safe and has a potential role in conditioning regimens in combination with BuMel for patients with transplantation-eligible MM.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Chromosome microarray analysis (CMA) detected a de novo deletion of 1.871 Mb at 1q23.3. The deletion encompassed 2 genes of PBX1 and LMX1A. PBX1 haploinsufficiency had been reported to lead syndromic congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) in humans. Furthermore, at 31 weeks' gestation, borderline oligohydramnios and restricted fetal dimensions were revealed. Ultimately, the pregnancy was terminated at 32 weeks with a 1500-g female fetus presenting polydactyl of left hand.

Nevertheless, only a few clinical cases have been described in cats, and even fewer have provided information on the response to treatment and a proper follow-up. Here we report a case of feline leishmaniosis not associated with any other disease or co-infection and document its response to allopurinol treatment and long-term follow-up data. RESULTS: A 6-year-old domestic shorthair female cat was referred for nodular blepharitis, mucocutaneous ulcerative lesions of the mouth and lymph node enlargement. The cat was moderately anaemic, hyperglobulinaemic and tested negative for feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus. Fine needle aspirates of nodules and mucocutaneous lesions showed the presence of numerous amastigote forms of Leishmania. Leishmania infection was further confirmed by serology (IFAT test, 1:640) and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on blood and conjunctival swabs. The cat was treated with allopurinol (20 mg/kg SID), which was clinically effective, although the cat remained Leishmania-positive in serology and RT-PCR on blood and conjunctival swabs. Allopurinol treatment was interrupted after seven months because of the healing of all lesions and lack of compliance by the owner. After two years, the cat relapsed displaying almost the same clinical signs and clinicopathological alterations. On this occasion, the parasite was isolated by culture and identified as belonging to L. infantum. Allopurinol treatment was started again but was interrupted several times because of the itching side effect observed. The cat worsened progressively and died two months after the relapse without any chance to shift the treatment to another molecule (e.g. meglumineantimoniate or miltefosine). CONCLUSIONS: Out of all documented cases of feline leishmanosis, the present case has the longest follow-up period and it is one of the few in which the parasite was isolated and identified. It further confirms the potential progression of Leishmania infection to disease in cats even in the absence of comorbidities. Veterinarians practicing in endemic areas should be aware of this susceptibility, properly include feline leishmaniosis in the differential diagnosis and propose preventative measures to those cats at risk.",,"['Brianti, Emanuele', 'Celi, Nunziata', 'Napoli, Ettore', 'Abbate, Jessica M', 'Arfuso, Francesca', 'Gaglio, Gabriella', 'Iatta, Roberta', 'Giannetto, Salvatore', 'Gramiccia, Marina', 'Otranto, Domenico']","['Brianti E', 'Celi N', 'Napoli E', 'Abbate JM', 'Arfuso F', 'Gaglio G', 'Iatta R', 'Giannetto S', 'Gramiccia M', 'Otranto D']","['Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Polo University Annunziata, Messina, Italy. ebrianti@unime.it.', 'Veterinary Practitioner, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Polo University Annunziata, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Polo University Annunziata, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Polo University Annunziata, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Polo University Annunziata, Messina, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, St. prov. per Casamassima km 3, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Messina, Polo University Annunziata, Messina, Italy.', 'Unit of Vector-Borne Diseases, Department of Infectious Diseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Veterinary Medicine, University of Bari, St. prov. per Casamassima km 3, Bari, Italy.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5613-0144'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190326,England,Parasit Vectors,Parasites & vectors,101462774,"['0 (Trypanocidal Agents)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy/*parasitology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Leishmania infantum', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/diagnosis/drug therapy/*veterinary', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trypanocidal Agents/therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Allopurinol', 'Cat', 'Feline leishmaniosis', 'HSP70', 'ITS1', 'Leishmania infantum', 'PCR-RFLP', 'Sequencing analysis', 'Treatment']",2019/03/27 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2019/03/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13071-019-3388-9 [doi]', '10.1186/s13071-019-3388-9 [pii]']",epublish,Parasit Vectors. 2019 Mar 26;12(1):121. doi: 10.1186/s13071-019-3388-9.,PMC6434852,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune response plays a key role in driving the course of L. infantum infection in other host species; however, the feline cell-mediated immune response to L. infantum infection has not yet been investigated. The aim of this study was to determine the cell-mediated immune response specific to L. infantum by means of interferon (IFN)-gamma release in whole blood assay from cats living in endemic areas (66 in Sicily and 113 in Catalonia) and to compare with antibody levels to L. infantum [enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT)], blood parasite load and retroviral infections. RESULTS: Most cats (n = 140) were L. infantum antibody negative and only 22% (n = 39) were positive. Only 9 and 2% of tested cats had a feline immunodeficency virus (FIV) infection or a feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection, respectively. Thirty-two cats out of 179 (18%) produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with L. infantum soluble antigen (LSA) while the majority of cats (93%) produced IFN-gamma after stimulation with concanavalin A (ConA). Six LSA-IFN-gamma-producer cats were seropositive (three to ELISA and five to IFAT) but they were polymerase chain reaction (PCR) negative, while only one cat was antibody- and PCR-positive. Significant positive correlations were found between IFN-gamma concentrations after stimulation with LSA and ConA, and between serology and PCR testing. No association was found between FIV status and LSA or ConA-IFN-gamma production. Combining PCR, serology and specific IFN-gamma concentration results, we found that 36% of cats studied were exposed to L. infantum. CONCLUSIONS: As expected, cats from endemic areas produce IFN-gamma after ex vivo blood stimulation with LSA and therefore are able to activate a cell-mediated adaptive immune response against the parasite that is variably associated with antibody or blood PCR positivity. The association of this assay to serological and molecular tests provides a better estimate of cat exposure to L. infantum.",,"['Priolo, Vito', 'Martinez-Orellana, Pamela', 'Pennisi, Maria Grazia', 'Masucci, Marisa', 'Prandi, David', 'Ippolito, Dorotea', 'Bruno, Federica', 'Castelli, Germano', 'Solano-Gallego, Laia']","['Priolo V', 'Martinez-Orellana P', 'Pennisi MG', 'Masucci M', 'Prandi D', 'Ippolito D', 'Bruno F', 'Castelli G', 'Solano-Gallego L']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie, Universita di Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Departament de Medicina i Cirurgia Animals, Facultat de Veterinaria, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie, Universita di Messina, Messina, Italy. pennipet@unime.it.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie, Universita di Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Departament de Medicina i Cirurgia Animals, Facultat de Veterinaria, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Bellaterra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie, Universita di Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Centro di Referenza Nazionale per la Leishmaniosi (CReNaL), Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Sicilia ""A.

However, imatinib resistance is currently a clinical problem for CML. It is very importantto find a strategy to inhibit imatinib resistance. METHODS: (1) We Identified indirubin and its derivatives and predicted its putative targets; (2) We downloaded data of the gene chip GSE2810 from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and performed GEO2R analysis to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs); and (3) we constructed a P-P network of putative targets and DEGs to explore the mechanisms of action and to verify the results of molecular docking. RESULT: We Identified a total of 42 small-molecule compounds, of which 15 affected 11 putative targets, indicating the potential to inhibit imatinib resistance; the results of molecular docking verified these results. Six biomarkers of imatinib resistance were characterised by analysing DEGs. CONCLUSION: The 15 small molecule compounds inhibited imatinib resistance through the cytokine-cytokine receptor signalling pathway, the JAK-stat pathway, and the NF-KB signalling pathway.

In addition, low oxygen tension is able to regulate the expression of different genes involved in malignancy. In this study, we hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) genes were assessed as principal regulators of hypoxia in do novo AML patients. Methods: Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were collected from 57 AML patients and 17 normal control subjects with informed consent. Expression of HIF1alpha and VEGF-A was then evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR (Q-Real time PCR) and data were analyzed with SPSS 16. Result: HIF1alpha and VEGF-A showed overexpression in AML patients compared to normal controls (P <0.0001 and P<0.005, respectively). The expression level of HIF1alpha was significantly higher in AML-M3 cases versus AML-non M3 cases. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between HIF1alpha and VEGF-A ( P <0.0001 and r = 0.497). Conclusion: Adding to the many studies on the role of hypoxia in solid tumors, our data indicate that HIF1a and VEGF-A overexpression also occurs in AML patients.

However, to date, the eradication of APCs remains a major challenge. We previously reported a naturally occurring secolignan- Peperomin E (PepE) and its analog 6-methyl (hydroxyethyl) amino-2, 6-dihydropeperomin E (DMAPE) that selectively target and induce oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in KG-1a CD34(+) cells (an APCs-like cell line) in vitro. We therefore further evaluated the efficacy and the mechanism of action of these compounds in this study. We found that PepE and DMAPE have similar potential to eliminate primary APCs, with no substantial toxicities to the normal cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, these agents selectively inhibit TrxR1, an antioxidant enzyme aberrantly expressed in APCs, by covalently binding to its selenocysteine residue at the C-terminal redox center. TrxR1 inhibition mediated by PepE (DMAPE) leads to the formation of cellular selenium compromised thioredoxin reductase-derived apoptotic protein (SecTRAP), oxidation of Trx, induction of oxidative stress and finally activation of apoptosis of APCs. Our results demonstrate a potential anti-APCs molecular target - TrxR1 and provide valuable insights into the mechanism underlying PepE (DMAPE)-induced cytotoxicity of APCs, and support the further preclinical investigations on PepE (DMAPE)-related therapies for the treatment of relapsed AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Although the risk of developing AML and ALL is significantly increased in children with Down syndrome, the development of both malignancies in the same patient is very rare. We describe a patient with Down syndrome who developed ALL 6 years after being diagnosed with AML. We performed a literature review and Children's Oncology Group query and discovered eight published cases and five cases of ALL following AML in pediatric patients with Down syndrome, as well as six cases of ALL following AML in non-Down syndrome patients. There was a similar cumulative incidence of ALL after treatment for AML in the Down syndrome and non-Down syndrome populations. Overall survival in patients with Down syndrome who developed ALL after treatment for AML was comparable to overall survival for patients with Down syndrome with de novo ALL with an average follow-up of 7 years after ALL diagnosis. Clinical data collected were used to discuss whether this phenomenon represents a secondary leukemia, second primary cancer, or mixed-lineage leukemia.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Murphy, Brianna R', 'Roth, Michael', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Alonzo, Todd', 'Gerbing, Robert', 'Wells, Robert J']","['Murphy BR', 'Roth M', 'Kolb EA', 'Alonzo T', 'Gerbing R', 'Wells RJ']","[""M.

While some clinical signs indicate good prognosis, definitive cytohistological prognostic factors have yet to be described. METHODS: We classified 65 ATLL patients into three groups by tumour cell size and nuclear pleomorphism on fine-needle aspiration and tumour touch smear samples. Semi-quantitative analysis of background small lymphocytes, reactive CD20-positive B cells and CD8-positive T cells was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients had pleomorphic lymphoma with predominantly medium-sized cells and coarse granular nuclei. Another 24 patients showed pleomorphic large cell lymphoma with stippled chromatin. The remaining 10 demonstrated monomorphic large lymphoma cells with fine granular chromatin. Patients with pleomorphic lymphoma with medium-sized cells showed significantly higher serum lactate dehydrogenase and lower CD30 and C-MYC expression in lymphoma cells than the other two groups (P = .0216, P < 0.01, respectively). Patients with pleomorphic medium-sized ATLL had few usual small lymphocytes observed on routine morphological examination and showed less concurrent detection of CD20-positive B cells and CD8-positive T cells, both of which were lower than in the other two groups (P = .006, P = .019, respectively). Furthermore, ATLL patients with predominantly medium-sized lymphocytes exhibited a worse prognosis than patients with pleomorphic large cells (P = .0197). Background small lymphocytes and concurrent detection of CD20-positive B cells and CD8-positive T cells may thus be good prognostic factors (P = .011, P = .021, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Morphological features, size of neoplastic cells and background non-neoplastic lymphocyte (B cells and CD8-positive T cells) volume appear to influence the prognosis of patients with aggressive-type ATLL.",['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Kobata, Katsumi', 'Mihashi, Yasuhito', 'Nonaka, Shuichi', 'Matsumoto, Shinji', 'Kawauchi, Shigeto', 'Iwasaki, Hiroki', 'Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Takeshita, Morishige']","['Kobata K', 'Mihashi Y', 'Nonaka S', 'Matsumoto S', 'Kawauchi S', 'Iwasaki H', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Takeshita M']","['Pathology Laboratory, Fukuoka University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Otolaryngology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Pathology Laboratory, Fukuoka University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Disease, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0267-2081'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190429,England,Cytopathology,Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,9010345,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma', '*cytology', '*prognosis', '*tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes']",2019/03/26 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/03/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cyt.12693 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytopathology. 2019 Jul;30(4):402-412. doi: 10.1111/cyt.12693.

We designed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials to compare safety among TKIs (bosutinib, dasatinib, imatinib, nilotinib, ponatinib and radotinib) used by patients diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia. METHODS: We obtained data from the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and SciELO databases. The Bayesian approach was used for direct and indirect comparisons, and the treatments were ranked by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). RESULTS: Seventeen studies were included in the network meta-analysis. Our data show that dasatinib was generally considered worse than the other TKIs, with SUCRA values for 140 mg dasatinib of 90.3% for anaemia, 87.4% for leucopenia, 90.6% for neutropenia and 97.2% for thrombocytopenia. In addition, nilotinib was shown to be safer, with SUCRA values for 600 and 800 mg doses of 21.9 and 35.8% for anaemia, 23.8 and 14.6% for leucopenia, 33.0 and 17.7% for neutropenia, and 28.7 and 32.6% for thrombocytopenia, respectively. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib appeared as the least safe drug for chronic myeloid leukaemia, probably because it binds to multiple key kinase targets, being more prone to cause serious haematological adverse events. Nilotinib demonstrated a safer profile, mostly due to its selective binding capacity.",['(c) 2019 The British Pharmacological Society.'],"['Fachi, Mariana M', 'Tonin, Fernanda S', 'Leonart, Leticia P', 'Rotta, Inajara', 'Fernandez-Llimos, Fernando', 'Pontarolo, Roberto']","['Fachi MM', 'Tonin FS', 'Leonart LP', 'Rotta I', 'Fernandez-Llimos F', 'Pontarolo R']","['Pharmaceutical Sciences Postgraduate Programme, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Postgraduate Programme, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Postgraduate Programme, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Pharmacy Service, Hospital de Clinicas, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Research Institute for Medicines (iMed.ULisboa), Department of Social Pharmacy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Universidade Federal do Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5918-4738', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4262-8608', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0927-3120', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9099-7216', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8529-9595', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7049-4363']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190523,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*drug-related side effects and adverse reactions', '*network meta-analysis', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2019/03/26 06:00,2020/09/24 06:00,['2019/03/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bcp.13933 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Oct;85(10):2280-2291. doi: 10.1111/bcp.13933.

They arise from mutated clones of hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells which expand by outperforming their normal counterparts. The intracellular signaling profile of cancer cells is the sum of genetic, epigenetic and microenvironmental influences, and the multiple interconnections between different signaling pathways make pharmacological targeting complicated. OBJECTIVE: To present an overview of known somatic mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the inflammatory signaling pathways affected by them, as well as current efforts to therapeutically modulate this aberrant inflammatory signaling. METHODS: In this review, we extensively reviewed and compiled salient information with ClinicalTrials.gov as our source on ongoing studies, and PubMed as our authentic bibliographic source, using a focused review question. RESULTS: Mutations affecting immune signal transduction are present to varying extents in clonal myeloid diseases. While MPN are dominated by a few common mutations, a multitude of different genes can be mutated in MDS and AML. Mutations can also occur in asymptomatic persons, a finding called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Mutations in FLT3, JAK, STAT, CBL and RAS can lead to aberrant immune signaling. Protein kinase inhibitors are entering the clinic and are extensively investigated in clinical trials in MPN, MDS and AML. CONCLUSION: In summary, this article summarizes recent research on aberrant inflammatory signaling in clonal myeloid diseases and the clinical therapeutic potential of modulation of signal transduction and effector proteins in the affected pathways.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Azrakhsh, Nessar Ahmad', 'Mensah-Glanowska, Patrycja', 'Sand, Kristoffer', 'Kittang, Astrid Olsnes']","['Azrakhsh NA', 'Mensah-Glanowska P', 'Sand K', 'Kittang AO']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology, Jagiellonian University Medical College / University Hospital, Krakow, Poland.', 'Clinic of Medicine and Rehabilitation, More and Romsdal Hospital Trust, Alesund, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Section for Hematology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/genetics/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Clonal hematopoiesis', 'MDS', 'MDS/MPN-RS-T', 'MPN', 'immune signaling pathways', 'inflammation', 'targeting.']",2019/03/26 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-97515 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867326666190325100636 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2019;26(28):5262-5277. doi: 10.2174/0929867326666190325100636.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment is tried both as monotherapy and as a part of combined therapy. METHODS: Relevant publications were identified through literature searches in the PubMed database. We searched for (i) original articles describing the results from clinical studies of checkpoint inhibition; (ii) published articles describing the immunocompromised status of AML patients; and (iii) published studies of antileukemic immune reactivity and immunotherapy in AML. RESULTS: Studies of monotherapy suggest that checkpoint inhibition has a modest antileukemic effect and complete hematological remissions are uncommon, whereas combination with conventional chemotherapy increases the antileukemic efficiency with acceptable toxicity. The experience with a combination of different checkpoint inhibitors is limited. Thalidomide derivatives are referred to as immunomodulatory drugs and seem to reverse leukemia-induced immunosuppression, but in addition, they have direct inhibitory effects on the AML cells. The combination of checkpoint targeting and thalidomide derivatives thus represents a strategy for dual immunotargeting together with a direct antileukemic effect. CONCLUSION: Checkpoint inhibitors are now tried in AML. Experimental studies suggest that these inhibitors should be combined with immunomodulatory agents (i.e. thalidomide derivatives) and/or new targeted or conventional antileukemic treatment. Such combinations would allow dual immunotargeting (checkpoint inhibitor, immunomodulatory agents) together with a double/triple direct targeting of the leukemic cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Leufven, Eva', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Leufven E', 'Bruserud O']","['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 87, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Jonas Lies vei 87, N-5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021, Bergen, Norway.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'checkpoint inhibition', 'chemotherapy', 'immunotherapy', 'lenalidomide', 'targeted therapy.']",2019/03/26 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMC-EPUB-97514 [pii]', '10.2174/0929867326666190325095853 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2019;26(28):5244-5261. doi: 10.2174/0929867326666190325095853.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CLL, specific functional alterations have been described in circulating CD8(+) T cells, yet a global view of the CD8(+) T cell compartment phenotype and of its real impact on disease progression is presently elusive. We developed a multidimensional statistical analysis of CD8(+) T cell phenotypic marker expression based on whole blood multi-color flow-cytometry. The analysis comprises both unsupervised statistics (hClust and PCA) and supervised classification methods (Random forest, Adaboost algorithm, Decision tree learning and logistic regression) and allows to cluster patients by comparing multiple phenotypic markers expressed by CD8(+) T cells. Our results reveal a global CD8(+) T cell phenotypic signature in CLL patients that is significantly modified when compared to healthy donors. We also uncover a CD8(+) T cell signature characteristic of patients evolving toward therapy within 6 months after phenotyping. The unbiased, not predetermined and multimodal approach highlights a prominent role of the memory compartment in the prognostic signature. The analysis also reveals that imbalance of the central/effector memory compartment in CD8(+) T cells can occur irrespectively of the elapsed time after diagnosis. Taken together our results indicate that, in CLL patients, CD8(+) T cell phenotype is imprinted by disease clinical progression and reveal that CD8(+) T cell memory compartment alteration is not only a hallmark of CLL disease but also a signature of disease evolution toward the need for therapy.",,"['Gonnord, Pauline', 'Costa, Manon', 'Abreu, Arnaud', 'Peres, Michael', 'Ysebaert, Loic', 'Gadat, Sebastien', 'Valitutti, Salvatore']","['Gonnord P', 'Costa M', 'Abreu A', 'Peres M', 'Ysebaert L', 'Gadat S', 'Valitutti S']","['Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, <<Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale contre le cancer 2018>>, Universite de Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut de Mathematiques de Toulouse, UMR 5219, Universite de Toulouse, CNRS, UPS IMT, Toulouse, France.', 'Institut Roche, Boulogne-Billancourt, France.', 'Universite de Strasbourg, CNRS, ICube, Strasbourg, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, CHU de Toulouse, France and Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM UMR1037, Toulouse, France."", ""Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, ""Equipe Innovations therapeuthiques des lymphomes B"", Toulouse, France.', 'Toulouse School of Economics, Universite Toulouse 1 Capitole, UMR5604, Institut de Mathematiques, Universite Paul sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Centre de Recherches en Cancerologie de Toulouse (CRCT), INSERM U1037, <<Equipe labellisee Ligue Nationale contre le cancer 2018>>, Universite de Toulouse III-Paul Sabatier, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Pathology, Institut Universitaire du Cancer-Oncopole de Toulouse, Toulouse, France.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8712-605X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190207,United States,Oncoimmunology,Oncoimmunology,101570526,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD8+ T cells', '*chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*multidimensional phenotyping', '*phenotypic signature', '*supervised learning']",2019/03/25 06:00,2019/03/25 06:01,['2019/03/26 06:00'],"['2018/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1080/2162402X.2019.1570774 [doi]', '1570774 [pii]']",epublish,Oncoimmunology. 2019 Feb 7;8(4):e1570774. doi: 10.1080/2162402X.2019.1570774. eCollection 2019.,PMC6422371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-tumor immune responses place cancer cells under selective pressure to lose or downregulate target antigens; therefore, vaccination against virus- or host- ""driver"" oncogenes are proposed as a strategy to overcome immune escape. Herein, we demonstrate the impact of immunogenic viral antigens on anti-tumor response and immune editing in MOC2-E6E7, a syngeneic murine oral cancer cell line expressing HPV-16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins. Using orthotopic syngeneic models, we observed in vivo tumor growth kinetics of MOC2-E6E7 is delayed in immunocompetent mice compared to parental MOC2 tumors. In contrast, tumor growth remained similar in Rag1(-/-) mice lacking adaptive immunity. MOC2-E6E7 tumors demonstrated an ""inflamed"" or immune-activated tumor microenvironment and greater infiltration of CD8(+) T cells compared to MOC2. By real-time PCR, we detected downregulation of E6 and E7 genes in MOC2-E6E7 tumors only in immunocompetent mice, suggesting the loss of ectopic viral antigen expression due to immune editing. We then assessed the efficacy of a biomaterials-based mesoporous silica rod (MSR) cancer vaccine targeting HPV-16 E7 in our model. Vaccination induced robust infiltration of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells, which led to tumor growth delay and modestly prolonged survival in MOC2-E6E7 tumors. Increased efficacy was seen in a separate head and neck cancer tumor model, mEER, which obligately expresses E7 antigen.

The patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was positive for HHV-6 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), but was negative for other viral DNA. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed atrophic changes in bilateral medial temporal lobes. Following 4 weeks of ganciclovir therapy, a CSF exam was negative for HHV-6 DNA and the patient's neurological symptoms partially improved. However, she was disoriented and had severe retrograde and anterograde amnesia. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography indicated global hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobes and the fronto-parietal cortices.

Our previous report showed that autophagic activity was elevated in NPM1-mutated AML, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. Mount of study provides evidence that glycometabolic enzymes are implicated in the autophagic process. Pyruvate kinase isoenzyme M2 (PKM2), a key glycolytic enzyme, has been recently reported as a tumor supporter in leukemia. However, little is known about the roles of PKM2 in autophagic activity in NPM1-mutated AML. In this study, PKM2 highly expressed in NPM1-mutated AML, and partially, high levels of PKM2 were upregulated by PTBP1. Further experiments demonstrated that PKM2 mediated autophagic activation and increased the phosphorylation of key autophagy protein Beclin-1. Importantly, functional experiments demonstrated that PKM2 contributed to cell survival via autophagic activation. Ultimately, high PKM2 expression was associated with short overall and event-free survival time in NPM1-mutated AML patients.

Depending on the sources, tRFs can be divided into tRF-1, tRF-2, tRF-3, tRF-5, and i-tRF; tiRNAs can be divided into 5'tiRNA and 3'tiRNA. Both tRFs and tiRNAs play important roles in tumorigenesis. Some tRFs and tiRNAs promote cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by regulating the expression of oncogenes. Other tRFs and tiRNAs inhibit cancer progression. Mechanism studies have shown that tRFs and tiRNAs may bind to RNA binding proteins such as Y-box binding protein 1 (YBX1) and prevent transcription, inactivate initiation factor eIF4G/A, promote translation of ribosomal proteins, or activate aurora kinase A, the regulator of mitosis.

TKIs do not eliminate disease-propagating leukemic stem cells (LSCs), suggesting a deeper understanding of niche-dependent regulation of CML LSCs is required to eradicate disease. Cxcl12 is expressed in bone marrow niches and controls HSC maintenance, and here, we show that targeted deletion of Cxcl12 from mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) reduces normal HSC numbers but promotes LSC expansion by increasing self-renewing cell divisions, possibly through enhanced Ezh2 activity. In contrast, endothelial cell-specific Cxcl12 deletion decreases LSC proliferation, suggesting niche-specific effects. During CML development, abnormal clusters of colocalized MSCs and LSCs form but disappear upon Cxcl12 deletion. Moreover, MSC-specific deletion of Cxcl12 increases LSC elimination by TKI treatment. These findings highlight a critical role of niche-specific effects of Cxcl12 expression in maintaining quiescence of TKI-resistant LSC populations.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In view of this lacuna, we evaluated outcomes and prognostic factors for LBL treated with a uniform protocol at our center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included consecutive patients of pediatric LBL aged </=18 years from January 2003 to January 2017. Patients were staged using the St Jude staging system. All patients were treated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia like BFM90 protocol. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival analysis. A statistical model was made using stepwise regression and forward selection of the factors predicting event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Sixty-five patients were evaluated with a median age of 12 years (range, 1-18 years) and male:female ratio of 2.25:1. Fifty-four patients presented with mediastinal disease. Median follow-up was 54.57 months (range, 0.6-140.5 months). EFS at 10 years was 62 +/- 6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.73) and OS 71 +/- 5% (95% CI, 0.57-0.81). In multivariate analysis, symptom duration </=30 days, white blood cell (WBC) count >12000/microL and serum albumin </=3.5 g/dL predicted inferior EFS and OS. A prognostic model with these 3 factors suggested that those without any of these risk factors had an OS of 92 +/- 5% whereas those with 2 or 3 factors had an OS of 37 +/- 14%. CONCLUSION: Our outcomes are 15% to 20% lower than in the published literature. Low albumin level, high WBC count at baseline, and symptom duration <30 days emerged as adverse predictors for EFS and OS. These clinical predictors and prognostic model for pediatric LBL should be validated in prospective cohorts.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Currently, there are scarce data available for the Latin American population. The aim of this study was to outline the impact of ACA emergence in Mexican patients with CML. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from adult patients with CML treated with upfront imatinib between January 2001 and December 2016. Two groups were defined for comparison according to the presence or absence of ACA. RESULTS: Ninety-seven patients were included. ACAs were found in 30 patients, 20% at diagnosis and 80% during follow-up. In 90% of the patients, ACA emergence was detected in the CML-chronic phase. Regarding clinical outcomes, the complete cytogenetic response rate (16.5% vs. 59.8%; P < .001), progression-free survival (PFS) at 10 years (76% vs. 95%; P = .009), and failure-free survival (FFS) at 10 years (16% vs. 73%; P < .001) were significantly inferior in the ACA group. Multivariate analysis confirmed that ACA emergence was a deleterious independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] 8.9; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.35-58.4; P = .023) and FFS (HR 3.7; 95% CI 1.54-8.58; P = .003).

All patients had active disease before commencement of the treatment. RESULTS: Of the patients, 91.7% achieved complete remission (CR), whereas 2 patients (8.2%) died in aplasia. One-year relapse rate was 49.3%. Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 25.6%. In a subgroup of patients with HCT-comorbidity index score </= 3, NRM was 15.4%. Two-year overall survival and relapse-free survival were 30.6% and 22.6%, respectively. Incidence of grade 3 and 4 acute graft versus host disease was 21.3% and 8.3, respectively.

Many chromosome alterations that result from aberrant V(D)J recombination involve breaks at single recombination signal sequences (RSSs). A long-standing question, however, is how such breaks occur. Here, we show that the genomic DNA that is excised during recombination, the excised signal circle (ESC), forms a complex with the recombinase proteins to efficiently catalyze breaks at single RSSs both in vitro and in vivo. Following cutting, the RSS is released while the ESC-recombinase complex remains intact to potentially trigger breaks at further RSSs. Consistent with this, chromosome breaks at RSSs increase markedly in the presence of the ESC. Notably, these breaks co-localize with those found in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients and occur at key cancer driver genes. We have named this reaction ""cut-and-run"" and suggest that it could be a significant cause of lymphocyte genome instability.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

A brief description of the currently ongoing clinical trials with new drugs is also enclosed. Expert opinion: PPCL still represents a difficult challenge for all hematologists. Here the authors provide a personal view on how the current, generally unsatisfactory results in this neoplastic disorder could be improved.

In this study, we focused on the suppressive effect of cumin seed aqueous extract on degranulation in order to reveal the anti-allergic effect of cumin. Cumin seed aqueous extract significantly suppressed the antigen-induced degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3 cells in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. The extract also inhibited the elevation of the intracellular calcium ion concentration induced by antigen. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the extract suppresses phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, phospholipase C-gamma1/2, and Akt in the signaling pathways activated by antigen induction via FcepsilonRI. Furthermore, the extract suppressed microtubule formation induced by antigen. In addition, oral administration of cumin seed aqueous extract significantly suppressed the passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reaction in BALB/c mice.

Here, we review the scientific rationale and current data evaluating immune checkpoint inhibitors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RECENT FINDINGS: Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy has shown limited clinical activity in AML. Initial results from early-phase clinical trials suggest that rational combinations of immune checkpoint inhibition with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are safe and potentially more promising. There are currently no data directly comparing immune checkpoint inhibition to standard therapies. Emerging immune targets more specific for leukemia cells including LILRB4 may improve future therapeutic efficacy. The success of immune checkpoint inhibition in AML has been modest to date. However, an improved understanding of the biology and the use of rational combinations has potential to improve rates of durable responses.

This study aimed to determine the efficacy of capsule endoscopy (CE) by evaluating the correlation between inflammatory findings on CE and TRM. METHODS: The data of patients after allo-SCT were retrospectively collected. The association between findings on CE and TRM at 100 days from the CE was evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients included in the study, 47 showed inflammatory findings on CE. The findings were diagnosed as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD; n = 17), cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (n = 14), and GVHD with CMV infection (n = 16). Of the 47 patients, 13 (28%) had TRM. Endoscopic diagnoses of these TRM cases were GVHD (n = 4), CMV infection (n = 0), and GVHD with CMV infection (n = 9). In contrast, in the remaining 47 patients who showed no inflammatory findings on CE, 2 patients (4%) had TRM. The proportion of TRM was higher in patients with inflammatory findings than in those without it (28 vs. 4%, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: CE may predict TRM in patients who developed gastrointestinal symptoms after allo-SCT.","['(c) 2019 S.

Archived neonatal blood spots (NBS), collected within the first days of life, offer a means to investigate small molecules that reflect early-life exposures. Using untargeted metabolomics, we compared abundances of small-molecule features in extracts of NBS punches from 332 children that later developed ALL and 324 healthy controls. Subjects were stratified by early (1-5y) and late (6-14y) diagnosis. Mutually-exclusive sets of metabolic features - representing putative lipids and fatty acids - were associated with ALL, including 9 and 19 metabolites in the early- and late-diagnosis groups, respectively. In the late-diagnosis group, a prominent cluster of features with apparent 18:2 fatty-acid chains suggested that newborn exposure to the essential nutrient, linoleic acid, increased ALL risk. Interestingly, abundances of these putative 18:2 lipids were greater in infants who were fed formula rather than breast milk (colostrum) and increased with the mother's pre-pregnancy body mass index.

Patients receiving pazopanib for > 14 days were analyzed for safety, tolerability, and efficacy. Co-primary endpoints were cumulative response rate and reduction of bone marrow microvessel density. Twenty patients (median age 76 years, range 52-86) were treated. Fifteen had relapsed/refractory and five had newly diagnosed AML. Median ECOG performance status was 1 (range 1-3). Four patients had adverse, 15 intermediate, and 1 patient favorable cytogenetic/molecular risk (ELN 2010 criteria). The safety profile of pazopanib was as reported. The most common adverse events of any grade were gastrointestinal. Two patients achieved PR (blast reduction > 50%), 14 stable disease (SD), and 4 progressive disease. Median PFS was 65 days (95% CI 29-105). After the end of the study, 1 CRi and 1 CRp occurred on demethylating agents, and 1 CR upon alloSCT. In these patients, SD and improved general condition on pazopanib allowed therapy escalation. Median OS for the overall study population was 191 days (95% CI 87-435) and 1-year survival was 35%.

In this study, the difference in GLIE random fluctuations and its biophysical etiology in a comparison cell model of leukemic Jurkat cells and human healthy donor lymphocytes was explored. A combination of common bright field microscopy and a unique imaging dish wherein cells are individually held untethered in a picoliter volume matrix of optical chambers was used. Random GLIE fluctuations were found to be greater in malignant Jurkat cells than in benign lymphocytes, while these fluctuations correlate with intracellular vesicle Mean Square Displacement (MSD) values and are inhibited by myosin-2 and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) inhibitors. These results suggest that the incoherent active forces acting on the cytoskeleton which cause mechanical dissipative fluctuation of the cytoskeletal and related intracellular content are the biophysical cellular mechanism behind the GLIE random fluctuation results.

Activated PERK acts to limit mRNA translation, enable proper protein folding, and restore the homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum. Given that Myc activation contributes to many types of lymphoid and myeloid human leukemias, we used a mouse model to examine the importance of PERK in development and progression of Myc-induced leukemias. We found that genetic ablation of Perk does not suppress the generation of the leukemic cells in the bone marrow. However, the cell-autonomous Perk deficiency restricts the dissemination of leukemic cells into peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and vital peripheral organs. Whereas the loss of the IFNAR1 chain of type I IFN receptor stimulated leukemia, Perk ablation did not stabilize IFNAR1, suggesting that PERK stimulates the leukemic cells' dissemination in an IFNAR1-independent manner. We discuss the rationale for using PERK inhibitors against Myc-driven leukemias.

NPM1 mutations are rare in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN), and the clinical outcomes of these patients, when treated with intensive chemotherapy, are unknown. We retrospectively evaluated the clinicopathologic characteristics and the impact of therapy in 31 patients with MDS or MDS/MPN and NPM1 mutations. Next-generation sequencing was performed at diagnosis in 22 patients. Median age was 62 years (range, 19-86). Twenty-four patients (77%) had normal karyotype, and all had multilineage dysplasia. Most patients could be classified as MDS with excess blasts (19/31, 61%). NPM1 mutations were detected at a median allele frequency of 0.38 (range, 0.09-0.49). Mutation burden did not correlate with bone marrow blast frequency, and its clearance seemed to be associated with decreased morphologic dysplasia. Ten of the 31 patients (32%) received cytotoxic chemotherapy, 20 (65%) hypomethylating agents, and 1 (4%) lenalidomide.

However, its practical administration has been limited due to poor aqueous solubility and bioavailability. In this work, we developed a novel inclusion complex of thymoquinone and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin that features improved solubility and bioactivity. The drug solubility was markedly accelerated in the increasing ratio of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin to thymoquinone amount. The formation of the thymoquinone/hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex was evidenced using X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. The release behavior of the complex, as well as of their mixtures, was examined in artificial gastric (pH1.2) and intestinal (pH6.8) dissolution media. The formulated complex released the drug rapidly at the initial stage, followed by a slow release. Thermodynamic parameters DeltaH, DeltaS and DeltaG were calculated with temperatures ranging from 20 to 45 degrees C to evaluate the complexation process. The activity of the inclusion complex was evaluated on IgE-mediated allergic response in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells by monitoring key allergic mediators. The results revealed that compared with free thymoquinone, the inclusion complex more strongly inhibited the release of histamine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and interleukin-4, and was not cytotoxic at the tested thymoquinone concentrations (0.125-4mug/mL) indicating the inclusion complex possibly had better antiallergic effects. Our finding suggested that the inclusion complex achieved prolonged action and reduced side-effect of thymoquinone.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, histopathological study on the nasal biopsy was impossible due to necrotic changes. As blast cells were present in peripheral blood samples, a bone marrow biopsy was recommended in order to reach a definitive diagnosis. The possibility of an RMS in cases of bone marrow infiltration by a diffuse tumor constituted by small, round, blast-like cells mimicking acute leukemia should be assessed. Immunohistochemical staining in bone marrow biopsy and flow cytometry in aspirate samples may help to establish the diagnosis (CD45 negativity and CD56 positivity) and cytogenetic studies can be useful in identifying a RMS subtype. When clinically possible, it is desirable to await the results of the tumor immunophenotype and those of the primary mass or bone marrow biopsy to avoid possible errors of diagnosis and treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Sociedad Espanola de Anatomia Patologica.

Determination of thiopurine methyltransferase activity (TPMT), a major determinant of thiopurines toxicity, has been suggested before implementing thiopurine treatment. An ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) method was developed and validated for the quantification of TPMT enzyme activity based on the conversion of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) to 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) using S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as methyl donor in red blood cell lysates (RBC). This method was improved from a previous laborious high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, using a lower volume of injection and with a shorter runtime. After incubation and protein precipitation 6-MMP was separated on a HSS-T3 (2.1x50mm, 1.8mum) column and monitored by UV detection (290nm). A change on the organic solvent used to dissolve 6-MP resulted in a reduction of interference by endogenous or non-enzymatic methylated 6-MMP. A full validation of the 6-MMP assay was performed according to the FDA and EMA guidelines. The method was linear from 0.125 to 2nmol/mL, with acceptable values of accuracy and precision. The method was applied in 106 patients treated with thiopurines whose TPMT activity was previously quantified by HPLC.

As a B-Raf degrader, compound 2 can accelerate the degradation of B-Raf by recruiting ubiquitin-proteasome system, and further affects the expression of Mcl-1, a downstream protein of B-Raf. The anticancer mechanism of compound 2 is quite different from its mother compound and cancer cells seem to be more sensitive to the degrader, hinting that degradation of B-Raf by PROTAC is a potential way for cancer treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here we show that the histone H3.3 chaperone HIRA (histone cell cycle regulator) associates with promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) to stimulate the induction of innate immune defences against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection. Following the activation of innate immune signalling, HIRA localized at PML-NBs in a Janus-Associated Kinase (JAK), Cyclin Dependent Kinase (CDK), and Sp100-dependent manner. RNA-seq analysis revealed that HIRA promoted the transcriptional upregulation of a broad repertoire of host genes that regulate innate immunity to HSV-1 infection, including those involved in MHC-I antigen presentation, cytokine signalling, and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. ChIP-seq analysis revealed that PML, the principle scaffolding protein of PML-NBs, was required for the enrichment of HIRA onto ISGs, identifying a role for PML in the HIRA-dependent regulation of innate immunity to virus infection. Our data identifies independent roles for HIRA in the intrinsic silencing of viral gene expression and the induction of innate immune defences to restrict the initiation and propagation of HSV-1 infection, respectively. These intracellular host defences are antagonized by the HSV-1 ubiquitin ligase ICP0, which disrupts the stable recruitment of HIRA to infecting viral genomes and PML-NBs at spatiotemporally distinct phases of infection. Our study highlights the importance of histone chaperones to regulate multiple phases of intracellular immunity to virus infection, findings that are likely to be highly pertinent in the cellular restriction of many clinically important viral pathogens.",,"['McFarlane, Steven', 'Orr, Anne', 'Roberts, Ashley P E', 'Conn, Kristen L', 'Iliev, Victor', 'Loney, Colin', 'da Silva Filipe, Ana', 'Smollett, Katherine', 'Gu, Quan', 'Robertson, Neil', 'Adams, Peter D', 'Rai, Taranjit Singh', 'Boutell, Chris']","['McFarlane S', 'Orr A', 'Roberts APE', 'Conn KL', 'Iliev V', 'Loney C', 'da Silva Filipe A', 'Smollett K', 'Gu Q', 'Robertson N', 'Adams PD', 'Rai TS', 'Boutell C']","['MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Veterinary Microbiology, Western College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatoon, CA.', 'Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, CA.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.', 'Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, San Diego, CA, United States of America.', 'Northern Ireland Centre for Stratified Medicine, Biomedical Sciences Research Institute, Ulster University, Londonderry, United Kingdom.', 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research (CVR), Garscube Campus, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3639-7209', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8701-6181', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9509-1157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7276-7492', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2970-7785']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190322,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (HIRA protein, human)', '0 (Histone Chaperones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*immunology/virology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*immunology/metabolism/virology', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*pathogenicity', 'Histone Chaperones/genetics/*metabolism', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",,,2019/03/23 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1007667 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-18-01955 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2019 Mar 22;15(3):e1007667. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007667. eCollection 2019 Mar.,PMC6472835,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['MC_UU_12014/12/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12014/5/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little evidence has been provided regarding how nonmetropolitan residence may influence clinical trial enrollment for AYAs with cancer. This study sought to determine whether AYAs from nonmetropolitan areas have lower rates of clinical trial enrollment than their urban counterparts and to examine factors associated with enrollment variation. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Institute's 2006 and 2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Patterns of Care AYA cohorts were analyzed. Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcoma were included (n = 3155). Urban influence codes were used to measure the rurality of the county of residence at diagnosis, which was categorized as large metropolitan, small metropolitan, or nonmetropolitan. Logistic regression compared trial participants and nonparticipants while adjusting for patient and provider factors. RESULTS: Compared with AYAs from large metropolitan counties, AYAs from small metropolitan (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-2.64) or nonmetropolitan counties (OR, 1.86; 95% CI, 1.23-2.81) experienced greater trial enrollment. AYAs treated at a hospital with a residency program (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.63-3.16) or by a pediatric oncologist (OR, 4.02; 95% CI, 3.03-5.32) were associated with greater enrollment. There was a significant interaction between rurality and hospital size, which had the greatest impact on nonmetropolitan enrollment.

Methods: All Norwegian YACSs (N = 3558) diagnosed at ages 19-39 years and treated between 1985 and 2009 for breast or colorectal cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or melanoma, and alive in 2015, were mailed a questionnaire. The response rate was 42%. For treatment, a minimal surgery-only group (N = 198) was defined as reference group, and 1000 YACSs represented the local, systemic, and systemic plus other treatment groups. Work status was compared with normative data. Results: The sample included 63% females. Median age at survey was 49 years (range 27-65), and median time since first cancer diagnosis was 16 years (range 6-31). At survey, 25% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 22-27) of YACSs were nonemployed, and 38% (95% CI: 35-41) reported low work ability. The rate of being nonemployed was similar to normative data. More female YACSs held disability pension compared with normative data. In multivariable analyses, an increasing number of adverse effects (AEs), cardiovascular diseases, lower basic education, reduced level of self-rated health, and increased level of depression were significantly associated with both being nonemployed and having low work ability. Conclusions: In YACSs surveyed at median 49 years of age, 25% were nonemployed and 38% had low current work ability.

Ninety-eight young adults (range: 21-60 years; median: 49 years) with CK/MK AML were studied. They received standard induction, consolidation and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from siblings or matched unrelated donors if available. Chromosomal abnormalities most commonly affected chromosome 5 (30%), 7 (22%) and 17 (21%). Next generation sequencing of a 54-myeloid gene panel were available in 76 patients. Tumor protein 53 (TP53) mutations were most common (49%) and associated with the presence of -5/5q- (P < .001) and -17/17p- (P < .001), but not -7/7q- (P = .370). This ""typical"" CK/MK AML subtype was associated with significantly lower presenting white cell counts, higher number of karyotypic abnormalities, and inferior leukemia-free and overall survivals, compared with CK/MK AML without the typical features. Blood or bone marrow samples from typical CK/MK AML patients showed defective p53 signaling upon induction by etoposide. In vitro drug sensitivity analysis showed that they were sensitive to APR-246 that targeted mutant p53, but resistant to MDM2 antagonist MI-77301. Novel therapeutic strategies targeting TP53 mutations in CK/MK AML should be developed and tested in clinical trials.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Leung, Garret M K', 'Zhang, Chunxiao', 'Ng, Nelson K L', 'Yang, Ning', 'Lam, Stephen S Y', 'Au, Chun H', 'Chan, Tsun L', 'Ma, Edmond S K', 'Tsui, Sze P', 'Ip, Ho W', 'So, Jason C C', 'Ng, Margaret H L', 'Cheng, Kelvin C K', 'Wong, Kit F', 'Siu, Lisa L P', 'Yip, Sze F', 'Lin, Shek Y', 'Lau, June S M', 'Luk, Tsan H', 'Lee, Harold K K', 'Lau, Chi K', 'Kho, Bonnie', 'Kwong, Yok L', 'Leung, Anskar Y H']","['Leung GMK', 'Zhang C', 'Ng NKL', 'Yang N', 'Lam SSY', 'Au CH', 'Chan TL', 'Ma ESK', 'Tsui SP', 'Ip HW', 'So JCC', 'Ng MHL', 'Cheng KCK', 'Wong KF', 'Siu LLP', 'Yip SF', 'Lin SY', 'Lau JSM', 'Luk TH', 'Lee HKK', 'Lau CK', 'Kho B', 'Kwong YL', 'Leung AYH']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Pathology, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine and Geriatrics, United Christian Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Tseung Kwan O Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Medicine, Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2450-7629', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9975-8687']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190416,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['*Abnormal Karyotype', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', '*Chromosomes, Human/genetics/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', '*Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,,2019/03/23 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25469 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Jun;94(6):650-657. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25469.

The majority of childhood AML patients do not harbor fusion genes or mutations applicable as MRD markers and overexpression of Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) may constitute a useful monitoring target. However, age-specific reference values in healthy hematopoiesis and standardization of WT1 assessment are prerequisites for clinical utility. PROCEDURE: We investigated WT1 expression across age in hematologically healthy controls (n = 109), during suspected infection (n = 90) and bone marrow (BM) regeneration (n = 13). WT1 expression in AML at diagnosis (n = 91) and during follow-up (n = 30) was compared with age-specific reference values. RESULTS: WT1 expression correlated with age and showed higher levels in both BM and peripheral blood (PB) in children compared with adults (P < 0.001 and P = 0.01). WT1 expression from healthy hematopoiesis was lower in PB compared with BM (WT1BM /WT1PB = 8.6, 95% CI: 5.3-13.7) and not influenced by infection nor BM regeneration. At AML diagnosis, 66% had more than 20-fold WT1 overexpression in PB or BM (PB 74%; BM 45%). WT1 was quantified in 279 PB samples during follow-up. All 11 patients with PB sampling within 4 months of disease recurrence displayed WT1 overexpression by a median of 1.9 months (range, 0.7-9.7) before hematological relapse. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines child-specific reference values for WT1 expression in healthy hematopoiesis and demonstrates that WT1 expression in PB is a useful post-treatment monitoring tool in childhood AML. Based on these observations, we propose definitions for childhood AML molecular relapse using WT1 overexpression.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lovvik Juul-Dam, Kristian', 'Guldborg Nyvold, Charlotte', 'Valerhaugen, Helen', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Beier Ommen, Hans']","['Lovvik Juul-Dam K', 'Guldborg Nyvold C', 'Valerhaugen H', 'Zeller B', 'Lausen B', 'Hasle H', 'Beier Ommen H']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Hematology-Pathology Research Laboratory, Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Pathology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0028-8115'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190321,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Reference Values', 'WT1 Proteins/blood/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Wilms tumor gene 1', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*measurable residual disease', '*pediatric hematology', '*relapse']",2019/03/23 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27671 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27671. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27671.

The early post-treatment phase is an especially unique time of adjustment. The primary aim of this review was to identify and synthesise research on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for patients up to five years post-treatment. The secondary aim was to identify if theorised risk/resistance model factors could explain any variance in reported HRQoL. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review using the PRISMA guidelines across five databases: Embase, Medline, Psychinfo, Pubmed, and Cochrane. Only studies examining HRQoL up to five years post-treatment were included. Studies were excluded if they covered periods greater than five years post-treatment or did not differentiate between patients with ALL and other cancers. After assessing the quality of each study sample size, patient characteristics, HRQoL outcomes and HRQoL correlates were extracted and summarised. RESULTS: A total of 14 studies representing 1254 paediatric patients, aged 2-18 years, were found. HRQoL findings were mixed, dependent on time since completion and comparison group. Patient HRQoL was mostly lower compared to normative data, whilst higher compared to healthy control groups, patients on treatment, and patients with other types of cancers. Lower HRQoL was also found to be associated with demographic (age and sex), family dysfunction, and treatment-related factors. CONCLUSIONS: Completing treatment signalled a significant improvement in HRQoL for patients compared to being on treatment. Overall, however, HRQoL was still significantly lower than the population during the early post-treatment period.",,"['Garas, Andrew', 'McLean, Louise A', 'De Luca, Cinzia R', 'Downie, Peter', 'McCarthy, Maria C']","['Garas A', 'McLean LA', 'De Luca CR', 'Downie P', 'McCarthy MC']","['Faculty of Education - Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia. andrew.garas@monash.edu.', 'Faculty of Education - Monash University, 19 Ancora Imparo Way, Clayton, Victoria, 3800, Australia.', ""Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Australia."", ""Monash Children's Hospital and Department of Paediatrics, Monash University, Clayton, Australia."", ""Clinical Sciences, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Parkville, Australia.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1614-5012'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",20190321,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*psychology', 'Quality of Life/*psychology']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'Health-related quality of life', 'Paediatric cancer', 'Post-treatment completion', 'Systematic review']",2019/03/23 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-019-04747-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-019-04747-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Nov;27(11):4341-4351. doi: 10.1007/s00520-019-04747-8.

EBV was first identified as an oncogenic virus in a Burkitt lymphoma cell line, though subsequently has been found to drive a variety of malignancies, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and other lymphoma subtypes. EBV has a tropism for B-lymphocytes and has the unique ability to exist in a latent state, evading the host immune response. In cases of impaired cell mediated immunity, as in patients with advanced age or iatrogenic immune suppression, the virus is able to proliferate in an unregulated fashion, expressing viral antigens that predispose to transformation. EBV-positive DLBCL not otherwise specified, which has been included as a revised provisional entity in the 2016 WHO classification of lymphoid malignancies, is thought to commonly occur in older patients with immunosenescence. Similarly, it is well-established that iatrogenic immune suppression, occurring in both transplant and non-transplant settings, can predispose to EBV-driven lymphoproliferative disorders. EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders are heterogeneous, with variable clinical features and prognoses depending on the context in which they arise. While DLBCL is the most common subtype, other histologic variants, including Burkitt lymphoma, NK/T-cell lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma can occur. Research aimed at understanding the underlying biology and disease prevention strategies in EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases are ongoing. Additionally, personalized treatment approaches, such as immunotherapy and adoptive T-cell therapies, have yielded encouraging results, though randomized trials are needed to further define optimal management.",,"['Crombie, Jennifer L', 'LaCasce, Ann S']","['Crombie JL', 'LaCasce AS']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, United States.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190307,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Burkitt leukemia/lymphoma (BL)', 'DLBCL', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'PTLD', 'ebv', 'lymphoma', 'post-transplant lymphomatous disorder']",2019/03/23 06:00,2019/03/23 06:01,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00109 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Mar 7;9:109. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00109. eCollection 2019.,PMC6416204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PLK1 overexpression is correlated with tumourigenesis and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Therefore, the identification of novel compounds that inhibit PLK1 would provide attractive therapeutic approaches. Although some PLK1 kinase inhibitors have been developed, their application has been limited by off-target effects. PLK1 contains a regulatory domain named the Polo-box domain (PBD), which is characteristic only for the Polo-like kinase family. This domain represents an alternative therapeutic target with higher selectivity for PLK1. In this study, we applied in silico virtual drug screening, fluorescence polarization and microscale thermophoresis to identify new scaffolds targeting the PBD of PLK1. One compound, 3-{[(1R,9S)-3-(naphthalen-2-yl)-6-oxo-7,11-diazatricyclo[7.3.1.0(2),(7)]trideca-2 ,4-dien-11-yl]methyl}benzonitrile (designated compound (1)), out of a total of 30,793 natural product derivatives, inhibited the PLK1 PBD with high selectivity (IC50: 17.9+/-0.5microM). This compound inhibited the growth of cultured leukaemia cells (CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000) and arrested the cell cycle in the G2/M phase, which is characteristic for PLK1 inhibitors. Immunofluorescence analyses showed that treatment with compound (1) disrupted spindle formation due to the aberrant localization of PLK1 during the mitotic process, leading to G2/M arrest and ultimately cell death. In conclusion, compound (1) is a selective PLK1 inhibitor that inhibits cancer cell growth. It represents a chemical scaffold for the future synthesis of new selective PLK1 inhibitors for cancer therapy.",,"['Abdelfatah, Sara', 'Berg, Angela', 'Bockers, Madeleine', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Abdelfatah S', 'Berg A', 'Bockers M', 'Efferth T']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Leipzig University, Institute of Organic Chemistry Johannisallee 29, 04103 Leipzig, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55128, Germany.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Institute of Pharmacy and Biochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55128, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181031,Egypt,J Adv Res,Journal of advanced research,101546952,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CAMKK2, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2', 'CDK, cyclin-dependent kinase', 'Cell cycle', 'IC50, 50% inhibition concentration', 'LK, Polo-like kinase', 'Natural products', 'Neoplasms', 'PBD, Polo-box domain', 'PC, Polo-box cap', 'PyRx', 'Targeted chemotherapy', 'Virtual drug screening']",2019/03/23 06:00,2019/03/23 06:01,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/27 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jare.2018.10.002 [doi]', 'S2090-1232(18)30107-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Adv Res. 2018 Oct 31;16:145-156. doi: 10.1016/j.jare.2018.10.002. eCollection 2019 Mar.,PMC6412170,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Active clustering of supernumerary centrosomes enables the formation of a functional bipolar spindle that is competent to complete a bipolar division. Disruption of spindle pole clustering in cancer cells promotes multipolar division and generation of non-proliferative daughter cells with compromised viability. Hence molecular pathways required for spindle pole clustering in cells with supernumerary centrosomes, but dispensable in normal cells, are promising therapeutic targets. Here we demonstrate that Aurora A kinase activity is required for spindle pole clustering in cells with extra centrosomes. While cells with two centrosomes are ultimately able to build a bipolar spindle and proceed through a normal cell division in the presence of Aurora A inhibition, cells with supernumerary centrosomes form multipolar and disorganized spindles that are not competent for chromosome segregation. Instead, following a prolonged mitosis, these cells experience catastrophic divisions that result in grossly aneuploid, and non-proliferative daughter cells. Aurora A inhibition in a panel of Acute Myeloid Leukemia cancer cells has a similarly disparate impact on cells with supernumerary centrosomes, suggesting that centrosome number and spindle polarity may serve as predictive biomarkers for response to therapeutic approaches that target Aurora A kinase function.",,"['Navarro-Serer, Bernat', 'Childers, Eva P', 'Hermance, Nicole M', 'Mercadante, Dayna', 'Manning, Amity L']","['Navarro-Serer B', 'Childers EP', 'Hermance NM', 'Mercadante D', 'Manning AL']","['Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester, MA, USA.', 'Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Department of Biology and Biotechnology, Worcester, MA, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190226,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Aurora A', 'alisertib', 'centriole', 'centrosome', 'spindle']",2019/03/23 06:00,2019/03/23 06:01,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.26714 [doi]', '26714 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Feb 26;10(17):1649-1659. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.26714. eCollection 2019 Feb 26.,PMC6422193,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing financial', 'interests in relation to the work described herein.']",['R00 CA182731/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Material and methods: The material was obtained from the database of the National Health Fund. This publication presents a comparison of the incidence of new malignancies in rural and urban populations of diabetic patients in Poland based on the database of the National Health Fund for the period between 1.05.2008 and 30.09.2014. Results: Comparison of the mean incidence of selected malignancies in diabetic patients in the population analysed indicated significant differences between the incidence rate in the urban and rural populations (p < 0.001). The mean incidence of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, brain tumours and leukaemia in both sexes was significantly higher in rural areas compared to urban. The mean incidence of oesophageal cancer and pancreatic cancer in females was significantly higher among in the urban population compared to the rural areas (p < 0.001). No differences in the incidence rate of these neoplasms were observed in men (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The incidence of gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, testicular cancer, kidney cancer, lung cancer, lymphocytic leukaemia and myeloid leukaemia is higher in diabetic males in rural areas than the incidence in the urban population.

RESULTS: ALC did not correlate with steroid response and CR. Median (range) ALC at the end of induction was significantly higher in patients who were MRD negative compared to MRD positive [1.24 (0.12, 6.69) vs 0.62 (0.15, 0.87); P=0.03], respectively.

The roles of USP39 in human cancer have been widely investigated. However, the roles of USP39 in human leukemia and the underlying mechanism remain unknown. Here we reported the function of USP39 in human leukemia. We observed that the expression of USP39 was up-regulated in human leukemia cells and the high expression of USP39 was correlated with poor survival of the patients with leukemia. Lentivirus-mediated knockdown of USP39 repressed the proliferation and colony formation of human leukemia cell lines HL-60 and Jurkat cells. Mechanism study showed that USP39 knockdown induced the arrest of cell cycle and apoptosis of leukemia cells. In addition, our microarray and bioinformatic analysis demonstrated that USP39 regulated diverse cellular signaling pathways that were involved in tumor biology, and several pivotal genes (IRF1, Caspase 8, and SP1) have been validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Knockdown or IRF1 partially restored the proliferation rate of leukemia cells with USP39 knockdown.

From embryonic stages to adulthood, BQ exposure suppressed erythroid and lymphoid hematopoiesis but led to abnormal accumulation of myeloid cells and precursors, which resembles benzene-induced cytopenia and myeloid dysplasia in humans. This myeloid expansion is caused by granulocyte, but not macrophage, lineage, emphasizing the significant role of lineage specificity in BQ-mediated hematopoietic toxicity. Analysis of the c-myb (also known as myb)-deficient mutant cmyb(hkz3) revealed that BQ induced neutrophilia in a c-myb-dependent manner, demonstrating that c-myb is a key intrinsic mediator of BQ hematotoxicity. Our study reveals that BQ causes lineage-specific hematotoxicity in zebrafish from embryonic stages to adulthood. Since c-myb is indispensable for BQ to induce neutrophilia, c-myb could serve as a potential drug target for reversing BQ hematotoxicity.",['(c) 2019.

Mylotarg was designated as an orphan medicinal product on October 18, 2000. The applicant for this medicinal product was Pfizer Limited (marketing authorization now held by Pfizer Europe MA EEIG).The demonstrated benefit with Mylotarg is improvement in event-free survival. This has been shown in the pivotal ALFA-0701 (MF-3) study. In addition, an individual patient data meta-analysis from five randomized controlled trials (3,325 patients) showed that the addition of Mylotarg significantly reduced the risk of relapse (odds ratio [OR] 0.81; 95% CI: 0.73-0.90; p = .0001), and improved overall survival at 5 years (OR 0.90; 95% CI: 0.82-0.98; p = .01) [Lancet Oncol 2014;15:986-996]. The most common (>30%) side effects of Mylotarg when used together with daunorubicin and cytarabine are hemorrhage and infection.The full indication is as follows: ""Mylotarg is indicated for combination therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of patients age 15 years and above with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML), except acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).""The objective of this article is to summarize the scientific review done by the CHMP of the application leading to regulatory approval in the European Union. The full scientific assessment report and product information, including the Summary of Product Characteristics, are available on the European Medicines Agency website (www.ema.europa.eu). IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article reflects the scientific assessment of Mylotarg (gemtuzumab ozogamicin; Pfizer, New York City, NY) use for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia based on important contributions from the rapporteur and co-rapporteur assessment teams, Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use members, and additional experts following the application for a marketing authorization from the company.

STAT3 mutations are often absent in typical T-LGLL, suggesting that in a significant fraction of patients, antigen-driven expansion alone can maintain LGL clone persistence. We set out to determine the relationship between activating STAT3 hits and CTL clonal selection at presentation and in response to therapy. Thus, a group of patients with T-LGLL were serially subjected to deep next-generation sequencing (NGS) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) and STAT3 to recapitulate clonal hierarchy and dynamics. The results of this complex analysis demonstrate that STAT3 mutations produce either a sweeping or linear subclone within a monoclonal CTL population either early or during the course of disease. Therapy can extinguish a LGL clone, silence it, or adapt mechanisms to escape elimination. LGL clones can persist on elimination of STAT3 subclones, and alternate STAT3-negative CTL clones can replace therapy-sensitive CTL clones. LGL clones can evolve and are fueled by a nonextinguished antigenic drive. STAT3 mutations can accelerate this process or render CTL clones semiautonomous and not reliant on physiologic stimulation.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kerr, Cassandra M', 'Clemente, Michael J', 'Chomczynski, Peter W', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej', 'Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Adema, Vera', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Lichtin, Alan E', 'Mustjoki, Satu', 'Radivoyevitch, Tomas', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Kerr CM', 'Clemente MJ', 'Chomczynski PW', 'Przychodzen B', 'Nagata Y', 'Adema V', 'Visconte V', 'Lichtin AE', 'Mustjoki S', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Sekeres MA', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Helsinki, Finland; and.', 'Quantitative Health Sciences Department, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research and.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0816-8241'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology']",,,2019/03/23 06:00,2020/03/28 06:00,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018027862 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018027862 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Mar 26;3(6):917-921. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018027862.,PMC6436009,,"['R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123904/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL132071/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, studies showed that the bone marrow microenvironment plays a role in FLT3 TKI resistance, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We recently identified a previously undescribed mechanism by which the bone marrow microenvironment can contribute to drug resistance: expression of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs). In fact, bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) expressed most CYPs, including CYP3A4. Because hepatic CYP3A4 plays a role in the inactivation of several FLT3 TKIs, we explored the potential role of CYP3A4 in bone marrow microenvironment-mediated FLT3 TKI resistance. We found that CYP3A4 plays a major role in BMSC-mediated inhibition in the activity of 3 different FLT3 TKIs (sorafenib, quizartinib, and gilteritinib) against FLT3/ITD acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Furthermore, clarithromycin, a clinically active CYP3A4 inhibitor, significantly reversed the protective effects of BMSCs. We show, for the first time, that bone marrow stromal CYP3A4 contributes to FLT3 TKI resistance in the bone marrow. These results suggest that combining FLT3 TKIs with CYP3A4 inhibitors could be a promising strategy toward improving the activity of FLT3 TKIs.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Chang, Yu-Ting', 'Hernandez, Daniela', 'Alonso, Salvador', 'Gao, Minling', 'Su, Meng', 'Ghiaur, Gabriel', 'Levis, Mark J', 'Jones, Richard J']","['Chang YT', 'Hernandez D', 'Alonso S', 'Gao M', 'Su M', 'Ghiaur G', 'Levis MJ', 'Jones RJ']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Graduate Program in Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Graduate Program in Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Graduate Program in Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Graduate Program in Pathobiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/metabolism/*physiology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,2019/03/23 06:00,2020/03/28 06:00,['2019/03/23 06:00'],"['2018/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018022921 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018022921 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Mar 26;3(6):908-916. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018022921.,PMC6436013,,"['P01 CA015396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that has been described in various biological systems and pathogenic processes. However, the immune mechanisms in response to circRNAs remain unknown. In this study, high-throughput transcriptome sequencing was used to detect circRNAs present in chicken macrophage (HD11) and chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infected with ALV-J. We identified 7684 circRNAs from diverse genomic locations in CEF and HD11 after ALV-J infection, these RNAs showed complex expression patterns that differed based on the cells type and infection time. In total, 302 differentially expressed (DE) circRNAs and 164 DE circRNAs were identified in CEF and HD11 after ALV-J infection, respectively. CircRNA7419-associated with KDM4C- and circRNA6679 and circRNA6680-associated with TNFAIP6- were involved in the immune response upon ALV-J infection in CEF. Host genes were analyzed through further bioinformatics analysis. The result confirmed that a large number of DE circRNAs corresponded to several immune-associated or tumor-associated terms and pathways, such as Mucin type O-Glycan biosynthesis, MAPK signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling, and Wnt signaling pathway in CEF, as well as Jak-STAT signaling pathway, apoptosis, and MAPK signaling pathway in HD11. CircRNAs related to the B cell receptor signaling pathway in CEF, and the Jak-STAT signaling pathway in HD11, were selected for circRNA-miRNA interaction network analyses. Our study indicates that circRNAs expression was altered by ALV-J infection in both CEF and HD11, and may play a key role in the progression of ALV-J infection.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In recent times, attention has been focused on the use of murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based replication-competent retroviral (RCR) vectors. RCR vectors have been shown to achieve efficient tumor reduction in a wide variety of cancer models. Most RCR vectors have been developed from amphotropic 4070 A MLV env, which is broadly applied in basic research. In this study, we generated RCR vectors based on Moloney MLV by replacing the native env gene in a full-length viral genome with the 10A1 env gene. 10A1 MLV can infect a wide variety of cells. Unlike amphotropic MLV, the 10A1 MLV can use amphotropic MLV receptor Pit2 or gibbon ape leukemia virus (GaLV) receptor Pit1. The resulting construct MoMLV-10A1-EGFP was able to replicate in 293 T, NIH3T3, and Mus dunni cells. To evaluate the potential of MoMLV-10A1 vector as a therapeutic agent, we incorporated the yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) suicide gene into vectors. The resulting vector MoMLV-10A1-CD could inhibit the growth of human 293T cells upon 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) administration. In addition, to lyse tumor cells by syncytium, MoMLV-10A1-R(-)-EGFP was generated by replacing wild-type 10A1 env with the 16-amino acid R peptide-truncated 10A1 env gene. Syncytium formation was observed in the TE671 human tumor cells, 293 T and PG13 cells upon transfection of the MoMLV-10A1-R(-)-EGFP vector. This result suggests that replication of this vector could be oncolytic in itself. We also found that syncytium could contribute to enhance cell-to-cell transmission of the retroviral vectors. Our results thus show that the MoMLV-10A1 vectors can be potentially useful for cancer gene therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of our study was to identify patients with higher infectious risk at the beginning of azacitidine treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective evaluation of 298 MDS/CMML/AML patients and included in the analysis 232 patients who completed the first 3 cycles of azacitidine therapy or developed Grade III/IV infection before completing the third cycle. RESULTS: Overall, 143 patients (62%) experienced serious infection, and in 94 patients (41%) infection occurred within the first 3 cycles. The following variables were found to have the most significant effect on the infectious risk in multivariate analysis: red blood cell transfusion dependency (odds ratio [OR], 2.38; 97.5% confidence interval [CI], 1.21-4.79), neutropenia <0.8 x 10(9)/L (OR, 3.03; 97.5% CI, 1.66-5.55), platelet count <50 x 10(9)/L (OR, 2.63; 97.5% CI, 1.42-4.76), albumin level <35 g/dL (OR, 2.04; 97.5% CI, 1.01-4.16), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status >/=2 (OR, 2.19; 97.5% CI, 1.40-3.54). Each of these variables is assigned 1 point, and the combined score represents the proposed Azacitidine Infection Risk Model. The infection rate in the first 3 cycles of therapy in lower-risk (0-2 score) and higher-risk (3-5 score) patients was 25% and 73%, respectively. The overall survival was significantly reduced in higher-risk patients compared with the lower-risk cohort (8 vs. 29 months). CONCLUSION: We selected a subset with high early risk for serious infection and worse clinical outcome among patients treated with azacitidine.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We have previously shown that Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM3) kinase decreased hepatoblastoma tumorigenicity. We sought to determine the effect of PIM3 overexpression on hepatoblastoma cells and whether expression of PIM3 correlated with patient/tumor characteristics or survival. METHODS: The hepatoblastoma cell line, HuH6, and patient-derived xenograft, COA67, were utilized. Viability, proliferation, migration, sphere formation, and tumor growth in mice were assessed in PIM3-overexpressing cells. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PIM3 on patient samples. Correlation between stain score and clinical/pathologic characteristics was assessed. RESULTS: PIM3 overexpression rescued the anti-proliferative effect observed with PIM3 knockdown. Sphere formation was increased in PIM3 overexpressing cells. Cells with PIM3 overexpression yielded larger tumors than those with empty vector. Seventy-four percent of samples expressed PIM3. There was no statistical difference in patient characteristics between subjects with strong versus weak PIM3 staining, but patients with strong PIM3 staining had decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: PIM3 expression plays a role in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis. PIM3 was present in the majority of hepatoblastomas and higher PIM3 expression correlated with decreased survival. PIM3 warrants investigation as a therapeutic target and prognostic marker for hepatoblastoma.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence, trends and outcomes of IFD in all haematology-oncology patients by linking Victorian hospital data to state-based registries. METHODS: Episodes of IFD complicating adult haematological malignancy (HM) and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) patients admitted to Victorian hospitals from 1(st) July 2005 to 30(th) June 2016 were extracted from the Victorian Admitted Episodes Dataset and linked to the date of HM diagnosis from the Victorian Cancer Registry and mortality from the Victorian Death Index. Descriptive analyses and regression modelling were used. RESULTS: There were 619,702 inpatient-episodes among 32,815 HM and 1,765 HSCT-patients. IFD occurring twelve-months from HM-diagnosis was detected in 669 (2.04%) HM-patients and 111 (6.29%) HSCT-recipients, respectively. Median time to IFD-diagnosis was 3, 5, 15 and 22 months in acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma, respectively.

HTLV-1 is the causative agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-1 associated myopathy/tropic spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). HTLV-1 expresses several regulatory and accessory genes that function at different stages of the virus life cycle. The regulatory gene Tax-1 is required for efficient virus replication, as it drives transcription of viral gene products, and has also been demonstrated to play a key role in the pathogenesis of the virus. Several studies have identified a PDZ binding motif (PBM) at the carboxyl terminus of Tax-1 and demonstrated the importance of this domain for HTLV-1 induced cellular transformation. Using a mass spectrometry-based proteomics approach we identified sorting nexin 27 (SNX27) as a novel interacting partner of Tax-1. Further, we demonstrated that their interaction is mediated by the Tax-1 PBM and SNX27 PDZ domains. SNX27 has been shown to promote the plasma membrane localization of glucose transport 1 (GLUT1), one of the receptor molecules of the HTLV-1 virus, and the receptor molecule required for HTLV-1 fusion and entry. We postulated that Tax-1 alters GLUT1 localization via its interaction with SNX27. We demonstrate that over expression of Tax-1 in cells causes a reduction of GLUT1 on the plasma membrane. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of SNX27 results in increased virion release and decreased HTLV-1 infectivity. Collectively, we demonstrate the first known mechanism by which HTLV-1 regulates a receptor molecule post-infection.",,"['Al-Saleem, Jacob', 'Dirksen, Wessel P', 'Martinez, Michael P', 'Shkriabai, Nikoloz', 'Kvaratskhelia, Mamuka', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Green, Patrick L']","['Al-Saleem J', 'Dirksen WP', 'Martinez MP', 'Shkriabai N', 'Kvaratskhelia M', 'Ratner L', 'Green PL']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center and Solove Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8929-7098', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9207-2065', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2744-7294', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0204-562X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190321,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (SLC2A1 protein, human)', '0 (SNX27 protein, human)', '0 (Sorting Nexins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/*physiology', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HTLV-I Infections/genetics/physiopathology/virology', 'Host Microbial Interactions/genetics/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'PDZ Domains', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Sorting Nexins/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Virulence/genetics/physiology', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/physiology']",,,2019/03/22 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0214059 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-06509 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 21;14(3):e0214059. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0214059. eCollection 2019.,PMC6428263,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

MR level determination is dependent on the sensitivity of the monitoring technique. Here, we compared a newly established TaqMan (TM) and our so far routinely used LightCycler (LC) quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR systems for their ability to achieve the best possible sensitivity in BCR-ABL1 monitoring. We have comparatively analyzed RNA samples from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 92 randomly chosen patients with CML resembling major molecular remission (MMR) or better and of 128 CML patients after treatment cessation (EURO-SKI stopping trial). While our LC system utilized ABL1, the TM system is based on GUSB as reference gene. We observed 99% concordance with respect to achievement of MMR. However, we found that 34 of the 92 patients monitored by TM/GUSB were re-classified to the next inferior MR log level, especially when LC/ABL1-based results were borderline to thresholds. Thirteen patients BCR-ABL1 negative in LC/ABL1 became positive after TM/GUSB analysis. In the 128 patients included in the EURO-SKI trial identical molecular findings were achieved for 114 patients. However, 14 patients were re-classified to the next inferior log-level by the TM/GUSB combination. Eight of these patients relapsed after treatment cessation; two of them were re-classified from MR4 to MMR and therefore did not meet inclusion criteria anymore. In conclusion, we consider both methods as comparable and interchangeable in terms of achievement of MMR and of longitudinal evaluation of clinical courses. However, in LC/ABL1 negative samples, slightly enhanced TM/GUSB sensitivity may lead to inferior classification of clinical samples in the context of TFR.",,"['Spiess, Birgit', 'Rinaldetti, Sebastien', 'Naumann, Nicole', 'Galuschek, Norbert', 'Kossak-Roth, Ute', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Tarnopolscaia, Irina', 'Rose, Diana', 'Voskanyan, Astghik', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Saussele, Susanne', 'Seifarth, Wolfgang']","['Spiess B', 'Rinaldetti S', 'Naumann N', 'Galuschek N', 'Kossak-Roth U', 'Wuchter P', 'Tarnopolscaia I', 'Rose D', 'Voskanyan A', 'Fabarius A', 'Hofmann WK', 'Saussele S', 'Seifarth W']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology, Medical Faculty Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Mannheim, Heidelberg University, Mannheim, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9930-7069'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190321,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Glucuronidase/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/standards', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/03/22 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2018/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0214305 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-30825 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 21;14(3):e0214305. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0214305. eCollection 2019.,PMC6428315,"['SS received honoraria from Novartis Pharma GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS),', 'Pfizer, ARIAD and research funding from Novartis Pharma GmbH and BMS.

Tumor heterogeneity remains a key challenge to effective cancer treatment, and reliable stratification of cancer patients for prediction of outcomes is highly important. Intratumoral heterogeneity is manifested at the different levels, including different tumorigenic properties of cancer cells. Since John Dick et al. isolated leukemia initiating cells in 1990, the populations of tumor initiating or cancer stem cells (CSCs) were identified and characterized also for a broad spectrum of solid tumor types. The properties of CSCs are of considerable clinical relevance: CSCs have self-renewal and tumor initiating potential, and the metastases are initiated by the CSC clones with the ability to disseminate from the primary tumor site. Conclusion: Evidence from both, experimental and clinical studies demonstrates that the probability of achieving local tumor control by radiation therapy depends on the complete eradication of CSC populations. The number, properties and molecular signature of CSCs are highly predictive for clinical outcome of radiotherapy, whereas targeted therapies against CSCs combined with conventional treatment are expected to provide an improved clinical response and prevent tumor relapse. In this review, we discuss the modern methods to study CSCs in radiation biology, the role of CSCs in personalized cancer therapy as well as future directions for CSC research in translational radiooncology.",,"['Peitzsch, Claudia', 'Kurth, Ina', 'Ebert, Nadja', 'Dubrovska, Anna', 'Baumann, Michael']","['Peitzsch C', 'Kurth I', 'Ebert N', 'Dubrovska A', 'Baumann M']","['a OncoRay - National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf , Dresden , Germany.', 'b National Center for Tumor Diseases (NCT), Partner Site Dresden, Germany: German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany; Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Dresden, Germany, and; Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf (HZDR) , Dresden , Germany.', 'c German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Dresden, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'd German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'f Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology , Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden , Dresden , Germany.', 'a OncoRay - National Center for Radiation Research in Oncology, Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden, Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf , Dresden , Germany.', 'c German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Dresden, and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'e Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf, Institute of Radiooncology - OncoRay , Dresden , Germany.', 'd German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) , Heidelberg , Germany.', 'f Department of Radiotherapy and Radiation Oncology , Faculty of Medicine and University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technische Universitat Dresden , Dresden , Germany.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5247-908X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3375-1500', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9340-974X']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190329,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/radiotherapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Precision Medicine', 'Probability', 'Radiation Oncology/*methods', 'Radiobiology', 'Radiotherapy/*methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'Translational Research, Biomedical', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer stem cells', '*model systems', '*radiosensitivity']",2019/03/22 06:00,2019/11/26 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553002.2019.1589023 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2019 Jul;95(7):900-911. doi: 10.1080/09553002.2019.1589023.

However, the mechanisms underlying the role of Tregs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remain to be elucidated. Helios, combined with forkhead box P3, is considered a suitable marker for discriminating functional Tregs. In the present study, a microenvironment was created with a high proportion of Helios+ Tregs in T celldeficient nude mice to determine the mechanism underlying Tregs expressing Helios in ALL. It was revealed that umbilical cord bloodderived Helios+ Tregs had proliferation and immunosuppression abilities similar to those of normal pediatric Tregs. The accumulation of Helios+ Tregs accelerated leukemogenesis and the infiltration of leukemic cells into the bone marrow. Importantly, a high expression of Helios in Tregs promoted angiogenesis in the bone marrow via the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)A/VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. Furthermore, the expression of chemokine CCchemokine ligand 22 (CCL22) in the bone marrow and serum of ALL mice infused with Helioshigh Treg cells was increased. The results demonstrated that Helios promotes the secretion of chemokine CCL22, which may recruit more Tregs into the bone marrow. Increased Helios+ Treg cells promoted angiogenesis in the bone marrow of ALL mice via the VEGFA/VEGFR2 pathway. Therefore, Helios may be a target to manipulate Treg activity in clinical settings.",,"['Li, Xue', 'Li, Dong', 'Shi, Qing', 'Huang, Xiaoyang', 'Ju, Xiuli']","['Li X', 'Li D', 'Shi Q', 'Huang X', 'Ju X']","['Department of Pediatrics, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250012, P.R.

The results demonstrated that two representative nitrostyrene compounds potently induced apoptosis in CLL cells. The proapoptotic effects of the compounds were found to be reactive oxygen species and caspasedependent, and had minimal effects on the viability of normal donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Nitrostyrene compounds exhibited synergistic augmentation of apoptosis when combined with the phosphatidylinositol 3kinase inhibitor idelalisib and demonstrated potent toxicity in ex vivo CLL cells, including those cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells, making them more resistant to apoptosis (n=8).

The edgeR package was used to screen for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the potential molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets were identified using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) v6.8, Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool, Connectivity Map (CMap), Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and GeneMANIA. A total of 230 DEGs were identified between the bone marrow tissues of IDH2 R140Q-mutated and wild-type AML patients, of which 31 were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Functional assessment of DEGs showed significant enrichment in multiple biological processes, including angiogenesis and cell differentiation. STRING and GeneMANIA were used to identify the hub genes of these DEGs. CMap analysis identified 13 potential small-molecule drugs against IDH2 R140Q-mutated adult de novo AML. Genome-wide co-expression network analysis identified several IDH2 R140Q co-expressed genes, of which 56 were significantly associated with AML OS. The difference in IDH2 mRNA expression levels and OS between the IDH2 R140Q-mutated and wild-type AML were not statistically significant in our cohort.

The results demonstrated that TAIII inhibits the viability of Jurkat cells in a time and dosedependent manner, and induces apoptosis of Jurkat cells in a dosedependent manner. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated the formation of numerous autophagosomes in TAIIItreated Jurkat cells. Furthermore, monodansylcadaverine (MDC)labeled autophagic vacuoles were observed following TAIII treatment by an inverted fluorescence microscope and MDC accumulation increased notably in TAIII treatment groups in a concentrationdependent manner. Bcell lymphoma2 (Bcl2)associated X (Bax) was upregulated while Bcl2 was reduced following TAIII treatment, indicating that the proapoptotic mechanism of TAIII may be associated with upregulation of Bax.

The cytotoxic effects of NK cells were first identified against leukemia cells, and it is now hypothesized that they may have a critical role in leukemia therapy. The cellular functions of NK cells are mediated by their cell surface receptors, which recognize ligands on cancer cells. The role of NK cells is specifically regulated by the activating or inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulinlike receptors (KIRs) on their surface, which bind to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I ligands present on the target cells. The association between KIR and HLA is derived from the diversity of KIR/HLA gene profiles present in different individuals, and this determines the cytotoxic effect of NK cells on cancer cells. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological leukemia characterized by the hyperproliferation of myeloid cells, with the majority of patients with CML presenting with abnormal immune cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are the present standard therapy for CML, but are associated with numerous adverse side effects. Various studies have proposed CML therapy by immunotherapeutic approaches targeting the immune cells.

The present meta-analysis was performed to provide more precise results. METHODS: Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases were used to identify eligible studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the strength of the association between NAT2 polymorphisms and AL risk. RESULTS: Increased risk was found under both heterozygous (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51) and recessive model (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06-1.55) for rs1801280.

While mild thrombocytopenia is common in allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant donors after G-CSF mobilization, serious thrombocytopenia is rarely reported. Herein, we report a case of severe thrombocytopenia caused by G-CSF in a 14-year-old healthy donor and review the relevant literature. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of severe thrombocytopenia caused by G-CSF in a healthy adolescent donor. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 14-year-old sister of a girl with T lymphocyte leukemia was selected as a matched donor for transplantation. The donor was healthy with normal blood parameters. DIAGNOSES: The donor received 10 mug/kg/day G-CSF via subcutaneous injection. On day 4 of G-CSF administration, blood tests before stem cell collection indicated that platelets dropped to 51 g/L. Abdominal ultrasound showed that the spleen was mildly enlarged. INTERVENTIONS: In order to prevent blood loss and other effects caused by a too low platelet count after collection, the donor's peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells were collected after platelet transfusion. OUTCOMES: Checkups for 1 year after G-CSF administration showed normal blood parameters. LESSONS: Due to the rare risk of severe thrombocytopenia in G-CSF mobilization, it is necessary to routinely monitor blood parameters during mobilization to ensure smooth progress of the transplantation process.",,"['Lu, Xuan', 'Wu, Yu', 'Wang, Huafang', 'Xia, Linghui']","['Lu X', 'Wu Y', 'Wang H', 'Xia L']","['Institute of Hematology.', 'Department of Ultrasound, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Institute of Hematology.', 'Institute of Hematology.']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/therapy', '*Living Donors', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', '*Siblings', 'Thrombocytopenia/*chemically induced']",,,2019/03/22 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000014786 [doi]', '00005792-201903220-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Mar;98(12):e14786. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000014786.,PMC6709058,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The computational results indicated that the alchemical method can accurately predict the binding affinities, while the end-point methods give relatively unreliable predictions. Decomposing the free energy difference into enthalpic and entropic components with MBAR reweighting enabled us to investigate the detailed thermodynamic parameters with which the entropy-enthalpy compensation in this protein-ligand binding case is identified.

We thus compared the activity of auranofin and Prima-1(Met) in 18 myeloma cell lines and in 10 samples from patients with multiple myeloma or plasma cell leukemia. We showed that, similar to Prima-1(Met), the activity of auranofin was not dependent on either TP53 status or p53 expression; was inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS scavenger; displayed a dramatic synergy with L-buthionine sulfoximine, an irreversible inhibitor of glutathione synthesis; and induced cell death that was not dependent on Bax/Bak expression.

Within the ATG-FRES dose range no differences were found in clearance of active ATG or T-cell re-appearance. However, the high dosage of ATG-GENZ (10 mg/kg), in contrast to the low dosage (6-8 mg/kg), correlated with prolonged persistence of active ATG and delayed T-cell reconstitution. Occurrence of serious acute GvHD (grade III-IV) was highest in the ATG-GENZ-low dosage group.

DNA replication errors are intrinsically toxic to cells. How GC B cells exert control over the DNA damage response while introducing mutations in their antibody genes is poorly understood. Here, we show that the DNA damage response regulator Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is essential for GC B cell survival. Remarkably, effective antibody-mediated immunity relies on optimal CHK1 dosage. Chemical CHK1 inhibition or loss of one Chk1 allele impairs the survival of class-switched cells and curbs the amplitude of antibody production. Mechanistically, active B cell receptor signaling wires the outcome of CHK1-inhibition towards BIM-dependent apoptosis, whereas T cell help favors temporary cell cycle arrest. Our results predict that therapeutic CHK1 inhibition in cancer patients may prove potent in killing B cell lymphoma and leukemia cells addicted to B cell receptor signaling, but will most likely dampen humoral immunity.",,"['Schoeler, Katia', 'Jakic, Bojana', 'Heppke, Julia', 'Soratroi, Claudia', 'Aufschnaiter, Andreas', 'Hermann-Kleiter, Natascha', 'Villunger, Andreas', 'Labi, Verena']","['Schoeler K', 'Jakic B', 'Heppke J', 'Soratroi C', 'Aufschnaiter A', 'Hermann-Kleiter N', 'Villunger A', 'Labi V']","['Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'Division of Translational Cell Genetics, Department for Pharmacology and Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'Division of Translational Cell Genetics, Department for Pharmacology and Genetics, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, Vienna, 1090, Austria.', 'Division of Developmental Immunology, Biocenter, Medical University of Innsbruck, Innsbruck, 6020, Austria. verena.labi@i-med.ac.at.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4389-9813', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7538-1520']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190320,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Chek1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1/genetics/*immunology', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'Germinal Center/*immunology', 'Immunity, Humoral/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,,2019/03/22 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41418-019-0318-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41418-019-0318-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2019 Dec;26(12):2551-2567. doi: 10.1038/s41418-019-0318-5.

CD34(+) cells could generate high amount of pDCs in the absence of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (FLT3L). Finally, an excess of pDCs correlates with regulatory T cell accumulation and an increased risk of acute leukemia transformation.

Fusion with E2A confers potent transcriptional activation and constitutive nuclear localization, bypassing the need for dimerization with protein partners that normally stabilize and regulate import of PBX1 into the nucleus, but the mechanisms underlying its oncogenic activation are incompletely defined. We demonstrate here that E2A-PBX1 self-associates through the PBX1 PBC-B domain of the chimeric protein to form higher-order oligomers in t(1;19) human leukemia cells, and that this property is required for oncogenic activity. Structural and functional studies indicate that self-association facilitates the binding of E2A-PBX1 to DNA. Mutants unable to self-associate are transformation defective, however their oncogenic activity is rescued by the synthetic oligomerization domain of FKBP, which confers conditional transformation properties on E2A-PBX1. In contrast to self-association, PBX1 protein domains that mediate interactions with HOX DNA-binding partners are dispensable. These studies suggest that oligomeric self-association may compensate for the inability of monomeric E2A-PBX1 to stably bind DNA and circumvents protein interactions that otherwise modulate PBX1 stability, nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. The unique dependence on self-association for E2A-PBX1 oncogenic activity suggests potential approaches for mechanism-based targeted therapies.",,"['Lin, Chiou-Hong', 'Wang, Zhong', 'Duque-Afonso, Jesus', 'Wong, Stephen Hon-Kit', 'Demeter, Janos', 'Loktev, Alexander V', 'Somervaille, Tim C P', 'Jackson, Peter K', 'Cleary, Michael L']","['Lin CH', 'Wang Z', 'Duque-Afonso J', 'Wong SH', 'Demeter J', 'Loktev AV', 'Somervaille TCP', 'Jackson PK', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Sun Yat-Sen University, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Guangzhou, 510006, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Leukaemia Biology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute, The University of Manchester, Manchester, M20 4GJ, UK.', 'Baxter Laboratory for Stem Cell Biology, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA. mcleary@stanford.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190320,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (TCF3 protein, human)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Tacrolimus Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1/chemistry', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Protein Stability', 'Tacrolimus Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,2019/03/22 06:00,2020/10/06 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2018/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-41393-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-41393-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 20;9(1):4915. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-41393-w.,PMC6426973,,"['KL2 TR001083/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001085/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, not all glycoproteins are compatible with all viruses. Despite the fact that viral pseudotyping is widely used, what makes a virus/glycoprotein pair compatible is poorly understood. To study this, we chose to analyze a gammaretroviral glycoprotein (Env) whose compatibility with different viruses could be modulated through small changes in its cytoplasmic tail (CT). One form of this glycoprotein is compatible with murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles but incompatible with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles, while the second is compatible with HIV-1 particles but not with MLV particles. To decipher the factors affecting virus-specific Env incompatibility, we characterized Env incorporation, maturation, cell-to-cell fusogenicity, and virus-to-cell fusogenicity of each Env. The HIV-1 particle incompatibility correlated with less efficient cleavage of the R peptide by HIV-1 protease. However, the MLV particle incompatibility was more nuanced. MLV incompatibility appeared to be caused by lack of incorporation into particles, yet incorporation could be restored by further truncating the CT or by using a chimeric MLV Gag protein containing the HIV-1 MA without fully restoring infectivity. The MLV particle incompatibility appeared to be caused in part by fusogenic repression in MLV particles through an unknown mechanism. This study demonstrates that the Env CT can dictate functionality of Env within particles in a virus-specific manner.IMPORTANCE Viruses utilize viral glycoproteins to efficiently enter target cells during infection. How viruses acquire viral glycoproteins has been studied to understand the pathogenesis of viruses and develop safer and more efficient viral vectors for gene therapies. The CTs of viral glycoproteins have been shown to regulate various stages of glycoprotein biogenesis, but a gap still remains in understanding the molecular mechanism of glycoprotein acquisition and functionality regarding the CT. Here, we studied the mechanism of how specific mutations in the CT of a gammaretroviral envelope glycoprotein distinctly affect infectivity of two different viruses. Different mutations caused failure of glycoproteins to function in a virus-specific manner due to distinct fusion defects, suggesting that there are virus-specific characteristics affecting glycoprotein functionality.",['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Song, Yul Eum', 'Olinger, Grace Y', 'Janaka, Sanath Kumar', 'Johnson, Marc C']","['Song YE', 'Olinger GY', 'Janaka SK', 'Johnson MC']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, University of Missouri, Columbia, Missouri, USA marcjohnson@missouri.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190515,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HIV-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Assembly']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Env incorporation', '*HIV-1', '*MLV', '*R peptide', '*assembly', '*cytoplasmic tail', '*fusogenicity', '*glycoprotein', '*retrovirus']",2019/03/22 06:00,2020/06/24 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02172-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02172-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 May 15;93(11). pii: JVI.02172-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02172-18.

We are exploring the immunotherapeutic potential of peripheral blood Vdelta1(+) T cells, which associate with improved long-term survival of stem-cell transplant recipients but have not yet been applied as adoptive cell therapy. Using our clinical-grade protocol for expansion and differentiation of ""Delta One T"" (DOT) cells, we found DOT cells to be highly cytotoxic against AML primary samples and cell lines, including cells selected for resistance to standard chemotherapy. Unlike chemotherapy, DOT-cell targeting did not select for outgrowth of specific AML lineages, suggesting a broad recognition domain, an outcome that was consistent with the polyclonality of the DOT-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. However, AML reactivity was only slightly impaired upon Vdelta1(+) TCR antibody blockade, whereas it was strongly dependent on expression of the NKp30 ligand, B7-H6. In contrast, DOT cells did not show reactivity against normal leukocytes, including CD33(+) or CD123(+) myeloid cells.

We determined if adoptive transfer of natural killer (NK) cells from haploidentical killer immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR)-human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched donors may prolong event-free survival in children with intermediate-risk AML who were in first complete remission after chemotherapy. Patients received cyclophosphamide (Day - 7), fludarabine (Days - 6 through - 2), and subcutaneous interleukin-2 (Days - 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). Purified, unmanipulated NK cells were infused on Day 0, and NK cell chimerism and phenotyping from peripheral blood were performed on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. As primary endpoint, the event-free survival was compared to a cohort of 55 patients who completed chemotherapy and were in first complete remission but did not receive NK cells. Donor NK cell kinetics were determined as secondary endpoints. Twenty-one patients (median age at diagnosis, 6.0 years [range, 0.1-15.3 years]) received a median of 12.5 x 10(6) NK cells/kg (range, 3.6-62.2 x 10(6) cells/kg) without major side effects. All but 3 demonstrated transient engraftment with donor NK cells (median peak donor chimerism, 4% [range, 0-43%]). KIR-HLA-mismatched NK cells expanded in 17 patients (81%) and contracted in 4 (19%). However, adoptive transfer of NK cells did not decrease the cumulative incidence of relapse (0.393 [95% confidence interval: 0.182-0.599] vs. 0.35 [0.209-0.495]; P = .556) and did not improve event-free (60.7 +/- 10.9% vs. 69.1 +/- 6.8%; P = .553) or overall survival (84.2 +/- 8.5% vs. 79.1 +/- 6.6%; P = .663) over chemotherapy alone. The lack of benefit may result from insufficient numbers and limited persistence of alloreactive donor NK cells but does not preclude its potential usefulness during other phases of therapy, or in combination with other immunotherapeutic agents.

The successful introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as Imatinib, Dasatinib and Bosutinib has greatly improved the CML patient survival rate. However, upon the chronic treatment, a variety of TKI resistant mutants, such as the V299L mutant which has been found in more and more patients with the high-throughput sequencing technology, are observed, although the incidence is still considered rare compared to the more prevalent gatekeeper T315I mutant. However, with the progress of the precision medicine concept, the rare mutation (or the orphan drug target) has attracted more and more attention. Here we report a novel type II BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor, CHMFL-ABL-039, which not only displayed great potency (IC50: 7.9 nM) and selectivity (S score (1) = 0.02) against native ABL kinase among other kinases in the kinome, but also exhibited great potency (IC50: 27.9 nM) and selectivity against Imatinib-resistant V299L mutant among other frequently observed ABL kinase mutants. CHMFL-ABL-039 has demonstrated greater efficacies than Imatinib regarding to the anti-proliferation, inhibition of the signaling pathway, arrest of cell cycle progression, induction of apoptosis in vitro and suppression of the tumor progression in vivo in the native and V299L mutated BCR-ABL kinase-driven cells/xenograft models.

To investigate the specific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in monocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and adenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells and multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, GGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these processes. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly decreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic differentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level of Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic differentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of Beclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the level of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid cell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules (CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27(kip1)). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of Becn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone activation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and overexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In addition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the first time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy process during osteoclastogenesis.Abbreviations: ACP5/TRAP: acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant; Ad-KLF2: adenoviral construct of KLF2; ATG3: autophagy related 3; ATG5: autophagy related 5; ATG7: autophagy related 7; ATG12: autophagy related 12; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; C57BL/6: inbred mouse strain C57 black 6; ChIP: chromatin immunoprecipitation; CSF1/MCSF: colony stimulating factor 1 (macrophage); CTSK: cathepsin K; EV: empty vector; GGTI298: geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor; H3K9Ac: histone H3 lysine 9 acetylation; H4K8Ac: histone H4 lysine 8 acetylation; K/BxN mice: T cell receptor (TCR) transgene KRN and the MHC class II molecule A(g7) generates K/BxN mice; KLF2: kruppel-like factor 2 (lung); 3MA: 3-methyladenine; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MDC: monodansylcadaverine; NFATc1: nuclear factor of activated T cells 1; NFKB: nuclear factor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells; p21/CDKN1A: cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A; p27(kip1)/CDKN1B: cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; PtdIns3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; siKlf2: small interfering KLF2 ribonucleic acid; NS: non-specific; RAW 264.7: abelson murine leukemia virus transformed macrophage cell line; TNFSF11/RANKL: tumor necrosis factor (ligand) superfamily, member 11; TSS: transcriptional start site; UCSC: University of California, Santa Cruz.",,"['Laha, Dipranjan', 'Deb, Moonmoon', 'Das, Hiranmoy']","['Laha D', 'Deb M', 'Das H']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8605-9366', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3343-0096']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190416,United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Klf2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*genetics/physiology', 'Beclin-1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Osteoclasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Osteogenesis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rheumatic Fever/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*KLF2', '*histone acetylation', '*monocytes', '*osteoclast differentiation']",2019/03/22 06:00,2020/07/14 06:00,['2019/03/22 06:00'],"['2019/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2019.1596491 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2019 Dec;15(12):2063-2075. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2019.1596491.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are important regulators of gene expression in all cells and disruption of their normal expression can lead to changes in phenotype of a cell, in particular the emergence of a leukemic clone. We collected peripheral blood samples from 10 adult patients with newly diagnosed AML, prior to induction chemotherapy, and 9 controls. Two and a half ml of whole blood was collected in Paxgene RNA tubes. MiRNA was purified using RNeasy mini column (Qiagen). We sequenced approximately 1000 miRs from each of 10 AML patients and 9 controls. In subset analysis, patients with NPM1 and FLT3 mutations showed the greatest number of miRNAs (63) with expression levels that differed from control with adjusted p-value of 0.05 or less. Some of these miRs have been described previously in association with leukemia, but many are new. Our approach of global sequencing of miRs as opposed to microarray analysis removes the bias regarding which miRs to assay and has demonstrated discovery of new associations of miRs with AML. Another strength of our approach is that sequencing miRs is specific for the 5p or 3p strand of the gene, greatly narrowing the proposed target genes to study further. Our study provides new information about the molecular changes that lead to evolution of the leukemic clone and offers new possibilities for monitoring relapse and developing new treatment strategies.",,"['Pandita, Aakriti', 'Ramadas, Poornima', 'Poudel, Aarati', 'Saad, Nibal', 'Anand, Ankit', 'Basnet, Alina', 'Wang, Dongliang', 'Middleton, Frank', 'Gilligan, Diana M']","['Pandita A', 'Ramadas P', 'Poudel A', 'Saad N', 'Anand A', 'Basnet A', 'Wang D', 'Middleton F', 'Gilligan DM']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Neuroscience and Physiology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, New York, United States of America.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3107-7188', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4773-6069']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190320,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/blood/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/methods', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,2019/03/21 06:00,2019/11/30 06:00,['2019/03/21 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0213078 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-36396 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 20;14(3):e0213078. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0213078. eCollection 2019.,PMC6426230,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the study was to identify clinical and imaging features in a large patient sample. Patients and methods Overall, 71 cases (34 females (47.9%) and 37 males (52.1%) with a median age of 56 (+/- 16 years) of histopathologically confirmed myeloid sarcoma were included into this study. The underlying hematological disease, occurrence, localizations and clinical symptoms as well as imaging features on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were investigated. Results In 4 cases (5.63%) the manifestation of MS preceded the systemic hematological disease by a mean value of 3.8 +/- 2.1 months. In 13 cases, first presentation of MS occurred simultaneously with the initial diagnosis of leukemia, and 51 patients presented MS after the initial diagnosis of the underlying malignancy with a mean latency of 39.8 +/- 44.9 SD months. The visceral soft tissue was affected in 26 cases, followed by the cutis/subcutis was affected in 21 cases. Further localizations were bones (n = 13), central nervous system (n = 9), lymph nodes (n = 4) and visceral organs (n = 9). Conclusions MS is a rare complication of several hematological malignancies, predominantly of acute myeloid leukemia, which can affect any part of the body.

An international phase Ib/II study evaluated the safety and preliminary efficacy of venetoclax, a selective B-cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 inhibitor, together with low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) in older adults with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adults 60 years or older with previously untreated AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy were enrolled. Prior treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome, including hypomethylating agents (HMA), was permitted. Eighty-two patients were treated at the recommended phase II dose: venetoclax 600 mg per day orally in 28-day cycles, with LDAC (20 mg/m(2) per day) administered subcutaneously on days 1 to 10. Key end points were tolerability, safety, response rates, duration of response (DOR), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median age was 74 years (range, 63 to 90 years), 49% had secondary AML, 29% had prior HMA treatment, and 32% had poor-risk cytogenetic features. Common grade 3 or greater adverse events were febrile neutropenia (42%), thrombocytopenia (38%), and WBC count decreased (34%). Early (30-day) mortality was 6%. Fifty-four percent achieved complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (median time to first response, 1.4 months). The median OS was 10.1 months (95% CI, 5.7 to 14.2), and median DOR was 8.1 months (95% CI, 5.3 to 14.9 months). Among patients without prior HMA exposure, CR/CR with incomplete blood count recovery was achieved in 62%, median DOR was 14.8 months (95% CI, 5.5 months to not reached), and median OS was 13.5 months (95% CI, 7.0 to 18.4 months). CONCLUSION: Venetoclax plus LDAC has a manageable safety profile, producing rapid and durable remissions in older adults with AML ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. High remission rate and low early mortality combined with rapid and durable remission make venetoclax and LDAC an attractive and novel treatment for older adults not suitable for intensive chemotherapy.",,"['Wei, Andrew H', 'Strickland, Stephen A Jr', 'Hou, Jing-Zhou', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Lin, Tara L', 'Walter, Roland B', 'Enjeti, Anoop', 'Tiong, Ing Soo', 'Savona, Michael', 'Lee, Sangmin', 'Chyla, Brenda', 'Popovic, Relja', 'Salem, Ahmed Hamed', 'Agarwal, Suresh', 'Xu, Tu', 'Fakouhi, Kaffa M', 'Humerickhouse, Rod', 'Hong, Wan-Jen', 'Hayslip, John', 'Roboz, Gail J']","['Wei AH', 'Strickland SA Jr', 'Hou JZ', 'Fiedler W', 'Lin TL', 'Walter RB', 'Enjeti A', 'Tiong IS', 'Savona M', 'Lee S', 'Chyla B', 'Popovic R', 'Salem AH', 'Agarwal S', 'Xu T', 'Fakouhi KM', 'Humerickhouse R', 'Hong WJ', 'Hayslip J', 'Roboz GJ']","['1 The Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', '2 Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN.', '3 University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, PA.', '4 University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', '5 University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, KS.', '6 University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', '7 Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', '8 Calvary Mater Hospital Newcastle, Waratah, NSW, Australia.', '9 University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, Australia.', '1 The Alfred Hospital and Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', '2 Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN.', '10 Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '12 Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '13 Genentech, South San Francisco, CA.', '11 AbbVie, North Chicago, IL.', '10 Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY.']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190320,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Sulfonamides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics']",,,2019/03/21 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.18.01600 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 May 20;37(15):1277-1284. doi: 10.1200/JCO.18.01600.

We identified 85 consecutive CML adult patients who were treated with ponatinib in 17 Italian centers. Patients were stratified according to the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) assessment, based on sex, age, smoking habits, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol levels. The 60-month cumulative incidence rate of AOEs excluding hypertension was 25.7%. Hypertension was reported in 14.1% of patients. The median time of exposure to ponatinib was 28 months (range, 3-69 months). Patients with a high to very high SCORE risk showed a significantly higher incidence rate of AOEs (74.3% vs 15.2%, P < 0.001). Patients aged >/=60 years showed a significantly higher incidence rate of AOEs (51.5% vs 16.9%, P = 0.008). In multivariate analysis, no association was found between AOEs and positive history of CV disease, age, dose of ponatinib, previous exposure to nilotinib, and comorbidities. Only the SCORE risk was confirmed as a significant predictive factor (P = 0.01; HR = 10.9; 95% C.I. = 1.7-67.8). Patients aged >/=60 years who were treated with aspirin had a lower incidence rate of AOEs (33.3% vs 61.8%). Among the 14 reported AOEs, 78.6% of them showed grade 3 to 4 toxicity. This real-life study confirmed the increased incidence of AOEs in CML patients treated with ponatinib, with high to very high SCORE risk. We suggest that patients aged >/=60 years who were treated with ponatinib should undergo prophylaxis with 100 mg/day of aspirin.

PLZF displays an epigenetic specificity by recruiting chromatin-modifying factors but little is known about its role in remodeling chromatin of cells committed toward a given specific hematopoietic lineage. In murine myeloid progenitors, we decipher a new role for PLZF in restraining active genes and enhancers by targeting acetylated lysine 27 of Histone H3 (H3K27ac). Functional analyses reveal that active enhancers bound by PLZF are involved in biological processes related to metabolism and associated with hematopoietic aging. Comparing the epigenome of young and old myeloid progenitors, we reveal that H3K27ac variation at active enhancers is a hallmark of hematopoietic aging. Taken together, these data suggest that PLZF, associated with active enhancers, appears to restrain their activity as an epigenetic gatekeeper of hematopoietic aging.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

However, the effects of HDACIs on chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and the mechanism-of-action of two HDACI members, sodium butyrate (NaBu) and panobinostat (LBH589) in K562 and the adriamycin-resistant cell line K562/ADR. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed using MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was detected with flow cytometry. Cell cycle analysis and western blot were performed to explore the possible molecules related to HDACIs effects. RESULTS: The effect of NaBu was more powerful on K562/ADR than on K562 cells. LBH589 triggered apoptosis and inhibited the growth of K562 cells. Both HDACIs inhibited K562 and K562/ADR cells via activation of intrinsic/extrinsic apoptotic pathways and inhibition of AKT-mTOR pathway while NaBu also activated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) mediated apoptotic pathway in K562/ADR cells. LBH589 reduced the expression of drug-resistant related proteins in K562 cells. However, neither NaBu nor LBH589 could significantly influence the expression of the drug-resistant related proteins in K562/ADR cells. CONCLUSION: The combination of HDACI and other therapeutic strategies are likely required to overcome drug resistance in CML therapy.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Identification and analysis of leukocytes in blood smear images, acquired from bright field microscope, are vital for diagnosing many diseases such as hepatitis, leukaemia and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The major challenge for robust and accurate identification and segmentation of leukocyte in blood smear images lays in the large variations of cell appearance such as size, colour and shape of cells, the adhesion between leukocytes (white blood cells, WBCs) and erythrocytes (red blood cells, RBCs), and the emergence of substantial dyeing impurities in blood smear images. In this paper, an end-to-end leukocyte localization and segmentation method is proposed, named LeukocyteMask, in which pixel-level prior information is utilized for supervisor training of a deep convolutional neural network, which is then employed to locate the region of interests (ROI) of leukocyte, and finally segmentation mask of leukocyte is obtained based on the extracted ROI by forward propagation of the network. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the propose method and both the quantitative and qualitative comparisons with existing methods indicate that LeukocyteMask achieves a state-of-the-art performance for the segmentation of leukocyte in terms of robustness and accuracy .","['(c) 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A single nucleotide, T > C, change in exon 13, leading to a Thr1289 Ala substitution, was identified in the lysine (K)-specific methyltransferase 2D gene (Kmt2d) located on chromosome 15. Mutations with a loss-of-function in the KMT2D gene on chromosome 12 in humans are responsible for Kabuki syndrome (KS). Phenotypic characterization of the bapa mutant was performed using a behavioral test battery to evaluate the parameters related to general activity, the sensory nervous system, the psychomotor system, and the autonomous nervous system, as well as to measure motor function and spatial memory. Relative to BALB/cJ mice, the bapa mutant showed sensory and psychomotor impairments, such as hypotonia denoted by a surface righting reflex impairment and hindquarter fall, and a reduction in the auricular reflex, suggesting hearing impairment. Additionally, the enhanced general activity showed by the increased rearing and grooming frequency, distance traveled and average speed possibly presupposes the presence of hyperactivity of bapa mice compared with the control group. A slight motor coordination dysfunction was showed in bapa mice, which had a longer crossing time on the balance beam compared with BALB/cJ controls. Male bapa mice also showed spatial gait pattern changes, such as a shorter stride length and shorter step length. In conclusion, the bapa mouse may be a valuable animal model to study the mechanisms involved in psychomotor and behavior impairments, such as hypotonia, fine motor coordination and hyperactivity linked to the Kmt2d mutation.","['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics', 'Society.']","['Yamamoto, Pedro K', 'de Souza, Tiago A', 'Antiorio, Ana T F B', 'Zanatto, Dennis A', 'Garcia-Gomes, Mariana de Souza A', 'Alexandre-Ribeiro, Sandra R', 'Oliveira, Nicassia de Souza', 'Menck, Carlos F M', 'Bernardi, Maria M', 'Massironi, Silvia M G', 'Mori, Claudia M C']","['Yamamoto PK', 'de Souza TA', 'Antiorio ATFB', 'Zanatto DA', 'Garcia-Gomes MSA', 'Alexandre-Ribeiro SR', 'Oliveira NS', 'Menck CFM', 'Bernardi MM', 'Massironi SMG', 'Mori CMC']","['Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Environmental and Experimental Pathology, Paulista University, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Immunology, Institute of Biomedical Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9393-240X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190423,England,Genes Brain Behav,"Genes, brain, and behavior",101129617,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2b protein, mouse)', 'Kabuki syndrome']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Animals', '*Behavior, Animal', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Face/*abnormalities/physiopathology', 'Gait', 'Hearing', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', '*Loss of Function Mutation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Movement', 'Muscle Hypotonia/genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Reflex', 'Vestibular Diseases/*genetics/physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['* Kmt2d gene', '*ENU-mutagenesis', '*mouse genetics', '*mouse phenotype', '*mutant behavior', '*psychomotor impairment']",2019/03/21 06:00,2020/03/13 06:00,['2019/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/13 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/gbb.12568 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Brain Behav. 2019 Nov;18(8):e12568. doi: 10.1111/gbb.12568.

We characterized the neurological toxicity associated with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy in a consecutive series of 100 patients up to 2 months post transfusion, 28 of whom were obtained from chart review and the others by prospective observation. The underlying neoplasms were lymphoma (74%), myeloma (14%), leukaemia (10%), and sarcoma (2%). The median age of the cohort was 64.5 years old and 39% of patients were female. The most commonly occurring neurological symptoms were encephalopathy (57%), headache (42%), tremor (38%), aphasia (35%) and focal weakness (11%). Focal neurological deficits are frequently observed after chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy and are associated with regional EEG abnormalities, FDG-PET hypometabolism, and elevated velocities on transcranial Doppler ultrasound. In contrast, structural imaging was typically normal.

In this study, we evaluated the in vivo effect of d-Limonene on a K562-induced model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in C57BL/6 mice. Method: The tail vein injection model of K562 cells in immunocompromised C57BL/6 mice was developed and evaluated for characteristics of the disease. The mice were treated with d-Limonene and evaluated for haematological parameters. We also evaluated the effect of d-Limonene on angiogenesis using the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Results: In a complete blood count, a significant dose-dependent reduction in white blood cell, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, but an elevation in red blood cell count and haemoglobin content was observed with d-Limonene treatment compared to the disease control or untreated group. In the CAM assay, d-Limonene produced a significant dose-dependent reduction in number of blood vessels in treatment groups compared to the vehicle-treated group.

However, their frequency of incidence, impact on prognosis and treatment response effect in CML is not conclusive. In the present study, we performed a chromosome analysis of 489 patients in different clinical stages of CML, using conventional GTG-banding, Fluorescent in situ Hybridization and Spectral Karyotyping. Among the de novo CP cases, ACAs were observed in 30 patients (10.20%) with lowest incidence, followed by IM resistant CP (16.66%) whereas in AP and BC, the occurrence of ACAs were higher, and was about 40.63 and 50.98%, respectively. The frequency of occurrence of ACAs were compared between the study groups and it was found that the incidence of ACAs was higher in BC compared to de novo and IM resistant CP cases. Likewise, it was higher in AP patients when compared between de novo and IM resistant CP cases, mirroring the fact of cytogenetic evolution with disease progression in CML. In addition, we observed 10 novel and 10 rare chromosomal aberrations among the study subjects. This study pinpoints the fact that the genome of advanced phase patients was highly unstable, and this environment of genomic instability is responsible for the high occurrence of ACAs. Treatment response analysis revealed that compared to initial phases, ACAs were associated with an adverse prognostic effect during the progressive stages of CML.

In some patients with leukemia, ophthalmic signs can precede the systemic features and can help in early diagnosis of systemic leukemia. Due to the scarcity of data on this topic from Pakistan, we conducted this study to determine the pattern of ocular involvement in patients with leukemia presenting in our settings. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital of Pakistan over a period of one year. The study comprised of both newly diagnosed and follow-up patients of acute leukemia of age more than 15 years. Patients underwent detailed ophthalmic anterior and dilated posterior segment examination. Patient's demographic profile, type of leukemia, chemotherapy status, and hematologic findings were also documented. Results There were 97 leukemic patients in the study with 55 (56.7%) males and 42 (43.3%) females. Various ophthalmic manifestations were observed in 47 (48.45%) patients. Forty-two (43.3%) were diagnosed cases with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 55 (56.7%) suffered from acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Ophthalmic manifestations were present in 29 patients of AML (52.7%) and 18 patients of ALL (42.85%). Ocular involvement was significantly more common in newly diagnosed (n=32) as compared with follow-up patients (n=15) (p-value = 0.032). Posterior segment (n=48) was the most common site of ocular involvement (n=48, 49.5%) with retinal hemorrhages seen in 40 patients (41.2%) and papilloedema in seven cases (7.2%). Thirty-three (70.2%) out of 47 patients with ophthalmic manifestations were asymptomatic while 14 (29.8%) had ocular symptoms at the time of initial presentation. Conclusion Ophthalmic manifestations were present in about half of the patients with leukemia.

Laboratory studies revealed a significant number of myeloblasts on peripheral smear with granulated cytoplasm, irregular nuclei, and prominent vacuoles. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated a T1-enhancing 1.5 cm right-sided dural-based lesion involving the medial sphenoid wing, cavernous sinus, infratemporal fossa, and sphenoid sinus region. An endoscopic biopsy of the lesion within the sphenoid sinus confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma, with myeloblasts comprising 30% of cellularity by flow cytometry. A subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed a hypercellular marrow with 23% blasts by flow cytometry that demonstrated a similar immunophenotypic pattern to those seen in the sinus mass.

Recently, we isolated natural killer (NK) cell-derived EVs (NK-EVs) from ex vivo expansion of NK cell cultures. The isolated NK-EVs contained cytotoxic proteins and several activated caspases, and they induced apoptosis in target cells. In this report, the protein levels of cytotoxic proteins from NK-EV isolates were analysed by ELISA. The mean values of perforin (PFN, 550 ng/mL), granzyme A (GzmA, 185 ng/mL), granzyme B (GzmB, 23.4 ng/mL), granulysin (GNLY, 56 ng/mL), and FasL (2.5 ng/mL) were obtained from >60 isolations using dot plots. The correlation between cytotoxicity and cytotoxic protein levels was examined by linear regression. PFN, GzmA, GzmB, GNLY all had a positive, moderate correlation with cytotoxicity, suggesting that there is not a single cytotoxic protein dominantly involved in killing and that all of these proteins may contribute to cytotoxicity. To further explore the possible killing mechanisms, cells were treated with NK-EVs, proteins extracted and lysates assessed by Western blotting. The levels of Gzm A substrates, SET and HMG2, were diminished in targeted cells, indicating that GzmA may induce a caspase-independent death pathway. Also, cytochrome C was released from mitochondria, a central hallmark of caspase-dependent death pathways. In addition, several ER-associated proteins were altered, suggesting that NK-EVs may induce ER stress resulting in cell death. Our results indicate that multiple killing mechanisms are activated by NK-derived EVs, including caspase-independent and -dependent cell death pathways, which can mediate cytotoxicity against cancer cells.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation (HSCT) is a form of cell-based therapy, which replaces the HSC in the patient's bone marrow but also serves as a T-cell therapy due to the Graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect mediated by donor T cells transferred with the graft. Allogeneic HSCT provides one potentially curative option to patients with relapsed or refractory leukemia but Graft-vs.-Host-Disease (GVHD) is the main cause of non-relapse mortality and limits the therapeutic benefit of allogeneic HSCT. Metabolism is a common cellular feature and has a key role in the differentiation and function of T cells during the immune response. Naive T cells and memory T cells that mediate GVHD and GVL, respectively, utilize distinct metabolic programs to obtain their immunological and functional specification. Thus, metabolic targets that mediate immunosuppression might differentially affect the functional program of GVHD-mediating or GVL-mediating T cells. Components of the innate immune system that are indispensable for the activation of alloreactive T cells are also subjected to metabolism-dependent regulation. Metabolic alterations have also been implicated in the resistance to chemotherapy and survival of malignant cells such as leukemia and lymphoma, which are targeted by GVL-mediating T cells. Development of novel approaches to inhibit the activation of GVHD-specific naive T cell but maintain the function of GVL-specific memory T cells will have a major impact on the therapeutic benefit of HSCT.

In this study, we analyzed the outcome of 84 patients at 3 years of follow-up after first-line treatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) induction followed by 36 months of rituximab maintenance thearpy. MRD was assessed by a quantitative four-color flow cytometry panel with a sensitivity level of 10(-4) Eighty out of 84 evaluable patients (95.2%) achieved at least a partial response or better at the end of induction. After clinical evaluation, 74 patients went into rituximab maintenance and the primary endpoint was assessed in the final analysis at 3 years of follow-up. Bone marrow (BM) MRD analysis was performed after the last planned induction course and every 6 months in cases with detectable residual disease during the 36 months of maintenance therapy. Thirty-seven patients (44%) did not have detectable residual disease in the BM prior to maintenance therapy. Interestingly, 29 patients with detectable residual disease in the BM after induction no longer had detectable disease in the BM following maintenance therapy. After a median followup of 6.30 years, the median overall survival (OS) and PFS had not been reached in patients with either undetectable or detectable residual disease in the BM, who had achieved a complete response at the time of starting maintenance therapy. Interestingly, univariate analysis showed that after rituximab maintenance OS was not affected by IGHV status (mutated vs unmutated OS: 85.7% alive at 7.2 years vs 79.6% alive at 7.3 years, respectively). As per protocol, 15 patients (17.8%), who achieved a complete response and undetectable peripheral blood and BM residual disease after four courses of induction, were allowed to stop fludarabine and cyclophosphamide and complete two additional courses of rituximab and continue with maintenance therapy for 18 cycles. Surprisingly, the outcome in this population was similar to that observed in patients who received the full six cycles of the induction regimen. These data show that, compared to historic controls, patients treated with FCR followed by rituximab maintenance have high-quality responses with fewer relapses and improved OS. The tolerability of this regime is favorable. Furthermore, attaining an early undetectable residual disease status could shorten the duration of chemoimmunotherapy, reducing toxicities and preventing long-term side effects. The analysis of BM MRD after fludarabine-based induction could be a powerful predictor of post-maintenance outcomes in patients with CLL undergoing rituximab maintenance and could be a valuable tool to identify patients at high risk of relapse, influencing further treatment strategies.

A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were performed to elucidate the clinical significance of minimal residual disease with respect to relapse-free survival and overall survival in precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A total of 23 articles and abstracts, most published between 2012 and 2016, were identified for inclusion in the primary meta-analysis. Typically, patients were in their first complete remission at the time of minimal residual disease assessment; in two studies, all patients were in their second, or later, complete remission. The primary analysis revealed improved relapse-free survival across all studies for patients who achieved minimal residual disease negativity (random effects hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.91-2.86). Improved overall survival for patients who achieved minimal residual disease negativity was also observed (hazard ratio, 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.63-2.94).

During disease maintenance, WT Ezh2 exerts an oncogenic function that may be therapeutically targeted. In contrast, Ezh2 acts as a tumor suppressor during AML induction. Transcriptional analysis explains this apparent paradox, demonstrating that loss of Ezh2 derepresses different expression programs during disease induction and maintenance. During disease induction, Ezh2 loss derepresses a subset of bivalent promoters that resolve toward gene activation, inducing a feto-oncogenic program that includes genes such as Plag1, whose overexpression phenocopies Ezh2 loss to accelerate AML induction in mouse models.

CLL remains incurable, and novel approaches to refractory CLL are needed. Our group has previously described trispecific killer engager (TriKE) molecules that redirect NK cell function against tumor cells. TriKE reagents simultaneously bind an activating receptor on NK cells, CD16, and a tumor antigen while also providing an NK cell expansion signal via an interleukin-15 moiety. Here we developed the novel CD19-targeting 161519 TriKE. We demonstrate that 161519 TriKE induced killing of a CD19-expressing Burkitt's lymphoma cell line and examined the impact on primary CLL targets using healthy donor and patient NK cells. 161519 TriKE induced potent healthy donor NK cell activation, proliferation, and directed killing. Furthermore, 161519 TriKE rescued the inflammatory function of NK cells obtained from CLL patient peripheral blood samples. Finally, we show that 161519 TriKE induced better directed killing of CLL in vitro when compared with rituximab. In conclusion, 161519 TriKE drives a potent activating and proliferative signal on NK cells, resulting in enhanced NK cell expansion and CLL target killing.

Because of difficulties in identifying such antigens, viral or model antigens have so far been used to study their biological relevance. We here identify a naturally existing human T-cell epitope derived from a truncated protein. The antigenic peptide is derived from the gene TTK only through an alternative transcript containing a premature termination codon that may target the transcript for nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). This antigen is recognized by HLA-A*02:01-restricted CD8(+) T cells derived from an allotransplanted leukemia patient. Functional analyses showed that these T cells failed to recognize several HLA-matched primary leukemic cells that expressed the alternative TTK transcript. Conventional antigen processing and presentation were not affected, suggesting that leukemic cells modify the generation of antigens processed from aberrant proteins. This natural TTK epitope provides insights in the source of transcripts producing antigenic epitopes in healthy and leukemic cells.

Furthermore, it is closely related to anaphylactic diseases, multiple sclerosis, chromosomal aneuploidy, aneuglobulinemia, B lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma. Herein we review the structure and biological function of BLNK and its role in B cell-related diseases. BLNK can cooperate with a series of effective proteins to activate BCR signaling pathway, thereby regulating the development, maturation and function of B cells. The functional mutation of BLNK can destroy the homeostasis of B cells and affect the development and maturation of B cells, which leads to the occurrence of B cell related diseases.

Cytoplasmic vacuolation-associated cell death represents a novel type of non-apoptotic cell-death. Here, we showed that isobavachalcone (IBC), a naturally occurring chalcone compound, selectively induced cell death with massive cytoplasmic vacuolation in some leukemic cells but not in normal peripheral blood cells. Although the IBC-induced cell death displayed certain apoptotic changes, the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK did not significantly suppress IBC-induced cell death. IBC-induced vacuoles are acidic in nature, as revealed by neutral red staining. However, these vacuoles could not be labeled by lysosome or mitochondrial trackers. Moreover, the knockdown of several autophagy-related genes, such as LC3, Beclin-1, and ATG7, did not inhibit IBC-induced vacuolation. Transmission electron microscope examination revealed that these vacuoles mainly derived from the endosome. Surprisingly, Vacuolar-type H + -ATPase inhibitors, weak bases, such as chloroquine and AKT inhibitors, markedly abrogated vacuolization but enhance IBC-induced cell death, suggesting that IBC-induced vacuolation and cell death go into different direction and the vacuolization is a protective action rather than a part of the death mechanism. In conclusion, by using IBC as a chemical probe, we provide new characteristics of methuosis-like cell death.

Recent research has found that most pancreatic cancers develop resistance to the current first-line chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine (Gem), and high expression of Mcl-1 can reduce the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to Gem chemotherapy. Therefore, novel strategies, such as combination therapy, to overcome resistance of Gem chemotherapy are needed urgently. Here, we employed a lipid-based delivery system (LPs) to codeliver Mcl-1 siRNA and Gem for pancreatic cancer treatment, named LP-Gem-siMcl-1. LP-Gem-siMcl-1 exhibited an increased cellular uptake, enhanced Mcl-1 down-regulation efficacy, and significant cytotoxicity in the human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines PANC-1 and BxPC-3. Furthermore, tumor inhibition in vivo proved that LP-Gem-siMcl-1 has higher anti-tumor efficiency than LP-siMcl-1 plus LP-Gem, indicating the synergistic anti-tumor effects of Gem and siMcl-1. Meanwhile, histological analysis demonstrated that LPs could efficiently co-deliver Gem and Mcl-1 siRNA to cancerous cells and overcome the resistance of Gem.

Both immunotherapies target the CD19-positive B-cell neoplasms. Kymriah is indicated for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia and large B-cell lymphoma. Yescarta is indicated for lymphoma only. Although the new therapy offers a promise for patients with advanced disease, it is associated with adverse events including neurotoxicity and cytokine release syndrome, which can be fatal and may require a high level of multidisciplinary supportive care. Due to the risks, both Kymriah and Yescarta are subject to Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) protocols. As active members of multidisciplinary clinical teams, pharmacists are likely to be responsible for the execution of Kymriah and Yescarta REMS programs.

This study explores the potential for enhancing the killing ability of NK cells by co-culturing the NK cells with the target cells under a static magnetic field (SMF). In this study, NK92-MI cell lines were cultured in the presence of a 0.4-T SMF. The effect of the SMF on NK cell viability was evaluated by means of an MTT assay. Culturing tests were performed with inhibitors of the DAG/IP3, STAT3, ERK, JNK and p38 pathways in order to examine the possible signaling cascade responsible for the SMF effect on the NK92-MI cell viability. Finally, the effect of the SMF on the cytotoxicity of the NK92-MI cells was evaluated by co-culturing the NK cells with K562 leukemia cell lines. The results showed that the application of a 0.4-T SMF significantly increased (p < 0.05) the viability of the NK92-MI cells. Furthermore, the inhibitor tests indicated that the SMF affected cell viability by activating multiple MAPK signaling pathways (ERKs, JNKs, and p38-MAPK). Finally, SMF pre-exposure for 48 hr significantly improved the killing activity of the NK92-MI cells (p < 0.05). That is, pre-exposure to SMF increased the viability of the NK92-MI cells and improved their killing ability against K562 tumor cells. In general, the present results suggest that NK cells pre-exposed to 0.4-T SMF show potential as a tool for immune-therapy treatment of cancer.",,"['Lin, Shu-Li', 'Su, Yi-Tsai', 'Feng, Sheng-Wei', 'Chang, Wei-Jen', 'Fan, Kan-Hsin', 'Huang, Haw-Ming']","['Lin SL', 'Su YT', 'Feng SW', 'Chang WJ', 'Fan KH', 'Huang HM']","['a Dental Department , Cathay General Hospital , Taipei , Taiwan.', 'b Graduate Institute of Biomedical Materials and Tissue Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan.', 'c School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan.', 'd School of Dentistry, College of Oral Medicine , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan.', 'e Dental Department , En Chu Kong Hospital , New Taipei City , Taiwan.', 'b Graduate Institute of Biomedical Materials and Tissue Engineering, College of Biomedical Engineering , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan.', 'c School of Oral Hygiene, College of Oral Medicine , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan.', 'f Graduate Institute of Biomedical Optomechatronics, College of Biomedical Engineering , Taipei Medical University , Taipei , Taiwan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190319,England,Electromagn Biol Med,Electromagnetic biology and medicine,101133002,,,"['*Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*cytology', '*Magnetic Fields', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Time Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Static magnetic field', 'cytotoxicity', 'immunotherapy', 'natural killer cell']",2019/03/21 06:00,2019/08/16 06:00,['2019/03/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15368378.2019.1591439 [doi]'],ppublish,Electromagn Biol Med. 2019;38(2):131-142. doi: 10.1080/15368378.2019.1591439.

Given that arsenic trioxide is able to arrest neuroblastoma cell cycle in the G2/M phase, the present study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to investigate whether the combination of arsenic trioxide with mitosis-phase-specific antineoplastic agents (vinorelbine or docetaxel) or non-mitosis-phase-specific antineoplastic agents (etoposide or cisplatin) exert synergistic effects in cytotoxicity on the human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell line. METHODS: Neuroblastoma cells were either incubated with one of the four drugs individually, or preincubated with arsenic trioxide and then followed by another drug when cell cycle was arrested at the G2/M phase with the highest proportion. RESULTS: The results of the present study revealed that arsenic trioxide potentiated the apoptotic rate of neuroblastoma cells induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. The present study further demonstrated that preincubation with arsenic trioxide followed by a mitosis-phase-specific antineoplastic agent result in a higher cytotoxicity effect compared with a non mitosis-phase-specific antineoplastic agent. Along with the enhanced cytotoxicity in combination group, the cell cycle distribution demonstrated a decreased proportion of G2/M phase in the combination group. CONCLUSION: The in vitro study revealed that the pre-application of arsenic trioxide followed by mitosis-phase-specific antineoplastic agents potentiate the cytotoxic effects on neuroblastoma cells, therefore arsenic trioxide may be a promising therapeutic option for treating neuroblastoma.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

After adoptive cell transfer, the CD40L(+) CAR T cells displayed superior antitumor efficacy, licensed antigen-presenting cells, enhanced recruitment of immune effectors, and mobilized endogenous tumor-recognizing T cells.

Donor-derived allo-immune responses eliminate the residual host hematopoiesis and protect against relapse. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation (CMV-R) after allo-SCT may trigger anti-leukemic effects. The impact of CMV-specific CD8+ T-cells (CMV-CTLs) on the outcome after allo-SCT is currently unknown. Here, we studied the relationship between CMV-CTLs, overall T-cell reconstitution and relapse incidence in 103 patients with acute leukemia (n = 91) or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 12) following CMV-seropositive recipient/donor (R+/D+) allo-SCT. Patients were subdivided based on the presence or absence of CMV-CTLs at 3 months after allo-SCT. Presence of CMV-CTLs was associated with preceding CMV-R and a fast T-cell reconstitution. Univariate analysis showed a significantly lower 1-, 2- and 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in patients with CMV-CTLs compared to those without CMV-CTLs. Multivariable regression analysis of the outcome performed with other relevant parameters chosen from univariate analysis revealed that presence of CMV-CTLs and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) were the only independent factors associated with a low CIR. Onset of relapse was significantly later in patients with CMV-CTLs (median 489 days) than in in those without (median 152 days, p = 0.041) during a five-year follow-up. Presence of CMV-CTLs was associated with a lower incidence of early relapses (1 and 2-years), while cGvHD lead to a lower incidence of late relapses (2 to 5-years). In conclusion, our data show that CMV-CTLs indicate a functional immune-reconstitution protective against early relapse.",,"['Varanasi, Pavankumar Reddy', 'Ogonek, Justyna', 'Luther, Susanne', 'Dammann, Elke', 'Stadler, Michael', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Borchers, Sylvia', 'Hambach, Lothar', 'Weissinger, Eva M']","['Varanasi PR', 'Ogonek J', 'Luther S', 'Dammann E', 'Stadler M', 'Ganser A', 'Borchers S', 'Hambach L', 'Weissinger EM']","['Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'German Center for Infection Research (DZIF) Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'RHEACELL GmbH & Co.

The aim of this study was to explore the survival of breast cancer patients with second primary malignancy, and to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy on the risk of different cancer sites. METHOD: Obtaining data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, we calculated the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for second primary malignancy in breast cancer survivors between 2000 and 2014. Overall survival and cancer-specific survival were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier method. Then, we further conducted stratified sub-analyses according to chemotherapy. RESULTS: The overall risk of second primary cancer for all sites was significantly elevated in breast cancer patients (SIR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.14-1.16). Overall survival and cancer-specific survival of the patients with breast cancer only were significantly better than the patients with multiple primary cancers (both P < 0.001). Chemotherapy was associated with increased incidences for all sites, except lymphoma, myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SIR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.88; SIR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.71-1.01; SIR = 0.57, 95% CI 0.43-0.74, respectively). The risk for developing second acute myeloid leukemia after chemotherapy in breast cancer patients varied with age and latency. CONCLUSION: Female breast cancer patients showed higher incidence of second primary malignancy, which was associated with poorer prognosis. Chemotherapy benefits should be weighed against the risks of second primary malignancy.",,"['Wei, Jin-Li', 'Jiang, Yi-Zhou', 'Shao, Zhi-Min']","['Wei JL', 'Jiang YZ', 'Shao ZM']","[""Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, 270 Dong-An Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, 270 Dong-An Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China."", ""Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, 270 Dong-An Road, Shanghai, 200032, People's Republic of China. zhimin_shao@yeah.net."", ""Cancer Institute, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. zhimin_shao@yeah.net."", ""Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. zhimin_shao@yeah.net.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190319,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*chemically induced/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', '*SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Breast cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Second primary malignancy', 'Survival']",2019/03/20 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2018/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-019-01430-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-019-01430-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2019 Aug;24(8):934-940. doi: 10.1007/s10147-019-01430-0.

It participates by regulating multiple cellular signaling pathways, including B cell receptor and FcR signaling cascades. BTK is abundantly expressed and constitutively active in the pathogenesis of B cell hematological malignancies, as well as several autoimmune diseases. Therefore, BTK is considered as an attractive target for treatment of B-lineage lymphomas, leukemias, and some autoimmune diseases. Many industry and academia efforts have been made to explore small molecular BTK inhibitors. AREAS COVERED: This review aims to provide an overview of the patented BTK inhibitors for the treatment of cancer from 2010 to 2018. EXPERT OPINION: BTK inhibitors attract much interest for their therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancers and autoimmune diseases, especially for B cell hematological malignancies. In 2013, ibrutinib was approved by the FDA as the first-in-class BTK inhibitors for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and now it is also undergoing clinical evaluation for other indications in either single or combined therapy. It is clear that BTK inhibitors can provide a promising clinical benefit in treating B-lineage lymphomas and leukemias.",,"['Feng, Yifan', 'Duan, Weiming', 'Cu, Xiaochuan', 'Liang, Chengyuan', 'Xin, Minhang']","['Feng Y', 'Duan W', 'Cu X', 'Liang C', 'Xin M']","[""a Department of Medicinal Chemistry, School of Pharmacy, Health Science Center , Xi'an Jiaotong University , Xi'an , Shaanxi P.R.

However, the biological function of PHF6 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has been poorly characterized. Materials and Methods: In this study, we first determined the mRNA levels of PHF6 in HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues using quantitative real-time PCR. Then the expression of PHF6 was knocked down in HCC cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721, and Bel-7402) by siRNA transfection. A series of functional experiments, including EdU proliferation assay, colony formation assay, and Transwell assay, were performed in HCC cells. Western blot analysis was used to detect the expression of PHF6, E-cadherin, and Vimentin. Results: We found that PHF6 was significantly elevated in HCC tissues and positively correlated with TNM stage, differentiation, and lymph node metastasis. Silencing PHF6 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration in HCC cells. Furthermore, silencing PHF6 obviously increased E-cadherin and decreased Vimentin expression. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PHF6 plays a positive role in the growth of HCC cells, and targeting PHF6 could serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for human HCC.",,"['Yu, Qiangfeng', 'Yin, Libo', 'Jian, Yizeng', 'Li, Pengtao', 'Zeng, Wenlong', 'Zhou, Jianyin']","['Yu Q', 'Yin L', 'Jian Y', 'Li P', 'Zeng W', 'Zhou J']","['1 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the Second Hospital of Longyan, Longyan, China.', '2 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Nanfang Hospital Affiliated to Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', '3 Molecular OncoSurgery, Section Surgical Research, Department of General, Visceral & Transplant Surgery, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', '1 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the Second Hospital of Longyan, Longyan, China.', '4 Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.', '1 Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the Second Hospital of Longyan, Longyan, China.', '4 Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190319,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (VIM protein, human)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vimentin/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['E-cadherin', 'HCC', 'PHF6', 'Vimentin', 'cell proliferation', 'migration']",2019/03/20 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2018.2671 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2019 May;34(4):245-251. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2018.2671.

The trial included patients after rituximab-containing induction treatment in first or second line that had achieved at least a PR. A randomization to rituximab maintenance treatment (375 mg/m(2) q3 months for 2 years) vs observation was performed. In this cohort 22% of the patients (58/263) were classified as obese. The baseline response to induction treatment was inferior in obese patients with a lower CR rate (43.1% vs 60.5% in obese vs non-obese, P = 0.018) and with a lower rate of patients achieving MRD negativity after chemoimmunotherapy induction treatment (19.6% vs 35.8%, P = 0.02).

This study describes the most prevalent skin manifestations in HTLV carriers attended at the clinic of Nucleo de Medicina Tropical (NMT) of the Universidade Federal do Para (UFPA) in Belem, Para, Brazil. METHODS: This is a study of a series of cases of patients infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2) treated at NMT UFPA between 1999 and 2016. A descriptive analysis of data was applied. RESULTS: Among 788 surveyed medical records in the service, 15.10% (n = 119) were referred to the dermatology clinic. From the series of cases that presented with skin lesions, 66.39% were female and 33.61% were male, and the average age of this group was 48 years. There was a predominance of patients with noninfectious inflammatory manifestations (64.2%), followed by infectious ones (24.6%), and 1.58% with lymphoproliferative diseases. As for the group of lesions, 45.26% of the erythematous-squamous type were observed, followed by dyschromia (24.21%), and eczematous (14.74%). One patient with a diagnosis of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, another with parapsoriasis, and four with infective dermatitis are highlighted. CONCLUSION: Skin disorders in the HLTV positive patient are important causes of referral to the dermatologist with etiological and skin lesions groups diversity. In the series of cases studied, lymphoproliferatives diseases and infective dermatitis associated with HTLV-1 were presented as a challenge for the diagnosis and clinical management of these patients.",['(c) 2019 The International Society of Dermatology.'],"['Andrade de Sousa, Brena', 'Dos Santos, Laisa V', 'Oliveira, Tamires R', 'Dias, Aline L', 'Araujo da Costa, Carlos', 'Medeiros Sousa, Rita C', 'de Sousa, Maisa S', 'Xavier, Marilia B']","['Andrade de Sousa B', 'Dos Santos LV', 'Oliveira TR', 'Dias AL', 'Araujo da Costa C', 'Medeiros Sousa RC', 'de Sousa MS', 'Xavier MB']","['Postgraduate Program in Parasitary Biology in the Amazon, Center of Biological and Health Sciences, State University of Para and Evandro Chagas Institute, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory on Skin diseases of Sanitary Interest, Center of Biological and Health Sciences, State University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Medicine course, Center of Biological and Health Sciences, State University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Medicine course, Center of Biological and Health Sciences, State University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Medicine course, Center of Biological and Health Sciences, State University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory in Tropical Dermatology and Endemic Diseases, Nucleus of Tropical Medicine, Federal University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory in Tropical Dermatology and Endemic Diseases, Nucleus of Tropical Medicine, Federal University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Nucleus of Tropical Medicine, Federal University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory on Skin diseases of Sanitary Interest, Center of Biological and Health Sciences, State University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.', 'Research Laboratory in Tropical Dermatology and Endemic Diseases, Nucleus of Tropical Medicine, Federal University of Para, Belem, Para, Brazil.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190319,England,Int J Dermatol,International journal of dermatology,0243704,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Carrier State/*epidemiology/virology', 'Dermatology/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'HTLV-II Infections/*epidemiology/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Referral and Consultation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Factors', 'Skin Diseases, Infectious/*epidemiology/virology', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/03/20 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2018/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijd.14422 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Dermatol. 2019 Aug;58(8):953-960. doi: 10.1111/ijd.14422.

While immune checkpoint-based therapy yielded impressive results in several advanced solid malignancies such as melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is still evolving. Areas covered: Here we review the immunology in the tumor microenvironment in the bone marrow and discuss the current preclinical and clinical data for immune checkpoint-based therapy in myeloid neoplasms. Expert commentary: Clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in AML and MDS are still in early stages and reported results so far have been modest especially for monotherapy use in the refractory settings. However, there are preliminary data for synergistic effects for combination of multiple ICI with hypomethylating agents and conventional chemotherapy. ICI might also be effective in eradicating minimal residual disease and to prevent relapse following induction chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Additional trials to provide insight into the efficacy and safety profile of immune checkpoint-based therapy, its optimal timing and potential combination with other types of therapy as well as identification of predictive biomarkers are needed.",,"['Bewersdorf, Jan Philipp', 'Stahl, Maximilian', 'Zeidan, Amer M']","['Bewersdorf JP', 'Stahl M', 'Zeidan AM']","['a Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.', 'b Department of Medicine, Section of Hematologic Oncology , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'a Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Hematology , Yale University School of Medicine , New Haven , CT , USA.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3352-0902'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190319,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*CTLA-4', '*PD-1', '*T-cells', '*combination therapy', '*immune checkpoint blockade', '*tumor immunology']",2019/03/20 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2019.1589374 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2019 May;19(5):393-404. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2019.1589374.

To achieve high cure rates, targeted therapy with retinoic acid (ATRA) must be started promptly at time of suspected diagnosis. Early death rates (EDRs, </=30 days from diagnosis) differ markedly in patients treated on clinical trials compared to the general population. OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We used the comprehensive Danish National Acute Leukemia Registry (DNLR) to investigate the incidence, treatment, EDR, and long-term clinical outcome in APL between 2000 and 2014. RESULTS: Twenty-two of 41 deaths occurring in 122 APL patients were EDs which were primarily caused by intracranial hemorrhage, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), sepsis, and multiorgan failure. The overall EDR was 18.0%, whereas clinical trial participants had an EDR of 6.7%. Fifteen patients recruited to the NCRI AML17 APL trial from 2010 to 2013 were younger and had decreased mortality (HR 0.18, CI 0.04-0.86, P = 0.02) compared to contemporarily treated patients (n = 15) not recruited to a clinical trial. Performance status, leukemia origin, and Sanz-score were independent prognostic variables. CONCLUSIONS: The very low EDR for on-trial patients is not observed in the general cohort of APL patients.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and the Centre for Health Economics, both at the University of York, were commissioned as the independent evidence review group (ERG). The clinical-effectiveness data were from a multicentre randomised controlled trial that compared inotuzumab with standard of care (SoC), where SoC was the investigator's choice of chemotherapy. Inotuzumab demonstrated statistically significant improvements in response rates or in the proportion of patients progressing to haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) but failed to meet the second primary objective of longer overall survival. Treatment-emergent adverse events were more frequent in the SoC arm, except veno-occlusive disease, which was more frequent in the inotuzumab arm. The company's economic model split patients into three post-hoc subgroups and used a partitioned survival approach within each group, with a cure assumption 3 years after receiving HSCT. In contrast with the trial results, the economic model estimated substantial improvement in survival with inotuzumab compared with SoC, providing an additional 5.2 life-years and 2.2 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) using a discount rate of 1.5% per annum. The ERG's critique highlighted a number of concerns, including the use of a post-hoc post-randomisation patient subset for extrapolation, the choice of a 1.5% discount rate, the complexity of the parametric modelling, the assumption of further treatment benefit post-HSCT, the nature of the cure assumption, and the length of inpatient stay while receiving treatment. The combination of the ERG's adjustments resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound122,174 per QALY gained using Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and pound114,078 per QALY gained with parametric survival models fit to the trial data. The final determination of the appraisal followed four NICE Appraisal Committee meetings, an appeal by the company and other stakeholders, two patient access schemes, and a company response to each appraisal consultation. The final ICER post-consultation was between pound33,749 and pound37,497 per QALY gained compared with SoC (excluding the confidential discount for blinatumomab received as subsequent therapy).

However, the absence of immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IGH) production in this condition has not been fully elucidated. To address this issue, we retrospectively analyzed patients at our center with LC-PCM and found a group who had only split signals of IGH gene derived from 14q32/IGH translocations by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Six patients were identified with only split signals of the IGH gene derived from 14q32/IGH translocations. Five of these patients were newly diagnosed, while one had IgG-lambda PCM at presentation, which transformed to lambda LC-PCM after treatment. The translocation partners were identified in four patients: two cases of (11;14)(q13;q32) and two cases of (4;14)(p16;q32). The development of LC-PCM appears to be explained by the application of allelic exclusion in these patients, such that 14q32/IGH translocation in one allele contributes to the pathogenesis of PCM and the subsequent loss of the other allele is responsible for the loss of IGH production. These findings suggest that a FISH pattern of IGH with ""split and loss"" may constitute a unique subgroup of LC-PCM.",,"['Nishio, Yuji', 'Sakai, Hirotaka', 'Saiki, Yusuke', 'Uchida, Akiko', 'Uemura, Yu', 'Matsunawa, Manabu', 'Isobe, Yasushi', 'Kato, Masayuki', 'Tomita, Naoto', 'Miura, Ikuo']","['Nishio Y', 'Sakai H', 'Saiki Y', 'Uchida A', 'Uemura Y', 'Matsunawa M', 'Isobe Y', 'Kato M', 'Tomita N', 'Miura I']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan. hsakai@marianna-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, St. Marianna University School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Sugao, Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki, 216-8511, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2677-7769'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190318,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', '*Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/*genetics', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Allelic exclusion', 'Bence Jones protein', 'Chromosomal translocation', 'Class switch recombination', 'Immunoglobulin heavy-chain']",2019/03/20 06:00,2019/05/03 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02629-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02629-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 May;109(5):572-577. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02629-7.

The toxicity of the FLAG-IDA courses is generally more severe than for the FLAG courses, with marked neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. This study aims to compare the outcomes of both regimens in terms of morbidity, mortality and remission/transplant. No comparison has been reported so far in Pakistan or the rest of third world countries. METHODOLOGY: This retrospective study was conducted in Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant unit after approval from Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee. 76 leukemic patients treated with salvage chemotherapy were included. Our endpoints for patient outcome analysis included disease remission/relapse, HSCT following remission, morbidity, mortality, progression free survival and overall survival. Kaplan Meier curves were made in SPSS for survival analysis. RESULTS: A total of 76 patients were included from 2015 to July 2018. 49 patients were given FLAG, and 27 were given FLAG-IDA. 31.6% in FLAG-IDA achieved complete remission (CR)/complete remission with incomplete counts (CRi). 21% in FLAG-IDA made it to Bone marrow transplant (BMT) (67% of those in CR/CRi). 41.7% in FLAG achieved CR/CRi, and 27.8% in FLAG made it to BMT (67% of those in CR/CRi). Common complications in both regimens were infection, bleeding and other complications e.g., rash, diarrhea, mucositis, etc. A statistically significant difference was found between overall survival of the two regimens, p value 0.033.

The tyrosine kinase Btk is essentially required for the activation of NF-kappaB in BCR signaling through the canonical pathway of IKK-dependent phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of IkappaB-alpha, the main repressor of NF-kappaB. Here, we provide the evidence of an additional mechanism of NF-kappaB activation in BCR signaling that is Btk-dependent and IKK-independent. In DeFew B lymphoma cells, the anti-IgM stimulation of BCR activated Btk and NF-kappaB p50/p65 within 0.5 min in absence of IKK activation and IkappaB-alpha degradation. IKK silencing did not affect the rapid activation of NF-kappaB. Within this short time, Btk associated and phosphorylated IkappaB-alpha at Y289 and Y305, and, concomitantly, p65 translocated from cytosol to nucleus. The mutant IkappaB-alpha Y289/305A inhibited the NF-kappaB activation after BCR triggering, suggesting that the phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha at tyrosines 289 and 305 was required for NF-kappaB activation. In primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, Btk was constitutively active and associated with IkappaB-alpha, which correlated with Y305-phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and increased NF-kappaB activity compared with healthy B cells. Altogether, these results describe a novel mechanism of NF-kappaB activation in BCR signaling that could be relevant for Btk-targeted therapy in B-lymphoproliferative disorders. KEY MESSAGES: Anti-IgM stimulation of BCR activates NF-kappaB p50/p65 within 30 s by a Btk-dependent and IKK-independent mechanism. Btk associates and phosphorylates IkappaB-alpha at Y289 and Y305, promoting NF-kappaB activation. In primary CLLs, the binding of Btk to IkappaB-alpha correlates with tyrosine phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha and increased NF-kappaB activity.",,"['Pontoriero, Marilena', 'Fiume, Giuseppe', 'Vecchio, Eleonora', 'de Laurentiis, Annamaria', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Iaccino, Enrico', 'Mimmi, Selena', 'Pisano, Antonio', 'Agosti, Valter', 'Giovannone, Emilia', 'Altobelli, Annalisa', 'Caiazza, Carmen', 'Mallardo, Massimo', 'Scala, Giuseppe', 'Quinto, Ileana']","['Pontoriero M', 'Fiume G', 'Vecchio E', 'de Laurentiis A', 'Albano F', 'Iaccino E', 'Mimmi S', 'Pisano A', 'Agosti V', 'Giovannone E', 'Altobelli A', 'Caiazza C', 'Mallardo M', 'Scala G', 'Quinto I']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy. fiume@unicz.it.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catanzaro ""Magna Graecia"", Viale Europa, Germaneto, 88100, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine and Medical Biotechnology, University of Naples ""Federico II"", Via S.

Multiparametric phenotyping by mass cytometry extended possibilities for immunoprofiling. However, careful optimization of each step of such method is necessary for obtaining reliable results. Also, with respect to procedure length and costs, sample preparation, staining, and storage should be optimized. Here, we designed a panel of 31 antibodies which allows for identification of several subpopulations of lymphoid and myeloid cells in a solid tumor and peripheral blood simultaneously. For sample preparation, disaggregation of tumor tissue with two different collagenases combined with DNase I was compared, and removal of dead or tumor cells by magnetic separation was evaluated. Two possible procedures of barcoding for single-tube staining of several samples were examined. While the palladium-based barcoding affected the stability of several antigens, the staining with two differently labeled CD45 antibodies was suitable for cells isolated from a patient's blood and tumor. The storage of samples in the intercalation solution for up to two weeks did not influence results of the analysis, which allowed the measurement of samples collected within this interval on the same day.

In this paper, we investigated Usnea Acid (UA) as MDR reversal agent on hematologic K562/ADR cells via ROS dependent apoptosis. Methods: CCK8 assay was used to measure cell viability rate of K562/ADR. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cell cycle distribution, cell apoptosis were measured with flow cytometry, respectively. Proteins related to apoptosis were measured by Western blot. Intracellular Adriamycin accumulation was observed by confocal microscopy and measured by flow cytometry. Results: In vitro study showed intracellular Adriamycin accumulation was remarkably increased by UA. Cell viability treated with Adr (4 muM) was decreased from 89.8% +/- 4.7 to 32% +/- 8.9 by combined with UA (4 muM). Adr-induced apoptosis and G1/G0 phase cell cycle arrest were remarkably increased by UA, as well as, intracellular ROS level. However, MDR reversing activity of UA was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger. Conclusion: These data provide compelling evidence that UA is a promising agent against MDR in leukemia cell line and suggest a promising therapeutic approach for leukemia.",,"['Wang, Wenjing', 'Niu, Shubin', 'Qiao, Luxin', 'Wei, Feili', 'Yin, Jiming', 'Wang, Shanshan', 'Ouyang, Yabo', 'Chen, Dexi']","['Wang W', 'Niu S', 'Qiao L', 'Wei F', 'Yin J', 'Wang S', 'Ouyang Y', 'Chen D']","['Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.', 'School of biomedicine, Beijing City University, No. 6 Huanghoudian Road Haidian District, Beijing, 100094, China.', 'Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.', 'Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.', 'Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.', 'Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.', 'Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.', 'Capital Medical University Affiliated Beijing You An Hospital, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Institute of Hepatology, Beijing, 100069, China.', 'Beijing Precision Medicine and Transformation Engineering Technology Research Center of Hepatitis and Liver Cancer, 100069, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6896-6640'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190211,United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0W584PFJ77 (usnic acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzofurans/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']",,,2019/03/20 06:00,2019/07/19 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/08 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/8727935 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Feb 11;2019:8727935. doi: 10.1155/2019/8727935. eCollection 2019.,PMC6388510,,,,,,,,['Biomed Res Int. 2021 Dec 22;2021:9808613.

Therefore, a case-control study was conducted to estimate the seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in this patient group and to identify risk factors and possible routes of infection. Serum samples were collected from 339 children with leukemia and 339 age matched health control subjects in Qingdao from September 2014 to March 2018. Enzyme linked immunoassays were used to screen anti- T. gondii IgG and anti- T. gondii IgM antibodies. Forty-eight (14.2%) children with leukemia and 31 (9.1%) control subjects were positive for anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies (P < 0.05), while 13 (3.8%) patients and 14 (4.1%) controls were positive for anti-T. gondii IgM antibodies (P = 0.84). Multivariate analysis showed exposure to soil and a history of blood transfusion were risk factors for T. gondii infection. Compared with IgG, patients with a history of blood transfusion were more likely to present anti- T. gondii IgM (P = 0.003). Moreover, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia had higher T. gondii seroprevalence in comparison to control subjects (P = 0.002 and P = 0.016, respectively). The results indicated that the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in children with leukemia is higher than that of healthy children in Eastern China.

The family consists of p53, p63 and p73 proteins, which share similar structure and function. Activation of wild-type p53 or TAp73 in tumors leads to tumor regression, and small molecules restoring the p53 pathway are in clinical development. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a metabolite of aminolevulinic acid, is a clinically approved drug applied in photodynamic diagnosis and therapy. PpIX induces p53-dependent and TAp73-dependent apoptosis and inhibits TAp73/MDM2 and TAp73/MDM4 interactions. Here we demonstrate that PpIX is a dual inhibitor of p53/MDM2 and p53/MDM4 interactions and activates apoptosis in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells without illumination and without affecting normal cells. PpIX stabilizes p53 and TAp73 proteins, induces p53-downstream apoptotic targets and provokes cancer cell death at doses non-toxic to normal cells.

Using 3D hydrodynamic flow focusing, cells are streamed single file through an ultrasound beam where ultrasound scattering events from each individual cell are acquired. The ultrasound operates at a center frequency of 375 MHz with a wavelength of 4 mum; when the ultrasound wavelength is similar to the size of a scatterer, the power spectra of the backscattered ultrasound waves have distinct features at specific frequencies that are directly related to the cell size. Our approach determines cell sizes through a comparison of these distinct spectral features with established theoretical models.

The incidence and characteristics across different TKI have not been systematically analyzed. We analyzed 531 patients treated with frontline TKIs in different prospective trials: imatinib 400 mg (n = 71) and 800 mg (n = 203), nilotinib (n = 108), dasatinib (n = 106), and ponatinib (n = 43). Characteristics and incidence of new-onset CV-AEs and AT-AEs were analyzed. Poisson regression models assessed factors associated with AE incidence. Median follow-up was 94 months (range, 2-195). Overall, 237 patients (45%) developed CV-AEs and 46 (9%) developed AT-AEs. Hypertension was the most common AE seen in 175 patients (33%; grade 3/4 in 17%). CV-AE and AT-AE incidence ratios (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 8.6 (7.6-9.8) and 1.7 (1.2-2.2) per 100 person-years. Among the TKIs, ponatinib showed the highest IR (95% CI) for CV-AEs and AT-AEs at 40.7 (27.9-59.4) and 9.0 (4.1-20.1). In multivariate analysis, ponatinib therapy was associated with increased incidence rate ratio (IRR) for CV-AEs (4.62; 95% CI, 2.7-7.7; P < .0001) and AT-AEs (6.38; 95% CI, 1.8-21.8; P < .0001) compared with imatinib 400. In summary, there is an increased risk of CV-AEs (except hypertension) and AT-AEs in CML patients treated with newer TKIs, particularly with ponatinib. Patients on TKIs must be informed and closely monitored for vascular AEs.

EGFR inhibition through NOTCH enriches lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). Src through Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activates NOTCH. Signal transduction and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation occurs upon EGFR blockade and regulates the generation of CSCs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Aldefluor assay kit, we investigated the enrichment of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells in EGFR-mutation-positive cells treated with gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib. Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in CSC marker expression upon EGFR blockade. We performed gene expression analysis in a cohort of EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. We evaluated the association of gene expression with treatment outcomes. RESULTS: The cell subpopulation surviving EGFR inhibition had high ALDH activity and elevated CSC marker expression. Concurrent inhibition of EGFR, STAT3, and Src diminished the CSC subpopulation in an EGFR-mutation-positive cellular model. In a cohort of 64 EGFR-mutation-positive patients, 2 ALDH1 isoforms and the NOTCH target hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), when highly expressed, were predictive of worse outcome to EGFR blockade. The gene expression of B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) that maintains the self-renewal of stem cells was also related to treatment outcome. CONCLUSION: Single EGFR inhibitors increase the population of CSCs. Combinatory therapy targeting STAT3 and Src may be of potential benefit. ALDH1, HES1, and Bmi-1 are essential biomarkers in the initial assessment of EGFR-mutation-positive patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the dynamic relationship between local oxygen levels and the immune surveillance of tumors by tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes (TIL) remains unclear. This situation reflects a methodological difficulty in visualizing oxygen gradients in living tissue in a manner that is suitable for spatiotemporal quantification and contextual correlation with individual cell dynamics tracked by typical fluorescence reporter systems. METHODS: Here, we devise a regimen for intravital oxygen and cell dynamics co-imaging, termed 'Fast' Scanning Two-photon Phosphorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FaST-PLIM). Using FaST-PLIM, we image the cellular motility of T-lymphocytes in relation to the microscopic distribution of oxygen in mouse models of hematological and solid tumors, namely in bone marrow with or without B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and in lungs with sarcoma tumors. RESULTS: Both in bone marrow leukemia and solid tumor models, TILs encountered regions of varying oxygen concentrations, including regions of hypoxia (defined as pO2 below 5 mmHg), especially in advanced-stage ALL and within solid tumor cores. T cell motility was sustained and weakly correlated with local pO2 above 5 mmHg but it was very slow in pO2 below this level. In solid tumors, this relationship was reflected in slow migration of TIL in tumor cores compared to that in tumor margins. Remarkably, breathing 100% oxygen alleviated tumor core hypoxia and rapidly invigorated the motility of otherwise stalled tumor core TILs. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a versatile and highly contextual FaST-PLIM method for phosphorescence lifetime-based oxygen imaging in living animal tumor immunology models. The initial results of this method application to ALL and solid lung tumor models highlight the importance of oxygen supply for the maintenance of intratumoral T cell migration, define a 5 mmHg local oxygen concentration threshold for TIL motility, and demonstrate efficacy of supplementary oxygen breathing in TIL motility enhancement coincident with reduction of tumor hypoxia.",,"['Rytelewski, Mateusz', 'Haryutyunan, Karine', 'Nwajei, Felix', 'Shanmugasundaram, Meenakshi', 'Wspanialy, Patrick', 'Zal, M Anna', 'Chen, Chao-Hsien', 'El Khatib, Mirna', 'Plunkett, Shane', 'Vinogradov, Sergei A', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Zal, Tomasz']","['Rytelewski M', 'Haryutyunan K', 'Nwajei F', 'Shanmugasundaram M', 'Wspanialy P', 'Zal MA', 'Chen CH', 'El Khatib M', 'Plunkett S', 'Vinogradov SA', 'Konopleva M', 'Zal T']","['Department of Immunology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, U902, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, 77054, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, U902, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, 77054, TX, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, U902, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, 77054, TX, USA.', 'School of Engineering, University of Guelph, Guelph, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, U902, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, 77054, TX, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, U902, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, 77054, TX, USA.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Biophysics and of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Biophysics and of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Departments of Biochemistry and Biophysics and of Chemistry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, U902, 7455 Fannin St, Houston, 77054, TX, USA. tzal@mdanderson.org.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3469-4261'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190318,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,['S88TT14065 (Oxygen)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Tracking', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted', 'Lung Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*secondary', 'Lymphocytes, Tumor-Infiltrating/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton/*methods', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Oxygen/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/immunology', 'Sarcoma/*diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphocytic leukemia', '*Intravital microscopy', '*Lung sarcoma tumors', '*PLIM', '*T cell motility', '*Tissue oxygenation', '*Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes', '*Tumor microenvironment', '*Two-photon lifetime imaging']",2019/03/20 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2019/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-019-0543-y [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-019-0543-y [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Mar 18;7(1):78. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0543-y.,PMC6423744,,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EB018464/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 NS092986/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CIHR/Canada', 'R01 CA155056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA137059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal treatment for these patients remains unclear. To treat these patients, we designed a new salvage regimen consisting of decitabine, cladribine, cytarabine, and granulocyte-stimulating factor (D-CLAG). CASE PRESENTATION: Here, we describe a case of acute monocytic leukemia with a complex karyotype in a 38-year-old female patient who relapsed after her first HSCT, which was performed using a matched sibling donor. The patient did not respond to standard induction chemotherapy and subsequently achieved complete remission with the D-CLAG regimen. No severe hematological or extramedullary toxicity was observed. Subsequently, the patient received a second D-CLAG regimen as a bridge therapy and directly underwent haploidentical related HSCT. Following HSCT, the marrow showed complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission. Currently, 1 year after transplantation, the patient's general condition remains good. CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that the D-CLAG regimen can be an option for reinduction in relapsed refractory AML patients as a bridge to transplantation.

Antagonism of pro-death Bcl-2 homology (BH) proteins to pro-survival BH members such as Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 has become a treatment approach, but previous studies suggest that a combined inhibition of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 is necessary. TW-37 inhibits Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 with almost the same affinity. However, single-agent cytotoxicity of TW-37 in neuroblastoma cell lines has not been investigated. METHODS: Cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation and changes in growth properties were determined in SKNAS, IMR-5, SY5Y and Kelly cells after treatment with TW-37. After transfection with Mcl-1 or Bcl-2 siRNA, apoptosis and proliferation were investigated in Kelly cells. Mice with Kelly cell line xenografts were treated with TW-37 and tumor growth, survival and apoptosis were determined. RESULTS: Cell lines with N-Myc amplification were more sensitive to TW-37 treatment, IC50 values for IMR-5 and Kelly cells being 0.28 muM and 0.22 muM, compared to SY5Y cells and SKNAS cells (IC50 0.96 muM and 0.83 muM). Treatment with TW-37 resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation rates, especially in IMR5 and Kelly cells. Bcl-2 as well as Mcl-1 knockdown induced apoptosis in Kelly cells. TW-37 led to a decrease in tumor growth and a favorable survival (p = 0.0379) in a Kelly neuroblastoma xenografts mouse model. CONCLUSION: TW-37 has strong single-agent cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, combined inhibition of Bcl-2/Mcl-1 by TW-37 in N-Myc amplified neuroblastoma may represent an interesting therapeutic strategy.",,"['Klenke, Stefanie', 'Akdeli, Neval', 'Stelmach, Patrick', 'Heukamp, Lukas', 'Schulte, Johannes H', 'Bachmann, Hagen S']","['Klenke S', 'Akdeli N', 'Stelmach P', 'Heukamp L', 'Schulte JH', 'Bachmann HS']","['Institute of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'NEO New Oncology AG, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institute of Hematopathology Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Charite Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacogenetics, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany. hagen.bachmann@uni-wh.de.', 'Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Center for Biomedical Education and Research (ZBAF), School of Medicine, Faculty of Health, Witten/Herdecke University, Stockumer Str 10, 58453, Witten, Germany. hagen.bachmann@uni-wh.de.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190318,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYCN protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (TW-37 compound)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'N-Myc Proto-Oncogene Protein/genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2', 'Mcl-1', 'Neuroblastoma, apoptosis', 'TW-37']",2019/03/20 06:00,2019/07/19 06:00,['2019/03/20 06:00'],"['2018/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5439-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5439-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Mar 18;19(1):243. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5439-1.,PMC6423774,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine if intrathecal (IT) dose intensification during induction would improve outcomes and reduce CNS relapse for CNS2 disease. METHODS: From January 2001 to December 2014, children (1-14 years) with newly diagnosed ALL were treated at the Princess Noorah Oncology Centre (PNOC) following modifications of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols. We intensified IT methotrexate (ITM) during induction for patients with CNS2 disease. Patients were evaluated for overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR). RESULTS: 449 children with T-cell (14.3%) or B-cell (85.7%) ALL were treated using PNOC-SR or PNOC-HR regimens (Jan 2001- Dec 2007) or CALL08 regimens (Arm A [SR], Arm B [IR], and Arm C [HR]) (Jan 2008 - Dec 2014). The 5-year OS, DFS, and CIR were 87.2 +/- 1.6%, 81.7 +/- 1.9%, and 13.0 +/- 1.7%, respectively. The OS and DFS of patients with CNS2 were significantly superior to that of patients with CNS3 (P = 0.025 and P = 0.019, respectively). Patients with CNS2 had similar OS and DFS to those with CNS1. None of the patients with CNS2 at initial diagnosis experienced CNS relapse. CONCLUSIONS: ITM intensification during induction was associated with elimination of CNS recurrence in patients with CNS2 disease and childhood ALL.

The definition of hormone has evolved in the last years. Hormones are considered in the context of cell(-)cell communication and mechanisms of cellular signaling. The best-known mechanisms of this kind are chemical receptor-mediated events, the cell(-)cell direct interactions through synapses, and, more recently, the extracellular vesicle (EV) transfer between cells. Recently, it has been extensively demonstrated that EVs are used as a way of communication between cells and that they are transporters of specific messenger signals including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Circulating ncRNAs in body fluids and extracellular fluid compartments may have endocrine hormone-like effects because they can act at a distance from secreting cells with widespread consequences within the recipient cells.

However, the physiology of this sexual precocity is still unclear. To understand sexual precocity in male microminipigs, we analyzed their testes at five developmental stages: neonatal (<7 days), 30-day-old, 45-day-old, 80-day-old, and adult (>24 months) stages. We used 4 pigs in each of the stages. To analyze testicular development histologically, the seminiferous tubule diameter (SD) was measured, and the presence or absence of the seminiferous lumen was confirmed. Changes in the expression of pluripotency markers, DBA, UCHL1, ZBTB16, and vimentin, were evaluated immunohistologically. For the analyses, cells positive for DBA, UCHL1, and ZBTB16 per 150 round seminiferous tubules in cross sections from each testis were counted to evaluate the total number of positive cells. The number of positive cells per 100 Sertoli cells (DBA+/Sertoli, UCHL1+/Sertoli, and ZBTB16+/Sertoli) was calculated to compare the five developmental stages. Histologically, SDs became larger with piglet growth, and precocity was confirmed; seminiferous lumens were observed from the 30-day-old stage. Immunohistologically, the number of DBA+/Sertoli, which indicates the number of gonocytes, decreased rapidly to an undetectable level by the 45-day-old stage. In the same period, the number of UCHL1+/Sertoli, which indicates total SSCs, increased significantly, suggesting that the proliferation of SSCs was accelerated before 30 days of age. Consequently, our study clarified that differentiation of SSCs in microminipigs started during the fetal period, the differentiation of gonocytes and proliferation of SSCs was then accelerated before 30 days of age, and the early phase of spermatogenesis was finally completed at around 45 days after birth. Consequently, sexual precocity in male microminipigs was characterized by a shorter duration of the early phase of spermatogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Cases that were included had at least 1 year of follow-up after the diagnosis of PTLD. We studied 82 patients with first-episode PTLD. Median age at diagnosis was 6.4 years (IQR 3.2-12.3 years). The most frequent PTLD sites were tonsillar/adenoidal (T/A [34%]) and gastrointestinal (32%), followed by miscellaneous (defined as less common sites including central nervous system, kidney, lung, and soft tissue [12%]), lymph node (11%), and multisite (11%). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that T/A PTLD was associated with decreased all-cause mortality compared with PTLD at other sites (log-rank 0.004), even after adjustment for histological subtype (P = .047). PTLD-related mortality was also decreased among T/A PTLD (log-rank 0.012) but showed a trend toward significance only after adjustment for histological subtype (P = .09). Among first episodes of PTLD, T/A PTLD was associated with a survival advantage compared with PTLD at other sites, even after adjustment for potential confounders. Based on our observations, we propose a clinical categorization of PTLD according to anatomical site of occurrence.","['(c) 2019 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of', 'Transplant Surgeons.']","[""L'Huillier, Arnaud G"", 'Dipchand, Anne I', 'Ng, Vicky L', 'Hebert, Diane', 'Avitzur, Yaron', 'Solomon, Melinda', 'Ngan, Bo-Yee', 'Stephens, Derek', 'Punnett, Angela S', 'Barton, Michelle', 'Allen, Upton D']","[""L'Huillier AG"", 'Dipchand AI', 'Ng VL', 'Hebert D', 'Avitzur Y', 'Solomon M', 'Ngan BY', 'Stephens D', 'Punnett AS', 'Barton M', 'Allen UD']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Labatt Family Heart Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Nephrology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Respiratory Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Pathology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, London Health Sciences Centre, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Infectious Diseases, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Transplant and Regenerative Medicine Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9230-7285', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6323-7222', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8072-5727', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2326-7731']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190422,United States,Am J Transplant,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,100968638,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Organ Transplantation/adverse effects/*mortality', 'Postoperative Complications/etiology/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)', '*cancer/malignancy/neoplasia', '*classification systems', '*clinical research/practice', '*hematogenous/leukemia/lymphoma', '*hematology/oncology', '*infection and infectious agents - viral', '*infectious disease', '*patient survival', '*pediatrics', '*posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)']",2019/03/19 06:00,2020/09/05 06:00,['2019/03/19 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ajt.15358 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Transplant. 2019 Oct;19(10):2764-2774. doi: 10.1111/ajt.15358.

HYA024 strain. This naturally occurring substance was reported to show remarkable cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines HeLa and DG-75 and in vivo antitumor activity against murine leukemia P388 cell line. Herein, the total synthesis, stereochemical revision, and biological assessment of iriomoteolide-2a are reported in detail. Total synthesis of the proposed structure 1 of iriomoteolide-2a featured a late-stage convergent assembly of three components by a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling, an esterification, and a ring-closing metathesis. However, the NMR data of synthetic 1 were not identical to those of the natural product. Careful analysis of the NMR data of the authentic material and synthesis/NMR analysis of appropriately designed model compounds led to consideration of four possible stereoisomers 2-5 as candidates for the correct structure. Accordingly, total syntheses of 2-5 were achieved by taking advantage of the convergent strategy, and comparison of the NMR spectra of synthetic 2-5 with those of the natural product led to the conclusion that 5 shows the correct relative configuration of iriomoteolide-2a. The absolute configuration of this natural product was finally established through chiral HPLC analysis of synthetic 5/ent-5 with the authentic sample. The antiproliferative activity of the synthetic compounds was assessed against HeLa and A549 cells to show that, in contrast to expectation, synthetic 5 and ent-5 were only marginally active in these cell lines. This work clearly underscores the vital role of total synthesis in the establishment of the structure and biological activity of natural products.","['(c) 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Objective: To analyze overall survival trends and other outcomes among infants who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cohort study, we used time-trend analysis to evaluate 3 periods: 2000 through 2004, 2005 through 2009, and 2010 through 2014. The study was conducted in a multicenter setting through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, which is made up of a voluntary working group of more than 450 transplant centers worldwide. Two groups of infants aged 1 year or younger in 2 cohorts were included: those with malignant conditions, such as leukemia, and those with nonmalignant disorders, including immunodeficiencies. Data analysis was conducted from July 2017 to December 2018. Exposures: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Main Outcomes and Measures: Survival trends, disease relapse, and toxicity. Results: A total of 2498 infants with a median age of 7 months (range, <1-12 months) were included. In the nonmalignant cohort (n = 472), survival rates improved from the first to the second period (hazard ratio, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.63-0.93]; P = .007) but did not change after 2004. Compared with infants with nonmalignant diseases (n = 2026; 3-year overall survival: 2000-2004, 375/577 [65.0%]; 2005-2009, 503/699 [72.0%]; and 2010-2014, 555/750 [74.0%]), those with malignant conditions had poorer survival rates, without improvement over time (3-year overall survival: 2000-2004, 109/199 [54.8%]; 2005-2009, 104/161 [64.6%]; and 2010-2014, 66/112 [58.9%]). From 2000 through 2014, relapse rates increased in infants with malignant conditions (3-year relapse rate: 2000-2004, 19% [95% CI, 14%-25%]; 2005-2009, 23% [95% CI, 17%-30%]; 2010-2014, 36% [95% CI, 27%-46%]; P = .01). Sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was frequent, occurring with a cumulative incidence of 13% (95% CI, 11%-16%) of infants with nonmalignant diseases and 32% (95% CI, 22%-42%) of those with malignant diseases. Generally, recipients of human leukocyte antigen-identical sibling bone marrow grafts had the best outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: Survival rates have not improved for infants with malignant diseases over the 15-year study period. Infants with nonmalignant diseases had improved survival rates in the earlier but not the later study period. Higher relapses for the malignant cohort and toxicities for all infants remain significant challenges. Strategies to reduce relapse and toxicity and optimize donor and graft selection may improve outcomes in the future.",,"['Parikh, Suhag H', 'Satwani, Prakash', 'Ahn, Kwang Woo', 'Sahr, Natasha A',

Once formed and released from producer cells, these pseudovirions incorporate a luciferase reporter gene. Since they only contain the heterologous coronavirus spike protein on their surface, the particles behave like their native coronavirus counterparts for entry steps. As such, they are the excellent surrogates of native virions for studying viral entry into host cells. Upon successful entry and infection into target cells, the luciferase reporter gets integrated into the host cell genome and is expressed. Using a simple luciferase assay, transduced cells can be easily quantified. An important advantage of the procedure is that it can be performed in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) facilities instead of BSL-3 facilities required for work with highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Another benefit comes from its versatility as it can be applied to envelope proteins belonging to all three classes of viral fusion proteins, such as the class I influenza hemagglutinin (HA) and Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP), the class II Semliki forest virus E1 protein, or the class III vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein. A limitation of the methodology is that it can only recapitulate virus entry steps mediated by the envelope protein being investigated.

However, the mechanisms are unclear. This study was designed to explore the role of vimentin in regulating monocyte survival or apoptosis as well as inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to lipopolysaccharides (LPSs). METHODS: A human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was transfected with vimentin-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) or vimentin over-expressing plasmid. Apoptosis was assessed by TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) and DNA content assay. Immunoblotting was performed to detect apoptosis-associated proteins. Cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) were measured by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. Two-way analysis of variance followed by Student's t test was used to compare means between different groups. RESULTS: Suppression of vimentin in THP-1 cells resulted in increased apoptotic response in the presence of LPS, while over-expression of vimentin could prevent the cells from apoptosis in response to LPS. LPS alone or suppression of vimentin resulted in significant up-regulation of caspase-3 (1.42 +/- 0.20 of LPS alone and 1.68 +/- 0.10 of vimentin suppression vs. control, t = 5.21 and 10.28, respectively, P < 0.05). In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) was significantly increased (IL-6: 577.90 +/- 159.90 pg/day/10 cells vs. 283.80 +/- 124.60 pg/day/10 cells of control, t = 14.76, P < 0.05; TNF-alpha: 54.10 +/- 5.80 vs. 17.10 +/- 0.10 pg/day/10 cells of control, t = 6.71, P < 0.05), while anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) was significantly up-regulated in the THP-1 cells that over-expressed vimentin (140.9 +/- 17.2 pg/day/10 cells vs. undetectable in control cells). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the vimentin may regulate innate immunity through modulating monocytes viability as well as inflammatory response in sepsis through shifting the balance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.",,"['Su, Long-Xiang', 'Pan, Pan', 'Wang, Xiao-Ting', 'Long, Yu', 'Liu, Da-Wei', 'Zhou, Xiang']","['Su LX', 'Pan P', 'Wang XT', 'Long Y', 'Liu DW', 'Zhou X']","['Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100070, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.', 'Department of Critical Care Medicine, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Peking Union Medical College, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing 100730, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vimentin)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Vimentin/*pharmacology']",,,2019/03/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CM9.0000000000000187 [doi]'],ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2019 Jun 5;132(11):1336-1343. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000187.,PMC6629360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutropenic patients are prone to infections, experience poorer clinical outcomes, and require expensive medical care. Although transfusions of donor neutrophils are a logical solution to neutropenia, this approach has not gained clinical traction, primarily due to challenges associated with obtaining sufficiently large numbers of neutrophils from donors whilst logistically managing their extremely short shelf-life. A protocol has been developed that produces clinical-scale quantities of neutrophils from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) in 10 L single-use bioreactors (1). This strategy could be used to mass produce neutrophils and generate sufficient cell numbers to allow decisive clinical trials of neutrophil transfusion. We present a bioprocess model for neutrophil production at relevant clinical-scale. We evaluated two production scenarios, and the impact on cost of goods (COG) of multiple model parameters including cell yield, materials costs, and process duration. The most significant contributors to cost were consumables and raw materials, including the cost of procuring HSPC-containing umbilical cord blood. The model indicates that the most cost-efficient culture volume (batch size) is ~100 L in a single bioreactor.

It has been demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-2-associated athanogene 3 (BAG3) is induced by proteasome inhibitors in various cancer cells and serves an important role in chemotherapy resistance. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/RAC-alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) pathway is constitutively activated in a number of lymphoid malignancy types, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Burkitt lymphoma. In the present study, the aim was to elucidate the role of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the induction of BAG3, following exposure to a proteasome inhibitor in DLBCL cell lines. Bortezomib and MG132 were used as proteasome inhibitors. Western blotting was used to evaluate the roles of proteasome inhibitors and the PI3K/AKT pathway in BAG3 induction in DLBCL cells (LY1 and LY8), and LY294002 was used to block the PI3K/AKT pathway. Cell viability was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Apoptosis of LY1 and LY8 cells was quantified by Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D flow cytometry. The BAG3 protein was markedly induced upon exposure to bortezomib and MG132 in a dose-dependent manner. The PI3K/AKT inhibitor LY294002 significantly suppressed the induction of BAG3 by proteasome inhibitors. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway decreased the proliferation and increased the apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibitors. The present results indicated that the PI3K/AKT pathway is associated with the activation of BAG3 expression in DLBCL cells, and is involved in the protective response against proteasome inhibition.",,"['Yuan, Ting', 'Zhang, Feng', 'Zhou, Xiangxiang', 'Li, Ying', 'Zhang, Ya', 'Xu, Yangyang', 'Wang, Xin']","['Yuan T', 'Zhang F', 'Zhou X', 'Li Y', 'Zhang Y', 'Xu Y', 'Wang X']","['Department of Hematology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, P.R.

Nucleophosmin-1 (NPM-1) is associated with good prognosis while internal tandem duplication of the fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 gene (FLT3-ITD) confers a poor prognosis. Knowledge of the status of these mutations in AML patients not only guides treatment decisions but also helps in predicting response to frontline induction and consolidation chemotherapy as well as the risk of relapse and overall survival. Our objectives were to determine the prevalence, clinico-haematological features and immunophenotypic characteristics of AML patients with FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation and to evaluate the response to induction therapy (CR) and disease free survival (DFS) in this cohort of patients. Methods: Patients diagnosed as AML from March 2015 to March 2017 at Armed Forces Institute of Pathology Rawalpindi were included in the study. Clinico-haematologic and immunophenotypic parameters were noted and molecular analysis for FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutation was performed. Any correlation with cytogenetics or other molecular markers was also studied. Response to standard induction chemotherapy and disease-free survival were assessed. Results: A total of 108 cases of AML were analyzed. Median age was 35 years and 64.8% were males. The median age of the study group was 35 years. Of these, 70 (64.8%) were males while 38 (35.2%) were females. Twenty-nine (26.9%) patients were NPM1 positive, twelve (11.1%) were FLT3-ITD positive while eight (7.4%) were positive for both mutations. Patients with NPM1 mutations were associated with female gender, higher haemoglobin level and platelet counts while those with FLT3-ITD mutations were predominantly seen in male patients and had significantly higher WBC counts, bone marrow blasts, biopsy cellularity and LDH levels. CR rates of NPM1 positive, FLT3-ITD positive and both mutation positive groups were 72%, 60% and 71%, respectively. The median disease-free survival was significantly lower in the FLT3-ITD positive group (7.1 months) as compared to the NPM1 positive group (16.1 months). The median disease-free survival was 12 months and 11.9 months in the NPM1 positive/FLT3-ITD positive and the NPM1 negative/FLT3-ITD negative groups, respectively. Conclusion: AML patients harbouring NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations have distinct clinical and haematological characteristics.

However, the complete remission rate of AML is still not optimistic, especially in elderly patients, and the recurrence rate after complete remission is still high. The resistance of leukemia cells to chemotherapy drugs becomes the main obstacle in the treatment of AML. At present, the research on the mechanisms of drug resistance in AML is very active.

Dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), a novel chemotherapeutic agent, exhibited antitumor properties in acute myeloid leukemia stem cells and showed an increased drug concentration in the brain. This study aims to investigate the specific anticancer activities and mechanisms of DMAMCL in glioma cells. Materials and methods: In this study, the effects of DMAMCL were evaluated and characterized in U87-MG and U251 glioma cells. Cell viability was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8. Apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. Autophagosome formation was observed with transmission electron microscopy, and the autophagy flux was measured by transfecting cells with mRFP-GFP-LC3 adenoviral vectors. Immunofluorescence and Western blot analyses were used to determine the expression of proteins. Results: In the present study, treatment with DMAMCL decreased cell viability and induced apoptosis in U87-MG and U251 glioma cells. Additionally, DMAMCL activated autophagy-mediated cell death as evidenced by the formation of autophagosomes, accumulation of LC3B-II, inhibition of autophagy flux, and increase in cell viability after cotreatment with an autophagy inhibitor. Subsequent experiments showed that the DMAMCL-induced apoptosis and autophagy were possibly mediated by ROS generation and Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibition. On the other hand, the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine and the Akt activator insulin-like growth factor-1 attenuated the DMAMCL-induced autophagy and cell death. Conclusion: Our findings revealed that DMAMCL induced apoptosis and autophagic cell death by regulating the ROS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway and suppressing the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway in human glioma cells.

Clinical trials have demonstrated compelling overall response and survival rates in individuals with B-cell malignancies. The current approved agents target CD19, an antigen commonly overexpressed in B-cell hematologic and other malignancies. OBJECTIVES: This article provides information on the current state of the science related to commercially available CAR T-cell products and examines how CAR T-cell science is evolving. METHODS: An overview of pathophysiology, indications, and nursing implications of the currently approved CAR T-cell agents is presented. Future directions for CAR T-cell development and treatment indications are discussed. FINDINGS: Tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah(R)) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta(R)) received approval in 2017 for the treatment of B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia in pediatric and young adult patients, and relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy in adult patients, respectively.

Several clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of a fluoroquinolone prophylaxis to prevent bacterial infection in patients being prone to prolonged profound neutropenia. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the efficacy and complications of levofloxacin as a prophylaxis for FN patients following chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Two databases from MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for published studies indexed before 10 July 2018. RESULTS: A total of 862 acute leukemia patients were included, with 356 in the levofloxacin prophylaxis arm and 506 in the no-prophylaxis arm. Patients receiving levofloxacin had a significantly lower FN rate than patients who did not receive the antibiotic prophylaxis (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.32-0.58, p < .00001, I(2) = 0%). The rate of microbiologically documented infection in the no-prophylaxis group was higher than that for the levofloxacin prophylaxis group (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.34-0.60, p < .00001, I(2) = 0%). The bacteremia rate in the levofloxacin prophylaxis group was significantly lower than that for the no-prophylaxis group (OR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.31-0.66, p < .00001, I(2) = 0%). However, the mortality rates of the two groups were quite similar between the two groups (OR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.34-1.33, p = .26, I(2) = 0%).

METHODS: We investigated, using the medical records of 85 consecutive CML patients who received TKIs between December 2001 and August 2016 at our hospital, reasons for discontinuation, duration of TKI treatment before discontinuation, molecular response (MR) status at TKI discontinuation, treatment-free remission (TFR) duration, and overall survival after TKI discontinuation. RESULTS: TKI therapy was discontinued in 21 patients. The median treatment duration before discontinuation was 68.3 months. The response statuses at discontinuation were MR(4) (n = 2), MR(4.5) (n = 4), and >/=MR(5) (n = 15). The reasons were pleural effusion (n = 5); requests for prolonged deep molecular response (DMR) (n = 4); ischemic heart disease, anemia, and economic problems (each, n = 3); renal dysfunction (n = 2); and hyperkalemia, diarrhea, dementia, asthma, and desire to get pregnant, (each, n = 1). All patients were alive with median follow-up period of 32.1 months. TFR was maintained in 14 patients, and the 2-year TFR proportion was 66.7%. Seven patients restarted TKI therapy and achieved MR(4) within median of 3 months. The duration of TKI administration before discontinuation (>/= 70 months) was favored longer TFR durations. CONCLUSION: TKI was safely discontinued in clinical practice and yielded TFR rates similar to those observed in previous clinical trials, regardless of reason.

Although a variety of salvage chemotherapy regimens may be used, response rates are unsatisfactory. This article summarizes current approaches and promising emerging strategies for the treatment of relapsed T-ALL. RECENT FINDINGS: Although nelarabine is the only agent approved specifically for T-ALL, recent studies have identified a variety of genetic alterations and signaling pathways that are critical in its pathogenesis. Based on these findings, a number of small-molecule inhibitors and other targeted therapies are being studied for relapsed T-ALL, including gamma-secretase inhibitors, BCL-2 inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and mTOR inhibitors. In addition, pre-clinical studies of chimeric antigen receptor T cells targeting CD5 and CD7 as well as the monoclonal antibody daratumumab have shown promising results for T-ALL. Relapsed T-ALL currently remains challenging to treat, but recent pre-clinical studies of targeted and immunotherapeutic agents have shown encouraging results.

METHODS: We investigated the relationship of ever use of 14 selected pesticide chemical groups and 33 individual active chemical ingredients with non-Hodgkin lymphoid malignancies (NHL) overall or major subtypes, in a pooled analysis of three large agricultural worker cohorts. Pesticide use was derived from self-reported history of crops cultivated combined with crop-exposure matrices (France and Norway) or self-reported lifetime use of active ingredients (USA). Cox regression models were used to estimate cohort-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were combined using random effects meta-analysis to calculate meta-HRs. RESULTS: During follow-up, 2430 NHL cases were diagnosed in 316 270 farmers accruing 3 574 815 person-years under risk. Most meta-HRs suggested no association. Moderately elevated meta-HRs were seen for: NHL and ever use of terbufos (meta-HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.00-1.39); chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma and deltamethrin (1.48, 1.06-2.07); and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and glyphosate (1.36, 1.00-1.85); as well as inverse associations of NHL with the broader groups of organochlorine insecticides (0.86, 0.74-0.99) and phenoxy herbicides (0.81, 0.67-0.98), but not with active ingredients within these groups, after adjusting for exposure to other pesticides. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of pesticides with NHL appear to be subtype- and chemical-specific. Non-differential exposure misclassification was an important limitation, showing the need for refinement of exposure estimates and exposure-response analyses.","['(c) World Health Organization, 2019.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect small meningiomas, but its potential value as a screening tool is unknown. METHODS AND MATERIALS: MRI was used to screen asymptomatic survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with cranial radiation therapy >/=10 years previously. The incidence of radiation-induced meningioma and outcomes of this group were compared with a historical cohort of survivors with the same exposure who underwent imaging only to investigate clinical signs or symptoms. RESULTS: One hundred seventy-six childhood leukemia survivors were included in this study: 70 in the screening group and 106 unscreened. Screening MRI was performed a median of 25 years after radiation therapy and detected meningioma in 15 (21.4%). In the unscreened group, 17 patients (16.0%) had neurologic symptoms leading to an MRI a median interval of 24 years after radiation therapy, 9 of whom (8.5%) were diagnosed with meningioma. There was no significant difference between screened versus unscreened patients in the size of meningioma (mean diameter, 1.6 cm vs 2.6 cm; P = .13), meningioma incidence (7.4% vs 4.0% at 25 years; P = .19), or extent of resection. Three patients had persistent neurologic symptoms in the unscreened group versus none among screened patients (P = .28). CONCLUSIONS: Screening MRI was able to detect small meningiomas that were not clinically apparent; however, we could not demonstrate a significant improvement in the chance of total resection or a significant decrease in morbidity. A larger sample could clarify potential reduction in neurologic sequelae associated with screening.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 165 patients with MDS and excess blasts (n=126, 76%) and sAML (n=39, 24%) according to a pretransplant strategy. Sixty-seven patients (41%) were directly transplanted (upfront group), whereas 98 patients (59%) had received pretransplant cytoreductive treatment (induction chemotherapy [CTX], n=64; hypomethylating agents [HMAs], n=34) resulting in a significantly higher complete remission rate in the CTX group (59% versus HMA 18%, P < .0001). Estimated rates of 5-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) for the entire group were 54% and 39%, respectively. The 5-year OS rates of the upfront, CTX, and HMA groups were 61%, 50%, and 45%, respectively (P=.116), whereas RFS rates were 38%, 41%, and 38% (P=.926). Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) did not differ between treatment groups. In the upfront group no difference regarding OS and RFS was seen with respect to pretransplant blast count (>10% versus <10%). In multivariate analyses type of pretransplant strategy did not have an effect on OS, RFS, CIR, and NRM, whereas cytogenetics (OS, RFS, CIR), reduced-intensity conditioning (OS, RFS, CIR), and an unrelated donor (RFS, CIR) were identified as negative predictors. When compared with the upfront group, 5-year OS was significantly lower in patients with CTX-refractory disease (34% versus 64%, P=.0346) and by clear trend in HMA nonresponders (42% versus 61%, P=.073), whereas RFS did not differ significantly. In further support of the concept, that pretransplant therapy may favor the selection of resistant clones, patients in the upfront group had a higher likelihood to respond to HMAs as salvage therapy for relapse in comparison with pretreated patients (complete remission, 58% versus 10%; P=.0005) and a higher 2-year OS rate after relapse (59% versus 19%, P=.0001). These data suggest that an upfront transplant strategy is at least not inferior to pretransplant cytoreduction and may be augmented by HMAs+donor lymphocyte infusion salvage therapy in case of relapse after allo-HSCT.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The literature on this subject is also limited. CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old man with bilateral ear nodules that progressed over two years. Biopsy of the right ear revealed a B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The patient responded to radiotherapy well. He received an additional dose two months after the initial treatment because of a remaining nodularity on the right earlobe. After several months, he presented a new lesion on his nasal tip, for which a biopsy confirmed a lymphoma relapse. The patient was managed with oral prednisone and low-dose radiation with a favourable response. DISCUSSION: This case highlights the importance of including lymphoma in the differential diagnosis of ear lesions from an otolaryngology perspective. A biopsy of any lesion or nodule with an atypical course should be considered for appropriate diagnosis and management.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

Hypomethylating agents have shown potential for treating medically unfit and elderly patients with AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the outcomes of elderly patients with AML treated with decitabine and intensive chemotherapy (IC). RESULTS: The data from 107 patients with newly diagnosed AML aged >/= 65 years were analyzed. The overall response rate was 38.6% and was significantly greater in the IC group than in the decitabine group (65.6% vs. 26.1%; P < .001). With a median follow-up duration of survivors of 14.8 months, the median overall survival (OS) and event-free survival were 12.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.0-14.7) and 2.0 months (95% CI, 2.0-2.0), respectively, which were not different between the 2 treatment groups. The FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutation (hazard ratio [HR], 2.637; 95% CI, 1.379-5.043; P = .003), complex karyotype (HR, 2.513; 95% CI, 1.258-5.020; P = .009), and peripheral blood blast percentage at diagnosis (HR, 1.983; 95% CI, 1.148-3.422; P = .014) were analyzed as independent prognostic factors for OS. A subgroup analysis for OS showed that IC was superior to decitabine for patients with the FLT3-internal tandem duplication mutation (P = .025) and poor risk cytogenetics, except for -7/del(7q) (P = .005), and decitabine was associated with longer OS for patients with -7/del(7q) (P = .077). CONCLUSION: Decitabine showed a similar OS to IC, despite the lower response rate in patients. The clinical outcomes of specific subgroups seemed to differ with different treatment options.

This study was designed to assess the rate of attainment of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets in patients receiving piperacillin/tazobactam therapy and to evaluate the effect on clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy for aggressive hematological malignancies were enrolled and treated with piperacillin/tazobactam 4 g/0.5 g every 6 h as initial antimicrobial therapy for first fever. Plasma drug concentrations were assayed at 50% and 100% of the dosing interval and compared with target MIC breakpoint of 16 mg/L to calculate the primary endpoints of 50% and 100% time above MIC (fT > MIC), respectively. Secondary endpoints included time to clinical cure, length of hospital stay, duration of antibiotics, and clinical treatment success. RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent (14/24) of patients achieved 50% fT > MIC while only 4% (1/24) achieved 100% fT > MIC. Higher creatinine clearance was significantly associated with lower trough drug concentration and appeared to be the dominant reason for the poor PK/PD target attainment. Median time to clinical cure, duration of antibiotic therapy, and hospital length of stay was 3, 13 and 21 days, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in these outcomes between patients who did and did not achieve 100% fT > MIC. CONCLUSIONS: A significant majority of febrile neutropenic patients fail to achieve PK/PD targets with 6-hourly piperacillin dosing, although the clinical implications of this finding are unclear. Larger studies are needed to assess any impact on morbidity and mortality.

RECENT FINDINGS: Addition of rituximab to standard chemotherapy improves survival in the frontline treatment of B cell ALL, and measurable residual disease (MRD) is the most important prognostic factor. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), particularly ponatinib, in combination with Hyper-CVAD significantly improve outcomes in Ph + ALL challenging the benefit of allogeneic stem cell transplant in first line for these patients. Blinatumomab, inotuzumab ozogamicin, and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are better options than chemotherapy alone for the treatment of relapsed or refractory ALL. Combination of these agents with chemotherapy and their incorporation in the frontline setting show promises to improve cure rates of ALL. Development of monoclonal antibodies, CAR T, and potent TKI has improved the outcome of ALL.

Hence in order to enhance the dosage in mitochondrial fraction of cinnamamides, the mitochondria-targeted derivatives were designed by the incorporation of cinnamamides into a fluorophore carrier of coumarin-3-carboxamide with a 1:1 stoichiometry. Using the amide linkers, twenty-one compounds were synthesized and the cytotoxicity against a panel of cancer cells (MCF-7, Hela, HepG2, HL-60) was tested. In particular, compound 18c displayed the potent cytotoxicity toward HL-60 leukaemia cells, which could quickly and efficiently entry into HL-60cells and specifically localize within mitochondria. And 18c preferred enrichment in HL-60cells than in PBMC normal cells, accounting for the higher toxicity to cancer cells than to normal cells. Moreover, the dissipations of mitochondrial membrane potential and enhancement of cellular ROS level were also preceded upon 18c treatment, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis/necrosis in HL-60cells. Besides, acted as a Michael acceptor, 18c initiated a thia-Michael addition reaction toward cysteamine (1:2 stoichiometry), detecting by the UV-Vis spectrum and HRMS analysis. This could result in the blue emission of 18c in mitochondria after the procedure of cell fixation, owing to the formation of covalent bond with mitochondrial thiols. Our study reported 18c might be useful for the further development into a mitochondria-targeted anti-leukemia agent and the Michael acceptor might be a versatile functional group.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Previously, we revealed that COBL is a hotspot for breakpoints in leukemia and could promote IKZF1 deletions. Through an international collaboration, we provide a detailed genetic and clinical picture of B-ALL with COBL rearrangements (COBL-r). Patients with B-ALL and IKZF1 deletion (n=133) were included. IKZF1 1-8 were associated with large alterations within chromosome 7: monosomy 7 (18%), isochromosome 7q (10%), 7p loss (19%), and interstitial deletions (53%). The latter included COBL-r, which were found in 12% of the IKZF1 1-8 cohort. Patients with COBL-r are mostly classified as intermediate cytogenetic risk and frequently harbor ETV6, PAX5, CDKN2A/B deletions. Overall, 56% of breakpoints were located within COBL intron 5. Cryptic recombination signal sequence motifs were broadly distributed within the sequence of COBL, and no enrichment for the breakpoint cluster region was found. In summary, a diverse spectrum of alterations characterizes DeltaIKZF1 and they also include deletion breakpoints within COBL. We confirmed that COBL is a hotspot associated with DeltaIKZF1, but these rearrangements are not driven by RAG-mediated recombination.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Recombinant human interleukin-11 (rhIL-11) is a cytokine that can stimulate thrombopoiesis and is commonly used to treat thrombocytopenia. We observed the side effects of rhIL-11 in 24 leukemia patients with chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia. To determine the cardiovascular effects of rhIL-11, we detected changes in the patients' serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), blood pressure fluctuations, weight change, and whether edema or heart failure occurred in leukemia patients after chemotherapy. The results showed that BNP was significantly elevated after using rhIL-11 (P < 0. 05) but regressed after 2-4 days. Furthermore, nine patients had edema and experienced weight gain, and four experienced acute left heart failure. In addition, the average blood pressure was 119/75 mmHg (range 139/86 mmHg to 99/64 mmHg) before rhIL-11 administration and 127/79 mmHg (range 146/89 mmHg to 108/69 mmHg) after rhIL-11 use. In conclusion, although rhIL-11 is useful for treating chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia, it is important to monitor the patients' clinical status and re-examine BNP levels frequently during the use of rhIL-11. Furthermore, senile patients should be given special attention.

The emergence of T334I and D381N point mutations in BCR-ABL1 confer drug resistance. Recent experimental studies show a synergistic effect in suppressing this resistance when Nilotinib and Asciminib are co-administered to target both the catalytic and allosteric binding site of BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein, respectively. However, the structural mechanism by which this synergistic effect occurs has not been clearly elucidated. To obtain insight into the observed synergistic effect, molecular dynamics simulations have been employed to investigate the inhibitory mechanism as well as the structural dynamics that characterize this effect. Structural dynamic analyses indicate that the synergistic binding effect results in a more compact and stable protein conformation. In addition, binding free energy calculation suggests a dominant energy effect of nilotinib during co-administration. van der Waals energy interactions were observed to be the main energy component driving this synergistic effect.

This enzyme belongs to the Polo-like kinases family, which is characterized by a regulatory domain named Polo-box domain (PBD). Rather than regular kinase inhibitors, this domain provides high selectivity to PLK1. Here, we report on four novel PLK1 PBD inhibitors identified by cytotoxicity screening and fluorescence polarization assay of a chemical library of natural and semisynthetic compounds. These compounds revealed two- to three-fold higher selectivity to the PDB of PLK1 than to those of the related family members, PLK2 and PLK3. These four substances inhibited tumor cell growth of sensitive CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells. The tested compounds increased the apoptotic cell fraction, which indicates apoptosis as a major mechanism of cell death. Cell cycle analysis showed compound (5) arrested the cell cycle of CCRF-CEM cells in the G2/M phase, while the other three molecules ((compound (3), compound (4), and compound (6)) exerted pronounced cytotoxicity with an increase of cells in the sub-G1 population. Molecular docking was performed for the understanding of ligand-protein interaction, the tested candidates showed strong binding affinity to PLK1 PBD.

Nevertheless, the identification of novel additional molecular alterations is of great interest, opening to new prognostic and therapeutic strategies for such heterogeneous hematological disease. We here describe a patient affected by CLL with a mutated IGHV status, showing a balanced t(1;3)(q23.1;q21.3) translocation and a der(18)t(1;18)(q24.2;p11.32), accompanying the recurrent 13q14 heterozygous deletion in all analyzed cells at onset. By combining whole-genome sequencing, SNP array, RNA sequencing, and FISH analyses, we defined a 1q23.1 biallelic minimally deleted region flanking translocations breakpoints at both derivative chromosome 1 homologues. The deletion resulted in the downregulation of the Fc receptor-like family genes FCRL1, FCRL2, and FCRL3 and in the lack of expression of FCRL5, observed by RT-qPCR. The mutational status of TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, MYD88, FBXW7, and XPO1 was investigated by targeted next-generation sequencing, detecting a frameshift deletion within NOTCH1 (c.7544_7545delCT).

In contrast, the role of CD8(+) T cells in the control of leukemia is less clear. We characterized the molecular signature of leukemia stem/progenitor cells (LSPCs) and paired CD8(+) T cells in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Epigenetic alterations via histone deacetylation reduced the expression of immune-related genes in bone marrow (BM)-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells. Surprisingly, a silenced gene expression pattern in CD8(+) T cells significantly correlated with an improved prognosis. To define interactions between CD8(+) T cells and LSPCs, we performed comprehensive correlative network modeling. This analysis indicated that CD8(+) T cells contribute to the maintenance/expansion of LSPCs, particularly in favorable risk AML. Functionally, CD8(+) T cells in favorable AML induced the expansion of LSPCs by stimulating the autocrine production of important hematopoietic cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-3. In contrast, LSPCs in aggressive AML were characterized by a higher activation of stemness/proliferation-related pathways and develop independent of BM CD8(+) T cells.

Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor Myb in AMLs driven by different combinations of CEBPA mutations. Using knockdown of Myb in murine cell lines modelling the spectrum of CEBPA mutations, we show that the effect of reduced Myb depends on the mutational status of the two Cebpa alleles. Importantly, Myb knockdown fails to override the block in myeloid differentiation in cells with biallelic N-terminal C/EBPalpha mutations, demonstrating for the first time that the dependency on Myb is much lower in AML with this mutational profile. By comparing gene expression following Myb knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing data for the binding of C/EBPalpha isoforms, we provide evidence for a functional cooperation between C/EBPalpha and Myb in the maintenance of AML. This co-dependency breaks down when both alleles of CEBPA harbour N-terminal mutations, as a subset of C/EBPalpha-regulated genes only bind the short p30 C/EBPalpha isoform and, unlike other C/EBPalpha-regulated genes, do so without a requirement for Myb.",['(c) 2019 Volpe et al.'],"['Volpe, Giacomo', 'Cauchy, Pierre', 'Walton, David S', 'Ward, Carl', 'Blakemore, Daniel', 'Bayley, Rachael', 'Clarke, Mary L', 'Schmidt, Luisa', 'Nerlov, Claus', 'Garcia, Paloma', 'Dumon, Stephanie', 'Grebien, Florian', 'Frampton, Jon']","['Volpe G', 'Cauchy P', 'Walton DS', 'Ward C', 'Blakemore D', 'Bayley R', 'Clarke ML', 'Schmidt L', 'Nerlov C', 'Garcia P', 'Dumon S', 'Grebien F', 'Frampton J']","['Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK g.volpe@bham.ac.uk.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Key Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, Joint School of Life Sciences, Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou, and Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Medical Research Council Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Medical Biochemistry, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK j.frampton@bham.ac.uk.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5000-6951', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0889-9025', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5181-9927', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5582-8575', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4289-2281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0456-8678']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190315,United States,Life Sci Alliance,Life science alliance,101728869,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transfection']",,,2019/03/17 06:00,2019/03/17 06:01,['2019/03/17 06:00'],"['2018/10/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/17 06:01 [medline]']","['2/2/e201800207 [pii]', '10.26508/lsa.201800207 [doi]']",epublish,Life Sci Alliance. 2019 Mar 15;2(2). pii: 2/2/e201800207. doi: 10.26508/lsa.201800207.

We found that visfatin, a 52-kDa adipokine, can positively regulate the proliferation of AML cells. Targeted inhibition of visfatin via its specific siRNAs or inhibitor can suppress the proliferation of AML cells. Further, knockdown of visfatin can increase the doxorubicin (Dox) and cisplatin (CDDP) sensitivity of AML cells. Among the tested six cytokines, si-visfatin can decrease the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17). Over expression of IL-17 can reverse si-visfatin suppressed cell proliferation and increased Dox sensitivity. The upregulation of IL-17 was also involved in visfatin induced activation of PI3K/Akt signals in AML cells. The inhibitor of PI3K/Akt can synergistically suppress the proliferation of HL60 cells which were transfected with si-visfatin. Knockdown of visfatin can increase the expression of miR-135a, which can bind to the 3'UTR of IL-17 and decrease its expression. The inhibitor of miR-135a can attenuate si-visfatin suppressed expression of IL-17 and proliferation of AML cells.

PML immunofluorescence (PML IF) identifies the microparticulate pattern of the PML protein localisation, highly specific for APL. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical utility of PML IF in a real-life setting based on a retrospective records review for all patients who had PML IF performed in our centre between 2000 and 2017. Final analysis included 151 patients, 70 of whom had APL. PML IF was reported on average 3 days faster than cytogenetics. Compared with genetic results, PML IF showed sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 100%. PML IF accurately predicted APL in four APL cases with cryptic karyotype/FISH and excluded APL in 98% cases tested based on the suspicious immunophenotype alone, 21/28 of whom had mutated NPM1. Results of PML IF influenced decision to start ATRA in 25 (36%) APL patients and led to its termination in six non-APL patients. In conclusion, PML IF is a fast and reliable test that facilitates accurate treatment decisions when APL is suspected. This performance of PML IF remains hard to match in a real-life setting.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

Accumulating evidence implicates the imprinted genes from this locus, DLK1 and MEG3, in the development and progression of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the contribution of this locus to the treatment response of patients and their survival is unknown. METHODS: DNA methylation of select CG dinucleotide-containing amplicons (CpG sites) within the DLK1-MEG3 locus and within differentially methylated regions of other imprinted loci was assessed in the mononuclear cells of 45 AML patients by combined bisulfite restriction analysis. Methylation results were compared with patient response to first-round induction therapy and overall survival. Multivariable analysis was employed to identify independent prognostic factors for patient overall survival in AML. RESULTS: Increased methylation at CpG sites within the MEG3 promotor region was observed in AML patients having longer overall survival. In addition, patients with shorter overall survival had increased expression of DLK1 and MEG3, and methylation at the MEG3-DMR CpG site inversely correlated with MEG3 expression. Multivariable analysis revealed that methylation at CG9, a non-imprinted CpG site within the MEG3 promotor region which contains a CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding DNA sequence, is an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival of AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our pilot study underscore the importance of the DLK1-MEG3 locus in AML development and progression. We identify CG9 methylation as an independent prognostic factor for AML patient survival, which suggests that distinct miRNA signatures from the DLK1-MEG3 locus could reflect varying degrees of cell stemness and present novel opportunities for personalized therapies in the future. These data provide a foundation for future studies into the role of higher-order chromatin structure at DLK1-MEG3 in AML.",,"['Sellers, Zachariah Payne', 'Bolkun, Lukasz', 'Kloczko, Janusz', 'Wojtaszewska, Marzena Liliana', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Moniuszko, Marcin', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z', 'Schneider, Gabriela']","['Sellers ZP', 'Bolkun L', 'Kloczko J', 'Wojtaszewska ML', 'Lewandowski K', 'Moniuszko M', 'Ratajczak MZ', 'Schneider G']","['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Allergology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine and Immune Regulation, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland. mzrata01@louisville.edu.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA. g0schn01@louisville.edu.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2088-8695'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190315,Germany,Clin Epigenetics,Clinical epigenetics,101516977,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DLK1 protein, human)', '0 (MEG3 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer stem cells', '*DLK1-MEG3', '*Imprinting', '*Leukemia', '*miRNAs']",2019/03/17 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/03/17 06:00'],"['2018/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13148-019-0643-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13148-019-0643-z [pii]']",epublish,Clin Epigenetics. 2019 Mar 15;11(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s13148-019-0643-z.,PMC6419839,,"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Quantitative real time PCR (QRT-PCR) and western blot were performed to determine the expression levels of IRF2, INPP4B and autophagy-related markers in AML cell lines. Autophagy was assessed by elevated Beclin-1 expression, the conversion of light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, downregulated p62 expression and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 puncta formation. The colony formation and apoptosis assays were performed to determine the effects of IRF2 and INPP4B on the growth of AML cells. RESULTS: IRF2 and INPP4B were highly expressed in AML cell lines, and were positively correlated with autophagy-related proteins. Overexpression of IRF2 or INPP4B stimulated autophagy of AML cells, whereas inhibition of IRF2 or INPP4B resulted in the attenuation of autophagy. More importantly, IRF2 or INPP4B overexpression reversed autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA)-induced proliferation-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects, while IRF2 or INPP4B silencing overturned the proliferation-promoting and anti-apoptotic effects of autophagy activator rapamycin.

It is traditionally described in the context of malnutrition and cachexia from generalized disease and is important to identify because of its potential reversibility. Several recent case reports have described GBMT in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) on the first-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib. Here, we describe a case of gelatinous transformation in a patient with CML receiving the second-generation TKI dasatinib who subsequently developed clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosome negative cells with excess peripheral blasts consistent with advanced secondary myelodysplastic syndrome. While the development of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Philadelphia-negative cells has been frequently described in the setting of TKI, most abnormalities are transient and generally do not effect disease progression and/or transformation like in this case. Remarkably, after TKI discontinuation, repeat bone marrow biopsies had markedly diminished amounts of gelatinous transformation - supporting reversible GBMT with TKI removal.

The aim of the present analysis was to assess the long-term safety with radium-223 in Japanese patients with mCRPC. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic mCRPC, >/= 2 bone metastases and no known visceral metastases received up to 6 injections of radium-223 (55 kBq/kg), one every 4 weeks. Adverse events (AEs) considered to be related to radium-223 were reported until 3 years after the first injection. Pre-specified conditions, such as acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, aplastic anemia, primary bone cancer, or other primary malignancies, were reported regardless of causality. RESULTS: Of the 49 patients enrolled in the study, 44 (89.8%) entered the survival follow-up period and 33 (67.3%) died. Throughout the entire study, there were no reports of second primary malignancy or other pre-specified conditions. Eight patients (16.3%) experienced post-treatment drug-related AEs, which were all hematological (anemia and decreased lymphocyte, platelet, and white blood cell counts). No serious post-treatment drug-related AEs were reported. Updated median OS was 19.3 months (95% CI: 14.2, 28.5). CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with symptomatic mCRPC and bone metastases, radium-223 had a favorable long-term safety profile with no second primary malignancies reported. Taken together with median OS, which was comparable to that in the pivotal phase III ALSYMPCA study, these results support continued benefit from radium-223 in Japanese patients with mCRPC.",,"['Uemura, Hirotsugu', 'Uemura, Hiroji', 'Nagamori, Satsohi', 'Wakumoto, Yoshiaki', 'Kimura, Go', 'Kikukawa, Hiroaki', 'Yokomizo, Akira', 'Mizokami, Atsushi', 'Kosaka, Takeo', 'Masumori, Naoya', 'Kawasaki, Yoshihide', 'Yonese, Junji', 'Nasu, Yasutomo', 'Fukasawa, Satoshi', 'Sugiyama, Takayuki', 'Kinuya, Seigo', 'Hosono, Makoto', 'Yamaguchi, Iku', 'Akagawa, Takashi', 'Matsubara, Nobuaki']","['Uemura H', 'Uemura H', 'Nagamori S', 'Wakumoto Y', 'Kimura G', 'Kikukawa H', 'Yokomizo A', 'Mizokami A', 'Kosaka T', 'Masumori N', 'Kawasaki Y', 'Yonese J', 'Nasu Y', 'Fukasawa S', 'Sugiyama T', 'Kinuya S', 'Hosono M', 'Yamaguchi I', 'Akagawa T', 'Matsubara N']","['Department of Urology, Kindai University Faculty of Medicine, 377-2, Ohno-Higashi, Osaka-Sayama, Osaka, 589-8511, Japan. huemura@med.kindai.ac.jp.', 'Department of Urology and Renal Transplantation, Yokohama City University Medical Center, 4-57, Urafune-cho, Minami-ku, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Cancer Center, 2-3-54 Kikusui 4 Jo, Shiroishi-ku, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Juntendo University, 2-2-1 Hongo Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5, Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, National Hospital Organization Kumamoto Medical Center, 1-5 Ninomaru, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Integrative Cancer Therapy and Urology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, 13-1 Takaramachi, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Tohoku University Hospital, 1-1, Seiryo-machi, Aoba-ku, Sendai, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 3-8-31, Ariake, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-5-1, Shikata, Okayama, Japan.', 'Prostate Center, Division of Urology, Chiba Cancer Center, 666-2, Nitona-cho, Chuo-ku, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1, Handayama, Higashi-ku, Hamamatsu, Japan.', 'The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine, 2-28-45, Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine, 2-28-45, Honkomagome, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Statistics, Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd, 2-4-9, Umeda, Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan.', 'Oncology Clinical Development, Bayer Yakuhin, Ltd, 2-4-9, Umeda, Kita-ku, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Breast and Medical Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, 6-5-1 Kashiwanoha, Kashiwa, Chiba, Japan.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3665-9523'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190314,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', 'RJ00KV3VTG (radium Ra 223 dichloride)', 'W90AYD6R3Q (Radium)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Aged', 'Anemia/chemically induced', 'Bone Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy/secondary', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant/mortality/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology', 'Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radium/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",['NOTNLM'],"['Bone metastases', 'Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer', 'Overall survival', 'Radium-223 dichloride', 'Safety']",2019/03/16 06:00,2019/07/11 06:00,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-018-01389-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-018-01389-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2019 May;24(5):557-566. doi: 10.1007/s10147-018-01389-4.

There is a real risk of succumbing to the treatment rather than the disease, and even so, cure is much less than certain. Since the establishment of complete remission as a prerequisite for cure in the 1960s, a number of years passed before advanced techniques for detecting minute amounts of disease matured sufficiently for clinical implementation. The two main techniques for detection of measurable residual disease (MRD) remain qPCR and multicolor flow cytometry. When performed in expert laboratories, both these modalities offer treating physicians excellent opportunity to follow the amount of residual disease upon treatment and offer unparalleled prognostication. In some AML and age group subsets, evidence now exist to support the choice of both proceeding to allogeneic transplant and not doing so. In other AML subgroups, MRD has sufficient discriminative power to identify patients likely to benefit from allogeneic transplant and patients likely not to. After treatment or transplantation, follow-up by molecular techniques can, with high certainty, predict relapse months before bone marrow function deterioration. On the other hand, options upon so-called molecular relapse are less well tested but recent evidence supports the use of azacitidine both in transplanted patients and patients consolidated with chemotherapy. In conclusion, MRD testing during treatment is a superb prognosticator and a major tool when choosing whether a patient should be transplanted or not. The exact use of MRD testing after treatment is less well defined but evidence is mounting for the instigation of treatment upon rising MRD levels (pre-emptive treatment) before morphologically detectable relapse.",,"['Roug, Anne Stidsholt', 'Ommen, Hans Beier']","['Roug AS', 'Ommen HB']","['Department of Hematology, Clinical Cancer Research Center, Aalborg University Hospital, Molleparkvej 4, DK-9000, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine, Aalborg University, Aalborg, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Palle-Juul Jensens Boulevard 99, DK-8200, Aarhus N, Denmark. hansomme@rm.dk.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190314,United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia, AML', '*Allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*Complete remission', '*Measurable residual disease, MRD', '*Multicolor flow cytometry', '*Pre-emptive treatment', '*Surveillance', '*qPCR']",2019/03/16 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11864-019-0627-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11864-019-0627-4 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2019 Mar 14;20(4):28. doi: 10.1007/s11864-019-0627-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is usually the case that the assumption of equal variances on the two groups is violated for many genes where a large number of them are required to be filtered or ranked. In these cases, exact tests are unavailable and the Welch's approximate test is most reliable one. The Welch's test involves two layers of approximations: approximating the distribution of the statistic by a t-distribution, which in turn depends on approximate degrees of freedom. This study attempts to improve upon Welch's approximate test by avoiding one layer of approximation. RESULTS: We introduce a new distribution that generalizes the t-distribution and propose a Monte Carlo based test that uses only one layer of approximation for statistical inferences. Experimental results based on extensive simulation studies show that the Monte Carol based tests enhance the statistical power and performs better than Welch's t-approximation, especially when the equal variance assumption is not met and the sample size of the sample with a larger variance is smaller. We analyzed two gene-expression datasets, namely the childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia gene-expression dataset with 22 283 genes and Golden Spike dataset produced by a controlled experiment with 13 966 genes. The new test identified additional genes of interest in both datasets. Some of these genes have been proven to play important roles in medical literature.

We aimed to gain insight in the association between CNAs in these genes, clinical outcome parameters, and cellular drug resistance. 71% of newly diagnosed pediatric BCP-ALL cases harbored one or more CNAs in these B-cell development genes. The distribution and clinical relevance of these CNAs was highly subtype-dependent. In the DCOG-ALL10 cohort, only loss of IKZF1 associated as single marker with unfavorable outcome parameters and cellular drug resistance. Prednisolone resistance was observed in IKZF1-deleted primary high hyperdiploid cells (~1500-fold), while thiopurine resistance was detected in IKZF1-deleted primary BCR-ABL1-like and non-BCR-ABL1-like B-other cells (~2.7-fold). The previously described risk stratification classifiers, i.e. IKZF1(plus) and integrated cytogenetic and CNA classification, both predicted unfavorable outcome in the DCOG-ALL10 cohort, and associated with ex vivo drug cellular resistance to thiopurines, or L-asparaginase and thiopurines, respectively. This resistance could be attributed to overrepresentation of BCR-ABL1-like cases in these risk groups.

Potential pre-clinical applications include drug testing and toxicity studies. Here we describe the use of a multi-compartment micro-fluidic chip to recapitulate hepatic vitamin D metabolism (vitamin D to 25-hydroxyvitamin D) and renal bio-activation (25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) in humans. In contrast to cultivation in conventional tissue culture settings, on-chip cultivation of HepG2 and RPTEC cells in interconnected chambers, used to mimic the liver and kidneys, respectively, resulted in the enhanced expression of vitamin D metabolizing enzymes (CYP2R1, CYP27B1 and CYP24A1). Pump-driven flow of vitamin D3-containing medium through the microfluidic chip produced eluate containing vitamin D3 metabolites. LC-MSMS showed a strong accumulation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D. The chip eluate induced the expression of differentiation markers in HL-60 (acute myeloid leukemia) cells, assessed by qPCR and FACS analysis, in a manner similar to treatment with reference standards indicating the presence of fully activated 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D, although the latter was not detected in the eluate by LC-MSMS. Interestingly, 25-hydroxyvitamin D by itself led to weak activation of HL-60 cells suggesting that 25-hydroxyvitamin D is also an active metabolite. Our experiments demonstrate that complex metabolic interactions can be reconstructed outside the human body using dedicated organ-on-chip platforms. We therefore propose that such systems may be used to mimic the in vivo metabolism of various micronutrients and xenobiotics.",,"['Theobald, Jannick', 'Abu El Maaty, Mohamed A', 'Kusterer, Nico', 'Wetterauer, Bernhard', 'Wink, Michael', 'Cheng, Xinlai', 'Wolfl, Stefan']","['Theobald J', 'Abu El Maaty MA', 'Kusterer N', 'Wetterauer B', 'Wink M', 'Cheng X', 'Wolfl S']","['Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmacy and Molecular Biotechnology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 364, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. wolfl@uni-hd.de.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6441-3742'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190315,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Vitamins)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)', 'EC 1.14.15.18 (25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase)']",IM,"['25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 1-alpha-Hydroxylase/metabolism', 'Activation, Metabolic/physiology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cholecalciferol/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Lab-On-A-Chip Devices', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Microchip Analytical Procedures/methods', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/methods', 'Microfluidics/methods', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Vitamins/metabolism']",,,2019/03/16 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2018/06/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-40851-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-40851-9 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 15;9(1):4616. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-40851-9.,PMC6420623,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most types of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders retain surface BCR expression, including B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Targeting BCR effectors in B-NHL cell lines in vitro has indicated that this signaling axis is crucial for malignant B cell growth. This has led to the development of inhibitors of BCR signaling, which are currently used for the treatment of CLL and several B-NHL subtypes. Recent studies based on conditional BCR inactivation in a MYC-driven mouse B-cell lymphoma model have revisited the role of the BCR in MYC-expressing tumor B cells. Indeed, lymphoma cells losing BCR expression continue to grow unless subjected to competition with their BCR-expressing counterparts, which causes their elimination. Here, we discuss the molecular nature of the fitness signal delivered by the BCR to MYC-expressing malignant B cells, ensuring their preferential persistence within a rapidly expanding tumor population.

PI3Kdelta inhibitors are thought to target only CLL and other immune cells because PI3Kdelta expression is restricted to haematopoietic cells. We found that PI3Kdelta is unexpectedly expressed in primary MSC derived from CLL patients and healthy donors. PI3Kdelta inhibition in MSC using idelalisib or duvelisib significantly reduced their ability to support CLL migration and adhesion.

In recent years, the improvement of DNA sequencing technologies allows the identification of cohesin mutations in different tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, the role of cohesin dysfunction in cancer insurgence remains elusive. In this regard, cells harboring cohesin mutations do not show any increase in aneuploidy that might explain their oncogenic activity, nor cohesin mutations are sufficient to induce myeloid neoplasms as they have to co-occur with other causative mutations such as NPM1, FLT3-ITD, and DNMT3A. Several works, also using animal models for cohesin haploinsufficiency, correlate cohesin activity with dysregulated expression of genes involved in myeloid development and differentiation.

Among the studies investigating risk and protective factors for the individual and relationship adjustment of parents being confronted with pediatric cancer, couple factors - such as dyadic coping - gained little research attention. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to explore the association between dyadic coping and individual/relationship outcomes of parents in the context of pediatric cancer. Methods: Participants were 59 couples of children diagnosed with leukemia or Non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Time since diagnosis varied from diagnosis to 20 months. Both parents completed the DCI-short, DASS21, PIP, and MMQ. Results: Positive dyadic coping (i.e., supportive and common dyadic coping) and negative dyadic coping proved to be related to individual and relational outcomes of parents facing cancer in their child. In addition, while men and women reported to be equally satisfied with their partner and their sexual relationship, women reported higher levels of individual maladjustment. Conclusion: Our findings led to the conclusion that dyadic coping is important for both individual as well as relationship outcomes of parents when facing a diagnosis of cancer in their child. When meeting with families, both partners should be invited as a unit in order to best capture couple level experiences. Also, clinicians should be sensitive to relational and sexual issues besides individual issues, taking into account evidence-based standards for psychosocial care in pediatric oncology.",,"['Van Schoors, Marieke', 'Loeys, Tom', 'Goubert, Liesbet', 'Berghmans, Geertrui', 'Ooms, Britt', 'Lemiere, Jurgen', 'Norga, Koenraad', 'Verhofstadt, Lesley Liliane']","['Van Schoors M', 'Loeys T', 'Goubert L', 'Berghmans G', 'Ooms B', 'Lemiere J', 'Norga K', 'Verhofstadt LL']","['Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Data Analysis, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation Ghent, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, University Hospital Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Antwerp University Hospital, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.', 'Department of Experimental Clinical and Health Psychology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190227,Switzerland,Front Psychol,Frontiers in psychology,101550902,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['couples', 'dyadic coping', 'individual adjustment', 'intimate relationships', 'pediatric cancer', 'relationship adjustment']",2019/03/16 06:00,2019/03/16 06:01,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00402 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychol. 2019 Feb 27;10:402. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00402. eCollection 2019.,PMC6400881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since constitutive activation of the B cell receptor (BCR) pathway has been reported in both ABC and GCB DLBCL, we investigated whether targeting SYK or BTK will increase sensitivity of DLBCL cells to venetoclax. We report that pharmacological inhibition of SYK or BTK synergistically enhances venetoclax sensitivity in BCL-2-positive DLBCL cell lines with an activated BCR pathway in vitro and in a xenograft model in vivo, despite the only modest direct cytotoxic effect. We further show that these sensitizing effects are associated with inhibition of the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway and changes in the expression of MCL-1, BIM, and HRK. In addition, we show that BCR-dependent GCB DLBCL cells are characterized by deficiency of the phosphatase SHP1, a key negative regulator of the BCR pathway. Re-expression of SHP1 in GCB DBLCL cells reduces SYK, BLNK, and GSK3 phosphorylation and induces corresponding changes in MCL1, BIM, and HRK expression. Together, these findings suggest that SHP1 deficiency is responsible for the constitutive activation of the BCR pathway in GCB DLBCL and identify SHP1 and BCL-2 as potential predictive markers for response to treatment with a venetoclax/BCR inhibitor combination.",,"['Sasi, Binu K', 'Martines, Claudio', 'Xerxa, Elena', 'Porro, Fabiola', 'Kalkan, Hilal', 'Fazio, Rosa', 'Turkalj, Sven', 'Bojnik, Engin', 'Pyrzynska, Beata', 'Stachura, Joanna', 'Zerrouqi, Abdessamad', 'Bobrowicz, Malgorzata', 'Winiarska, Magdalena', 'Priebe, Valdemar', 'Bertoni, Francesco', 'Mansouri, Larry', 'Rosenquist, Richard', 'Efremov, Dimitar G']","['Sasi BK', 'Martines C', 'Xerxa E', 'Porro F', 'Kalkan H', 'Fazio R', 'Turkalj S', 'Bojnik E', 'Pyrzynska B', 'Stachura J', 'Zerrouqi A', 'Bobrowicz M', 'Winiarska M', 'Priebe V', 'Bertoni F', 'Mansouri L', 'Rosenquist R', 'Efremov DG']","['Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Immunology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Dept. of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Molecular Hematology, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy. efremov@icgeb.org.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5637-8983'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190314,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Syk Kinase/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/methods']",,,2019/03/16 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2018/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0442-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0442-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Oct;33(10):2416-2428. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0442-8.

The aim of this study is to target the BCMA, which promotes MM cell growth and survival, by generating BCMA-specific memory CD8(+) CTL that mediate effective and long-lasting immunity against MM. Here we report the identification of novel engineered peptides specific to BCMA, BCMA72-80 (YLMFLLRKI), and BCMA54-62 (YILWTCLGL), which display improved affinity/stability to HLA-A2 compared to their native peptides and induce highly functional BCMA-specific CTL with increased activation (CD38, CD69) and co-stimulatory (CD40L, OX40, GITR) molecule expression. Importantly, the heteroclitic BCMA72-80 specific CTL demonstrated poly-functional Th1-specific immune activities [IFN-gamma/IL-2/TNF-alpha production, proliferation, cytotoxicity] against MM, which were correlated with expansion of Tetramer(+) and memory CD8(+) CTL. Additionally, heteroclitic BCMA72-80 specific CTL treated with anti-OX40 (immune agonist) or anti-LAG-3 (checkpoint inhibitor) display increased immune function, mainly by central memory CTL. These results provide the framework for clinical application of heteroclitic BCMA72-80 peptide, alone and in combination with anti-LAG3 and/or anti-OX40 therapy, in vaccination and/or adoptive immunotherapeutic strategies to generate long-lasting anti-tumor immunity in patients with MM or other BCMA expressing tumors.",,"['Bae, Jooeun', 'Samur, Mehmet', 'Richardson, Paul', 'Munshi, Nikhil C', 'Anderson, Kenneth C']","['Bae J', 'Samur M', 'Richardson P', 'Munshi NC', 'Anderson KC']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. jooeun_bae@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'VA Boston Healthcare System, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190312,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (B-Cell Maturation Antigen)', '0 (TNFRSF17 protein, human)']",IM,"['B-Cell Maturation Antigen/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Vaccination/methods']",,,2019/03/16 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/10/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0414-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0414-z [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Sep;33(9):2208-2226. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0414-z.

The key to drug activity is incorporation into target cell DNA, however, a practical method to measure this incorporation is un-available. Here, we report a sensitive and specific LC-MS/MS method to simultaneously measure decitabine incorporation and DNA hypomethylation. A stable heavy isotope of 2'-deoxycytidine was used as an internal standard and one-step multi-enzyme digestion was used to release the DNA bound drug. Enzyme-released decitabine along with other mononucleosides were separated by a reverse-phase C18 column and quantified by mass spectrometry using multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode, with a lower limit of quantitation at 1.00 nM. In vitro studies demonstrated dosage and time-dependent incorporation of decitabine into myeloid leukemia cell DNA that correlated with extent of DNA hypomethylation. When applied to clinical samples serially collected from MDS patients treated with decitabine, the method again demonstrated correlation between decitabine DNA-incorporation and DNA hypomethylation.

We evaluated the clinical utility of 5 BRAF mutation testing strategies for use on bone marrow trephines (BMT). METHODS: 11 HCL, 5 HCL 'mimic', 2 treated HCL and 10 normal BMT specimens were tested for mutant BRAF, comparing Sanger sequencing, pyrosequencing, amplicon-based next generation sequencing (NGS), automated (Idylla) PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: PCR and IHC were cheaper and identified V600E in 100 % of HCL cases. Pyrosequencing detected the mutation in 91%, NGS in 55% of cases and Sanger sequencing in 27%. All assays gave wild-type BRAF results in HCL mimics and normal BMT samples. CONCLUSIONS: PCR and IHC were most sensitive and cost-effective, but these have limited scope for multiplexing and are likely to be replaced by NGS gene panels or whole genome sequencing in the medium to long term.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

MCC tumors typically present as painless, expanding nodules on the sun-exposed skin areas of older, white patients. Eyelid and periocular tumors comprise approximately 2.5% of all cases of MCC and may be mistaken for chalazia or basal cell carcinomas. Immunosuppression is a significant risk factor, particularly in solid-organ-transplant recipients, patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and patients with HIV. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often used for accurate staging of head and neck MCC. Treatment includes wide local excision, commonly with the addition of radiotherapy for improved locoregional disease control. Historically, adjuvant chemotherapy had been reserved for metastatic disease, but immunotherapy and targeted chemotherapies are currently being investigated for use in primary disease.

The enzyme l-asparaginase (ASNase) constitutes a key element in the treatment of this disease. Four formulations of ASNase from a bacterial source are currently available. However, these formulations are characterized by their high immunogenicity, resulting in the inactivation of the drug, as well as in the occurrence of hypersensitivity reactions in a large number of patients. In this work, we performed an immunoinformatic analysis in order to clarify structural aspects of the immunogenicity of the asparaginase from Escherichia coli and Erwinia carotovora. For this purpose, we performed the prediction of immunogenic and allergenic epitopes in the structure of asparaginases by using the relative frequency of immunogenic peptides for the eight alleles most frequently distributed worldwide. This study showed that there are no significant differences in the level of immunogenicity between the two enzymes, while asparaginase from E. coli presented a higher relative frequency of allergenic epitopes. These results are consistent with previously published reports. However, from a structural point of view, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing the structural determinants that contribute to the hypersensitivity response to this treatment.","['Copyright (c) 2019 International Alliance for Biological Standardization.', 'Published by Elsevier Ltd.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of medical records was done on children who were diagnosed and treated for cancer at Seoul National University Hospital between 2004 and 2013. AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Impaired renal function of estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 90 mL/minute/1.73 m(2) and development of proteinuria of cancer survivors were also assessed. RESULTS: This study included 1868 patients who were diagnosed with cancer at a median age of 7.9 years. During the course of treatment, 983 patients (52.6%) developed 1864 episodes of AKI, and the cumulative incidence at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 1 year after diagnosis was 28.9%, 39.6%, and 53.6%, respectively. The 1-year cumulative incidence was the highest in patients with acute myeloid leukemias (88.4%). In all, 6.1% of patients had more than 4 episodes of AKI and 11.8% of patients had stage 3 AKI. Among the 1096 childhood cancer survivors, 22.6% were found to have impaired renal function. A greater number of AKI episodes (>/=4 times) and nephrectomy were independent risk factors of impaired renal function. Also, 8.2% of the survivors developed proteinuria among 742 childhood cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: A large percentage of children with cancer experience AKI during the course of treatment, and AKI is associated with impaired long-term renal function.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We found that ANO1 is overexpressed in GC tissues and correlated with GC tumor-node-metastasis stage. Knockdown of ANO1 significantly inhibited GC cell migration and invasion in vitro, and loss of ANO1 resulted in inhibition of tumor metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, SP1 increased ANO1 transcription, recruited MLL1 to the ANO1 promoter region, facilitated H3K4 trimethylation, and subsequently promoted ANO1 expression.

This concept led to the development of next generation CAR-T cells, so-called TEGs: alphabetaT cells Engineered to express a defined gammadeltaTCR. The high affinity gamma9delta2TCR clone 5 has recently been selected within the TEG format as a clinical candidate (TEG001). However, exploring safety and efficacy against a target, which reflects an early metabolic change in tumor cells, remains challenging given the lack of appropriate tools. Therefore, we tested whether TEG001 is able to eliminate established leukemia in a primary disease model, without harming other parts of the healthy hematopoiesis in vivo. METHODS: Separate sets of NSG mice were respectively injected with primary human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and cord blood-derived human progenitor cells from healthy donors. These mice were then treated with TEG001 and mock cells. Tumor burden and human cells engraftment were measured in peripheral blood and followed up over time by quantifying for absolute cell number by flow cytometry. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric 2-tailed Mann-Whitney t-test. RESULTS: We successfully engrafted primary AML blasts and healthy hematopoietic cells after 6-8 weeks. Here we report that metabolic cancer targeting through TEG001 eradicated established primary leukemic blasts in vivo, while healthy hematopoietic compartments derived from human cord-blood remained unharmed in spite of TEGs persistence up to 50 days after infusion. No additional signs of off-target toxicity were observed in any other tissues. CONCLUSION: Within the limitations of humanized PD-X models, targeting CD277J by TEG001 is safe and efficient. Therefore, we have initiated clinical testing of TEG001 in a phase I first-in-human clinical trial (NTR6541; date of registration 25 July 2017).",,"['Johanna, Inez', 'Straetemans, Trudy', 'Heijhuurs, Sabine', 'Aarts-Riemens, Tineke', 'Norell, Hakan', 'Bongiovanni, Laura', 'de Bruin, Alain', 'Sebestyen, Zsolt', 'Kuball, Jurgen']","['Johanna I', 'Straetemans T', 'Heijhuurs S', 'Aarts-Riemens T', 'Norell H', 'Bongiovanni L', 'de Bruin A', 'Sebestyen Z', 'Kuball J']","['Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Faculdade de Medicina, Instituto de Medicina Molecular, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Dutch Molecular Pathology Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Dutch Molecular Pathology Center, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Laboratory of Translational Immunology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. j.h.e.kuball@umcutrecht.nl.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190312,England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BTN3A1 protein, human)', '0 (Butyrophilins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Blood Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Butyrophilins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Immunotherapy', '*Mice model', '*Preclinical', '*TCR engineering', '*TEGs', '*Toxicity']",2019/03/16 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-019-0558-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-019-0558-4 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Mar 12;7(1):69. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0558-4.,PMC6419469,,,,,,,,,['NTR/NTR6541'],,,,,,

None of the existing predictive scores gives a good prognosis of TKI efficacy. Gene polymorphisms, expression and microRNAs are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of TKI resistance in CML. The aim of our study is to find new molecular markers of TKI therapy efficacy in CML patients. METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase were included in this study. Optimal and non-optimal responses to TKI were estimated according to ELN 2013 recommendation. We performed genotyping of selected polymorphisms in 62 blood samples of CML patients, expression profiling of 33 RNA samples extracted from blood and miRNA profiling of 800 miRNA in 12 blood samples of CML patients. RESULTS: The frequencies of genotypes at the studied loci did not differ between groups of patients with an optimal and non-optimal response to TKI therapy. Analysis of the expression of 34,681 genes revealed 26 differently expressed genes (p < 0.05) in groups of patients with different TKI responses, but differences were very small and were not confirmed by qPCR.

Yet even in tumors with active ADRB2 signaling propranolol may be ineffective. Inhibition of apoptosis is one of the major mechanisms by which activation of ADRB2 contributes to prostate cancer pathophysiology. The signaling network that controls apoptosis in prostate tumors is highly redundant, with several signaling pathways targeting a few critical apoptosis regulatory molecules. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of ADRB2 signaling in the context of other signaling mechanisms is necessary to identify patients who will benefit from propranolol therapy. This review discusses how information on the antiapoptotic mechanisms activated by ADRB2 can guide clinical trials of ADRB2 antagonist propranolol as potential life-extending therapy for prostate cancer. To select patients for clinical trials of propranolol three classes of biomarkers are proposed. First, biomarkers of ADRB2/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathway activation; second, biomarkers that inform about activation of other signaling pathways unrelated to ADRB2; third, apoptosis regulatory molecules controlled by ADRB2 signaling and other survival signaling pathways.",,"['Kulik, George']",['Kulik G'],"['Department of Cancer Biology, Wake Forest University Health Sciences, Medical Center Blvd, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA. gkulik@wakehealth.edu.', 'Department of Life Sciences, Alfaisal University, Riyadh 11533, Saudi Arabia. gkulik@wakehealth.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190313,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2-associated death promoter (BAD)', 'apoptosis', 'cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)', 'clinical trial', 'myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1)', 'propranolol', 'prostate cancer', 'beta-2 adrenergic receptor (ADRB2)']",2019/03/16 06:00,2019/03/16 06:01,['2019/03/16 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11030358 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11030358 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Mar 13;11(3). pii: cancers11030358. doi: 10.3390/cancers11030358.,PMC6468358,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNA 155 (miR-155) is a conserved multifunctional miRNA involved in multiple roles including the modulation of the immune responses. When deregulated, miR-155 can also contribute to cancer as has been demonstrated in several human malignancies such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as in Epstein(-)Barr virus (EBV)-induced B cell transformation. Avian oncogenic viruses such as Marek's disease virus (MDV), avian leukosis virus (ALV), and reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) that account for more than 90% of cancers in avian species, also make use of the miR-155 pathway during oncogenesis. While oncogenic retroviruses, such as ALV, activate miR-155 by insertional activation, acutely transforming retroviruses use transduced oncogenes such as v-rel to upregulate miR-155 expression. MDV on the other hand, encodes a functional miR-155 ortholog mdv1-miR-M4, similar to the miR-155 ortholog kshv-miR-K11 present in Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We have shown that mdv1-miR-M4 is critical for the induction of MDV-induced lymphomas further demonstrating the oncogenic potential of miR-155 pathway in cancers irrespective of the diverse etiology.

Umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells may exert therapeutic effects via extracellular vesicles, while priming umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells may further enhance their effect. The authors investigated whether interferon-gamma-primed umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells would generate mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles with enhanced effects in Escherichia coli (E. coli) pneumonia. METHODS: In a university laboratory, anesthetized adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8 to 18 per group) underwent intrapulmonary E. coli instillation (5 x 10 colony forming units per kilogram), and were randomized to receive (a) primed mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles, (b) naive mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (both 100 million mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles per kilogram), or (c) vehicle. Injury severity and bacterial load were assessed at 48 h. In vitro studies assessed the potential for primed and naive mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles to enhance macrophage bacterial phagocytosis and killing. RESULTS: Survival increased with primed (10 of 11 [91%]) and naive (8 of 8 [100%]) mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles compared with vehicle (12 of 18 [66.7%], P = 0.038).

Primed-but not naive-mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles enhanced endothelial nitric oxide synthase production in the injured lung (endothelial nitric oxide synthase/beta-actin = 0.77 +/- 0.34, 0.25 +/- 0.29, 0.21 +/- 0.33, respectively; P = 0.005). Both primed and naive mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles enhanced E. coli phagocytosis and bacterial killing in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) in vitro (36.9 +/- 4, 13.3 +/- 8, 0.1 +/- 0.01%, respectively; P = 0.0004) compared with vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular vesicles from interferon-gamma-primed human umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells more effectively attenuated E. coli-induced lung injury compared with extracellular vesicles from naive mesenchymal stromal cells, potentially via enhanced macrophage phagocytosis and killing of E. coli.",,"['Varkouhi, Amir K', 'Jerkic, Mirjana', 'Ormesher, Lindsay', 'Gagnon, Stephane', 'Goyal, Sakshi', 'Rabani, Razieh', 'Masterson, Claire', 'Spring, Chris', 'Chen, Paul Z', 'Gu, Frank X', 'Dos Santos, Claudia C', 'Curley, Gerard F', 'Laffey, John G']","['Varkouhi AK', 'Jerkic M', 'Ormesher L', 'Gagnon S', 'Goyal S', 'Rabani R', 'Masterson C', 'Spring C', 'Chen PZ', 'Gu FX', 'Dos Santos CC', 'Curley GF', 'Laffey JG']","[""From the Keenan Research Centre for Biomedical Science (A.K.V., M.J., L.O., S.

Recently, multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been identified in the pathogenesis of cerebral infarction. Here, the current study aims to explore the interaction among lncRNA cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor-2B-antisense RNA 1 (CDKN2B-AS1), transcription factor B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A), and MAPKK kinase kinase 1 (MAP4K1) and further investigate whether they affect cerebral infarction progression. The expression of CDKN2B-AS1, BCL11A, and MAP4K1 was altered in lymphocytes extracted from patients with cerebral infarction. In order to identify their roles in regulatory T (Treg) cells, the proliferation and apoptosis of the CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells were examined, and levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta were determined. Also, the RNA crosstalk among CDKN2B-AS1, BCL11A, and MAP4K1 was validated. Finally, we established a rat model of middle cerebral arterial occlusion to evaluate the neurologic impairment and cerebral infarction volume. The results revealed that lymphocytes in patients with cerebral infarction presented with the up-regulated expression of CDKN2B-AS1. Moreover, BCL11A could specifically bind to CDKN2B-AS1 and MAP4K1 promoter so as to inhibit MAP4K1. Moreover, it was observed that down-regulated CDKN2B-AS1 inhibited CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg-cell proliferation, reduced levels of IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-beta and cerebral infarction volume, and elevated MAP4K1 expression. Collectively, our study provides evidence that CDKN2B-AS1 silencing could increase MAP4K1 expression to inhibit the CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg-cell proliferation by reducing enrichment of transcription factor BCL11A, thereby protecting against cerebral infarction progression, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy for treating cerebral infarction.-Lei, J.-J., Li, H.-Q., Mo, Z.-H., Liu, K.-J., Zhu, L.-J., Li, C.-Y., Chen, W.-L., Zhang, L.

However, fusion of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) to ABL produces constitutive kinase activity that causes chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as imatinib revolutionized the treatment of CML and other cancers, but acquired resistance to these inhibitors is rising. Thus, careful dissection of ABL signaling pathways is needed to find novel drug targets. Here we present a refined proteomic approach for elucidation of direct kinase substrates called kinase assay linked phosphoproteomics (KALIP). Our strategy integrates in vitro kinase assays at both the peptide and protein levels with quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics in response to treatment by multiple TKIs. Utilizing multiple TKIs permits elimination of off-target effects of these drugs, and overlapping the in vivo and in vitro data sets allows us to define a list of the most probable kinase substrates. Applying our approach produced a list of 60 ABL substrates, including novel and known proteins. We demonstrate that spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a novel direct substrate of ABL, and we predict our proteomic strategy may facilitate identification of substrates in other cancers that have disrupted kinase signaling.",,"['Arrington, Justine', 'Xue, Liang', 'Wang, Wen-Horng', 'Geahlen, Robert L', 'Tao, W Andy']","['Arrington J', 'Xue L', 'Wang WH', 'Geahlen RL', 'Tao WA']",,['ORCID: 0000-0002-5535-5517'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190321,United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proteome)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Chromatography, Liquid', 'Drug Discovery', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Phosphoproteins/analysis/chemistry/metabolism', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', '*Proteome/analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Signal Transduction/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*KALIP', '*LC-MS', '*kinase substrates', '*phosphoproteomics', '*tyrosine kinase']",2019/03/15 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00942 [doi]'],ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2019 Apr 5;18(4):1679-1690. doi: 10.1021/acs.jproteome.8b00942.

However, the prognosis of pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with KMT2A rearrangements depends on its translocation partners. We herein report the case of a 9-month-old boy with a KMT2A-USP2 fusion, which required diagnosis by whole transcriptome sequencing after the failure of detection of known translocation partners by conventional screening approaches. As this first report of a patient with AML with a KMT2A-USP2 fusion illustrates, identification of the partners in all patients with KMT2A-rearranged AML is critical to elucidate the outcomes associated with specific rearrangements and to develop appropriate treatment strategies. Moreover, development of additional methods to detect specific translocation partners of KMT2A and leukemia-specific targeting drugs is important to improve further the outcomes of KMT2A-rearranged AML.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Ikeda, Junji', 'Shiba, Norio', 'Tsujimoto, Shin-Ichi', 'Yoshida, Masanori', 'Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko', 'Ogata-Kawata, Hiroko', 'Okamura, Kohji', 'Takeuchi, Masanobu', 'Osumi, Tomoo', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Hata, Kenichiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Ito, Shuichi', 'Kato, Motohiro']","['Ikeda J', 'Shiba N', 'Tsujimoto SI', 'Yoshida M', 'Nakabayashi K', 'Ogata-Kawata H', 'Okamura K', 'Takeuchi M', 'Osumi T', 'Tomizawa D', 'Hata K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Ito S', 'Kato M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, National Research Institute for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6629-5006'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190408,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Oncogene Fusion', '*Transcriptome', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase']",['NOTNLM'],"['* KMT2A', '* USP2', '*RNA sequencing', '*infant AML']",2019/03/15 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22751 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Sep;58(9):669-672. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22751.

The management paradigms include observation, endovascular exclusion, or surgical trapping with or without revascularization. The case described in this video involved a 67-yr-old woman with a known history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, who presented after a mechanical ground-level fall. Clinically, she had a nasal deformity and resolving epistaxis consistent with mild facial trauma. Computed tomography (CT) revealed a comminuted nasal bone fracture and an incidental 3-cm right petrous ICA aneurysm. Subsequent vascular imaging demonstrated a concurrent 1.5-cm right cervical ICA dissecting pseudoaneurysm. Flow diversion with a Pipeline stent (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was unsuccessful because the aneurysm's size precluded microcatheter selection of the ICA distal to the lesion. When the patient did not tolerate balloon test occlusion of the ICA, we proceeded with surgical trapping of both aneurysms and high-flow extracranial-to-intracranial bypass. The patient underwent a right frontotemporal craniotomy and an external carotid artery-to-frontal M2 middle cerebral artery bypass with a radial artery graft. Following a clinoidectomy, an aneurysm clip was applied to the paraclinoid ICA, and the cervical ICA was ligated just distal to the bifurcation, effectively trapping both aneurysms. The patient tolerated the procedure well. Postoperatively, she experienced symptomatic hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy and a transient partial oculomotor palsy that resolved during her hospital course. She was discharged home without neurological sequelae.

Exposing KG1-a cells to N-(4- tert- butyl- 4'- oxo- 1'H- spiro [cyclohexane- 1, 2'- quinazoline]- 3'(4'H)- yl)- 4- methyl benzenesulfonamide (4t-CHQ), as an active sub-component of spiroquinazolinone benzenesulfonamides, the experiment investigated the possible mechanisms that manifest the role of 4t-CHQ in leukemic KG1-a progenitor cells. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effects of 4t-CHQ on KG1-a cells emerge from its modulating function on the expression of Bax/Bcl2 and survinin proteins. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed using MTT assay. The IC50 value of cells was calculated to be 131.3muM, after 72h-incubation with 4t-CHQ, ranging from 10 to 150muM. Apoptotic changes were studied using Acridine Orange/Ethidium Bromide (AO/EB) staining. DNA fragmentation was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis method. To evaluate the percentage of apoptotic cells and cell growth dynamic apoptotic features, we performed Annexin V/PI double staining assay and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry. RESULTS: According to the results, apoptosis induction was initiated by 4t-CHQ in the KG1-a cells (at IC50 value). Cell dynamic analysis revealed that the cell cycle at the G1 phase was arrested after treatment with 4t- CHQ. Western blotting analysis showed enhancement in the expression ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, while the expression of survinin protein decreased in a time-dependent manner in the KG1-a cells. According to the docking simulation data, the effectiveness of 4t-CHQ on KG1-a cells commenced by its reactions with the functional domain of BH3 and Bcl2 and BIR domains of survivin protein. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate a remarkable role of 4t- CHQ in arresting leukemia KG1-a stem cells both by induction of apoptosis as well as by down-regulating survivin and Bcl2 proteins.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Rahimian, Arezoo', 'Mahdavi, Majid', 'Rahbarghazi, Reza', 'Charoudeh, Hojjatollah N']","['Rahimian A', 'Mahdavi M', 'Rahbarghazi R', 'Charoudeh HN']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Applied Cell Sciences, Faculty of Advanced Medical Sciences, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Survivin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Quinazolines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfonamides/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Survivin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Bcl2', '*KG1-a cell', '*leukemia', '*spiro-quinazolinone', '*survivin.']",2019/03/15 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-97306 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190313165130 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(11):1340-1349. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190313165130.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the last 30 years, pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells were established from murine and primate sources, and display indefinite replicative potential and the ability to differentiate to all three embryonic germ layers. Despite large efforts in many aspects of rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cell culture, a number of diverse challenges remain. Natural and synthetic small molecules (SMs) strategy has the potential to overcome these hurdles. Small molecules are typically fast and reversible that target specific signaling pathways, epigenetic processes and other cellular processes. Inhibition of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta/Smad) and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4)/ERK signaling pathways by SB431542 and PD0325901 small molecules, respectively, known as R2i, enhances the efficiency of mouse, rat, and chicken pluripotent stem cells passaging from different genetic backgrounds. Therefore, the application of SM inhibitors of TGF-beta and ERK1/2 with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) allows the cultivation of pluripotent stem cells in a chemically defined condition. In this review, we discuss recently emerging evidence that dual inhibition of TGF-beta and FGF signaling pathways plays an important role in regulating pluripotency in both rodent and non-rodent pluripotent stem cells.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Farzaneh, Maryam', 'Derakhshan, Zahra', 'Hallajzadeh, Jamal', 'Sarani, Neda Hosseini', 'Nejabatdoust, Armin', 'Khoshnam, Seyed Esmaeil']","['Farzaneh M', 'Derakhshan Z', 'Hallajzadeh J', 'Sarani NH', 'Nejabatdoust A', 'Khoshnam SE']","['Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Reproductive Biology, School of Advanced Medical Sciences and Technologies, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Toxicology, Maraghe University of Medical Science, Maraghe, Iran.', 'Faculty of Paramedical, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Rasht Branch, Islamic Azad University, Rasht, Iran.', 'Physiology Research Center, Department of Physiology, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther,Current stem cell research & therapy,101272517,"['0 (4-(5-benzo(1,3)dioxol-5-yl-4-pyridin-2-yl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzamide)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 4)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '86K0J5AK6M (mirdametinib)', '9N3CBB0BIQ (Diphenylamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Chickens', 'Dioxoles/pharmacology', 'Diphenylamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['FGF4/ERK pathway', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Stem cells', 'TGF-beta/Smad pathway', 'chemically defined condition', 'small molecules.']",2019/03/15 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2018/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['CSCR-EPUB-97317 [pii]', '10.2174/1871527318666190314110529 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Stem Cell Res Ther. 2019;14(6):466-473. doi: 10.2174/1871527318666190314110529.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short (~22-nucleotides) non-protein-coding regulatory RNA molecules with key roles in cellular and molecular processes linked to different cancers including CLL. Re-cently, some investigations have demonstrated that miR-125a downregulation is correlated with the expression of P53, NRG1 and ERBB2. <i>Methods:</i> In this study, samples including 38 patients with CLL and 25 healthy individuals were collected. We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess the expression of miR-125a in plasma of the CLL patients in comparison with healthy controls. Moreover, we used the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) signaling pathway analysis on miR-125a targets in the DAVID database in order to investigate the potential role of miR-125a in cancer pathways. MiR-125a exerted a variety of roles in the cancer pathway via downregulating target genes including ERBB2. <i>Results:</i> The expression of miR-125a dramatically decreased (~2-fold) in the patients with CLL compared with the healthy controls (p = 0.03). Furthermore, overexpression of miR-125a was associated with different CLL staging and B symptoms (all at p < 0.05). The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated the eight statistically related KEGG signaling pathways with miR-125a targetome. <i>Conclusions:</i> The results suggested that the miR-125a expression level could be a novel potential biomarker for CLL prognosis.",,"['Ahmadvand, Mohammad', 'Eskandari, Mahsa', 'Khakpour, Golnaz', 'Pashaiefar, Hossein', 'Manoochehrabadi, Saba', 'Yaghmaie, Marjan', 'Montazer-Zohour, Mostafa', 'Naghavi, Anoosh']","['Ahmadvand M', 'Eskandari M', 'Khakpour G', 'Pashaiefar H', 'Manoochehrabadi S', 'Yaghmaie M', 'Montazer-Zohour M', 'Naghavi A']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Signal Transduction']",,,2019/03/15 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180815 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2019 Mar 1;65(3). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2018.180815.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite steadily improving long-term outcomes, infections remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children receiving therapy for leukaemia. The incidence and risk of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) continue to rise. In some settings, IFIs caused by moulds are more frequent than those caused by yeasts, and Aspergillus spp. is the most common pathogens. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency, type of fungal infection seen during induction chemotherapy and outcomes.. METHODS: This observational retrospective study was conducted in paediatric oncology department at Shaukat Khanum Cancer Hospital Lahore from January 2015 to December 2016 after taking International research board (IRB) approval. The study includes all the patients aged 1-15 who were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia while on induction chemotherapy. The data was retrieved of 165 patients from the hospital database after informed written consent.. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 4.6+/-2.80 with range 1-15years. Total 154 (93%) of the children were of age between 1-5 years whereas only 11 (6.7%) were between 5-10 years. Male sex was predominant in 117 (70.9%) and 48 (29.1%) were girls. Pre-B Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was diagnosed in 93.3% of the patients and rest 11 (6.7%) were diagnosed with Pre-T Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. NCI Standard risk patients were 132 (80%) and 33 (20%) were stratified as high risk. Fungal infections were documented in 18 (11%) patients out of which 7(39%) were probable infections, and only 11 (61%) were proven fungal infections. Aspergillus was the commonest organism in 5 (28%) patients. Death was observed in 21 (13%) patients and causes were sepsis due to infections in 18 (86%) out of which fungal infections were 11(61%), bacterial 4(22%), combine bacterial and fungal 3(17%). Remaining 3 (14%) patients death causes include, neutropenic colitis was observed in first patient, second patient died of infection without any identifiable focus, and third patient died due to chemotherapy related toxicity.. CONCLUSIONS: Our study concludes that the fungal infection was the most common cause of mortality in induction in our patients.

We herewith report a case who developed a symptomatic PNH long after an allogenic marrow transplant. Some reasonable arguments concerning the origin of PNH clone have been discussed. The molecular studies revealed presence of JAK2 and TET2 mutations without a BCOR mutation. The literature review has been performed to probe into the complex interplay of autoimmunity and clonal selection and expansion of PNH cells, which occurs early in hematopoietic differentiation. The consequent events such as hypoplastic and/or hemato-oncologic features could further be explained on the basis of next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare clonal disorder of hematopoietic stem cells, characterized by a somatic mutation of the phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A (PIGA). The PIGA gene products are crucial for biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which attaches a number of proteins to the plasma membrane of the cell. Amongst these proteins, the CD55 and CD59 are complement regulatory proteins. The CD55 inhibits C3 convertase whereas the CD59 blocks the membrane attack complex (MAC) by inhibiting the incorporation of C9 to MAC. The loss of complement regulatory protein renders the red cell susceptible to complement-mediated lysis leading to intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. The intravascular hemolysis explains most of the morbid clinical manifestations of the disease. The clinical features of syndrome of PNH are recurrent hemolytic episodes, thrombosis, smooth muscle dystonia, and bone marrow failure; other important complications include renal failure, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The most used therapies were blood transfusions, immunosuppressive, and steroid. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation was also practiced. At present, the therapy of choice is eculizumab (Soliris, Alexion Pharmaceuticals), a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks activation of the terminal complement at C5. The limiting factor for this therapy is breakthrough hemolysis and the frequent dosing schedule. Ravulizumab (ALXN1210) is the second generation terminal compliment inhibitor which seems to provide a sustained control of hemolysis without breakthrough hemolysis and with a longer dosing interval.",,"['Santagostino, Alberto', 'Lombardi, Laura', 'Dine, Gerard', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Misra, Srimanta Chandra']","['Santagostino A', 'Lombardi L', 'Dine G', 'Hirsch P', 'Misra SC']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Troyes General Hospital, 10000 Troyes, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Troyes General Hospital, 10000 Troyes, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Troyes General Hospital, 10000 Troyes, France.', 'Sorbonne University, Inserm, Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine, CRSA, AP-HP, Department of Laboratory Hematology Saint-Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Troyes General Hospital, 10000 Troyes, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2840-6961'],['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190205,United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,,2019/03/15 06:00,2019/03/15 06:01,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/12/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/8928623 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Feb 5;2019:8928623. doi: 10.1155/2019/8928623. eCollection 2019.,PMC6379860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the impact of HMBA on the cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells against acute T lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells or HIV-1-infected T cells that exit from latency. We show that in T-ALL cells HMBA upmodulated MICB and ULBP2 ligands for the NKG2D activating receptor. In a primary CD4(+) T cell-based latency model, HMBA did not reactivate HIV-1, yet enhanced ULBP2 expression on cells harboring virus reactivated by prostratin (PRO). However, HMBA reduced the expression of NKG2D and its DAP10 adaptor in NK cells, hence impairing NKG2D-mediated cytotoxicity and DAP10-dependent response to IL-15 stimulation. Alongside, HMBA dampened killing of T-ALL targets by IL-15-activated NK cells and impaired NK cell-mediated clearance of PRO-reactivated HIV-1(+) cells. Overall, our results demonstrate a dominant detrimental effect of HMBA on the NKG2D pathway that crucially controls NK cell-mediated killing of tumors and virus-infected cells, providing one possible explanation for poor clinical outcome in HMBA-treated cancer patients and raising concerns for future therapeutic application of this drug.",,"['Giuliani, Erica', 'Desimio, Maria Giovanna', 'Doria, Margherita']","['Giuliani E', 'Desimio MG', 'Doria M']","[""Laboratory of Immunoinfectivology, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Piazza S.

Common childhood acute leukaemia is thought to be caused by two hits, the first in utero and the second in childhood in response to infection. The mechanism for the initial DNA damaging event are unknown. Here we have used in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models to show that a placental barrier will respond to agents that are suspected of initiating childhood leukaemia by releasing factors that cause DNA damage in cord blood and bone marrow cells, including stem cells. We show that DNA damage caused by in utero exposure can reappear postnatally after an immune challenge. Furthermore, both foetal and postnatal DNA damage are prevented by prenatal exposure of the placenta to a mitochondrially-targeted antioxidant.

In this study, we investigate the characteristics and possible regulatory mechanisms of DPSC function under hypoxic conditions. METHODS: Human DPSCs were cultured under normoxia (20% O2) and hypoxia (3% O2). DPSC proliferation and osteo/odontogenic differentiation potential were assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) assay, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin red staining, real-time RT-PCR assays, and western blot analysis. Microarray and bioinformatic analyses were performed to investigate the differences in the mRNA, lncRNA, and miRNA expression profiles of DPSCs. RESULTS: DPSCs exhibited a more powerful proliferation ability and lower osteo/odontogenic differentiation potential in hypoxic conditions. A total of 60 mRNAs (25 upregulated and 35 downregulated), 47 lncRNAs (20 upregulated and 27 downregulated), and 14 miRNAs (7 upregulated and 7 downregulated) in DPSCs were differentially expressed in the hypoxia group compared with the normoxia group. Bioinformatic analysis identified that 7 mRNAs (GRPR, ERO1L, ANPEP, EPHX1, PGD, ANGPT1, and NQO1) and 5 lncRNAs (AF085958, AX750575, uc002czn.2, RP3-413H6.2, and six-twelve leukemia (STL)) may be associated with DPSCs during hypoxia according to CNC network analysis, while 28 mRNAs (including GYS1, PRKACB, and NQO1) and 13 miRNAs (including hsa-miR-3916 and hsa-miR-192-5p) may be involved according to miRNA target gene network analysis. The depletion of one candidate lncRNA, STL, inhibited the osteo/odontogenic differentiation potentials of DPSCs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that hypoxia could enhance the proliferation ability and impair the osteo/odontogenic differentiation potential of DPSCs in vitro. Furthermore, our results identified candidate coding and noncoding RNAs that could be potential targets for improving DPSC function in regenerative endodontics and lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of hypoxia's effects on DPSCs.",,"['Shi, Ruitang', 'Yang, Haoqing', 'Lin, Xiao', 'Cao, Yangyang', 'Zhang, Chen', 'Fan, Zhipeng', 'Hou, Benxiang']","['Shi R', 'Yang H', 'Lin X', 'Cao Y', 'Zhang C', 'Fan Z', 'Hou B']","['Department of Endodontics, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling and Stem Cells Therapy, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tooth Regeneration and Function Reconstruction, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Implant Dentistry, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling and Stem Cells Therapy, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tooth Regeneration and Function Reconstruction, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling and Stem Cells Therapy, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tooth Regeneration and Function Reconstruction, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Signaling and Stem Cells Therapy, Beijing Key Laboratory of Tooth Regeneration and Function Reconstruction, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. zpfan@ccmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Endodontics, Beijing Stomatological Hospital, School of Stomatology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China. houbenxiang@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190312,England,Stem Cell Res Ther,Stem cell research & therapy,101527581,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Cell Hypoxia', 'Dental Pulp/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*biosynthesis', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', '*Transcriptome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Coding RNA', '*Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs)', '*Hypoxia', '*Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)', '*MicroRNA (miRNA)']",2019/03/15 06:00,2020/04/23 06:00,['2019/03/15 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13287-019-1192-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13287-019-1192-2 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Res Ther. 2019 Mar 12;10(1):89. doi: 10.1186/s13287-019-1192-2.,PMC6417198,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DHA inhibited EoL-1 cells growth dose-dependently by inducing growth arrest at G0/1 phase of the cell cycle. After DHA addition to the cells, the expression of MYC oncogene was decreased, PTAFR-mRNA overexpression was observed which was used as a marker of differentiation, and PLA2G4A-mRNA increase was recorded. The enzymatic activities of phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), a group of hydrolytic enzymes, whose action precedes and leads to PAF biosynthesis through the remodeling pathway, as well as platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) which hydrolyses and deactivates PAF, were also measured. DHA had an effect on the levels of both the intracellular and secreted activities of PLA(2) and PAFAH. The inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha were also detected in high levels. In conclusion, DHA-induced EoL-1 cells differentiation was correlated with downregulation of MYC oncogene, overexpression of PTAFR and PLA2G4A-mRNAs, increase of the inflammatory cytokines production, and alteration of the enzymatic activities that regulate PAF levels.

Several reports have suggested anti-bacterial effects of menadione, although the effect of menadione on major virulence factors of H. pylori and H. pylori-induced inflammation is yet to be elucidated. In this study, therefore, we demonstrated that menadione has anti-H. pylori and anti-inflammatory effects. Menadione inhibited growth of H. pylori reference strains and clinical isolates. Menadione reduced expression of vacA in H. pylori, and translocation of VacA protein into AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma cell) was also decreased by menadione treatment. This result was concordant with decreased apoptosis in AGS cells infected with H. pylori. Moreover, cytotoxin-associated protein A (CagA) translocation into H. pylori-infected AGS cells was also decreased by menadione. Menadione inhibited expression of several type IV secretion system (T4SS) components, including virB2, virB7, virB8, and virB10, that are responsible for translocation of CagA into host cells. In particular, menadione inhibited nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cell (NF-kappaB) activation and thereby reduced expression of the proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha in AGS as well as in THP-1 (monocytic leukemia cell) cell lines.

However, a subgroup of patients exhibit poor response or experience relapse. This issue may be overcome by combination therapy using natural compounds. Neferine, a major bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from ""lotus plumule"" (seed embryo of lotus) commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine and tea, was used herein in the combination treatment of CML. The MTT assay showed that neferine exerted cytotoxicity in primary CML cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, low concentrations of neferine (4 and 8 microM) sensitized primary CML cells to imatinib (CI < 1), and significantly decreased its IC50 from 0.70 +/- 0.10 to 0.32 +/- 0.06 microM and 0.16 +/- 0.02 microM, respectively. Cotreatment of neferine and imatinib significantly decreased the expression of BCR-ABL protein and its molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) mRNA and protein levels, and further decreased phospho-extracellular regulated protein kinase 1/2 (p-Erk1/2) and myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl-1) expression. These results suggest that neferine might be a potential imatinib sensitizer in CML treatment. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: In China, Lotus plumule, the green embryo of lotus, is used as a tea and as a source of herbal medicine in the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, spermatorrhea, and thirst. Additional, neferine, a bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid extracted from lotus plumule has been shown to have antitumor potential. Herein, the effect of neferine and imatinib cotreatment on primary CML cells obtained from CML patients was assessed, with a synergistic effect being observed between the two compounds. Therefore, neferine might be a promising natural compound to potentiate imatinib in CML patients.",['(c) 2019 Institute of Food Technologists(R).'],"['Zhang, Yalan', 'Xiao, Yuhang', 'Dong, Qixing', 'Ouyang, Wenjuan', 'Qin, Qun']","['Zhang Y', 'Xiao Y', 'Dong Q', 'Ouyang W', 'Qin Q']","['Xiangya Hospital, Central South Univ., Changsha, China.', 'Xiangya Hospital, Central South Univ., Changsha, China.', 'Xiangya Hospital, Central South Univ., Changsha, China.', 'Xiangya Hospital, Central South Univ., Changsha, China.', 'Xiangya Hospital, Central South Univ., Changsha, China.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9732-7039'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190313,United States,J Food Sci,Journal of food science,0014052,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '2292-16-2 (neferine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzylisoquinolines/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lotus/*chemistry']",['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'neferine']",2019/03/14 06:00,2019/06/05 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2018/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/1750-3841.14484 [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Sci. 2019 Apr;84(4):904-910. doi: 10.1111/1750-3841.14484.

Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is a well-known signaling phytohormone that triggers gene expression in secondary metabolism. Currently, MeJA-mediated biosynthesis of indigo and indirubin in B. cusia is not well understood. In this study, we analyzed the content of indigo and indirubin in leaf and root tissues of B. cusia with high-performance liquid chromatography and measured photosynthetic characteristics of leaves treated by MeJA using FluorCam6 Fluorometer and chlorophyll fluorescence using the portable photosynthesis system CIRAS-2. We performed de novo RNA-seq of B. cusia leaf and root transcriptional profiles to investigate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in response to exogenous MeJA application. The amount of indigo in MeJA-treated leaves were higher than that in controled leaves (p = 0.004), and the amounts of indigo in treated roots was higher than that in controlled roots (p = 0.048); Chlorophyll fluorescence of leaves treated with MeJA were significantly decreased. Leaves treated with MeJA showed lower photosynthetic rate compared to the control in the absence of MeJA. Functional annotation of DEGs showed the DEGs related to growth and development processes were down-regulated in the treated leaves, while most of the unigenes involved in the defense response were up-regulated in treated roots. This coincided with the effects of MeJA on photosynthetic characteristics and chlorophyll fluorescence. The qRT-PCR results showed that MeJA appears to down-regulate the gene expression of tryptophan synthase beta-subunits (trpA-beta) in leaves but increased the gene expression of anthranilate synthase (trp 3) in roots responsible for increased indigo content. The results showed that MeJA suppressed leaf photosynthesis for B. cusia and this growth-defense trade-off may contribute to the improved adaptability of B. cusia in changing environments.",,"['Lin, Wenjin', 'Huang, Wei', 'Ning, Shuju', 'Gong, Xiaogui', 'Ye, Qi', 'Wei, Daozhi']","['Lin W', 'Huang W', 'Ning S', 'Gong X', 'Ye Q', 'Wei D']","['School of Life science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Key Laboratory of Medical Measurement, Fujian Academy of Medical Sciences, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Life science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Crop science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Life science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Life science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.', 'School of Life science, Fujian Agriculture and Forestry University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3776-3023'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190313,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oxylipins)', '0 (Plant Growth Regulators)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)', '900N171A0F (methyl jasmonate)', 'D3741U8K7L (Indigo Carmine)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)']",IM,"['Acanthaceae/*drug effects/physiology', 'Acetates/*pharmacology', 'Adaptation, Physiological', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/drug effects', 'China', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Plant/*drug effects', 'Indigo Carmine/metabolism', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Oxylipins/*pharmacology', 'Photosynthesis/drug effects', 'Plant Breeding/methods', 'Plant Growth Regulators/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry/metabolism', 'Plant Roots/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Plants, Medicinal/drug effects/physiology', 'Tryptophan/*biosynthesis']",,,2019/03/14 06:00,2019/11/28 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2018/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0212863 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-22608 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 13;14(3):e0212863. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0212863. eCollection 2019.,PMC6415880,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of VOD in Wilms tumor (WT) ranges from 1.2% to 8%. The diagnosis of VOD is clinical, and there are no validated laboratory biomarkers. PROCEDURE: We prospectively evaluated the specificity and sensitivity of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and protein C as diagnostic markers of VOD in WT patients. Fifty patients treated from 2008 to 2016 for WT were eligible. VOD was diagnosed according to modified Seattle criteria and retrospectively reclassified according to the recently published criteria for VOD in pediatric HSCT patients. RESULTS: VOD occurred in 6 of 50 patients (12%) after 20 to 97 days from starting chemotherapy. The average duration of VOD was 10 days (range, 4-13 days). PAI-1 levels were elevated in all VOD patients, while a decrease in protein C levels was observed in 33% of patients with VOD. PAI-1 antigen (Ag) values >/= 26.4 ng/mL demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for the clinical diagnosis of VOD with sensitivity 100%, specificity 93%; whereas protein C levels below 34.5% had sensitivity 67%, specificity 100%. Both PAI-1 and protein C had an high negative predictive value: PAI-1 Ag 100%; protein C 95%. CONCLUSIONS: PAI-1 Ag and protein C have good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of VOD in WT patients. Their high negative predictive value can be used in the differential diagnosis of liver toxicity, especially in VOD episodes with absent or delayed hyperbilirubinemia.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Cesaro, Simone', 'Mauro, Margherita', 'Sattin, Giulia', 'Sartori, Maria Teresa', 'Saggiorato, Graziella', 'Paratella, Alessandra', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Bisogno, Gianni']","['Cesaro S', 'Mauro M', 'Sattin G', 'Sartori MT', 'Saggiorato G', 'Paratella A', 'Tridello G', 'Bisogno G']","['Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', ""Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Mother's and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Clinical Medicine 1, Department of Medicine, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', ""Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Mother's and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', ""Hematology Oncology Division, Department of Mother's and Child's Health, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.""]","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8698-9547', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5500-3175']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20190313,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Protein C)', '0 (SERPINE1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*blood', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein C/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Wilms Tumor/blood/drug therapy/pathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*PAI-1', '*Wilms tumor', '*liver toxicity', '*protein C', '*veno-occlusive disease']",2019/03/14 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2018/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27695 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jul;66(7):e27695. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27695.

Only rare reactions have ever been reported due to anti-B. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An apheresis PLT product was donated by a blood group O male, processed using PLT additive solution, and pathogen reduced. Postreaction recipient testing included an antibody screen using gel technology, a direct antiglobulin test (DAT) using immunoglobulin G and C3, and an eluate against group O and B cells. Postreaction donor testing included measuring anti-B titers in saline, with and without anti-human globulin. RESULTS: A 60-year-old blood group B patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia developed confusion, fever, and hypotension within hours after a blood group O PLT transfusion. The posttransfusion reaction evaluation was remarkable for a positive DAT 3+ for C3; the eluate showed anti-B. Rapid extravascular hemolysis occurred, with a 50% decline in hemoglobin, a high lactate dehydrogenase, and a high bilirubin. She was resuscitated with fluids, blood products, pressors, and oxygen and died of asystole 60 hours later. The donor's anti-B titers were 128 by tube testing at immediate spin and 512 at the anti-human globulin phase. Notably, a group B patient at a different hospital received a split of the same apheresis unit, with no reaction. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first fatality reported from passively transfused anti-B. The fact that one transfusion recipient died whereas another did not have any reported reaction highlights the potential importance of recipient variables in isohemagglutinin-mediated hemolysis.",['(c) 2019 AABB.'],"['Balbuena-Merle, Raisa', 'West, F Bernadette', 'Tormey, Christopher A', 'Hendrickson, Jeanne E']","['Balbuena-Merle R', 'West FB', 'Tormey CA', 'Hendrickson JE']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'American Red Cross, Farmington, Connecticut.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Pathology & Laboratory Medicine Service, VA Connecticut Healthcare System, West Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7928-3132'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190313,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Organ Preservation Solutions)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*immunology', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/blood/*etiology/immunology', 'Blood Preservation/methods', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hemolysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Isoantibodies/*adverse effects/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Preservation Solutions', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Plateletpheresis', 'Transfusion Reaction/blood/*etiology/immunology']",,,2019/03/14 06:00,2020/05/29 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/trf.15240 [doi]'],ppublish,Transfusion. 2019 Jun;59(6):1911-1915. doi: 10.1111/trf.15240.

Chemical methods using small molecules and biological methods using proteins and nucleic acids are employed for achieving this control, albeit with limitations. We found, for the first time, that retroviral DNA integration patterns in the human genome, the result of complicated interactions between cells and viruses, can be engineered by adapting cells to the defined nanotopography of silica bead monolayers. Compared with cells on a flat glass surface, cells on beads with the highest curvature harbored retroviral DNAs at genomic sites near transcriptional start sites and CpG islands during infections at more than 50% higher frequencies. Furthermore, cells on the same type of bead layers contained retroviral DNAs in the genomic regions near cis-regulatory elements at frequencies that were 2.6-fold higher than that of cells on flat glass surfaces. Systems-level genetic network analysis showed that for cells on nanobeads with the highest curvature, the genes that would be affected by cis-regulatory elements near the retroviral integration sites perform biological functions related to chromatin structure and antiviral activities.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review and histopathologic study with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization of 3 cases. RESULTS: Three cases of ENTNKT presented to the Mass Eye and Ear emergency room as orbital cellulitis over 1 year. The first case was unusual in that there was a predominance of small cells, giving the ENTNKT the histopathologic appearance of a nonmalignant inflammatory process. This challenging case is juxtaposed alongside 2 other cases, which exhibited the more typical lymphomatous microscopic appearance. DISCUSSION: ENTNKT can extend into the orbit from the adjacent sinuses or rarely arise primarily in the orbit. A diagnosis is typically made with a biopsy. Occasionally, however, the histopathologic diagnosis can be elusive when a predominance of small lymphomatous cells that are virtually indistinguishable from non-neoplastic inflammatory cells is present. Demonstration of CD56 positivity by immunostaining and in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus are essential in confirming the diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: ENTNKT should be considered both in the clinical and histopathologic differential diagnoses of orbital infections and idiopathic inflammations (pseudotumor).",,"['Wolkow, Natalie', 'Jakobiec, Frederick A', 'Habib, Larissa A', 'Freitag, Suzanne K']","['Wolkow N', 'Jakobiec FA', 'Habib LA', 'Freitag SK']","['Division of Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, David G.

Depression is a multifactorial disorder and its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation has been reported to serve important roles in human disease.

Further analysis of the ceRNA networks revealed that ceRNA regulation may be important for depression. Hub ceRNAs including high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 3, peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptorgamma coactivator 1beta and leukemia inhibitory factor receptoralpha were associated with depression. A common core ceRNA network was identified by comparison analysis. Functional analysis suggested that these ceRNAs may be implicated in depression. Differential expression analysis revealed that ceRNAs in the obtained ceRNA interaction networks were significantly enriched with significantly differentially expressed genes. A total of 8 key functional modules for depression were identified, and small target molecules were screened. ceRNA protocadherinalpha subfamily C2 in module 1 and ceRNA Cyclindependent kinase 6 in module 3 were reported to be implicated in the occurrence and development of depressive disorders.

In the present study, the response of leukemic mononuclear cells to anticancer drugs used for CLL treatment (cladribine + mafosfamide; CM or CM combined with rituximab; RCM) was compared with the response to new cyclindependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors: BP14 and BP30. Viable apoptotic and necrotic cells were quantified by flow cytometry using propidium iodide and YoPro stains. CDK inhibitors were studied in several doses to determine the reduction of necrosis and simultaneous increase of apoptosis in leukemic cell incubations with anticancer agents. The distinct cell response to applied doses/anticancer agents was observed. Results obtained in the current manuscript confirmed that modulation of doses is important. This was particularly indicated in results obtained at 24 h of cells incubation with anticancer agent. While an important time for analysis of anticancer response efficacy (monitoring of apoptosis induction potential) seems to be 48 h of cells exposition to anticancer agents. High variability in response to the drugs revealed that both the nature and the dose of the anticancer agents could be important in the final effect of the therapy.

Alternative treatments for cases resistant to TKIs are required. A serine/threonine protein kinase, Tlymphokineactivated killer celloriginated protein kinase (TOPK), is highly expressed in various malignant tumors. Binding of peptides to human leukocyte antigen was assessed via mass spectrometry in K562 CML cells. TOPK expression was assessed in various CML cell lines and in clinical samples obtained from patients with CML using reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. It was observed that TOPK was expressed abundantly in BCR/ABLpositive cell lines and at significantly higher levels in CML clinical samples compared with healthy donor samples. Overexpression of BCR/ABL or the presence of its inhibitor imatinib upregulated and downregulated TOPK expression, respectively, indicating that TOPK may be a target of BCR/ABL. TOPK inhibitor OTS514 suppressed proliferation of BCR/ABLpositive cell lines and colony formation of CD34positive cells from patients with CML compared with lymphoma patients without bone marrow involvement. Furthermore, phosphorylation of TOPK was increased by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibitor okadaic acid and was decreased in the presence of PP2A activator FTY720 compared with untreated samples. As constitutive BCR/ABL activity and inhibition of PP2A are key mechanisms of CML development, TOPK may be a crucial signaling molecule for this disease.

Our aim is to investigate the potential causes of EA development, as well as clinical, laboratory, endoscopic and radiologic features, management and outcome in these patients. METHODS: The following research was performed on PubMed (MEDLINE) database using the medical subject headings [Mesh] terms ""Ascites"" AND ""Eosinophils"". RESULTS: A total of 284 results, dating from 1962 onwards, were found and abstracts were examined. 131 papers were excluded and the remaining 153 publications, consisting in case reports and series of cases, were analyzed. From 171 patients with EA, 127 subjects (74%) had EGE, 17 (10%) parasitic and fungal infections, 11(7%) Hypereosinophilic syndrome and 16 patients (9%) less common diseases (eosinophilic pancreatitis, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, myelofibrosis, T-cell lymphoma, Churg Strauss Syndrome, Systemic lupus erythematosus, Familial paroxysmal polyserositis and Menetrier's disease).

Recent studies suggest that NK cell surface receptors and cytokines are the key points of the disease development and protection. We hypothesized that the interactions between NK cell receptors and targeted cells construct an eventual niche, and this niche has an eventual profile in various autoimmune diseases and cancers. The NK cells preactivated with cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18 can have higher cytotoxicity; however, the toxic side effect of IL-2 should be considered. The vicissitudes of NK cell profile and its receptors obey the environmental communications and cell interactions. Our vision around the NK cells as an immune axis remained dual, and we still cannot judge the immune responses based on the NK cell flip-flop. A design of eventual niche to monitor the NK cell and targeted cell interaction is needed to strengthen our ability in diagnosis and treatment approaches based on the NK cells. Here, we have reviewed the shifts in the NK cells and their surface receptors in autoimmune diseases, solid tumors, and leukemia, and also discussed the effective chemokines that affect NK cell activation and proliferation.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Although absolute risks are low, infertility is associated with higher risk of cancer compared to a group of non-infertile women. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Infertile women are at higher risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. Information on risk of non-gynecologic cancers is rare and conflicting, and the effect of pregnancy on these risk associations is known for only a minority of cancer types. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort analysis between 2003 and 2016 using an insurance claims database. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In all, 64 345 infertile women identified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to 3 128 345 non-infertile patients seeking routine gynecologic care. Women with prior diagnosis of cancer or within 6 months of index event were excluded. Main outcomes were development of any malignancy and individual cancers as identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Results were adjusted for age at index date, index year, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, number of visits per year and highest level of education. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Infertile women had an overall higher risk of developing cancer compared to non-infertile women (2.0 versus 1.7%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.18; CI: 1.12-1.24). In addition, the risk of uterine cancer (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.78; CI: 1.39-2.28), ovarian cancer (0.14 versus 0.09%, aHR 1.64; CI: 1.33-2.01), lung cancer (0.21 versus 0.21%, aHR = 1.38; CI: 1.01-1.88), thyroid cancer (0.21 versus 0.16%, aHR = 1.29; CI: 1.09-1.53), leukemia (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.55; CI: 1.21-1.98) and liver and gallbladder cancer (0.05 versus 0.03%, aHR = 1.59; CI: 1.11-2.30) were higher in infertile women compared to non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis of women in each cohort who became pregnant and had a delivery during enrollment, the risk of uterine and ovarian cancer were similar between infertile and non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis excluding women with PCOS and endometriosis from both cohorts, the risk of uterine cancer was similar between infertile and non-infertile women. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Absolute risk of cancer was low, average follow up for each individual was limited, and average age at index date was limited. Insurance databases have known limitations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Using claims-based data, we report that infertile women may have a higher risk of certain cancers in the years after infertility evaluation; continued follow up should be considered after reproductive goals are achieved.

Current standard-of-care includes radiation, chemotherapy, and surgical resection when possible. Despite advances in each of these treatment modalities, survival rates for pediatric and adult HGG patients has remained largely unchanged over the course of several years. This is in stark contrast to the significant survival increases seen recently for a variety of hematological and other solid malignancies. The introduction and widespread use of immunotherapies have contributed significantly to these survival increases, and as such these therapies have been explored for use in the treatment of HGG. In particular, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown promise in clinical trials in HGG patients. However, unlike the tremendous success CAR T cell therapy has seen in B cell leukemia and lymphoma treatment, the success in HGG patients has been modest at best. This is largely due to the unique tumor microenvironment in the central nervous system, difficulty in accessing the tumor site, and heterogeneity in target antigen expression. The results of these features are poor CAR T cell proliferation, poor persistence, suboptimal cytokine secretion, and the emergence of antigen-loss tumor variants. These issues have called for the development of ""next generation"" CAR T cells designed to circumvent the barriers that have limited the success of current CAR T cell technologies in HGG treatment. Rapid advancements in gene editing technologies have provided several avenues for CAR T cell modification to enhance their efficacy.

Consecutive 151 de novo pediatric AML patients, (</=18 yr) were prospectively enrolled from June 2013-August 2016, to assess the prognostic impact of mt-DNA D-loop variations (somatic/germline) on survival. For each patient, D-loop region was sequenced on baseline bone marrow and buccal swab, and mother's blood sample. In 151 AML subjects, 1490 variations were found at 237 positions; 80.9% were germline and 19.1% somatic. The mean number of variations per position was 6.3. Variations with frequency >/=6 were analyzed for their impact on survival and 4 categories were created, namely ""somatic-protective"", ""somatic-hazardous"", ""germline-protective"" and ""germline- hazardous"". Although, somatic-protective could not predict event free survival (EFS) or overall survival (OS), somatic-hazardous [(OS) HR = 2.33, p = 0.06] and germline-hazardous [(OS) HR = 2.85, p < 0.01] significantly predicted OS and EFS. Notably, the germline-protective, could significantly predict EFS (HR = 0.31, p = 0.03) and OS (HR = 0.19, p < 0.01), only when variations at >/=2 positions were present. On multivariate analysis, three positions namely 16111, 16126, 16362 and karyotype were found to be predictive of EFS. A prognostic index (PI) was developed using nomogram PI = (0.8*karyotype) + (1.0*c16111) + (0.7*t16362) + (1.2*t16126). Hazard ratio for EFS increased significantly with increasing PI reaching to a maximum of 3.3 (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the impact of mt-DNA D-loop variations on outcomes in pediatric AML depends on their nature (germline/somatic), position and mutational burden, highlighting their potential role as evolving prognostic biomarkers.",,"['Tyagi, Anudishi', 'Pramanik, Raja', 'Vishnubhatla, Sreenivas', 'Bakhshi, Radhika', 'Bakhshi, Sameer']","['Tyagi A', 'Pramanik R', 'Vishnubhatla S', 'Bakhshi R', 'Bakhshi S']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dr. B.

Only limited data are available to characterize this condition, and it remains largely unknown. Patients and methods: In our study, we performed karyotype analysis on 1,031 patients diagnosed with acute leukemia from 2006 to 2018. A total of 10 patients of near-triploidy/tetraploidy karyotype were enrolled. Two cases of near-triploidy (66-79 chromosomes) and eight cases of near-tetraploidy (84-100 chromosomes) were identified. Bone marrow samples of these 10 patients were analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with 19 commercially available probes that detected a small portion of gene alterations and large regions of chromosome amplifications. Results: Of the six patients with acute myelocytic leukemia, we detected three cases of double t(8;21)(q22;q22) that have not been previously reported, and one of them demonstrated ins(21;8) (q22;q24q22). We also describe a novel pediatric case carrying double t(15;17)(q22;q21) and receiving targeted treatment with all-trans retinoic acid therapy. To date, this case has responded well to the regimen and has shown continuous complete remission. All patients received chemotherapy. One of them received allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) and survived for 22 months. Eight of the 10 patients died, and the median overall survival was 11 months. Conclusion: Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, we identified the distinct complex karyotype of near-triploidy/tetraploidy and provided further prognostic information. Tetraploidy acute promyelocytic leukemia had favorable prognosis; thus, HSCT was not necessary. The case of insertion t(21;8)(q22;q24q22) in tetraploidy responded poorly to chemotherapy and achieved molecular remission with difficultly.

Efficacy and safety data for nilotinib in the Asian population is scarce, particularly in Pakistan. We aimed to determine the MR to nilotinib and its safety profile in patients with chronic phase CML. Patients and methods: This observational study was conducted among 173 patients with newly diagnosed CML presenting in the chronic phase. Most patients (50.1%) had a high Sokal score at diagnosis. All patients received nilotinib 600 mg/day. The hematological and molecular responses were assessed at 3 and 6 months respectively and thereafter at 6-monthly intervals. Long-term event free survival (EFS), transformation free survival (TFS), overall survival (OS) and adverse events were observed. Results: Cumulative incidence of major MR (MMR) was 86% and deep MR (DMR ie MR 4.0 and MR4.5) was 39%. Early MMR and DMR after 6 months of therapy were achieved by 74.9% and 37% of patients, respectively. Two-year EFS, TFS and OS rates for all patients were 91.9%, 92% and 92.3%, respectively. At median follow-up of 24 months, 81% and 49% of patients sustained MMR and DMR, respectively. The main adverse events were weight gain (4.6%) and abdominal pain (4%).

From the therapeutic point of view, selective inhibition of PI3Kdelta with idelalisib represents a valuable addition to available treatment options for patients with CLL/SLL, many of whom do not respond to or cannot tolerate chemoimmunotherapy. However, to our knowledge, there have been no prospective studies evaluating idelalisib efficacy in a DLBCL-ABC form of RS. Here, we present a case of a DLBCL-ABC form of RS achieving a complete response at 3 weeks after initiating idelalisib and rituximab therapy for six cycles. This response was maintained during the idelalisib monotherapy, but the patient relapsed rapidly after treatment was withdrawn, because of a grade three immune colitis that developed at 10 months of treatment. This report demonstrates that idelalisib is highly effective in RS and provides an attractive option in this aggressive disease.

The Wnt/beta-catenin pathway is required for the development of LSCs in AML. The present study aimed to validate whether CD82 supports the survival of LSCs in pediatric AML via activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. METHODS: CD82 expression and its correlation with molecules downstream of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in samples from pediatric AML patients were analyzed. Forced or downregulated expression of CD82 in AML cells was evaluated for the effects of CD82 on cell proliferation, cycle regulation, apoptosis, and adriamycin chemoresistance and to validate the underlying mechanism. RESULT: Aberrant expression of CD82 in pediatric AML patients was found. CD82 messenger RNA expression correlated positively with downstream molecules of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in AML children. Knockdown of CD82 induced apoptosis, suppressed growth, and decreased adriamycin chemoresistance in AML cells. CD82 accelerated beta-catenin nuclear location and then stimulated the expression of downstream molecules of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway. CONCLUSION: CD82 regulates the proliferation and chemotherapy resistance of AML cells via activation of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which suggest that the CD82 may be a potential therapeutic target in AML children.",,"['Ji, Hongyan', 'Chen, Li', 'Xing, Yuqian', 'Li, Shanshan', 'Dai, Jianjian', 'Zhao, Ping', 'Wang, Yulin']","['Ji H', 'Chen L', 'Xing Y', 'Li S', 'Dai J', 'Zhao P', 'Wang Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Anhui Provincial Cancer Hospital, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Nursing Department, Shandong University Second Affiliated Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Health Oncology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China. slyyzp123@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, China.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190312,United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,"['0 (CD82 protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Kangai-1 Protein)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Kangai-1 Protein/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', '*Wnt Signaling Pathway', 'beta Catenin/*metabolism']",,,2019/03/14 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41390-019-0370-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41390-019-0370-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Pediatr Res. 2019 Jun;85(7):1024-1031. doi: 10.1038/s41390-019-0370-3.

With the use of more modern, efficient treatments, 5-year survival has reached more than 90% in this population. However, this achievement comes with many secondary and long-term effects since more than 65% of the survivors experience at least one severe complication, including the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. The main objective of the present work was to characterize the composition of HDL particles isolated from pediatric ALL survivors. HDLs from 8 metabolically healthy ALL survivors, 8 metabolically unhealthy ALL survivors and 8 age- and gender-matched controls were analyzed. The HDL fraction from the survivors contained less cholesterol than the controls. In addition, proteomic analyses revealed an enrichment of pro-thrombotic (e.g., fibrinogen) and pro-inflammatory (e.g., amyloid A) proteins in the HDLs deriving from metabolically unhealthy survivors. These results indicate an alteration in the composition of lipid and protein content of HDL from childhood ALL survivors with metabolic disorders. Although more work is needed to validate the functionality of these HDLs, the data seem relevant for survivor health given the detection of potential biomarkers related to HDL metabolism and functionality in cancer.",,"['Fournier, Maryse', 'Bonneil, Eric', 'Garofalo, Carole', 'Grimard, Guy', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Marcil, Valerie', 'Levy, Emile']","['Fournier M', 'Bonneil E', 'Garofalo C', 'Grimard G', 'Laverdiere C', 'Krajinovic M', 'Drouin S', 'Sinnett D', 'Marcil V', 'Levy E']","['Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, QC, H3C 3J7, Montreal, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada.', 'Research Centre, Sainte-Justine University Hospital Health Center, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada. emile.levy@recherche-ste-justine.qc.ca.', 'Department of Nutrition, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, H3T 1C5, Quebec, Canada. emile.levy@recherche-ste-justine.qc.ca.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4039-3131', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3625-6676', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9983-7027']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190312,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers', '*Cancer Survivors', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/blood/etiology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/blood/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/blood/etiology/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*complications/metabolism/mortality', 'Proteomics', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/03/14 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-40906-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-40906-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 12;9(1):4268. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-40906-x.,PMC6414624,,['CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, outcomes of relapsed BCP-ALL remain unsatisfactory, particularly in adult patients where the molecular basis of relapse is still poorly understood. To elucidate the evolution of relapse in BCP-ALL, we established a comprehensive multi-omics dataset including DNA-sequencing, RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation array and proteome MASS-spec data from matched diagnosis and relapse samples of BCP-ALL patients (n = 50) including the subtypes DUX4, Ph-like and two aneuploid subtypes. Relapse-specific alterations were enriched for chromatin modifiers, nucleotide and steroid metabolism including the novel candidates FPGS, AGBL and ZNF483. The proteome expression analysis unraveled deregulation of metabolic pathways at relapse including the key proteins G6PD, TKT, GPI and PGD. Moreover, we identified a novel relapse-specific gene signature specific for DUX4 BCP-ALL patients highlighting chemotaxis and cytokine environment as a possible driver event at relapse. This study presents novel insights at distinct molecular levels of relapsed BCP-ALL based on a comprehensive multi-omics integrated data set including a valuable proteomics data set. The relapse specific aberrations reveal metabolic signatures on genomic and proteomic levels in BCP-ALL relapse. Furthermore, the chemokine expression signature in DUX4 relapse underscores the distinct status of DUX4-fusion BCP-ALL.",,"['Schroeder, Michael P', 'Bastian, Lorenz', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Gokbuget,

However, the regulatory mechanisms modulating mutant and/or wild-type (WT) IDH1 function remain unknown. Here, we show that two groups of tyrosine kinases (TK) enhance the activation of mutant and WT IDH1 through preferential Y42 or Y391 phosphorylation. Mechanistically, Y42 phosphorylation occurs in IDH1 monomers, which promotes dimer formation with enhanced substrate (isocitrate or alpha-ketoglutarate) binding, whereas Y42-phosphorylated dimers show attenuated disruption to monomers. Y391 phosphorylation occurs in both monomeric and dimeric IDH1, which enhances cofactor (NADP(+) or NADPH) binding. Diverse oncogenic TKs phosphorylate IDH1 WT at Y42 and activate Src to phosphorylate IDH1 at Y391, which contributes to reductive carboxylation and tumor growth, whereas FLT3 or the FLT3-ITD mutation activates JAK2 to enhance mutant IDH1 activity through phosphorylation of Y391 and Y42, respectively, in AML cells. SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrated an intrinsic connection between oncogenic TKs and activation of WT and mutant IDH1, which involves distinct TK cascades in related cancers. In particular, these results provide an additional rationale supporting the combination of FLT3 and mutant IDH1 inhibitors as a promising clinical treatment of mutant IDH1-positive AML.See related

The highest rates of treatment failure occur in specific genetic subsets of ALL, including hypodiploid B-cell ALL (B-ALL), for which effective alternative therapies to current intensive chemotherapy treatments have yet to be developed. Here, we integrated biochemical and genomic profiling with functional drug assays to select effective agents with therapeutic potential against hypodiploid B-ALL. ABT-199, a selective Bcl-2 inhibitor, was effective in reducing leukemic burden in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived xenograft models of hypodiploid B-ALL. Daily oral treatment with ABT-199 significantly increased survival in xenografted mice. The unexpected efficacy of ABT-199 observed in hypodiploid leukemias lacking BIM expression (the major reported mediator of ABT-199-induced apoptosis) led us to investigate the mechanism of action of ABT-199 in the absence of BIM.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Frequency and prognostic impact of PAK2 amplification were evaluated in an ATLL cohort of 370 cases. Novel long-term cultures and in vivo xenograft models were developed using primary ATLL cells from North American patients. Two PAK inhibitors were used to block PAK kinase activity pharmacologically. siRNA-based gene silencing approach was used to genetically knockdown (KD) PAK1 and PAK2 in ATLL cell lines. RESULTS: PAK1/2/4 are the three most abundantly expressed PAK family members in ATLL. PAK2 amplifications are seen in 24% of ATLLs and are associated with worse prognosis in a large patient cohort. The pan-PAK inhibitor PF-3758309 (PF) has strong in vitro and in vivo activity in a variety of ATLL preclinical models. These activities of PF are likely attributed to its ability to target several PAK isoforms simultaneously because genetic silencing of either PAK1 or PAK2 produced more modest effects. PAK2 plays a major role in CADM1-mediated stromal interaction, which is an important step in systemic dissemination of the disease. This finding is consistent with the observation that PAK2 amplification is more frequent in aggressive ATLLs and correlates with inferior outcome. CONCLUSIONS: PAK2, a gene frequently amplified in ATLL, facilitates CADM1-mediated stromal interaction and promotes survival of ATLL cells. Taken together, PAK inhibition may hold significant promise as a targeted therapy for aggressive ATLLs.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Chung, Elaine Y', 'Mai, Yun', 'Shah, Urvi A', 'Wei, Yongqiang', 'Ishida, Elise', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Ren, Xiaoxin', 'Pradhan, Kith', 'Bartholdy, Boris', 'Wei, Xiaolei', 'Zou, Yiyu', 'Zhang, Jinghang', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Zang, Xingxing', 'Verma, Amit', 'Janakiram, Murali', 'Ye, B Hilda']","['Chung EY', 'Mai Y', 'Shah UA', 'Wei Y', 'Ishida E', 'Kataoka K', 'Ren X', 'Pradhan K', 'Bartholdy B', 'Wei X', 'Zou Y', 'Zhang J', 'Ogawa S', 'Steidl U', 'Zang X', 'Verma A', 'Janakiram M', 'Ye BH']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Division of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York. hilda.ye@einstein.yu.edu.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8419-1091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7401-8591']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190312,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (PF 3758309)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'p21-Activated Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",,,2019/03/14 06:00,2020/08/20 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2018/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3033 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3033 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jun 15;25(12):3589-3601. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3033.

The S2 protein from equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) has been reported to reduce SERINC5 expression at steady-state levels likely via the endocytic pathway; however, the precise mechanism is still unclear. Here, we investigated how EIAV S2 protein down-regulates SERINC5 compared with down-regulation induced by Nef from HIV-1 and glycoMA proteins from murine leukemia virus (MLV). Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay and immunoprecipitation (IP), we detected an interaction between S2 and SERINC5. We found that this interaction relies on the S2 myristoylation site, indicating that it may occur on the plasma membrane. S2 internalized SERINC5 via receptor-mediated endocytosis and targeted it to endosomes and lysosomes, resulting in a ubiquitination-dependent decrease in SERINC5 expression at steady-state levels. Both BiFC and IP detected a glycoMA-SERINC5 interaction, but a Nef-SERINC5 interaction was detected only by BiFC. Moreover, S2 and glycoMA down-regulated SERINC5 more effectively than did Nef. We further show that unlike Nef, both S2 and glycoMA effectively down-regulate SERINC2 and also SERINC5 from Xenopus tropicalis (xSERINC5). Moreover, we detected expression of the equine SERINC5 (eSERINC5) protein and observed that its expression is much weaker than expression levels of SERINC5 from other species. Nonetheless, eSERINC5 had a strong antiviral activity that was effectively counteracted by S2. We conclude that HIV-1, EIAV, and MLV share a similar mechanism to antagonize viral restriction by host SERINC5.",['(c) 2019 Ahmad et al.'],"['Ahmad, Iqbal', 'Li, Sunan', 'Li, Rongrong', 'Chai, Qingqing', 'Zhang, Lixin', 'Wang, Bin', 'Yu, Changqing', 'Zheng, Yong-Hui']","['Ahmad I', 'Li S', 'Li R', 'Chai Q', 'Zhang L', 'Wang B', 'Yu C', 'Zheng YH']","['From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and.', 'From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and.', 'From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824.', 'From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and.', 'From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and.', 'From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and.', 'From the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, CAAS-Michigan State University Joint Laboratory of Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin 150069, China and zhengyo@msu.edu.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1098-7385'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190312,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (S2 protein, Equine infectious anemia virus)', '0 (SERINC5 protein, human)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endocytosis', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Organelles/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Viral Proteins/*metabolism', 'nef Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*EIAV S2', '*HIV Nef', '*MLV glycoGag', '*SERINC5', '*host-pathogen interaction', '*innate immunity', '*restriction factor', '*viral protein', '*virus', '*virus entry']",2019/03/14 06:00,2020/01/08 06:00,['2019/03/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)36632-1 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.007662 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Apr 26;294(17):7013-7024. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.007662.

Venetoclax dose initially was escalated (100-400 mg) in a 3 + 3 design to define MTD combined with standard-dose obinutuzumab. Patients received venetoclax (schedule A) or obinutuzumab (schedule B) first to compare safety and determine dose/schedule for expansion. Venetoclax-obinutuzumab was administered for 6 cycles, followed by venetoclax monotherapy until disease progression (R/R) or fixed duration 1-year treatment (1L). Fifty R/R and 32 1L patients were enrolled. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. Safety, including incidence of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), did not differ between schedules (2 laboratory TLSs per schedule). Schedule B and a 400-mg dose of venetoclax were chosen for expansion. The most common grade 3-4 adverse event was neutropenia (R/R, 58% of patients; 1L, 53%). Rates of grade 3-4 infections were 29% (R/R) and 13% (1L); no fatal infections occurred in 1L. All infusion-related reactions were grade 1-2, except for 2 grade 3 events. No clinical TLS was observed.

They could be important in neutrophils for handling the large amount of oxidants that these cells produce. We investigated the redox state of Prx1 and Prx2 in HL-60 promyelocytic cells differentiated to neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) and in human neutrophils. HL-60cell differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide caused a large decrease in expression of both Prxs, and all-trans retinoic acid also decreased Prx1 expression. Prx1 was mostly reduced in dHL-60cells. NADPH oxidase activation by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or ingestion of Staphylococcus aureus induced rapid oxidation to disulfide-linked dimers, and eventually hyperoxidation. The NADPH oxidase inhibitor, diphenyleneiodonium, prevented Prx1 dimerization in stimulated dHL-60cells, and decreased the extent of oxidation under resting conditions. In contrast, Prx1 and Prx2 were present in neutrophils from human blood as disulfides, and PMA or S. aureus caused no further oxidation. They remained oxidized on incubation with diphenyleneiodonium in media. Although this suggests that Prx redox cycling could be deficient in neutrophils, thioredoxin expression and thioredoxin reductase activity were similar in neutrophils and dHL-60cells. Additionally, neutrophil thioredoxin was initially reduced and underwent oxidation after PMA activation. Thus, although the Prxs respond to oxidant generation in dHL-60cells, in neutrophils they appear ""locked"" as disulfides. On this basis we propose that neutrophil Prxs are inefficient antioxidants and contribute little to peroxide removal during the oxidative burst, and speculate that they might be involved in other cell processes.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

We aimed to establish a cytarabine-resistant line from FLT3-ITD-positive MV4-11 (MV4-11-P) cells and examine the development of resistance. The FLT3-ITD mutation was retained in MV4-11-R; however, the protein was underglycosylated and less phosphorylated in these cells. Moreover, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt, MEK1/2 and p53 increased in MV4-11-R. The levels of Mcl-1 and p53 proteins were also elevated in MV4-11-R. A p53 D281G mutant emerged in MV4-11-R, in addition to the pre-existing R248W mutation. MV4-11-P and MV4-11-R showed similar sensitivity to cabozantinib, sorafenib, and MK2206, whereas MV4-11-R showed resistance to CI-1040 and idarubicin. MV4-11-R resistance may be associated with inhibition of Akt phosphorylation, but not ERK phosphorylation, after exposure to these drugs. The multi-kinase inhibitor cabozantinib inhibited FLT3-ITD signaling in MV4-11-R cells and MV4-11-R-derived tumors in mice. Cabozantinib effectively inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival time in mice bearing MV4-11-R-derived tumors. Together, our findings suggest that Mcl-1 and Akt phosphorylation are potential therapeutic targets for p53 mutants and that cabozantinib is an effective treatment in cytarabine-resistant FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",,"['Ko, Ya-Chen', 'Hu, Chung-Yi', 'Liu, Zheng-Hau', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang', 'Ou, Da-Liang', 'Chien, Hsiung-Fei', 'Lin, Liang-In']","['Ko YC', 'Hu CY', 'Liu ZH', 'Tien HF', 'Ou DL', 'Chien HF', 'Lin LI']","['Department of Medical Imaging and Radiological Technology, Yuanpei University of Medical Technology, Hsinchu 300, Taiwan. koyc@mail.ypu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan. jcyhu@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei 100, Taiwan. jcyhu@ntu.edu.tw.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences and Medical Biotechnology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei 100, Taiwan.

The PREVAPIX-ALL study is an open-label randomized controlled study comparing outcomes of treatment with prophylactic dose apixaban versus no anticoagulation (standard of care) in children and adolescents with ALL and T/B cell LL receiving standard induction chemotherapy with asparaginase and the presence of a central venous access device. On day 29 of induction, all patients undergo screening imaging with duplex ultrasonography and echocardiography. The primary efficacy endpoint of the study is a composite of symptomatic and asymptomatic VTE that includes deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebral sinovenous thrombosis or VTE-related death. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding. Secondary outcomes are central line-associated infections, patency and line replacement, superficial thrombosis, arterial events and death. A planned sample size of 500 randomized paediatric patients enrolled over a period of 5 years is based on the estimation of VTE rates of 20 and 10% in the standard of care and apixaban groups, respectively. An optional biomarker study in 150 patients will examine predictors of increased VTE risk and study in vivo anticoagulant effects of apixaban in children by measuring specific biomarkers in the haemostatic system and inflammatory pathway.

Proteins, by definition, are nano materials and have been clinically proven as an efficient delivery vehicle for small molecule drugs. Here we describe the design of a protein-based peptide drug carrier derived from the tetramerization domain of the chimeric oncogenic protein Bcr/Abl of chronic myeloid leukemia. A dodecameric peptide inhibitor of the p53-MDM2/MDMX interaction, termed PMI, was grafted to the N-terminal helical region of Bcr/Abl tetramer. To antagonize intracellular MDM2/MDMX for p53 activation, we extended this protein, (PMI)Bcr/Abl, by a C-terminal Arg-repeating hexapeptide to facilitate its cellular uptake. The resultant tetrameric protein (PMI)Bcr/Abl-R6 adopted an alpha-helical conformation in solution and bound to MDM2 at an affinity of 32nM. (PMI)Bcr/Abl-R6 effectively induced apoptosis of HCT116 p53(+/+) cells in vitro in a p53-dependent manner and potently inhibited tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model by stabilizing p53 in vivo. Our protein-based delivery strategy thus provides a clinically viable solution to p53-inspired anticancer therapy and is likely applicable to the development of many other peptide therapeutics to target a great variety of intracellular protein-protein interactions responsible for disease initiation and progression.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Trisomy of the terminal portion of 15q which includes the IGFR1 gene, produces a rare overgrowth phenotype that has been termed 15q overgrowth syndrome (15q OGS). Upregulation of IGF1R has long been implicated in oncogenesis of multiple cancer types, including acute leukemias, and has been shown to render cells more susceptible to other transforming events. To date, too few cases of 15q OGS have been reported to identify any cancer predisposition. We present a case of a 34-year-old female with intellectual disability, macrocephaly, and subtle dysmorphic features who was diagnosed with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (lymphoid and myeloid). Prior to initiation of therapy she was referred to medical genetics for further evaluation and was identified as having a chromosomal translocation resulting in a partial trisomy of chromosome 15q, consistent with 15q OGS. A review of the literature for cases of malignancy in individuals with increased copy number of 15q revealed only one other reported patient.

Although intensive chemotherapy provides high cure rates in a majority of patients, subtypes harboring certain genetic lesions, such as MLL rearrangements or BCR-ABL1 fusion, remain clinically challenging, necessitating a search for other therapeutic approaches. Herein, we aimed to validate antioxidant enzymes of the thioredoxin system as potential therapeutic targets in BCP-ALL. We observed oxidative stress along with aberrant expression of the enzymes associated with the activity of thioredoxin antioxidant system in BCP-ALL cells. Moreover, we found that auranofin and adenanthin, inhibitors of the thioredoxin system antioxidant enzymes, effectively kill BCP-ALL cell lines and pediatric and adult BCP-ALL primary cells, including primary cells cocultured with bone marrow-derived stem cells. Furthermore, auranofin delayed the progression of leukemia in MLL-rearranged patient-derived xenograft model and prolonged the survival of leukemic NSG mice. Our results unveil the thioredoxin system as a novel target for BCP-ALL therapy, and indicate that further studies assessing the anticancer efficacy of combinations of thioredoxin system inhibitors with conventional anti-BCP-ALL drugs should be continued.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

These studies have suggested strategies for optimizing CAR T-cell fitness as well as the pre-existing host immune response, approaches that will likely lead to improvements in the efficacy of CAR T cells in CLL.

We hypothesized that nutrition supplementation with bovine colostrum, rich in bioactive factors, would ameliorate gastrointestinal toxicity and reduce the incidence of fever and infectious complications during induction treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Children with newly diagnosed ALL were included in a 2-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomized to receive a daily colostrum or placebo supplement during 4 weeks of induction treatment. Data on fever, bacteremia, need for antibiotics, and mucosal toxicity were prospectively collected. (Trial registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT01766804). RESULTS: Sixty-two patients were included. No differences were found for the primary outcome (number of days with fever). No difference was observed for neutropenic fever, intravenous antibiotics, or incidence of bacteremia. Peak severity of oral mucositis was significantly reduced by colostrum (7/29 patients, 24% mild; 6/29, 21% moderate; 1/29, 3% severe) compared with placebo (12/31, 39% mild; 1/31, 3% moderate; 7/31, 23% severe) (P = 0.02). Among patients receiving at least 1 dose of supplement (colostrum: n = 22; placebo: n = 30), the peak weekly self-reported oral mucositis score was overall significantly less severe in the colostrum group (P = 0.009). CONCLUSION: The use of prophylactic bovine colostrum showed no effect on fever, infectious morbidity, or inflammatory responses.

Comorbidities significantly impact the prognosis of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The objective of this study was to determine the association and impact of CHIP mutations with comorbidities in patients with MDS. METHODS: This retrospective analysis of 566 consecutive patients with MDS was conducted at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center from August 2013 to December 2016. The 27-item Adult Comorbidity Evaluation (ACE-27) scale was used to assess the severity of comorbid conditions. Next-generation sequencing was used to detect the presence of CHIP mutations in bone marrow aspirates. Spearman correlations and logistic regression analyses were used to determine the association between mutations and comorbidities. RESULTS: Mutations in the genes tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (TET2), ASXL transcriptional regulator 1 (ASXL1), DNA methyltransferase 3alpha (DNMT3A), Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), and tumor protein 53 (TP53) were noted in 20%, 18%, 9%, 2%, and 21% of patients, respectively. Patients with DNMT3A and JAK2 mutations had higher likelihoods of a prior history of myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 2.62; P = .03) and veno-occlusive disease (odds ratio, 6.48; P = .02), respectively. TP53 mutation was associated with a prior history of malignancy. Patients with TET2 mutation had no association with any comorbidity. A prognostic model including the revised International Prognostic Scoring System classification, the ACE-27 score, and TP53 mutation status (the I-RAT model) predicted median overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with MDS, the presence of CHIP-associated mutations is associated with comorbidities. DNMT3A and JAK2 mutations were associated with higher likelihoods of prior myocardial infarction and thrombotic events. There was no association between comorbidity and TET2 mutation. Incorporating the revised International Prognostic Scoring System classification with the ACE-27 and TP53 mutation status improved outcome prediction in patients with MDS.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Naqvi, Kiran', 'Sasaki, Koji', 'Montalban-Bravo, Guillermo', 'Alfonso Pierola, Ana', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Short, Nicholas', 'Assi, Rita', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Takahashi, Koichi', 'Nogueras Gonzalez, Graciela', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Soltysiak, Kelly A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Naqvi K', 'Sasaki K', 'Montalban-Bravo G', 'Alfonso Pierola A', 'Yilmaz M', 'Short N', 'Assi R', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Kadia T', 'Pierce S', 'Takahashi K', 'Nogueras Gonzalez G', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Patel K', 'Soltysiak KA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5511-6153', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190312,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Clonal Evolution', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential', '*comorbidities', '*mutations', '*myelodysplastic syndromes']",2019/03/13 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32056 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Jul 1;125(13):2233-2241. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32056.

In order to classify Raman spectra, clustering method known as Super Paramagnetic Clustering based on statistical physics concepts with a stochastic approach was implemented. Comparing firstly average Raman spectra of the three cancers, some peaks that allowed differentiating one cancer from other were identified, however, other peaks allowed concluding that there are biochemical similarities among them. According to these spectra, the band associated with amide I (1654 cm-1) and one of two shoulders assigned to amide III (1230-1282 cm-1) allowed discriminating leukemia from breast and cervical cancer, whereas band 714 cm-1 (polysaccharides) achieves to differentiate cervical cancer from leukemia and breast cancer, and bulged region, 1040 - 1100 cm-1 (phenylalanine, phospholipid) discriminated breast cancer from leukemia and cervical cancer. Subsequently, Super Paramagnetic Clustering method was applied to Raman spectra to study similarity relationships between cancers based on the biochemical composition of serum samples. Finally, as a cross check method, the standard method to classify Raman spectra of breast cancer, leukemia and cervical cancer, known as principal components analysis, was used showing excellent agreement with results of Super Paramagnetic Clustering method.

Both, genetically modified donor-derived NK cells as well as continuously expanding NK-92 cells are currently under clinical development. To enhance their therapeutic utility for the treatment of pre-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), we engineered NK-92 cells by lentiviral gene transfer to express a FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-specific CAR that contains a composite CD28-CD3zeta signaling domain. FLT3 has primarily been described as a therapeutic target for acute myeloid leukemia, but overexpression of FLT3 has also been reported in B-ALL. Exposure of FLT3-positive targets to CAR NK-92 cells resulted in conjugate formation between NK and leukemia cells, NK-cell degranulation and selective cytotoxicity toward established B-ALL cell lines and primary blasts that were resistant to parental NK-92. In a SEM B-ALL xenograft model in NOD-SCID IL2R gamma(null) mice, treatment with CAR NK-92 but not parental NK-92 cells markedly inhibited disease progression, demonstrating high antileukemic activity in vivo. As FLT3 is known to be also expressed on precursor cells, we assessed the feasibility of incorporating an inducible caspase-9 (iCasp9) suicide switch to enhance safety of our approach. Upon addition of the chemical dimerizer AP20187 to NK-92 cells coexpressing the FLT3-specific CAR and iCasp9, rapid iCasp9 activation was observed, precluding further CAR-mediated cytotoxicity. Our data demonstrate that B-ALL can be effectively targeted by FLT3-specific CAR NK cells which may complement CD19-directed immunotherapies, particularly in cases of inherent or acquired resistance to the latter.",['(c) 2019 UICC.'],"['Oelsner, Sarah', 'Waldmann, Anja', 'Billmeier, Arne', 'Roder, Jasmin', 'Lindner, Aline', 'Ullrich, Evelyn', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Jung, Gundram', 'Grosse-Hovest, Ludger', 'Oberoi, Pranav', 'Bader, Peter', 'Wels, Winfried S']","['Oelsner S', 'Waldmann A', 'Billmeier A', 'Roder J', 'Lindner A', 'Ullrich E', 'Marschalek R', 'Dotti G', 'Jung G', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Oberoi P', 'Bader P', 'Wels WS']","['Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'LOEWE Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'SYNIMMUNE GmbH, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Division for Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunology, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt/Mainz, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9858-3643'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190324,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Il2rg protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Genetic Engineering', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', 'Interleukin Receptor Common gamma Subunit/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*transplantation', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-ALL', '*CD135', '*FLT3', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*chimeric antigen receptor', '*natural killer cells']",2019/03/13 06:00,2020/01/18 06:00,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2018/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32269 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Oct 1;145(7):1935-1945. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32269.

METHODS: We analyzed 43 pediatric and young adult subjects participating in a Phase I trial of defined composition CD19CAR T cells (NCT02028455). CAR T cell phenotype, function and expansion, as well as starting material T cell repertoire, were analyzed in relation to therapeutic outcome (defined as achieving complete remission within 63 days) and duration of leukemia free survival and B cell aplasia. RESULTS: These analyses reveal that initial therapeutic failures (n = 5) were associated with attenuated CAR T cell expansion and/or rapid attrition of functional CAR effector cells following adoptive transfer. The CAR T products were similar in phenotype and function when compared to products resulting in sustained remissions. However, the initial apheresed peripheral blood T cells could be distinguished by an increased frequency of LAG-3+/TNF-alphalow CD8 T cells and, following adoptive transfer, the rapid expression of exhaustion markers. For the 38 subjects who achieved an initial sustained MRD-neg remission, remission durability correlated with therapeutic products having increased frequencies of TNF-alpha-secreting CAR CD8+ T cells, and was dependent on a sufficiently high CD19+ antigen load at time of infusion to trigger CAR T cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: These parameters have the potential to prospectively identify patients at risk for therapeutic failure and support the development of approaches to boost CAR T cell activation and proliferation in patients with low levels of CD19 antigen.

We previously demonstrated that autophagy-deficiency causes myoblast apoptosis and impairs myotube formation. In this study, we continued this work with particular emphasis on mitochondrial remodelling and stress/apoptotic signaling. We found increased (p < 0.05) autophagic (e.g., altered LC3B levels, increased ATG7, decreased SQSTM1) and mitophagic (e.g., BNIP3 upregulation, mitochondrial localized GFP-LC3 puncta, and elevated mitochondrial LC3B-II) signaling during myoblast differentiation. shRNA-mediated knockdown of ATG7 (shAtg7) decreased these autophagic and mitophagic responses, while increasing CASP3 activity and ANXA5/annexin V staining in differentiating myoblasts; ultimately resulting in dramatically impaired myogenesis. Further confirming the importance of mitophagy in these responses, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of Bnip3 (bnip3(-/-)) resulted in increased CASP3 activity and DNA fragmentation as well as impaired myoblast differentiation. In addition, shAtg7 myoblasts displayed greater endoplasmic reticulum (e.g., increased CAPN activity and HSPA) and mitochondrial (e.g., mPTP formation, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, elevated mitochondrial 4-HNE) stress. shAtg7 and bnip3(-/-) myoblasts also displayed altered mitochondria-associated signaling (e.g., PPARGC1A, DNM1L, OPA1) and protein content (e.g., SLC25A4, VDAC1, CYCS). Moreover, shAtg7 myoblasts displayed CYCS and AIFM1 release from mitochondria, and CASP9 activation. Similarly, bnip3(-/-) myoblasts had significantly higher CASP9 activation during differentiation. Importantly, administration of a chemical inhibitor of CASP9 (Ac-LEHD-CHO) or dominant-negative CASP9 (ad-DNCASP9) partially recovered differentiation and myogenesis in shAtg7 myoblasts. Together, these data demonstrate an essential role for autophagy in protecting myoblasts from mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptotic signaling during differentiation, as well as in the regulation of mitochondrial network remodelling and myogenesis.

In this study, we investigated whether rs3824662 in GATA3 associates with CRLF2 expression in leukemic cells and predicts prognosis in pediatric BCP-ALL patients treated according to the ALL Intercontinental Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (IC BFM) 2009 (n = 645) and the ALL IC BFM 2002 (n = 216) protocols. High expression of CRLF2 was observed at both protein and mRNA levels (fourfold higher in AA than in CA + CC) among GATA3 AA variant carriers, independent of the presence of P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion. Additionally, the AA variant at rs3824662 was a significant factor affecting minimal residual disease level at the end of induction phase and overall survival regardless of the risk group and the protocol. The germline variant at rs3824662 in GATA3 is a prognostic factor which associates with CRLF2 expression in leukemic cells supporting the hypothesis that GATA3 may have a regulatory effect on the CRLF2 pathway in pediatric BCP-ALL.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Madzio, Joanna', 'Pastorczak, Agata', 'Sedek, Lukasz', 'Braun, Marcin', 'Taha, Joanna', 'Wypyszczak, Kamila', 'Trelinska, Joanna', 'Lejman, Monika', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Tomasik, Bartlomiej', 'Derwich, Katarzyna', 'Koltan, Andrzej', 'Kazanowska, Bernarda', 'Irga-Jaworska, Nina', 'Badowska, Wanda', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Fendler, Wojciech', 'Szczepanski, Tomasz', 'Mlynarski, Wojciech']","['Madzio J', 'Pastorczak A', 'Sedek L', 'Braun M', 'Taha J', 'Wypyszczak K', 'Trelinska J', 'Lejman M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Tomasik B', 'Derwich K', 'Koltan A', 'Kazanowska B', 'Irga-Jaworska N', 'Badowska W', 'Matysiak M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Styczynski J', 'Fendler W', 'Szczepanski T', 'Mlynarski W']","['Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Molecular Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Biostatistics & Translational Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Transplantology, Medical University of Wroclaw, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Gdansk Medical University, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Warmia and Mazury, Olsztyn, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Lublin, Lublin, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University, Torun, Poland.', 'Department of Biostatistics & Translational Medicine, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Zabrze Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oncology and Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0766-0194'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190403,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (GATA3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA3 protein, human)', '0 (P2RY8 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2Y)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'GATA3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Oncogene Fusion', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2Y/genetics', 'Survival Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['* CRLF2', '* GATA3', '*Ph-like ALL', '*minimal residual disease', '*pediatric leukemia', '*polymorphism']",2019/03/13 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22748 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Sep;58(9):619-626. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22748.

In this work, we examined whether reprogramming of the apoptotic and migratory machineries through a multi-targeting approach would induce enhanced cell death and enhanced inhibition of the migratory capacity of glioblastoma cells. METHODS: Preclinical testing and molecular analyses of combined inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and RAC1 were performed in established, primary cultured and stem-like glioblastoma cell systems. RESULTS: We found that the combined inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and RAC1 resulted in synergistic pro-apoptotic and anti-migratory effects in a broad range of different glioblastoma cells. At the molecular level, we found that RAC1 inhibition led to a decreased expression of the deubiquitinase Usp9X, followed by a decreased stability of Mcl-1.

This analysis was conducted by pooling data from 2 studies of single-agent InO in patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 3 studies of single-agent InO, 5 studies of InO plus rituximab (R-InO), and 1 study of R-InO plus chemotherapy in patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Pharmacokinetic data included 8361 InO concentration-time observations that were modeled using nonlinear mixed-effects analysis. Covariate relations were identified using generalized additive modeling on base model parameters and then tested in a stepwise manner via covariate modeling. InO concentration was described with a 2-compartment model with linear and time-dependent clearance components. Based on the final model, baseline body surface area was a covariate of the linear and time-dependent clearance components and volume of distribution in the central compartment; baseline percentage of blasts in the peripheral blood was a covariate of the decay coefficient of the time-dependent clearance term (CLt); and concomitant rituximab treatment was a covariate of the linear clearance component (CL1). The magnitude of change of each pharmacokinetic parameter due to these covariates was not considered clinically relevant. Therefore, no dose adjustment of InO for the treatment of patients with R/R B-cell ALL or NHL is needed on the basis of selected covariates.",,"['Garrett, May', 'Ruiz-Garcia, Ana', 'Parivar, Kourosh', 'Hee, Brian', 'Boni, Joseph']","['Garrett M', 'Ruiz-Garcia A', 'Parivar K', 'Hee B', 'Boni J']","['Pfizer Oncology, 10646 Science Center Dr, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA. may.haughey@pfizer.com.', 'Pfizer Oncology, 10646 Science Center Dr, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Pfizer Oncology, 10646 Science Center Dr, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Pfizer Oncology, 10646 Science Center Dr, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Pfizer Oncology, Collegeville, PA, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190311,United States,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn,Journal of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics,101096520,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*Inotuzumab ozogamicin', '*Population pharmacokinetics', '*Time-dependent clearance']",2019/03/13 06:00,2020/05/10 06:00,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2017/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10928-018-9614-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10928-018-9614-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn. 2019 Jun;46(3):211-222. doi: 10.1007/s10928-018-9614-9.

It affects bone metabolism by modulating both osteoclast and osteoblast functions. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of short-term use of G-CSF on bone metabolism in children with leukemia and solid tumors. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with a malignancy who received G-CSF therapy according to chemotherapy protocols and another 20 growth factor-free cancer patients who were enrolled as controls were included in the study. The serum osteocalcin and urinary free deoxypyridinoline levels were measured before the start of G-CSF therapy, on day 3 after treatment, and 7 days after G-CSF therapy was discontinued. In the control group, the measurements were made during corticosteroid and methotrexate-free chemotherapy. RESULTS: The mean osteocalcin level (8.6+/-2.3 ng/mL) from before the onset of treatment decreased significantly (7.7+/-2.3 ng/mL) on day 3 of G-CSF therapy and significantly increased after 7 days of G-CSF therapy (7.9+/-2.2 ng/mL) (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), which was still significantly lower than the pre-G-CSF values (p<0.001). The urinary free deoxypyridinoline level significantly increased on day 3 of G-CSF treatment (25.6+/-6.5 nmol/mmol Cr) and significantly decreased after 7 days of G-CSF therapy (22.6+/-6.4 nmol/mmol Cr) (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively), which was still significantly higher than the values recorded before G-CSF therapy (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The findings show that the short-term use of G-CSF in children with cancer can affect bone metabolism and can play a role in metabolic changes. Decreased osteoblastic activity and increased osteoclastic activity suggest that osteoporosis may be associated with bone pain in these patients.",,"['Turhan, Ayse Bozkurt', 'Binay, Cigdem', 'Bor, Ozcan', 'Simsek, Enver']","['Turhan AB', 'Binay C', 'Bor O', 'Simsek E']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Goztepe Training and Research Hospital of Istanbul Medeniyet University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Eskisehir, Turkey.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181203,Turkey,North Clin Istanb,Northern clinics of Istanbul,101684520,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bone', 'cancer', 'granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', 'hematopoietic growth factor']",2019/03/13 06:00,2019/03/13 06:01,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2017/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2017/12/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.14744/nci.2017.59320 [doi]', 'NCI-5-277 [pii]']",epublish,North Clin Istanb. 2018 Dec 3;5(4):277-281. doi: 10.14744/nci.2017.59320. eCollection 2018.,PMC6371986,"['Conflict of Interest: The authors declare that they have not received any', 'financial or any other support that might lead to any conflict of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here report a case of unilateral serous retinal detachment with choroidal thickening before the detection of atypical lymphocytes or myeloblasts as the initial manifestation of subsequently diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. Observations: A 43-year-old woman presented with serous retinal detachment in her left eye. Choroidal thickening was also revealed by B-scan ultrasonography and optical coherence tomography. Atypical lymphocytes or myeloblasts were not apparent on hematologic analysis at initial presentation, but an increased leukocyte count and the presence of 40% blasts in a peripheral smear were detected 1 month later. A bone marrow biopsy led to a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia. The retinal detachment and choroidal thickening showed amelioration 4 days after the onset of chemotherapy and had resolved 2 months later.

About one-third of adult patients outlive their leukemia, with the remainder unable to attain complete remission status following the first phase of treatment due to refractory bone marrow or blood residual microscopic disease. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program conducted 49 phase 1-1b trials in adult patients with leukemia between 1986 and 2017 in an effort to discover tolerated and effective therapeutic drug combinations intended to improve remission and mortality rates.

The treating physician has now the opportunity to decide i) which patient can be still offered chemoimmunotherapy as salvage treatment, ii) which patient at relapse is a candidate to receiving, continuous treatment with ibrutinib, idelalisib and rituximab or venetoclax and iii) which patient may benefit from a fixed-duration treatment using the BCL2 antagonist venetoclax in association with rituximab. Ibrutinib is the most actively investigated drug in R/R CLL and data at a 7-year follow-up were reported, showing durable efficacy and favorable efficacy profile. The patients with cardiac disease, hypertension, and anticoagulant therapy are not ideal candidates for continuous therapy with this agent. Idelalisib and rituximab were tested in patients with unfavorable characteristics including cytopenias. The short follow-up and treatment-emergent adverse events limit its role to patients unlikely to get a benefit with other agents.

Material and methods: We retrospectively analyzed immunophenotypic data along with cytogenetics/molecular genetics data (wherever available) from 631 consecutive cases of AL diagnosed at our flow cytometry laboratory from January 2014 to August 2017. Results: Of the total 631 cases, 52.9% (n=334) were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 43.9% (n=277) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 2.2% (n=14) mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL), 0.5% (n=3) acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) and 0.5% (n=3) chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis (CML-BC).

The choice of the anthracycline employed has been widely studied in multiple clinical trials showing similar complete remission rates. Materials and Methods: Using an ex vivo test we have analyzed if a subset of AML patients may respond differently to cytarabine combined with idarubicin, daunorubicin or mitoxantrone. Bone marrow (BM) samples of 198 AML patients were incubated for 48 hours in 96 well plates, each well containing different drugs or drug combinations at different concentrations. Ex vivo drug sensitivity analysis was made using the PharmaFlow platform maintaining the BM microenvironment. Drug response was evaluated as depletion of AML blast cells in each well after incubation. Annexin V-FITC was used to quantify the ability of the drugs to induce apoptosis, and pharmacological responses were calculated using pharmacokinetic population models. Results: Similar dose-respond graphs were generated for the three anthracyclines, with a slight decrease in EC50 with idarubicin (p=1.462E-06), whereas the interpatient variability of either drug was large. To identify those cases of selective sensitivity to anthracyclines, potency was compared, in terms of area under the curve. Differences in anthracycline monotherapy potency greater than 30% from 3 pairwise comparisons were identified in 28.3% of samples. Furthermore, different sensitivity was detected in 8.2% of patients comparing combinations of cytarabine and anthracyclines.

This was a Phase I/II study evaluating safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of orally administered enasidenib in subjects with advanced hematologic malignancies with an IDH2 mutation. Methods: Blood samples for PK and PD assessment were collected. A semi-mechanistic nonlinear mixed effect PK/PD model was successfully developed to characterize enasidenib plasma PK and to assess enasidenib-induced CYP3A activity. Results: The PK model showed that enasidenib plasma concentrations were adequately described by a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination; the PD model showed a high capacity to induce CYP3A (Emax=7.36) and a high enasidenib plasma concentration to produce half of maximum CYP3A induction (EC50 =31,400 ng/mL). Monte Carlo simulations based on the final PK/PD model showed that at 100 mg once daily dose there was significant drug accumulation and a maximum of three-fold CYP3A induction after multiple doses. Although the EC50 value for CYP3A induction by enasidenib is high, CYP3A induction was observed due to significant drug accumulation.

ARID1A is a core component of the mammalian SWI/SNF complex, which is one of the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes. To uncover the role of ARID1A in hematopoietic development, we utilized hematopoietic cell-specific deletion of Arid1a in mice. We demonstrate that ARID1A is essential for maintaining the frequency and function of hematopoietic stem cells and its loss impairs the differentiation of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. ARID1A deficiency led to a global reduction in open chromatin and ensuing transcriptional changes affected key genes involved in hematopoietic development. We also observed that silencing of ARID1A affected ATRA-induced differentiation of NB4 cells, suggesting its role in granulocytic differentiation of human leukemic cells. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive elucidation of the function of ARID1A in hematopoiesis and highlights the central role of ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF complex in maintaining chromatin dynamics in hematopoietic cells.",,"['Han, Lin', 'Madan, Vikas', 'Mayakonda, Anand', 'Dakle, Pushkar', 'Woon, Teoh Weoi', 'Shyamsunder, Pavithra', 'Nordin, Hazimah Binte Mohd', 'Cao, Zeya', 'Sundaresan, Janani', 'Lei, Ienglam', 'Wang, Zhong', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Han L', 'Madan V', 'Mayakonda A', 'Dakle P', 'Woon TW', 'Shyamsunder P', 'Nordin HBM', 'Cao Z', 'Sundaresan J', 'Lei I', 'Wang Z', 'Koeffler HP']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore. csivm@nus.edu.sg.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Department of Cardiac Surgery, Cardiovascular Research Center, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore (NCIS), National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7876-624X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190311,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Arid1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",,,2019/03/13 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2018/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0438-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0438-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Sep;33(9):2291-2305. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0438-4.

This uncertainty results largely from methodological differences relating to the use of real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) to measure BCR-ABL1 transcript levels for MRD analysis. We here describe the first results by the EURO-MRD consortium on standardization of qRT-PCR for the e1a2 BCR-ABL1 transcript in Ph + ALL, designed to overcome the lack of standardisation of laboratory procedures and data interpretation. Standardised use of EAC primer/probe sets and of centrally prepared plasmid standards had the greatest impact on reducing interlaboratory variability. In QC1 the proportion of analyses with BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios within half a log difference were 40/67 (60%) and 52/67 (78%) at 10(-3) and 36/67 (53%) and 53/67 (79%) at 10(-4)BCR-ABL1/ABL1. Standardized RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and cycler platforms did not improve results further, whereas stringent application of technical criteria for assay quality and uniform criteria for data interpretation and reporting were essential.

At least one subsequent treatment regimen was employed after T0 in 249 (90%) patients. Overall response rate to first regimen after T0 was 31% with median progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of 3.4 and 9.3 months, respectively. PFS was best achieved with combinations of carfilzomib and alkylator (median 5.7 months), and daratumumab and IMiD (median 4.5 months).

Elucidation of the expression and function of deregulated genes in LSCs is critical to specifically target LSCs and may consequently lead to improving outcomes of AML patients. Here, we correlated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) expression profiles obtained from two RNA-seq datasets of 375 younger (aged <60 years) 76 older (>/=60 years) adults with cytogenetically normal AML with a 'core enriched' (CE) gene expression signature (GES) associated with LSCs. We identified a LSC-specific signature of 111 lncRNAs that correlated strongly with the CE-GES. Among the top upregulated LSC-associated lncRNAs, we identified the lncRNA DANCR.

Furthermore, we showed that targeting Dancr in vivo using a primary murine model of AML (expressing both Mll partial tandem duplication/Flt3 internal tandem duplication) prolonged the survival of mice after serial transplantation.

MIM has been implicated in various cancers, however, its modes of action remain largely enigmatic. Here, we performed an extensive in silico characterisation of MIM to gain better understanding of its function. We detected previously unappreciated functional motifs including adaptor protein (AP) complex interaction site and a C-helix, pointing to a role in endocytosis and regulation of actin dynamics, respectively. We also identified new functional regions, characterised with phosphorylation sites or distinct hydrophilic properties. Strong negative selection during evolution, yielding high conservation of MIM, has been combined with positive selection at key sites. Interestingly, our analysis of intra-molecular co-evolution revealed potential regulatory hotspots that coincided with reduced potentially pathogenic polymorphisms. We explored databases for the mutations and expression levels of MIM in cancer. Experimentally, we focused on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), where MIM showed high overall expression, however, downregulation on poor prognosis samples. Finally, we propose strong conservation of MTSS1 also on the transcriptional level and predict novel transcriptional regulators.

Mutations in DNA repair genes disrupt the maintenance of DNA integrity and predispose to hereditary cancer syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To clinically characterise and genetically diagnose two reportedly unrelated patients with unique cancer syndromes, including multiorgan tumourogenesis (patient 1) and early-onset acute myeloid leukaemia (patient 2), both displaying unique peripheral blood karyotypes. METHODS: Genetic analysis in patient 1 included TruSight One panel and whole-exome sequencing, while patient 2 was diagnosed by FoundationOne Heme genomic analysis; Sanger sequencing was used for mutation confirmation in both patients. Karyotype analysis was performed on peripheral blood, bone marrow and other available tissues. RESULTS: Both patients were found homozygous for CHEK2 c.499G>A; p.Gly167Arg and exhibited multiple different chromosomal translocations in 30%-60% peripheral blood lymphocytes. This karyotype phenotype was not observed in other tested tissues or in an ovarian cancer patient with a different homozygous missense mutation in CHEK2 (c.1283C>T; p.Ser428Phe). CONCLUSIONS: The multiple chromosomal translocations in patient lymphocytes highlight the role of CHK2 in DNA repair. We suggest that homozygosity for p.Gly167Arg increases patients' susceptibility to non-accurate correction of DNA breaks and possibly explains their increased susceptibility to either multiple primary tumours during their lifetime or early-onset tumourigenesis.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

We have previously shown that adoptive transfer of double negative T (DNT) cells expanded from healthy donors can target leukemia but their role in treating established lung cancer is not clear. Here we explore the role of human DNT cells in targeting late-stage established lung cancer either alone or in combination with Nivolumab (anti-PD-1 antibody) and describe underlying mechanisms. METHODS: DNT cells from resected lung cancer tissue of patients were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their infiltration and PD-1 expression. Expansion capacity and anti-tumor function of lung cancer patient and healthy donor DNT cells were compared. Late-stage lung cancer xenograft models were developed to determine the anti-tumor effect of DNT cells alone or in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody, and the level of tumor-infiltrating DNT cells was quantified by histology and characterized by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Patient-derived tumor infiltrating lymphocytes contained a lower frequency of DNT cells with a higher expression of PD-1 relative to normal lung tissue. Ex vivo expanded patient- and healthy donor-derived DNT cells showed similar levels of cytotoxicity against lung cancer cells in vitro. Healthy donor-derived DNT cells significantly inhibited the growth of late-stage lung cancer xenografts, which was further augmented by anti-PD-1 through increased DNT cell tumor infiltration.

Although rarely pathogenic in an immunocompetent host, it can cause severe opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals. CASE PRESENTATION: A 67-year-old white woman had a routine blood analysis before undergoing knee surgery. The results showed leukopenia for which bone marrow examination was performed, showing an underlying acute myeloid leukemia. During the neutropenic phase after a second induction with cytarabine/idarubicin, she developed fever, headaches, and photophobia. Cultures of cerebrospinal fluid were positive for Rothia mucilaginosa. Despite full therapy with antibiotics, neurosurgical interventions, and intensive care support, our patient died due to refractory intracranial hypertension and transtentorial herniation. CONCLUSIONS: Meningitis due to Rothia mucilaginosa is a rare but potentially lethal infection in patients with neutropenia, and evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of this disease are lacking. We suggest an empirical therapy with amoxicillin/rifampicin until adjustments can be made based on an antibiogram.

These NKG2C-expressing NK cells demonstrate enhanced CD16-dependent cytokine production and downregulate FcepsilonRIgamma and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). Lacking NKG2C diminishes resistance to HIV infection, but whether this affects NK cell acquisition of superior antibody-dependent function is unclear. Therefore, our objective was to investigate whether HCMV-driven NK cell differentiation is impaired in NKG2C(null) HIV-infected individuals. Phenotypic (CD2, CD16, CD57, NKG2A, FcepsilonRIgamma, and PLZF expression) and functional (cytokine induction and cytotoxicity) properties were compared between HIV(-)infected NKG2C(null) and NKG2C-expressing groups. Cytokine production was compared following stimulation through natural cytotoxicity receptors or through CD16. Cytotoxicity was measured by anti-CD16-redirected lysis and by classical antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against anti-class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody-coated cells. Our data indicate highly similar HCMV-driven NK cell differentiation in HIV infection with or without NKG2C. While the fraction of mature (CD57(pos)) NK cells expressing CD2 (p = 0.009) or co-expressing CD2 and CD16 (p = 0.03) was significantly higher in NKG2C(null) HIV-infected individuals, there were no significant differences in NKG2A, FcepsilonRIgamma, or PLZF expression. The general phenotypic and functional equivalency observed suggests NKG2C-independent routes of HCMV-driven NK cell differentiation, which may involve increased CD2 expression.",,"['Comeau, Emilie M', 'Holder, Kayla A', 'Fudge, Neva J', 'Grant, Michael D']","['Comeau EM', 'Holder KA', 'Fudge NJ', 'Grant MD']","[""Immunology and Infectious Diseases Program, Division of BioMedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, 300 Prince Philp Drive, St. John's, NL A1B 3V6, Canada. emc878@mun.ca.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190309,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FCGR3B protein, human)', '0 (FcepsilonRI gamma-chain, human)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (KLRC2 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Coinfection/immunology/virology', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus/*pathogenicity', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology', 'Female', 'GPI-Linked Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C/*genetics/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ADCC', '*CD16', '*CD2', '*FcepsilonRIgamma', '*HCMV', '*HIV', '*NKG2A', '*NKG2C', '*NKG2Cnull', '*PLZF']",2019/03/13 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2019/03/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]']","['v11030239 [pii]', '10.3390/v11030239 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2019 Mar 9;11(3). pii: v11030239. doi: 10.3390/v11030239.,PMC6466323,,['PJT 361426/CIHR/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tested monocationic bichalcophenes displayed promising potent anticancer activity against most cancer cell lines with GI50 values of 1.34-3.09muM. The most potent compound was derivative 8 (median GI50 and TGI values of 1.34 and 3.23muM, respectively), being also the least cytotoxic in this bichalcophene series with an LC50 of 77.6muM. The most responsive cancer cell lines were leukemia (SR and K-562) and colon (HCT-15 and HT29) with GI50 in the sub-micromolar range. The effect of the tested bichalcophenes on normal human lung fibroblast (WI-38) cell line showed that they exerted their antiproliferative activity outside the realms of causing any toxicity in normal cells. To study apoptotic profiles of representatives of this class, compounds 4h, 4i, and 8 were found to cause significant reductions in cdk1 expression in HCT-116 colon cells by 46, 79, and 84%, respectively versus 52% reduction by 5- Flourouracil (5-FU). These three compounds were also unique being the only derivatives that significantly elevated the expression of p53 by approximately 2, 4, and 5 folds, respectively. The tested bichalcophenes exhibited moderate to potent antioxidant activity in DPPH and ABTS as well as hydroxyl radical scavenging assays. Moreover, compounds IIIb, IIIc, 4c, and 4i, showed the highest pro-oxidant activity.

Synthesis of three cyst wall proteins (CWPs) is the fundamental feature of this differentiation. Myeloid leukemia factor (MLF) proteins are involved in cell differentiation, and tumorigenesis in mammals, but little is known about its role in protozoan parasites. We developed a CRISPR/Cas9 system to understand the role of MLF in Giardia. Due to the tetraploid genome in two nuclei of Giardia, it could be hard to disrupt a gene completely in Giardia. We only generated knockdown but not knockout mutants. We found that knockdown of the mlf gene resulted in a significant decrease of cwp gene expression and cyst formation, suggesting a positive role of MLF in encystation. We further used mlf as a model gene to improve the system. The addition of an inhibitor for NHEJ, Scr7, or combining all cassettes for gRNA and Cas9 expression into one plasmid resulted in improved gene disruption efficiencies and a significant decrease in cwp gene expression. Our results provide insights into a positive role of MLF in inducing Giardia differentiation and a useful tool for studies in Giardia.",,"['Lin, Zi-Qi', 'Gan, Soo-Wah', 'Tung, Szu-Yu', 'Ho, Chun-Che', 'Su, Li-Hsin', 'Sun, Chin-Hung']","['Lin ZQ', 'Gan SW', 'Tung SY', 'Ho CC', 'Su LH', 'Sun CH']","['Department of Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Parasitology, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8420-0303', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8604-8085']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190311,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (Protozoan Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Giardia lamblia/cytology/*genetics', 'Giardiasis/parasitology', 'Humans', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protozoan Proteins/*genetics']",,,2019/03/12 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/03/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0213594 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-24175 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 11;14(3):e0213594. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0213594. eCollection 2019.,PMC6411161,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like mammals, D. rerio possess an adaptive immune system that includes B and T lymphocytes. Studies of zebrafish lymphopoiesis are difficult because antibodies recognizing D. rerio cell surface markers are generally not available, complicating isolation and characterization of different lymphocyte populations, including B-lineage cells. Transgenic lines with lineage-specific fluorophore expression are often used to circumvent this challenge. The transgenic lck:eGFP line has been used to study D. rerio T cell development, and has also been utilized to model T cell development and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although lck:eGFP fish have been widely used to analyze the T-lineage, they have not been used to study B cells. Recently, we discovered that many zebrafish B cells also express lck, albeit at lower levels. Consequently, lck:eGFP B cells likewise express low levels of GFP. Based on this finding, we developed a protocol to purify B-lineage cells from lck:eGFP zebrafish, which we report here. Our method describes how to utilize a fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) to purify B cells from lck:eGFP fish or related lines, such as double-transgenic rag2:hMYC; lck:eGFP fish. In these lines, B cells, particularly immature B cells, express GFP at low but detectable levels, allowing them to be distinguished from T cells, which express GFP highly. B cells can be isolated from marrow, thymus, spleen, blood, or other tissues. This protocol provides a new method to purify D. rerio B cells, enabling studies focused on topics like B cell development and B lymphocyte malignancies.",,"['Burroughs-Garcia, Jessica', 'Hasan, Ameera', 'Park, Gilseung', 'Borga, Chiara', 'Frazer, J Kimble']","['Burroughs-Garcia J', 'Hasan A', 'Park G', 'Borga C', 'Frazer JK']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.', 'Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center; Kimble-Frazer@ouhsc.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20190222,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (enhanced green fluorescent protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Zebrafish/genetics/*immunology']",,,2019/03/12 06:00,2020/01/24 06:00,['2019/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/59191 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Feb 22;(144). doi: 10.3791/59191.,,,['P20 GM103447/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importin-9 wraps around the core, globular region of H2A-H2B to form an extensive interface. The nature of this interface coupled with quantitative analysis of deletion mutants of H2A-H2B suggests that the NLS-like sequences in the H2A-H2B tails play a minor role in import. Importin-9*H2A-H2B is reminiscent of interactions between histones and histone chaperones in that it precludes H2A-H2B interactions with DNA and H3-H4 as seen in the nucleosome. Like many histone chaperones, which prevent inappropriate non-nucleosomal interactions, Importin-9 also sequesters H2A-H2B from DNA. Importin-9 appears to act as a storage chaperone for H2A-H2B while escorting it to the nucleus.

Although targeted therapy using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is highly effective at inducing remission, most patients require life-long TKI to decrease the risk of relapse. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to finding ways to eliminate CML stem cells (LSCs); the source of disease persistence. Areas covered: In this review, the authors present recent immunologic findings pertinent to CML, vaccinations targeting leukemia antigens, interferon combination therapies, and other emerging strategies aimed at increasing immunogenicity and improving outcomes in patients with CML. Recent publications and abstracts found in Pubmed and hematology/oncology meetings related to these topics were identified and incorporated into this review. Expert commentary: Further understanding of the immune system and antigenic composition of LSCs has allowed for novel therapeutic development. Immunotherapies are effective at the malignant stem cell level and combining these approaches with TKI is a promising option. Despite ongoing challenges, it is increasingly recognized that a cure may be achievable through immunotherapies.",,"['Chan, Onyee', 'Talati, Chetasi', 'Sweet, Kendra', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Chan O', 'Talati C', 'Sweet K', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['a Moffitt Cancer Center , University of South Florida , Tampa , FL , USA.', 'b Division of Malignant Hematology , Moffitt Cancer Center , Tampa , FL , USA.', 'b Division of Malignant Hematology , Moffitt Cancer Center , Tampa , FL , USA.', 'b Division of Malignant Hematology , Moffitt Cancer Center , Tampa , FL , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190311,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*immunogenicity', '*interferon with TKI', '*leukemia-associated antigens', '*tumor antigen-specific immunotherapy', '*vaccines']",2019/03/12 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/03/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1588105 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Apr;12(4):225-233. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1588105.

In Germany, approximately 1000 men and 850 women die of CLL each year. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective literature search in PubMed and on the authors' scientific and clinical experience. RESULTS: The diagnosis of CLL requires the detection of at least 5000 B-lymphocytes per microliter in the peripheral blood. Courses of CLL may be indolent and require no treatment, but may also be aggressive and progress rapidly. Treatment should be initiated when there is marked evidence of bone-marrow suppression or disease- related symptoms such as B symptoms or fatigue. In the past ten years, a number of targeted drugs have been introduced that can achieve a very good, long-lasting response, particularly when used in combination. The combination of chemotherapy with anti-CD20 antibodies (chemoimmunotherapy) is the standard first-line treat- ment. In younger patients without any relevant accompanying illnesses, the combi- nation of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab prolongs survival. Patients with comorbidities should be treated with a combination of chlorambucil and obinutuzumab. In the last few years, ibrutinib, idelalsib, and venetoclax have been approved for clinical use. These substances inhibit cellular signal transduction pathways and are being increasingly used. CONCLUSION: Recent progress in the development of novel treatment options gives hope that CLL may soon be a controllable disease. Even at present, chemoimmuno- therapy can achieve a progression-free survival of more than eight years in certain genetically defined subgroups of CLL patients.",,"['Tresckow, Julia von', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Tresckow JV', 'Eichhorst B', 'Bahlo J', 'Hallek M']","['Department of Internal Medicine I - Oncology, Hematology, Clinical Infectiology, Clinical Immunology, Hemostaseology, Internal Intensive Care; University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Arztebl Int,Deutsches Arzteblatt international,101475967,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy']",,,2019/03/12 06:00,2019/11/07 06:00,['2019/03/12 06:00'],"['2017/09/28 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/07 06:00 [medline]']","['arztebl.2019.0041 [pii]', '10.3238/arztebl.2019.0041 [doi]']",ppublish,Dtsch Arztebl Int. 2019 Jan 25;116(4):41-46. doi: 10.3238/arztebl.2019.0041.,PMC6415618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, the first-line of treatment involves Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs), which specifically inhibits the activity of the fusion protein BCR-ABL. However, resistance, mainly due to mutations, can occur. In the attempt to find more effective and less toxic therapies, several approaches are taken into consideration such as research of new anti-leukemic drugs and ""combination chemotherapy"" where different drugs that act by different mechanisms are used. Here, we reviewed the molecular mechanisms of CML, the main mechanisms of drug resistance and current strategies to enhance the therapeutic effect of TKIs in CML. Despite major advances in CML treatment, new, more potent anticancer drugs and with fewer side effects are needed. Marine organisms, and particularly seaweed, have a high diversity of bioactive compounds with some of them having anticancer activity in several in vitro and in vivo models. The state-of-art suggests that their use during cancer treatment may improve the outcome. We reviewed here the yet few data supporting anti-leukemic activity of some carotenoids and phlorotannins in some leukemia models. Also, strategies to overcome drug resistance are discussed, particularly the combination of conventional drugs with natural compounds.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Almeida, Tania P', 'Ramos, Alice A', 'Ferreira, Joana', 'Azqueta, Amaya', 'Rocha, Eduardo']","['Almeida TP', 'Ramos AA', 'Ferreira J', 'Azqueta A', 'Rocha E']","['Team of Histomorphology, Physiopathology and Applied Toxicology, CIIMAR/CIMAR - Interdisciplinary Center for Marine and Environmental Research, U.Porto - University of Porto, Avenida General Norton de Matos s/n, 4450-208 Matosinhos, Portugal.', 'Laboratory of Histology and Embryology, Department of Microscopy, ICBAS - Institute of Biomedical Sciences Abel Salazar, U.Porto - University of Porto, Rua de Jorge Viterbo Ferreira, no 228, 4050-313 Porto, Portugal.', 'FCUP - Faculty of Sciences, U.

The main purpose of this paper is to establish an overview of indoor VOCs regarding their impacts on human health. Herein, 13 VOCs were designated as indoor air pollutants (IAPs) in the IAQ standards and guidelines. They were further grouped into four types: nonchlorinated aromatic compounds, chlorinated aromatic compounds, chlorinated aliphatic compounds and aldehydes. For this purpose, the present study discusses the criteria for designating VOCs, and summarizes their main sources in indoor environments. Because the occupational exposure limit (OEL) in workplaces has often used as a preliminary basis for establishing acceptable health-based IAQ guidelines in buildings and residences, this paper thus reviews the OEL values, especially in the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)-threshold limit value (TLV).

The 3-year overall survival (OS) rate of patients with an early disease status was 45.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37.0 to 54.2%). A multivariate analysis revealed five adverse factors for OS: performance status (PS) 2-4 (hazard ratio [HR] 4.48; P < .001), poor cytogenetic risk group (HR 1.83; P = .041), male recipient (HR 2.58; P = .003), use of HLA-mismatched related grafts (HR 4.75; P = .003), and unrelated cord blood (HR 2.47; P = .023). The 3-year OS rate of patients with an advanced disease status was 37.2% (95% CI 32.4 to 41.9%). Five factors correlated with worse OS: PS 2-4 (HR 1.72; P = .003), poor cytogenetic risk group (HR 1.49; P = .003), use of HLA-mismatched related grafts (HR 1.96; P = .015), unrelated cord blood (HR 2.05; P < .001), and the high number of red blood cell transfusions before transplantation (HR 1.85; P = .018).

METHODS: Bone marrow samples from patients with known MDS were analyzed by 10-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping and compared with normal bone marrow samples. RESULTS: There was loss of blast heterogeneity in patients with MDS compared with normal bone marrow samples, based on the relative size of the dominant blast population (83.0% vs 64.8%) and fewer hematogones (0.08% vs 1.39%). The size of the largest blast population divided by the fraction of hematogones (blast dominance-hematogone [BDH] index) was significantly larger in MDS compared with normal cases (27,084 vs 190, P < .0001; receiver operating characteristic area under the curve = 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: The BDH index is more sensitive and specific than loss of blast heterogeneity or decrease in hematogones for detecting MDS in bone marrow samples and may be useful in clinical practice.","['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

Despite detailed knowledge of molecular actin assembly, the exact processes governing actin organization during activation remain elusive. Using advanced microscopy, we here show that Rat Basophilic Leukemia (RBL) cells, a model mast cell line, employ an orchestrated series of reorganization events within the cortical actin network during activation. In response to IgE antigen-stimulation of FCepsilon receptors (FCepsilonR) at the RBL cell surface, we observed symmetry breaking of the F-actin network and subsequent rapid disassembly of the actin cortex. This was followed by a reassembly process that may be driven by the coordinated transformation of distinct nanoscale F-actin architectures, reminiscent of self-organizing actin patterns. Actin patterns co-localized with zones of Arp2/3 nucleation, while network reassembly was accompanied by myosin-II activity. Strikingly, cortical actin disassembly coincided with zones of granule secretion, suggesting that cytoskeletal actin patterns contribute to orchestrate RBL cell activation.",,"['Colin-York, Huw', 'Li, Dong', 'Korobchevskaya, Kseniya', 'Chang, Veronica T', 'Betzig, Eric', 'Eggeling, Christian', 'Fritzsche, Marco']","['Colin-York H', 'Li D', 'Korobchevskaya K', 'Chang VT', 'Betzig E', 'Eggeling C', 'Fritzsche M']","['MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Headley Way, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus, 19700 Helix Drive, Ashburn, VA, 20147, USA.', 'National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China.', 'Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology, University of Oxford, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.', 'MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 0QH, UK.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Janelia Research Campus, 19700 Helix Drive, Ashburn, VA, 20147, USA.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Headley Way, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', 'MRC Human Immunology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Headley Way, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK. marco.fritzsche@rdm.ox.ac.uk.', 'Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology, University of Oxford, Roosevelt Drive, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK. marco.fritzsche@rdm.ox.ac.uk.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190307,England,Commun Biol,Communications biology,101719179,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Myosin Type II)']",,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/*metabolism', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Myosin Type II/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism']",,,2019/03/12 06:00,2019/03/12 06:01,['2019/03/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s42003-019-0322-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s42003-019-0322-9 [pii]']",epublish,Commun Biol. 2019 Mar 7;2:93. doi: 10.1038/s42003-019-0322-9. eCollection 2019.,PMC6405992,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],"['212343/Z/18/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '104924/14/Z/14/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '100262/Z/12/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_16082/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/K01577X/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'MC_UP_1201/15/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_15060/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_00008/9/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies indicate that HTLV-1 is arguably one of the most carcinogenic agents to humans. In addition, HTLV-1 causes a diverse array of diseases, including myelopathy and immunodeficiency, which cause morbidity and mortality to many people in the world, including the indigenous population in Australia, a fact that was emphasized only recently. HTLV-1 can be transmitted by infected lymphocytes, from mother to child via breast feeding, by sex, by blood transfusion, and by organ transplant. Therefore, the prevention of HTLV-1 infection is possible but such action has been taken in only a limited part of the world. However, until now it has not been listed by the World Health Organization as a sexually transmitted organism nor, oddly, recognized as an oncogenic virus by the recent list of the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health. Such underestimation of HTLV-1 by health agencies has led to a remarkable lack of funding supporting research and development of treatments and vaccines, causing HTLV-1 to remain a global threat. Nonetheless, there are emerging novel therapeutic and prevention strategies which will help people who have diseases caused by HTLV-1. In this review, we present a brief historic overview of the key events in HTLV-1 research, including its pivotal role in generating ideas of a retrovirus cause of AIDS and in several essential technologies applicable to the discovery of HIV and the unraveling of its genes and their function. This is followed by the status of HTLV-1 research and the preventive and therapeutic developments of today.

Oral ponatinib (Iclusig((R))) is a third-generation TKI structurally designed to inhibit native BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase and several BCR-ABL1 mutants, including T315I. Ponatinib is now approved for patients with CML who are resistant or intolerant to prior TKI therapy (European Union) or for whom no other TKI therapy is indicated (United States). Despite achieving results in heavily treated patients, which led to its approval, the drug may induce cardiovascular events, requiring a careful baseline assessment of predisposing risk factors and specific management during treatment. Pharmacokinetic analysis has indicated the possibility of reducing the starting dose of ponatinib to 15 mg/day and preliminary data showed advantages in terms of safety while maintained its efficacy. This review summarizes the results achieved and drug-related side effects reported in all clinical trials and real-life experiences, testing ponatinib in patients with CP-CML.

Here, we have synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from organic resource and confirmed their anti-cancer and anti-microbial potentials. Microwave irradiation method was employed to synthesize AgNPs using Pandanus odorifer leaf extract. Anti-cancer potential of AgNPs was evaluated by scratch assay on the monolayer of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells, indicating that the synthesized AgNPs inhibit the migration of RBL cells. The synthesized AgNPs showed MIC value of 4-16 mug/mL against both Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacterial strains, exhibiting the anti-microbial potential. Biofilm inhibition was recorded at sub-MIC values against Gram +ve and Gram -ve bacterial strains. Violacein and alginate productions were reduced by 89.6 and 75.6%, respectively at 4 and 8 mug/mL of AgNPs, suggesting anti-quorum sensing activity. Exopolysaccharide production was decreased by 61-79 and 84% for Gram -ve and Gram +ve pathogens respectively. Flagellar driven swarming mobility was also reduced significantly. Furthermore, In vivo study confirmed their tolerability in mice, indicating their clinical perspective.

As a traditional medicinal plant, which was first found in <Ben- Cao-Gang- Mu>. In many traditional herbal books, there are records of ""Mu-Tou-Hui"" of treatment for uterine bleeding, cancer, swelling pain, leukemia, etc. However, there are few studies on the chemical constituents of Patrinia heterophylla Bunge. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the chemical constituents of P. heterophylla and the basis of their antitumor activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 compounds were isolated from roots and rhizomes of P. heterophylla by repeating various column chromatography techniques, whose structures were determined by organic spectrum analysis methods and compared with published data. The cytotoxicities were evaluated by MTT assay on six cancer cell lines: human melanoma cell (A375), human hepatocellular carcinoma cell (SMMC-7721), human gastric cancer cell (SGC-7901), human cervical cancer cell (HeLa), human colon cancer cell (HCT-116), and human breast cancer cell (MDA-MB-231). The apoptosis-inducing activities of compounds 1, 5, 12 and 15 in A375 tumor cell determined by flow cytometry. RESULT: Five phenylpropanoids, ethyl caffeate (1), coniferaldehyde (5), trans-p-coumaryl aldehyde (6), caffeic acid methyl ester (12), and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid (15), four acetophenones, 1-(2,4-dihydroxyphenyl) ethanone (2), 2',5'-Dihydroxyacetophenone (3), cynanchone A (8), and cynandione A (10), two phenols, vanillin (4) and catechol (9), two iridoids, sarracenin (7) and patriscabrol (11), one alkane, tetracosane (14), and one coumarin, scopoletin (13), were isolated from the EtOH extracts. Of them, compounds 1-10, 12 and 14-15 were isolated for the first time from the roots of P. heterophylla. Compounds 1 and 15 were reported for the first time with in vitro inhibitory activity against tumor cells. MTT assay showed that compounds 1, 5-9, 12-13 and 15 had selective cytotoxic activities (IC50 27.20-163.03muM) against tumor cells. Apoptosis detected by flow cytometry revealed that compounds 1, 5, 12 and 15 can induce apoptosis for A375 at low concentrations when the concentrations of compounds 1, 5, 12 and 15 are the value of 14, 40, 34, 108muM, the percentages of apoptotic cells were about 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Compounds 1-10, 12 and 14-15 were isolated for the first time from the P. heterophylla. This result enriches the previous studies on the chemical constituents of P. heterophylla. Compounds 1 and 15 were reported for the first time to have cytotoxic activities against tumor cells. Compounds 1, 5, 6, 7, 12, 15 showed cytotoxic activities against tumor cells. This result reveals that the active ingredient of P. heterophylla are composed of phenylpropanoids, iridoids and coumarins. This study provides some theoretical basis for the anti-tumor research of P. heterophylla.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

This study utilizes a computational approach to identify the deleterious SNPs which may affect the structure and function of BCL11A protein. The study also generated a 3D structure of native and mutants. The analysis identified two SNPs in BCL11A as highly deleterious: N391K and C414S which are expected to affect structure and stability of the protein. According to conservation analysis, both residues N391 and C414 were identified as highly conserved. Additionally, post-translational modification sites were predicted at both sites.

Lumbar puncture (LP) plays central role in the diagnosis and treatment process, but options for analgesia are limited. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a fixed N2O/O2 mixture to reduce pain in children with leukemia during LP as compared with placebo. METHODS: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, and randomized clinical trial involving children who needed LP for diagnosis or treatment was conducted in the pediatrics department of the General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to inhale either a fixed N2O/O2 mixture or O2. The primary endpoint was the maximal pain level felt by the patient during the procedure measured using a numerical rating scale (0-10). RESULTS: One-hundred fourteen consecutive patients were enrolled in this study and randomized. Pain scores during the procedure showed a significant decrease in N2O/O2 mixture-treated patients to 1.05 +/- 1.40 versus 8.00 +/- 2.13 in controls (P < 0.01). No serious adverse effects were attributed to N2O/O2 mixture inhalation. Analysis of the satisfaction of patients receiving N2O/O2 mixture indicated that medical staff were satisfied with this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that self-administered fixed N2O/O2 is efficient to reduce pain related to LP in children with leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

AML is routinely treated with chemotherapy, and so it is of great interest to develop optimal chemotherapy treatment strategies. In this work, we incorporate an immune response into a stem cell model of AML, since we find that previous models lacking an immune response are inappropriate for deriving optimal control strategies. Using optimal control theory, we produce continuous controls and bang-bang controls, corresponding to a range of objectives and parameter choices. Through example calculations, we provide a practical approach to applying optimal control using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. In particular, we describe and explore factors that have a profound influence on numerical convergence.

We compared the risk of CVD in ALL survivors to siblings, examined time trends, quantified treatment-related risks, and investigated whether risk extends beyond patients treated with anthracyclines and chest radiotherapy. METHODS: The Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study assessed CVD by patient questionnaire in 5-year ALL survivors diagnosed between 1976 and 2005 and their siblings. Participants were asked whether a physician had ever told them that they had hypertension, arrhythmia, heart failure, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, thrombosis or valvular problems. We investigated treatment-related risk factors for CVD using multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for demographic and socioeconomic factors, BMI, smoking, diabetes mellitus, alcohol consumption and physical activity. RESULTS: We contacted 707 survivors and 1299 siblings, 511 (72%) and 709 (55%) of whom responded, respectively. Survivors had a higher risk of developing CVD than siblings (odds ratio [OR] 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3&ndash;2.8), in particular heart failure (OR 13.9, 1.8&ndash;107.4). Compared to patients treated 1976&ndash;85, the risk of CVD was 1.4 (0.7&ndash;2.8) for those treated 1985&ndash;1994 and 1.5 (0.6&ndash;3.7) for those treated 1995&ndash;2005. The overall CVD risks after anthracycline treatment (OR 3.1, 2.0&ndash;4.7), haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (OR 8.0, 2.4&ndash;26.9) or relapse (OR 4.1, 1.9&ndash;8.8) were increased compared to those of siblings, while the CVD risks of survivors treated without anthracycline or chest radiotherapy were similar (OR 1.0; 0.5&ndash;2.0). CONCLUSIONS: Despite attempts to reduce cardiotoxicity in childhood cancer treatment, CVD risks in ALL survivors treated more recently do not seem to have declined.",,"['Hau, Eva M', 'Caccia, Julien N', 'Kasteler, Rahel', 'Spycher, Ben', 'Suter, Thomas', 'Ammann, Roland A', 'von der Weid, Nicolas X', 'Kuehni, Claudia E']","['Hau EM', 'Caccia JN', 'Kasteler R', 'Spycher B', 'Suter T', 'Ammann RA', 'von der Weid NX', 'Kuehni CE']","['Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Switzerland / Department of Paediatrics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Switzerland / Department of Paediatrics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Cardiology, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.', ""Department of Paediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Swiss Childhood Cancer Registry, Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern, Switzerland / Department of Paediatrics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Switzerland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190310,Switzerland,Swiss Med Wkly,Swiss medical weekly,100970884,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Switzerland']",,,2019/03/11 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/03/11 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.4414/smw.2019.20012 [doi]', 'Swiss Med Wkly. 2019;149:w20012 [pii]']",epublish,Swiss Med Wkly. 2019 Mar 10;149:w20012. doi: 10.4414/smw.2019.20012. eCollection 2019 Feb 25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that SLC40A1, the gene encoding the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN), is variably expressed among primary AMLs and that low levels are associated with good prognosis and improved outcomes. In particular, core binding factor (CBF) AMLs, which are associated with good outcomes with chemotherapy, consistently have low level of SLC40A1 expression. AML cell lines that expressed relatively low levels of FPN endogenously, or were engineered via gene knockdown, had an increased sensitivity to chemotherapy relative to controls expressing high levels of FPN. Primary FPN(low) AML bulk cells also had increased sensitivity to Ara-C treatment, iron treatment and the combination of Ara-C and iron relative to FPN(high) cells. FPN(low) leukemic stem cells (LSCs) had decreased viability following addition of iron alone and in combination with Ara-C treatment relative to FPN(high) LSCs.

METHODS: A multivariate patient similarity network and clustering was applied to assess the prognostic values of routine genetic, laboratory, and clinical factors and to identify subsets of ultra-HR-CLL patients. The study cohort consisted of 116 HR-CLL patients (F/M 36/80, median age 63 yrs) carrying del(11q), del(17p)/TP53 mutations and/or complex karyotype (CK) at the time of diagnosis. RESULTS: Three major subsets based on the presence of key prognostic variables as genetic aberrations, bulky lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and gender: profile (P)-I (n = 34, men/women with CK + no del(17p)/TP53 mutations), P-II (n = 47, predominantly men with del(11q) + no CK + no del(17p)/TP53 mutations), and P-III (n = 35, men/women with del(17p)/TP53 mutations, with/without del(11q) and CK) were revealed. Subanalysis of major subsets identified three ultra-HR-CLL groups: men with TP53 disruption with/without CK, women with TP53 disruption with CK and men/women with CK + del(11q) with poor short-term outcomes (25% deaths/12 mo). Besides confirming the combinations of known risk-factors, the used patient similarity network added further refinement of subsets of HR-CLL patients who may profit from different targeted drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed for the first time in hemato-oncology the usefulness of the multivariate patient similarity networks for stratification of HR-CLL patients. This approach shows the potential for clinical implementation of precision medicine, which is especially important in view of an armamentarium of novel targeted drugs.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The treatment of AML still faces challenges. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective targeted therapies. The receptor tyrosine kinase C-KIT confers critical proliferative signals to AML. Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is an endogenous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), which promotes the growth and transformation of various solid tumors. These actions make CIP2A a promising target for tumor treatment. Here, we reported the effects and underlying mechanisms of a natural compound, cucurbitacin B (CuB), on AML. We reported that CuB suppressed growth and induced apoptosis in AML cells. The inhibition of growth and activation of apoptosis were mediated through CuB-induced downregulation of the CIP2A/PP2A/C-KIT signal pathway. Furthermore, CuB inactivated the JAK2 and STAT3 molecules downstream of C-KIT via the downregulation of CIP2A.

Leukemic infiltration of the anterior segment can masquerade as intraocular inflammation; a high index of suspicion for this complication is essential. We describe a case of ocular relapse in a 2-year-old male on maintenance therapy for ALL. A systematic review of all known cases of similar leukemic infiltration of the anterior segment of the eye in ALL was performed. A total of 106 patients in 43 reports described leukemic infiltration of the eye as an initial presentation of ALL or relapse. Ocular relapse may be the first visible manifestation of systemic disease, with concurrent disease in the CNS, bone marrow, or testes. Prognosis for ALL patients with ocular relapse is poor, with death after initial presentation reported as early as 16 days. Patients with a history of ALL presenting with any sign of ocular inflammation should be assessed for relapse and leukemic infiltration. As soon as a diagnosis of relapse has been confirmed, appropriate leukemia therapy should be initiated.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Canadian Ophthalmological Society.

Recently, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) has been found to play roles in multiple types of cancer. However, the roles of LIFR in the progression of PCa remain to be revealed. In this study, we found that LIFR plays an oncogenic role in PCa. The phosphorylation of LIFR at S1044 contributes to subsequent activation of the AKT pathway, inducing the expression of a series of proliferation and metastatic genes. Additionally, LIFR-S1044 is phosphorylated by ERK2 but not ERK1. The signal intensity of pLIFR-S1044 and pAKT S473 in PCa tissue displays a tight positive correlation. The ERK2/LIFR/AKT axis modulates PCa progression and offers a promising therapeutic and diagnostic target for PCa.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Interleukin 7 (IL-7) and its receptor IL-7Ralpha promote T-ALL development and mutational activation of IL-7Ralpha associates with very high risk in relapsed disease. Using combinatorial phage-display libraries and antibody reformatting, we generated a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody (named B12) against both wild-type and mutant human IL-7Ralpha, predicted to form a stable complex with IL-7Ralpha at a different site from IL-7. B12 impairs IL-7/IL-7R-mediated signaling, sensitizes T-ALL cells to treatment with dexamethasone and can induce cell death per se. The antibody also promotes antibody-dependent natural killer-mediated leukemia cytotoxicity in vitro and delays T-cell leukemia development in vivo, reducing tumor burden and promoting mouse survival. B12 is rapidly internalized and traffics to the lysosome, rendering it an attractive vehicle for targeted intracellular delivery of cytotoxic cargo. Consequently, we engineered a B12-MMAE antibody-drug conjugate and provide proof-of-concept evidence that it has increased leukemia cell killing abilities as compared with the naked antibody.

Following intensive collaboration between cardiologists, haematologists and rheumatologists via daily email exchanges, a diagnosis was reached of autoinflammatory constrictive pericarditis with a non-infiltrative coexisting CMML. The key to achieving a rapid and sustained response was a trial of high-dose steroids followed by intravenous immunoglobulins. This achieved restoration of cardiac function, resolution of symptoms and near normalisation of inflammatory markers. A diagnosis of concurrent CMML was confirmed at 3 months.

Relapsed or refractory hematopoietic cancers are frequently resistant to conventional therapy, and novel highly active strategies are urgently needed. CXCR4-directed endoradiotherapy constitutes a highly promising targeted therapeutic concept. Here, we investigated the adverse effects of this novel treatment approach. Methods: Twenty-two patients with heavily pretreated lymphoproliferative or myeloid malignancies were treated with (177)Lu- or (90)Y-pentixather-a CXCR4-directed therapeutic radioligand-before conventional conditioning therapy followed by autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-five CXCR4-directed endoradiotherapies were administered to those patients. Adverse events occurring between endoradiotherapy and the start of conventional conditioning therapy were retrospectively analyzed and graded for the estimation of the safety profile. Results: CXCR4-directed endoradiotherapy with pentixather showed a favorable toxicity profile. As expected, the hematopoietic system was most affected, with all subjects developing cytopenias. Except for 1 acute kidney failure, grade 3, due to tumor lysis syndrome, overall nephro- and hepatotoxicity was low. Other higher-grade adverse events were either transient and resolved or easily manageable. Conclusion: Therapy with radiolabeled pentixather appears to be well tolerated and easily applicable when preceding conventional conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",['(c) 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging.'],"['Maurer, Sabine', 'Herhaus, Peter', 'Lippenmeyer, Romina', 'Hanscheid, Heribert', 'Kircher, Malte', 'Schirbel, Andreas', 'Maurer, H Carlo', 'Buck, Andreas K', 'Wester, Hans-Jurgen', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Grigoleit, Gotz-Ulrich', 'Keller, Ulrich', 'Lapa, Constantin']","['Maurer S', 'Herhaus P', 'Lippenmeyer R', 'Hanscheid H', 'Kircher M', 'Schirbel A', 'Maurer HC', 'Buck AK', 'Wester HJ', 'Einsele H', 'Grigoleit GU', 'Keller U', 'Lapa C']","['III.

We have recently shown that the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein prevents H3.3 from being deposited in large heterochromatic PML-associated domains (PADs). However, to what extent PML modulates H3.3 loading on chromatin in other areas of the genome remains unexplored. Here, we examined the impact of PML on targeting of H3.3 to genes and repeat regions that reside outside PADs. We show that loss of PML increases H3.3 deposition in subtelomeric, telomeric, pericentric and centromeric repeats in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, while other repeat classes are not affected. Expression of major satellite, minor satellite and telomeric non-coding transcripts is altered in Pml-null cells. In particular, telomeric Terra transcripts are strongly upregulated, in concordance with a marked reduction in H4K20me3 at these sites. Lastly, for most genes H3.3 enrichment or gene expression outcomes are independent of PML. Our data argue towards the importance of a PML-H3.3 axis in preserving a heterochromatin state at centromeres and telomeres.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Young people face unique challenges in this area because of their life stage, their need to reintegrate with peers, and their own approach to their disease and treatment. This paper explores the perspectives of young people as they return to school during and after curative cancer treatment. METHOD: 12 young people (6 females, 6 males) from the north of England (aged 13-16yearsat time of recruitment) took part in photo elicitation interviews conducted at three time points during the year following a diagnosis of lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, A-plastic anaemia or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Interviews were transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: 'approaches to telling', 'lives becoming public property'; and 'owning the story'. Within these themes participants experienced stressors related to altered peer group dynamics, being propelled into the foreground of the school environment, being responsible for the feelings and needs of others, and conflicts between their perception of coping and the reactions of others. CONCLUSIONS: Re-entering school following a diagnosis of cancer can result in challenging dynamics for a young person, which they are not always equipped to manage. Participants displayed individual differences in their approaches and preferences, but inevitably all had to cope with their lives becoming public property and managing the narrative of their cancer experience.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2019.

One underlying mechanism of chemoresistance involves (over)expression of ATP-dependent drug efflux transporters such as multidrug resistance protein 1-5 (MRP1-5) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which can extrude the important antileukemia drug methotrexate (MTX). Survival of childhood ALL critically depends on the leukemic blasts' capacity for intracellular retention of MTX and MTX-polyglutamates. This pilot study assessed whether expression of MRP1, MRP4, MRP5 and BCRP (real-time PCR) in primary childhood ALL blasts (n = 23) correlated with ex vivo resistance to MTX (assayed by in situ thymidylate synthase inhibition assay (TSIA)), ex vivo accumulation of (radioactive) MTX polyglutamates, and patient survival. Results show that high MRP4 expression is correlated with ex vivo MTX resistance assayed by TSIA (P = 0.01). Moreover, elevated MRP4 and BCRP expression correlated with lower accumulation of MTX-PGs (P = 0.004 and P = 0.03, respectively). Combined high expression of BCRP and MRP4 even further impacted reduced MTX-PG accumulation (P = 0.02). Overall survival was lower (P logrank = 0.04) in children with ALL cells which featured a relatively high expression of both BCRP and MRP4 transporters. These results underscore the impact of high drug efflux transporter expression, notably MRP4 and BCRP, in diminished MTX response in childhood ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the association of early mortality (< 60 days) with location of initial care, sociodemographic factors, and complications has not been evaluated in pediatric and young adult (YA) patients with ALL. METHODS: Using the California Cancer Registry linked to hospitalization data, we identified pediatric and YA patients with ALL who received inpatient leukemia treatment between 1991 and 2014. Patients were classified as receiving all or part/none of their care at an SCC (Children's Oncology Group- or National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center). Propensity scores were created for treatment at an SCC in each age group. Multivariable, inverse probability-weighted Cox proportional hazards regression models identified factors associated with early mortality. Results are presented as hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. RESULTS: Among 6,531 newly diagnosed pediatric (</= 18 years) and YA (19 to 39 years of age) patients with ALL, 1.6% of children and 5.4% of YAs died within 60 days of diagnosis. Most children received all of their care at an SCC (n = 4,752; 85.7%) compared with 35.5% of YAs (n = 1,779).

Since then, several studies have documented that NK cells can kill hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cancer cells. NK cells also recognize and kill cells that have undergone viral infections. Besides natural cytotoxicity, NK cells are also major effectors of antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC). Therefore, NK cells are well ""armed"" to recognize and mount immune responses against ""insults"" that result from cell transformation and viral infections. Because of these attributes, an essential role of NK cells in tumor surveillance was noted. Indeed, several studies have shown a correlation between impaired NK cell cytotoxicity and a higher risk of developing cancer. This evidence led to the idea that cancer initiation and progress is intimately related to an abnormal or misdirected immune response. Whereas all these ideas remain current, it is also true that NK cells represent a heterogeneous population with different abilities to secrete cytokines and to mediate cytotoxic functions. In addition, recent data has shown that NK cells are prone to suffer epigenetic modifications resulting in the acquisition of previously unrecognized attributes such as memory and long-term survival. Such NK cells, referred as ""adaptive"" or ""memory-like,"" also display effector functions that are not necessarily equal to those observed in conventional NK cells. Given the new evidence available, it is essential to discuss the conceptual reasoning and misconceptions regarding the role of NK cells in immune surveillance and immunotherapy.",['(c)2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Cruz-Munoz, Mario Ernesto', 'Valenzuela-Vazquez, Lucero', 'Sanchez-Herrera, Jacqueline', 'Santa-Olalla Tapia, Jesus']","['Cruz-Munoz ME', 'Valenzuela-Vazquez L', 'Sanchez-Herrera J', 'Santa-Olalla Tapia J']","['Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Autonoma del Estado de Morelos, Cuernavaca, Mexico.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190308,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Lineage/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/pathology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Surveillance', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification/cytology/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Virus Diseases/*immunology/pathology/virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Immuno therapy', '*Leukemia', '*Lymphocytes', '*NK cells', '*Signaling']",2019/03/09 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/03/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.MR0618-224RR [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 May;105(5):955-971. doi: 10.1002/JLB.MR0618-224RR.

In CLL, chemoimmunotherapy is being replaced by monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors that are more effective and better tolerated. In MM, new immunomodulatory drugs, proteasome inhibitors, and monoclonal antibodies have expanded treatment options for older patients. The introduction of novel agents has dramatically shifted the landscape of therapeutic options for older adults with hematologic malignancies.

We show here that a rat fibroblast cell line stably expressing L233-Tax formed significantly larger tumors than P233-Tax-expressing cells in a murine xenograft study. Although the microvessel density was comparable in both tumors, visible blood vessel invasion was observed only on tumors from L233-Tax-expressing cells. Endothelial cell tube formation assays using human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed no significant difference in angiogenic activity between conditioned medium from L233- and P233-Tax-expressing cells, whereas in vitro chemotaxis assays revealed that only L233-Tax-expressing cells produced a chemoattractant for endothelial cells. Since pathological neovascularization can occur from the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells, these results suggest that L233-Tax-expressing cells recruit murine endothelial progenitor cells and promote neovascularization to support tumor growth. BLV-infected lymphoma cells may also recruit bovine endothelial progenitor cells to promote neovascularization.

There are no available data on the synthesis of 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives with nonprotein amino acids and their biological activity. The aim of this paper was to determine the synthesis, structural characterization and cytotoxic activity of new 1-(1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)cycloalkane-1- carboxylic acids with 5-, 6-, 7-, 8- and 12-membered rings as well as 2-(1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)- yl)adamantane-2-carboxylic acid and 1-(1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene- 1-carboxylic acid. METHODS: The target compounds were obtained by an interaction of 1,8-naphthalic anhydride with a series of non-protein amino acids. The optimized geometry and harmonic vibrational frequencies have been calculated by DFT employing B3LYP functional using 6-31G(d,p) basis set. An ab initio (MP2 and Hartee-Fock) and DFT (different functionals) using several basis sets have been applied for NMR calculations. The cytotoxic effects of the synthesized compounds are assessed against two human tumor cell lines, namely K-562 (chronic myeloid leukemia) and HUT-78 (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma) after 72 h exposure, using the MTT-dye reduction assay. The apoptogenic effects and the ability to modulate the NFkappaB-signaling pathways were determined using commercially available ELISA kits. RESULTS: All compounds inhibited the growth of malignant cells at micromolar concentrations whereby compound 4b (1-(1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acid) demonstrated superior activity in both cell lines with IC50 values comparable to those of the reference anticancer drug melphalan. CONCLUSION: New 1,8-naphthalimide derivatives with non-protein amino acids were successfully synthesized. Quantum-chemical calculations were performed to elucidate the structure of the newly synthesized compounds. There is a proper alignment between theoretical and experimental results. The cytotoxicity of the synthesized products against two human tumor cell lines, namely K-562 and HUT-78 was evaluated. All compounds inhibited the growth of malignant cells at micromolar concentrations. The pharmacodynamics evaluation of compound 4b showed that its cytotoxicity is mediated by induction of apoptosis and inhibition of NFkappaB-signaling.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Marinov, Marin N', 'Naydenova, Emilia D', 'Momekov, Georgi T', 'Prodanova, Rumyana Y', 'Markova, Nadezhda V', 'Voynikov, Yulian T', 'Stoyanov, Neyko M']","['Marinov MN', 'Naydenova ED', 'Momekov GT', 'Prodanova RY', 'Markova NV', 'Voynikov YT', 'Stoyanov NM']","['Department of General Chemistry, Faculty of Plant Protection and Agroecology, Agricultural University - Plovdiv, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, University of Chemical Technology and Metallurgy, Sofia 1756, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria.', 'Department of General Chemistry, Faculty of Plant Protection and Agroecology, Agricultural University - Plovdiv, Plovdiv 4000, Bulgaria.', 'Institute of Organic Chemistry with Centre of Phytochemistry, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia 1113, Bulgaria.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria.', 'Department of Chemistry and Chemical Technologies, ""Angel Kanchev"" University of Ruse, Razgrad Branch, Razgrad 7200, Bulgaria.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Naphthalimides)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/*chemistry', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Density Functional Theory', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Naphthalimides/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*1,8-Naphthalimides', '*Cytotoxicity', '*DFT', '*GIAO', '*MTT', '*Non-protein amino acids', '*Synthesis.']",2019/03/09 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/03/09 06:00'],"['2018/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-97135 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190307115231 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(10):1276-1284. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190307115231.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, effects of genetic variants in these three microRNAs have not been investigated in Chinese population. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate the relationship between genetic variants in miR-100, miR-146a, and miR-210 and the risk of childhood ALL in Chinese population. Subsequently, plasma expression level of miR-100 was also detected. RESULT: We found that subjects carrying mutant homozygous TT genotype of miR-100 rs543412 had a statistically significantly decreased risk of childhood ALL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.55-0.97, P = 0.029). This protective effect was also observed among subjects whose parents were ever drinkers (adjusted OR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.29-0.94), or whose living house were ever painted (adjusted OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.34-0.94). Besides, rs543412 variant homozygous TT had a significantly protective role in patients with childhood B-ALL. Finally, we found that expression level of miR-100 in plasma of childhood ALL cases was significantly higher than that of noncancer controls. CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that there was significant association between the polymorphisms in miR-100 (rs543412) and decreased susceptibility to childhood ALL.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Here, we report the case of an AML-M2 patient with a variant NUP98-LEDGF/PSIP1 gene fusion (N9-L10). In this patient, three different NUP98-LEDGF fusion mRNAs were characterized due to alternative splicing in LEDGF exon 11. Targeted high-throughput sequencing revealed the presence of IDH1, SRSF2, and WT1 additional pathogenic mutations. To improve the therapeutic monitoring, quantification of NUP98-LEDGF mRNA by real-time PCR was developed. Because of poor response to conventional chemotherapy, allogeneic stem cell transplantation was performed, followed by 20 cycles of azacitidine-based preemptive treatment of relapse. More than 31 months after diagnosis, corresponding to 25 months post SCT and 4 months after the last cycle of azacytidine, the patient is in complete molecular remission (undetectable NUP98-LEDGF mRNA transcripts). This study highlights the considerable variability in breakpoint location within both NUP98 and LEDGF, associated with alternative splicing affecting LEDGF. It also emphasizes the need to fully characterize the breakpoints within the two genes and the identification of all fusion mRNAs, particularly for the development of a molecular monitoring assay. All these data seem critical for the optimal management of NUP98-LEDGF + hematological malignancies commonly associated with a poor prognosis.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

We describe the use of G-CSF in patients treated according to NOPHO-AML 2004 and DB AML-01 and investigated associations with relapse. PROCEDURE: Patients diagnosed with de novo AML completing the first week of therapy and not treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the first complete remission were included (n = 367). Information on G-CSF treatment after each course (yes/no) was registered prospectively in the study database and detailed information was gathered retrospectively from each center. Descriptive statistics were used to describe G-CSF use and Cox regression to assess the association between G-CSF and risk of relapse. RESULTS: G-CSF as supportive care was given to 128 (35%) patients after 268 (39%) courses, with a large variation between centers (0-93%). The use decreased with time-the country-adjusted odds ratio was 0.8/diagnostic year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.7-0.9). The median daily dose was 5 mug/kg (range 3-12 mug/kg) and the median cumulative dose was 75 mug/kg (range 7-1460 mug/kg). Filgrastim was used in 82% of G-CSF administrations and infection was the indication in 44% of G-CSF administrations.

DESIGN/METHODS: Among 726 pediatric patients with newly diagnosed ALL treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 22 had deficient G6PD activity. We compared the prevalence of positive minimal residual disease (MRD) >/=1% at Day 15/Day 19 of induction or >/=0.01% at Day 42/Day 46 (end of induction) and the number of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions after daunorubicin in induction between patients with or without G6PD deficiency, adjusting for ALL risk group, treatment protocol, age, and gender. RESULTS: There was no difference in Day 15/19 (P = 1) or end of induction MRD (P = 0.76) nor in the number of RBC transfusions (P = 0.73); the lack of association with MRD was confirmed in a dataset of 1192 newly diagnosed male patients enrolled in a Children's Oncology Group trial (P = 0.78).

A detailed characterization of the surface immunophenotype of LSCs to discriminate them from bulk leukemic blasts may enable successful targeting of this population thereby improving patient outcomes in AML. To identify surface markers, which may reflect LSC activity at diagnosis, we performed a detailed analysis of 16 putative LSC markers in CD34/38 leukemic subcompartments of 150 diagnostic AML samples using multicolor flow cytometry. The most promising markers were then selected to determine a possible correlation of their expression with a recently published LSC gene signature. We found GPR56 and CLL-1 to be the most prominently differently expressed surface markers in AML subcompartments. While GPR56 was highest expressed within the LSC-enriched CD34(+) 38(-) subcompartment as compared to CD34(+) 38(+) and CD34(-) leukemic bulk cells, CLL-1 expression was lowest in CD34(+) 38(-) leukemic cells and increased in CD34(+) 38(+) and CD34(-) blasts. Furthermore, high GPR56 surface expression in CD34(+) 38(-) leukemic cells correlated with a recently published LSC gene expression signature and was associated with decreased overall survival in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy. In contrast, CLL-1 expression correlated inversely with the LSC gene signature and was not informative on outcome. Our data strongly support GPR56 as a promising clinically relevant marker for identifying leukemic cells with LSC activity at diagnosis in CD34-positive AML.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: This study used a Delphi panel approach to explore concepts of cure in RR Ph-negative B cell precursor ALL. Ten European experts in this disease area participated in a survey and face-to-face panel meeting. RESULTS: Findings showed that clinicians conceptualize ""cure"" as a combination of three broad treatment outcomes that vary depending on the treatment stage: complete remission early in treatment (1-3 months) indicates initial success; eradicating cancer cells (minimal residual disease negative status) consolidates the early clinical response; leukemia-free survival is required in the long term. CONCLUSIONS: Although such terminology remains contested, clinicians would begin considering ""cure"" as early as 2 years provided the patient is off therapy, with most considering the term applicable by the third year.

We analyzed the relationships between immunohistochemical (IHC) expression, including that of CD123, and clinical outcomes. This study involved a retrospective analysis of 48 patients diagnosed with de novo AML (M0-M5, n = 48) at our hospital between February 2008 and September 2015. Among patients with de novo AML, CD123 expression was associated with a failure to achieve complete response (CR) to initial induction chemotherapy (P = 0.044) and poor overall survival (OS) (P = 0.036).

Dyskerin encoded by the DKC1 gene is associated with the formation of certain small RNAs and the telomerase activity. Inherited mutations in DKC1 inactivate the dyskerin and causes dyskeratosis congenital, which is characterized by skin defects, hematopoiesis failure, and increased susceptibility to cancer. DKC1 reportedly up-regulates in several human cancers, including renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer. Dyskerin is deregulated in B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia and breast carcinomas, but its expression and function in glioma have hardly been investigated. Hence, we were prompted to collect tissue samples and implement cell experiments. Our study reveals that DKC1 expression is significantly increased in the pathological tissues of glioma compared with that in normal tissues. The increased staining of DKC1 is related to the World Health Organization stages of tumors. DKC1 knockdown also significantly inhibits glioma cell growth by altering the expression of cell cycle-relative molecules to arrest at the G1 phase. In the transwell chamber, DKC1 knockdown glioma cells exhibit low motility. Consistent with classic oncogenic pathways, N-cadherin, HIF-1alpha, and MMP2 expression levels are lower compared with those of the control group. Therefore, DKC1 up-regulation in gliomas is common and necessary for extensive tumor growth. The phenotype of glioma cell lines after DKC1 down-regulation suggests its use as a valuable clinical treatment strategy.",,"['Miao, Fa-An', 'Chu, Kun', 'Chen, Hai-Rong', 'Zhang, Meng', 'Shi, Pei-Cong', 'Bai, Jin', 'You, Yong-Ping']","['Miao FA', 'Chu K', 'Chen HR', 'Zhang M', 'Shi PC', 'Bai J', 'You YP']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211100, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, 84 West Huaihai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Department of Occupational Medicine and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 210029, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, 84 West Huaihai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, 84 West Huaihai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, 84 West Huaihai Road, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China. bj@xzhmu.edu.cn.', 'Jiangsu Center for the Collaboration and Innovation of Cancer Biotherapy, Cancer Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China. bj@xzhmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, 211100, Jiangsu Province, China. yypl3@njmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, 300 Guangzhou Road, Nanjing, 221002, Jiangsu Province, China. yypl3@njmu.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190307,United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DKC1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Brain Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', '*Glioma/genetics/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', '*Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DKC1', '*Glioma', '*Invasion', '*Migration', '*Proliferation']",2019/03/09 06:00,2020/04/25 06:00,['2019/03/09 06:00'],"['2018/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10637-019-00748-w [doi]', '10.1007/s10637-019-00748-w [pii]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 2019 Dec;37(6):1177-1186. doi: 10.1007/s10637-019-00748-w.

We used a panel of seven dietary lectins to analyze cytotoxicity against hematological cancers. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), even at low doses, demonstrated maximum toxicity toward acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Using AML cell lines, we show time- and dose-dependent killing by WGA. We also show that low doses of WGA kills primary patient AML cells, irrespective of subtype, with no significant toxicity to normal cells. WGA caused AML cell agglutination, but failed to agglutinate RBC's at this dose. WGA, primarily, binds to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) and is also reported to interact with sialic-acid-containing glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides. After neuraminidase pre-treatment, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of terminal sialic acid residues, AML cells were less sensitive to WGA-induced cell death. AML cells were also not sensitive to succinyl-WGA, which does not react with sialic acid. Incubation with LEL lectin, which recognizes GlcNAc or SNA, which binds preferentially to sialic acid attached to terminal galactose in alpha-2,6 and to a lesser degree alpha-2,3 linkage, did not alter AML cell viability. These data indicate that WGA-induced AML cell death is dependent on both GlcNAc binding and interaction with sialic acids. We did not observe any in vitro or in vivo toxicity of WGA toward normal cells at the concentrations tested. Finally, low doses of WGA injection demonstrated significant in vivo toxicity toward AML cells, using xenograft mouse model. Thus, WGA is a potential candidate for leukemia therapy.",,"['Ryva, Bradley', 'Zhang, Keman', 'Asthana, Abhishek', 'Wong, Derek', 'Vicioso, Yorleny', 'Parameswaran, Reshmi']","['Ryva B', 'Zhang K', 'Asthana A', 'Wong D', 'Vicioso Y', 'Parameswaran R']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States.', 'The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, OH, United States.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190221,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['GlcNAc', 'WGA', 'lectin', 'leukemia', 'therapy']",2019/03/09 06:00,2019/03/09 06:01,['2019/03/09 06:00'],"['2018/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/09 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00100 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Feb 21;9:100. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00100. eCollection 2019.,PMC6393371,,"['T32 GM007250/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR002549/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our group proposes that mobilization of HSPCs is mainly a result of sterile inflammation in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment in response to pro-mobilizing stimuli and that during the initiation phase of the mobilization process BM-residing cells belonging to the innate immunity system, including granulocytes and monocytes, release danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs, also known as alarmins), reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes. These factors together orchestrate the release of HSPCs into PB. One of the most important DAMPs released in the initiation phase of mobilization is extracellular adenosine triphosphate, a potent activator of the inflammasome. As a result of its activation, IL-1beta and IL-18 as well as other pro-mobilizing mediators, including DAMPs such as high molecular group box 1 (Hmgb1) and S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100a9), are released. These DAMPs are important activators of the complement cascade (ComC) in the mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-dependent pathway. Specifically, Hmgb1 and S100a9 bind to MBL, which leads to activation of MBL-associated proteases, which activate the ComC and in parallel also trigger activation of the coagulation cascade (CoaC). In this review, we will highlight the novel role of the innate immunity cell-expressed NLRP3 inflammasome, which, during the initiation phase of HSPC mobilization, couples purinergic signaling with the MBL-dependent pathway of the ComC and, in parallel, the CoaC for optimal release of HSPCs.

However, the prognostic role of the complete gamut of cytogenetic aberrations in AML patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is currently undefined. In addition, their significance in conjunction with FLT3-ITD status has not been addressed thus far. Using the ALWP/EBMT registry we conducted a retrospective analysis to determine the clinical outcomes of AML patients undergoing allo-HSCT with respect to specific recurring cytogenetic abnormalities complemented with FLT3-ITD status. We analyzed a cohort consisting of 8558 adult AML patients who underwent allo-HSCT from either a matched sibling or a matched unrelated donor. Patients with inv(3)(q21q26)/t(3;3)(q21;q26), del(5q), monosomy 7, chromosome 17p abnormalities, t(10;11)(p11-14;q13-23), t(6;11)(q27;q23), as well as those patients with a monosomal or complex karyotype experienced significantly inferior leukemia-free survival (LFS) compared to patients with a normal karyotype. Trisomy 14, del(9q), and loss of chromosome X were associated with improved LFS rates. A novel prognostic model delineating 5 distinct groups incorporating cytogenetic complexity and FLT3-ITD status was constructed with significant prognostic implications.

However, how master transcription factors individually impact the epigenomic landscape and orchestrate the behaviour of regulatory networks under different environmental constraints is only partially understood. Here, we show that the transcription factor Nanog deploys multiple distinct mechanisms to enhance embryonic stem cell self-renewal. In the presence of LIF, which fosters self-renewal, Nanog rewires the pluripotency network by promoting chromatin accessibility and binding of other pluripotency factors to thousands of enhancers. In the absence of LIF, Nanog blocks differentiation by sustaining H3K27me3, a repressive histone mark, at developmental regulators. Among those, we show that the repression of Otx2 plays a preponderant role.

Based on CD39/CD26 markers, blood nTreg analysis revealed the presence of five different cell subsets, each representing a distinct stage of maturation. Ex vivo added microenvironmental factors, including IL-2, TGFbeta, and PGE2, direct the conversion from naive precursor to immature memory and finally from immature to mature memory cells, the latest being a no-return stage. Phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the subsets illustrate the structural parental maturation between subsets, which further correlates with the expression of regulatory factors. Regarding nTreg functional plasticity, both maturation stage and microenvironmental cytokines condition nTreg activities, which include blockade of autoreactive immune cells by cell-cell contact, Th17 and IL-10 Tr1-like activities, or activation of TCR-stimulating dendritic cell tolerization. Importantly, blood nTreg CD39/CD26 profile remained constant over a 2-y period in healthy persons but varied from person to person. Preliminary data on patients with autoimmune diseases or acute myelogenous leukemia illustrate the potential use of the nTreg CD39/CD26 profile as a blood biomarker to monitor chronic inflammatory diseases. Finally, we confirmed that naive conventional CD4 T cells, TCR-stimulated under a tolerogenic conditioned medium, could be ex vivo reprogrammed to FOXP3 lineage Tregs, and further found that these cells were exclusively committed to suppressive function under all microenvironmental contexts.",['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

Here, we analyzed the transcriptome, lipidome, and genetic interactions of human leukemia cells exposed to palmitate. Palmitate treatment increased saturated glycerolipids, accompanied by a transcriptional stress response, including upregulation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. A comprehensive genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen identified >350 genes modulating lipotoxicity. Among previously unknown genetic modifiers of lipotoxicity, depletion of RNF213, a putative ubiquitin ligase mutated in Moyamoya vascular disease, protected cells from lipotoxicity. On a broader level, integration of our comprehensive datasets revealed that changes in di-saturated glycerolipids, but not other lipid classes, are central to lipotoxicity in this model. Consistent with this, inhibition of ER-localized glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase activity protected from all aspects of lipotoxicity. Identification of genes modulating the response to saturated fatty acids may reveal novel therapeutic strategies for treating metabolic diseases linked to lipotoxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 is expressed at a high level in platelets and their progenitors, where it plays a central role in platelet functions, hemostasis, and arterial thrombosis. Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 also participates in cancer progression, such as tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. In resting platelets, integrin alphaIIbbeta3 adopts an inactive conformation. Upon agonist stimulation, the transduction of inside-out signals leads integrin alphaIIbbeta3 to switch from a low- to high-affinity state for fibrinogen and other ligands. Ligand binding causes integrin clustering and subsequently promotes outside-in signaling, which initiates and amplifies a range of cellular events to drive essential platelet functions such as spreading, aggregation, clot retraction, and thrombus consolidation. Regulation of the bidirectional signaling of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 requires the involvement of numerous interacting proteins, which associate with the cytoplasmic tails of alphaIIbbeta3 in particular. Integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and its signaling pathways are considered promising targets for antithrombotic therapy. This review describes the bidirectional signal transduction of integrin alphaIIbbeta3 in platelets, as well as the proteins responsible for its regulation and therapeutic agents that target integrin alphaIIbbeta3 and its signaling pathways.",,"['Huang, Jiansong', 'Li, Xia', 'Shi, Xiaofeng', 'Zhu, Mark', 'Wang, Jinghan', 'Huang, Shujuan', 'Huang, Xin', 'Wang, Huafeng', 'Li, Ling', 'Deng, Huan',

Here, we report the case of a man with nephrotic syndrome that was caused by dasatinib. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukemia was referred to our hospital because of proteinuria 1 month after dasatinib therapy was introduced. A percutaneous kidney biopsy was performed, diffuse glomerular endothelial injury and effacement of the foot process were noted, and the patient was diagnosed with dasatinib-induced nephrotic syndrome. Additionally, in an electron microscopy study, randomly arranged fibrils were observed in the mesangial and subendothelial regions. Switching from dasatinib to nilotinib led to a decrease in the proteinuria level, from 12 to 0.6 g/g creatinine, within 2 weeks. The patient was discharged from our department on the 25th day after hospitalization, without any drug aftereffects.

The study aimed to assess prevalence and reasons for non-adherence to Imatinib in newly diagnosed patients with CML in the first 3-months of treatment. METHODS: The study was conducted from October 1, 2016 to November 30, 2017 at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A total of 147 newly diagnosed patients were followed and their adherence status was determined using the 8-items Morisky Medication Adherence Scale and reasons for their non-adherence were evaluated using semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data while multivariable logistic regression was employed to explore associations among variables of interest. RESULTS: Participants' median age at time of confirmed diagnosis was 36 years; with most of them in the age group of <40 years (64.6%). Males comprised 59.2%. Adherence rate was found to be 55.1%. Those who lived in rural area, had low income, adverse drug events and comorbidity were significantly associated with treatment non-adherence. Most (68.4%) patients missed their medication due to adverse drug events. Three patients were lost-to-follow-up. Among 144 patients who finished the 3-month follow-up, 91.7% of them achieved complete hematologic remission. Morisky high adherent (AOR = 8.6, 95%CI:4.32-11.1) was positively associated with complete hematologic remission. CONCLUSIONS: Overall treatment adherence is suboptimal.

Using a descriptive design, patients with largely hematologic malignancies completed the questionnaires, including the Korean-Advance Directive (K-AD) model, which pertains to values, treatment wishes, and proxy appointment. Of 45 patients (aged 48.7 +/- 10.7 years, 51.1% men), two-thirds had leukemia (40.0%) and lymphoma (26.7%). ""Dying comfortably"" was the most frequently selected value (n = 20). Regarding treatment wishes, hospice care was the most desired type (n = 22), whereas aggressive treatments, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, were less preferred (n = 3). The patient's spouse was most frequently appointed as a proxy (n = 27). Patients who completed all the 3 components of the K-AD model (51.1%) were less depressed (t = -2.31; P = .028) and more likely to perceive the benefits of the K-AD model (t = 2.07; P = .045), compared with the noncompleters (48.9%). Further, being male (odds ratio [OR], 6.42; P = .031), having higher scores on depressive symptoms (OR, 1.28; P = .016), and perceived barriers (OR, 1.08; P = .040) were associated with lower tendency to complete the K-AD model.

These patients are at high risk for metabolic syndrome (MS), especially those who received total body irradiation (TBI). The consequences of children's irradiation on adipose tissue (AT) development in adulthood are currently unknown. The objective of this study is to assess the impact of TBI on AT of childhood AL survivors. Design: We compared the morphological and functional characteristics of AT among survivors of childhood AL who developed MS and received (n = 12) or not received (n = 12) TBI. Subjects/methods: Body fat distribution and ectopic fat stores (abdominal visceral and liver fat) were evaluated by DEXA, MRI and 1H-spectroscopy. Functional characteristics of subcutaneous AT were investigated by studying gene expression and pre-adipocyte differentiation in culture. Results: Patients who have received TBI exhibited a lower BMI (minus 5 kg/m2) and a lower waist circumference (minus 14 cm), especially irradiated women. Despite the lower quantity of intra-abdominal AT, irradiated patient displayed a nearly two-fold greater content of liver fat when compared to non-irradiated patient (17 vs 9%, P = 0.008). These lipodystrophic-like features are supplemented by molecular abnormalities in subcutaneous AT of irradiated patients: decrease of gene expression of SREBP1 (minus 39%, P = 0.01) and CIDEA (minus 36%, P = 0.004) and a clear alteration of pre-adipocyte differentiation. Conclusions: These results strongly support the direct effect of irradiation on AT, especially in women, leading to specific nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, despite lower BMI.

Furthermore, it has been suggested that the increase in DLBCL is due to the activated B-cell (ABC) subtype; but data on this, and the impact of inflammatory co-morbidities on survival, are sparse and contradictory. METHODS: Data are from an established UK population-based cohort. Patients (n = 6834) diagnosed between 01/2009 and 08/2015 are included; DLBCL (n = 1771), myeloma (n = 1760), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, n = 1580), MZL (n = 936), and follicular lymphoma (FL, n = 787). Information on rheumatological disorders and deaths was obtained by record-linkage to nationally compiled Hospital Episode Statistics, with age-and sex-matched individuals (n = 68,340) from the same catchment population ( 4 million people) providing the comparator. RESULTS: Significantly increased risks for DLBCL (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.8-2.8) and MZL (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.5-2.7) were found for those with rheumatological disorders; the site distribution of those with/without rheumatological conditions differing for DLBCL (p = 0.007) and MZL (p = 0.002). No increases in risk were observed for the remaining mature B-cell malignancies, and no associations with survival were detected for DLBCL (age-adjusted HR = 1.2, 95% CI 0.9-1.6) or MZL (age-adjusted HR = 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.9). Furthermore, whilst our findings provide evidence for an association with rheumatological disease severity for DLBCL, they offer little support for the notion that the association is driven by an increase in the incidence of the ABC subtype. CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that the chronic activation and proliferation of specific B-cell populations which characterize autoimmune disease increase the potential for the lymphomagenic events that lead to DLBCL and MZL in both males and females; but have no impact on the development of CLL, FL or MM, or on survival.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

The underlying corticotroph adenomas harbor frequently somatic mutations in the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8) gene. These mutations render USP8 hyperactive and prevent client proteins from degradation. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of USP8 mutations on proteins deregulated in CD. DESIGN: One hundred eight pituitary adenomas (75 corticotroph [58 USP8 wild type (WT) and 17 USP8 mutated], 14 somatotroph, and 19 nonfunctioning) were investigated by immunohistochemistry. All evaluated proteins [USP8, arginine vasopressin receptor 1b and 2, corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor, cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB), p27/kip1, cyclin E, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), orphan nuclear receptor 4, epidermal growth factor receptor, histone deacetylase 2, glucocorticoid receptor, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 and Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 enzyme substrate 1] were known to be deregulated in CD. Furthermore, AtT20 cells were transfected with USP8 to investigate the expression of possible downstream proteins by immunoblot. RESULTS: Whereas most of the investigated proteins were not differentially expressed, the cell-cycle inhibitor p27 was significantly reduced in USP8 mutated corticotroph adenoma (H-score 2.0 +/- 1.0 vs 1.1 +/- 1.1 in WT adenomas; P = 0.004). In contrast, the chaperone HSP90 was expressed higher (0.5 +/- 0.4 vs 0.2 +/- 0.4; P = 0.29), and the phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB was increased in USP8 mutated adenomas (1.30.5 +/- 0.40.9 vs 0.70.5 +/- 0.40.7; P = 0.014). Accordingly, AtT20 cells transfected with the USP8 P720R mutant had higher phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) levels than WT transfected cells (1.3 +/- 0.14 vs 1 +/- 0.23; P = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: We could demonstrate that USP8 mutations are associated with deregulation of p27/kip1, HSP90, and pCREB. These findings suggest that these proteins are direct or indirect clients of USP8 and could therefore be potential targets for therapeutic approaches in patients with CD.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Endocrine Society.'],"['Weigand, Isabel', 'Knobloch, Lisanne', 'Flitsch, Jorg', 'Saeger, Wolfgang', 'Monoranu, Camelia M', 'Hofner, Kerstin', 'Herterich, Sabine', 'Rotermund, Roman', 'Ronchi, Cristina L', 'Buchfelder, Michael', 'Glatzel, Markus', 'Hagel, Christian', 'Fassnacht, Martin', 'Deutschbein, Timo', 'Sbiera, Silviu']","['Weigand I', 'Knobloch L', 'Flitsch J', 'Saeger W', 'Monoranu CM', 'Hofner K', 'Herterich S', 'Rotermund R', 'Ronchi CL', 'Buchfelder M', 'Glatzel M', 'Hagel C', 'Fassnacht M', 'Deutschbein T', 'Sbiera S']","['Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Central Laboratory, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Metabolism and System Research, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Central Laboratory, University Hospital Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (CDKN1B protein, human)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (USP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Adenoma/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/metabolism', 'Endopeptidases/*genetics', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation/genetics', 'Pituitary ACTH Hypersecretion/*genetics/pathology', 'Pituitary Gland/pathology', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/complications/*genetics/pathology', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/03/08 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['5370168 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2018-02564 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2019 Jul 1;104(7):2535-2546. doi: 10.1210/jc.2018-02564.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One way by which tumors thrive in the context of ER stress is by promoting ER-Associated Degradation (ERAD), although the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we show that the Small p97/VCP Interacting Protein (SVIP), an endogenous inhibitor of ERAD, undergoes DNA hypermethylation-associated silencing in tumorigenesis to achieve this goal. SVIP exhibits tumor suppressor features and its recovery is associated with increased ER stress and growth inhibition. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses show that cancer cells with epigenetic loss of SVIP are depleted in mitochondrial enzymes and oxidative respiration activity. This phenotype is reverted upon SVIP restoration. The dependence of SVIP hypermethylated cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis and glucose was also associated with sensitivity to an inhibitor of the glucose transporter GLUT1. This could be relevant to the management of tumors carrying SVIP epigenetic loss, because these occur in high-risk patients who manifest poor clinical outcomes. Overall, our study provides insights into how epigenetics helps deal with ER stress and how SVIP epigenetic loss in cancer may be amenable to therapies that target glucose transporters.",,"['Llinas-Arias, Pere', 'Rossello-Tortella, Margalida', 'Lopez-Serra, Paula', 'Perez-Salvia, Montserrat', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Marin, Silvia', 'Munoz, Juan P', 'Junza, Alexandra',

Isobaric labeling has a unique multiplexing feature where the ""total"" peptide signal from all channels (or samples) triggers MS/MS fragmentation for peptide identification, while the reporter ions provide quantitative information. In light of this feature, we tested the concept of using a ""boosting"" sample (e.g., a biological sample mimicking the study samples but available in a much larger quantity) in multiplexed analysis to enable sensitive and comprehensive quantitative phosphoproteomic measurements with <100000 cells. This simple boosting to amplify signal with isobaric labeling (BASIL) strategy increased the overall number of quantifiable phosphorylation sites more than 4-fold. Good reproducibility in quantification was demonstrated with a median CV of 15.3% and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.95 from biological replicates. A proof-of-concept experiment demonstrated the ability of BASIL to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia cells based on the phosphoproteome data. Moreover, in a pilot application, this strategy enabled quantitative analysis of over 20000 phosphorylation sites from human pancreatic islets treated with interleukin-1beta and interferon-gamma. Together, this signal boosting strategy provides an attractive solution for comprehensive and quantitative phosphoproteome profiling of relatively small populations of cells where traditional phosphoproteomic workflows lack sufficient sensitivity.",,"['Yi, Lian', 'Tsai, Chia-Feng', 'Dirice, Ercument', 'Swensen, Adam C', 'Chen, Jing', 'Shi, Tujin', 'Gritsenko, Marina A', 'Chu, Rosalie K', 'Piehowski, Paul D', 'Smith, Richard D', 'Rodland, Karin D', 'Atkinson, Mark A', 'Mathews, Clayton E', 'Kulkarni, Rohit N', 'Liu, Tao', 'Qian, Wei-Jun']","['Yi L', 'Tsai CF', 'Dirice E', 'Swensen AC', 'Chen J', 'Shi T', 'Gritsenko MA', 'Chu RK', 'Piehowski PD', 'Smith RD', 'Rodland KD', 'Atkinson MA', 'Mathews CE', 'Kulkarni RN', 'Liu T', 'Qian WJ']","['Section of Islet Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine , Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02215 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine , University of Florida , Gainesville , Florida 32611 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine , University of Florida , Gainesville , Florida 32611 , United States.', 'Department of Pathology, Immunology, and Laboratory Medicine , University of Florida , Gainesville , Florida 32611 , United States.', 'Section of Islet Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine , Joslin Diabetes Center and Harvard Medical School , Boston , Massachusetts 02215 , United States.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6514-6911', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5592-3588', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2381-2349', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7070-6541', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9529-6550', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5393-2827']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190315,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1beta/*pharmacology', 'Islets of Langerhans/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphopeptides/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Staining and Labeling/*methods', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods']",,,2019/03/08 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00024 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2019 May 7;91(9):5794-5801. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00024.

Human airway trypsin-like protease 4 (HAT-L4) is a transmembrane serine protease expressed in epithelial cells and exocrine glands. In the skin, HAT-L4 is important for normal epidermal barrier function. Here, we report an unexpected finding of ectopic HAT-L4 expression in neutrophils and monocytes from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Such expression was not detected in bone marrow cells from normal individuals or patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In AML patients who underwent chemotherapy, persistent HAT-L4 expression in bone marrow cells was associated with minimal residual disease and poor prognostic outcomes. In culture, silencing HAT-L4 expression in AML-derived THP-1 cells by short hairpin RNAs inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 activation and Matrigel invasion. In mouse xenograft models, inhibition of HAT-L4 expression reduced the proliferation and growth of THP-1 cell-derived tumors. Our results indicate that ectopic HAT-L4 expression is a pathological mechanism in AML and that HAT-L4 may be used as a cell surface marker for AML blast detection and targeting.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

This study aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of combining a janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitor with ibrutinib because JAK-mediated cytokine-signals support CLL cells and may not be inhibited by ibrutinib. The JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib was prescribed to 12 CLL patients with abnormal serum beta-2 microglobulin levels after 6 months or persistent lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly after 12 months on ibrutinib using a 3 + 3 phase 1 trial design (NCT02912754). Ibrutinib was continued at 420 mg daily and ruxolitinib was added at 5, 10, 15, or 20 mg BID for 3 weeks out of five for seven cycles. The break was mandated to avoid anemia and thrombocytopenia observed with ruxolitinib as a single agent in CLL. The combination was well-tolerated without dose-limiting toxicities. Cyclic changes in platelets, lymphocytes, and associated chemokines and thrombopoietic factors were observed and partial response criteria were met in 2 of 12 patients. The results suggest that JAK-signaling helps CLL cells persist in the presence of ibrutinib and ruxolitinib with ibrutinib is well-tolerated and may be a useful regiment to use in combination therapies for CLL.",['(c) 2019 The Authors.

A case report.,712-716,10.1177/0269216319835149 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Awareness and pain during palliative sedation is typically assessed by observational scales, but the use of such scales has been put into question. CASE PRESENTATION: A woman in her mid-80s was admitted to a palliative care unit, presenting with chronic lymphatic leukemia, depression, and a cerebrovascular accident, with right-sided hemiplegia and aphasia. The patient was unable to eat and was suffering from nausea and vomiting. Before admission, the patient had expressed her desire to discontinue treatment on several occasions. CASE MANAGEMENT: The decision was made to initiate palliative sedation. The patient consented to take part in a study to assess level of comfort and pain using two monitoring devices (NeuroSense monitor and Analgesia Nociception Index monitor). CASE OUTCOME: The patient died 90 h after initiation of palliative sedation. Titration of the medication was challenging and sedation was not deep enough during the first 2 days. Thirteen assessments made with the Ramsay Sedation Scale showed that the patient was considered to be in a deep sleep, while in fact the NeuroSense monitor indicated otherwise. CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates the feasibility and potential advantages of using monitoring devices to objectify assessments of pain and discomfort in palliatively sedated patients.",,"['Six, Stefaan', 'Laureys, Steven', 'Poelaert, Jan', 'Bilsen, Johan', 'Theuns, Peter', 'Musch, Liza', 'Deschepper, Reginald']","['Six S', 'Laureys S', 'Poelaert J', 'Bilsen J', 'Theuns P', 'Musch L', 'Deschepper R']","['1 Mental Health and Wellbeing Research Group, Department of Public Health, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', '2 Coma Science Group, Cyclotron Research Centre and Neurology Department, University Hospital of Liege, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', '3 Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', '1 Mental Health and Wellbeing Research Group, Department of Public Health, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', '1 Mental Health and Wellbeing Research Group, Department of Public Health, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', '4 Department of Experimental and Applied Psychology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', '1 Mental Health and Wellbeing Research Group, Department of Public Health, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Jette, Belgium.', '1 Mental Health and Wellbeing Research Group, Department of Public Health, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Jette, Belgium.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3584-6818'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190307,England,Palliat Med,Palliative medicine,8704926,['0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)'],IM,"['Aged, 80 and over', 'Awareness/*physiology', 'Deep Sedation/*methods', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives/*therapeutic use', 'Monitoring, Physiologic/instrumentation/methods', 'Pain/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Pain Management/*methods', 'Palliative Care/*methods', 'Unconsciousness/*physiopathology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Palliative care', '*deep sedation', '*pain measurement', '*patient monitoring', '*unconsciousness']",2019/03/08 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0269216319835149 [doi]'],ppublish,Palliat Med. 2019 Jun;33(6):712-716. doi: 10.1177/0269216319835149.

METHODS: The expression of SIRP-alpha and CD36 was measured in peritoneal macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of endometriosis patients and control participants. The expressions of SIRP-alpha and CD36 were measured in human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) cell-derived macrophages that were treated with interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced conditioned medium, eutopic versus normal endometrial homogenate, or lipopolysaccharide in the presence or absence of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) or transforming growth factor (TGF-beta) inhibitors, respectively. RESULTS: Peritoneal macrophages that were isolated from women with endometriosis exhibited an enhanced expression of SIRP-alpha and a decreased expression of CD36 compared to control participants. Women with endometriosis had significantly higher levels of SIRP-alpha and CD36 in peripheral circulating mononuclear cells than in control participants. SIRP-alpha expression was significantly increased, whereas the CD36 expression was decreased in THP-1 cell-derived macrophages after treatment with eutopic endometrial homogenate. Intervention with IL-6-induced conditioned medium resulted in the downregulation of SIRP-alpha but the upregulation of CD36 in THP-1 cells. Incubation with the NF-kappaBp50 inhibitor decreased the expression of CD36 and SIRP-alpha in macrophages that were treated with normal endometrial homogenate, whereas the TGF-beta inhibitor enhanced the CD36 expression of THP-1 cell-derived macrophages treated with eutopic endometrial homogenate. CONCLUSION: The eutopic endometrium could reduce the phagocytic ability of peritoneal macrophages in women with endometriosis through the modulation of SIRP-alpha and CD36 expression. Inhibition of the TGF-beta signal pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of endometriosis.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The tumor samples are sometimes difficult to analyze using DNA-based molecular methods because of poor tumor DNA quality or quantity. Anti-BRAFV600E VE1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been proposed as a valuable ancillary tool to analyze some ""molecularly challenging"" tumor samples. In this technical study, we focused on its application in the field of decalcified tumor samples. We selected four patients with known BRAFV600E-mutated cancer (3 metastatic melanomas and 1 hairy cell leukemia) and paired non-decalcified/decalcified tumor samples. Molecular analyses failed in the four decalcified samples (3 bone metastases and 1 osteo-medullar biopsy) with non-contributive mutation status. Whereas non-decalcified tumor samples were all positive using anti-BRAFV600E VE1 IHC, the four decalcified samples were concluded negative. Because decalcified tumor samples are difficult to analyze from a molecular point of view, it is tempting to use IHC instead of DNA-based methods searching for BRAFV600E mutations in these samples. Nevertheless, the decalcification process may also cause false-negative results using VE1 IHC. Decalcified samples require specific and optimized IHC and molecular protocols and quality controls.","['(c) 2019 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.']","['Bourhis, Amelie', 'Le Flahec, Glen', 'Uguen, Arnaud']","['Bourhis A', 'Le Flahec G', 'Uguen A']","['CHRU Brest, Department of Pathology, Brest, F-29220, France.', 'CHRU Brest, Department of Pathology, Brest, F-29220, France.', 'CHRU Brest, Department of Pathology, Brest, F-29220, France.', 'Inserm, U1078, Brest, F-29200, France.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0230-2905'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190307,Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Biopsy', 'Decalcification Technique', 'False Negative Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['BRAFV600E', 'Idylla', 'decalcification', 'hairy cell leukemia', 'immunohistochemistry', 'melanoma']",2019/03/08 06:00,2019/06/27 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/pin.12784 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2019 Apr;69(4):219-223. doi: 10.1111/pin.12784.

The primary endpoint of this analysis was the molecular relapse-free survival, estimated by the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method. Major endpoint was the estimated rate of patients without molecular relapse at 6 months. Fourteen patients were enrolled; 4 patients maintained DMR with a follow-up of 24 (two patients), 34 and 66 months, respectively, whereas 10 patients relapsed. All molecular relapses occurred within 6 months (median 3 months, range 1-6) after imatinib discontinuation. The overall probability of maintaining DMR at 6 months was 28.6%. No parameters associated with molecular relapse could be identified. Keeping in mind the rarity of paediatric CML, which contributed to the small size of the cohort, our findings illustrate that imatinib cessation after sustained DMR is successful in only limited numbers of patients, whereas much higher rates are reported in adult patients.

Soon after the introduction of whole-body PET instruments, (18)F-FDG was utilized in the assessment of a variety of solid tumors and certain hematological malignancies. Yet, the role of (18)F-FDG in assessing benign and uncommon malignant disorders of the bone marrow has not been investigated to a great extent. Fluorine-18-FDG as a molecular probe has the proven capacity to reflect the abnormal glycolytic activities inherent to a variety of disorders, where such information may serve as a guide to the clinical course of the respective disease. Recent efforts have studied bone marrow and extra-medullary disease activity in certain malignancies like chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Nonetheless, few studies have explored the role of (18)F-FDG in assessing the metabolic basis of benign disorders of red marrow. Moreover, the introduction of novel imaging analysis schemes in recent years has allowed for the global assessment of red marrow disease, which can provide a superior means for characterizing the systemic nature and burden of these disorders. Accordingly, semi-quantitative global analysis techniques as applied to the skeletal structures in (18)F-FDG PET may provide a tool to better understand these complex marrow abnormalities. Functional imaging of red bone marrow may also reveal critical information specifically regarding the extra-medullary extension of such hematological disorders that cannot be assessed by other diagnostic or imaging techniques. Myleoproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are an apt category of hematological disease that confer significantly altered systemic metabolic rates of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in the marrow, as such they are primed for exploration with (18)F-FDG PET. The hallmark of such disorders involves the excess production of particular cellular components in blood. After a period of excess production, scar tissue may develop in place of the HSC leading to myleofibrosis and decreased hematopoietic activity. One of the least studied disorders within the larger category of MPN with respect to the nuclear medicine is polycythemia. Polycythemia may be either primary, polycythemia vera (PV), or secondary. PV involves a JAK2+ in HSC which allows for the excessive proliferation of immature erythrocytes and depressed erythropoietin levels as a result. Secondary polycythemia occurs in response to decreased oxygen intake, often as a result of smoking, which results in increased erythropoietin and hematocrit levels. Primary and secondary polycythemia lead to an increase in overall red marrow activity and a diffusion of active red marrow into the appendicular skeleton. Clinical presentation often includes redness or irritation of the skin along with headache, fatigue and excessive bleeding. Based upon the mentioned precedent, it is evident that PET imaging with (18)F-FDG and other tracers will play a meaningful role in assessing diffuse bone marrow disorders such as hematological malignancies and myeloproliferative abnormalities. Semi-quantification studies of global bone marrow activity in such an application will be a vital means in accurately assessing the systematic nature and global burden of such benign hematological disorders such a polycythemia. Accordingly, the derived metabolic data projects to be a useful tool in the prospective clinical and scientific aspects of the diagnosis of these benign hematological disorders and the assessment of disease progression in light of relevant biological treatments. Given the nature of the disease and the enumerated capabilities of (18)F-FDG PET it is expected that one would be able to capture the systematic abnormalities inherent to the disease. Moreover, the handful of case studies supports this possibility. Three case studies have all illustrated diffuse elevated (18)F-FDG uptake throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton that reflects the hyper-metabolic red bone marrow as related to polycythemia. Moreover, the use of various functional imaging tracers, in addition to (18)F-FDG, may indirectly reflect hypermetabolism in red bone marrow through abnormal tracer accumulation in the skeletons of patients. The whole body (18)F-FDG scan of a JAK2+ PV patient before treatment (a) as compared to a matched subject (b) is found below; of note is the PV patient's elevated uptake in the pelvis, femur and spine.",,"['Ayubcha, Cyrus', 'Hosoya, Hitomi', 'Seraj, Siavash M', 'Zadeh, Mahdi Z', 'Werner, Thomas', 'Alavi, Abass']","['Ayubcha C', 'Hosoya H', 'Seraj SM', 'Zadeh MZ', 'Werner T', 'Alavi A']","['Department of Radiology, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, PA, USA. abass.alavi@uphs.upenn.edu.']",,['eng'],['Editorial'],20190307,Greece,Hell J Nucl Med,Hellenic journal of nuclear medicine,101257471,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",,"['Fluorodeoxyglucose F18', 'Humans', 'Polycythemia/*diagnostic imaging', '*Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiopharmaceuticals']",,,2019/03/08 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['s002449910951 [pii]', '10.1967/s002449910951 [doi]']",ppublish,Hell J Nucl Med. 2019 Jan-Apr;22(1):4-5. doi: 10.1967/s002449910951.

CircRNAs are majorly recognized in the transcript formation of eukaryotic genes. Research has also revealed that circRNAs regulate gene expression at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels. Notably, there have been studies demonstrating that they contribute to the improvement of various diseases, including cancer. In this regard, they have potential applications in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. In circRNA studies of blood fluids, plasma circRNAs have been identified as biomarkers in human cancers. For instance, the acute myeloid leukemia-associated hsa_circ_0004277 has been reported to be a biomarker in targeted treatments. This links with circRNAs being highly expressed in hematopoietic tissue; in haematopoiesis, the cell states are controlled by the main regulators and the complex circuits of the RNA family.

TFR failure was defined for the individual patient as either not being eligible for drug discontinuation or as having relapse in the TFR phase with reintroduction of nilotinib treatment. Methods: Using a qualitative approach, out of 25 patients with CML who experienced TFR failure 14 were interviewed. Patients' views and experiences were explored using in-depth interviews, analyzed using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Results: The analysis of the interviews revealed that the experience of the diagnosis seems to have been lived as a traumatic break that has created a dichotomy, like an ambivalence in the ways in which CML patients perceived and experienced the whole disease journey, with contradictory feelings of both positive and negative emotions (e.g., a diagnosis of cancer, that is something distressing and of being afraid of, but also with a treatment and a life expectancies of which being grateful). This ambivalence of feelings was found to give meaning to the way in which patients cognitively and emotionally experienced the different steps of their disease history. Thus, four main issues, corresponding to different steps of the patients' journey, were identified: (1) the moment of the diagnosis, (2) the experience of the illness journey: disease and treatment, (3) the moment of ""TFR failure,"" and (4) the impact of disease, treatment and relapse on the patient's life. Conclusion: This qualitative analysis helps in understanding patients' perspective, both in terms of getting access to the inner subjective experience of having CML and its strict relationship with the involvement in a trial or its cessation. Clinicians should consider that the way in which CML patients feel engaged in a clinical trial, create expectancies about TFR or experience the TFR failure is linked to the process of coping with the diagnosis, which is characterized by ambivalence.",,"['Borghi, Lidia', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Capochiani, Enrico', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Minotto, Claudia', 'Orlandi, Ester Maria', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Sica, Simona', 'Supekar, Sharon', 'Haenig, Jens', 'Vegni, Elena']","['Borghi L', 'Galimberti S', 'Barate C', 'Bonifacio M', 'Capochiani E', 'Cuneo A', 'Falzetti F', 'Iurlo A', 'Lunghi F', 'Minotto C', 'Orlandi EM', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Sica S', 'Supekar S', 'Haenig J', 'Vegni E']","['Department of Health Sciences, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology, Azienda Toscana Nord Ovest, Livorno, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.', ""Hematology Division, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'UOS Hematology, UOC Oncologiaed Ematologia Oncologica AULSS3, Mestre, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, ""San Luigi Gonzaga"" University Hospital, Orbassano, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli - IRCSS, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Oncology Region Europe, Novartis Farma SpA, Origgio, Italy.', 'Oncology Region Europe, Novartis Farma SpA, Origgio, Italy.', 'Department of Health Sciences, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190220,Switzerland,Front Psychol,Frontiers in psychology,101550902,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['ENESTPath', 'TFR', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'inner emotional experience', 'nilotinib', 'psycho-emotional outcomes']",2019/03/08 06:00,2019/03/08 06:01,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/08 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00329 [doi]'],epublish,Front Psychol. 2019 Feb 20;10:329. doi: 10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00329. eCollection 2019.,PMC6391340,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we analyzed 250 BCP-ALL cases and identified a novel subgroup ('PAX5-plus', n = 19) by distinct DNA methylation and gene expression profiles. All patients in this subgroup harbored mutations in the B-lineage transcription factor PAX5, with p.P80R as hotspot. Mutations either affected two independent codons, consistent with compound heterozygosity, or suffered LOH predominantly through chromosome 9p aberrations. These biallelic events resulted in disruption of PAX5 transcriptional programs regulating B-cell differentiation and tumor suppressor functions. Homozygous CDKN2A/B deletions and RAS-activating hotspot mutations were highly enriched as cooperating events in the genomic profile of PAX5-plus ALL. Together, this defined a specific pattern of triple alterations, exclusive to the novel subgroup. PAX5-plus ALL was observed in pediatric and adult patients. Although restricted by the limited sample size, a tendency for more favorable clinical outcome was observed, with 10 of 12 adult PAX5-plus patients achieving long-term survival. PAX5-plus represents the first BCP-ALL subgroup defined by sequence alterations in contrast to gross chromosomal events and exemplifies how deregulated differentiation (PAX5), impaired cell cycle control (CDKN2A/B) and sustained proliferative signaling (RAS) cooperatively drive leukemogenesis.",,"['Bastian, Lorenz', 'Schroeder, Michael P', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Schlee, Cornelia', 'Tanchez, Jutta Ortiz', 'Kampf, Sebastian', 'Wagner, Dimitrios L', 'Schulze, Veronika', 'Isaakidis, Konstandina', 'Lazaro-Navarro, Juan', 'Hanzelmann, Sonja', 'James, Alva Rani', 'Ekici, Arif', 'Burmeister, Thomas', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Vosberg, Sebastian', 'Krebs, Stefan', 'Blum, Helmut', 'Hecht, Jochen', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Rieger, Michael A', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Gokbuget, Nicola', 'Neumann, Martin', 'Baldus, Claudia D']","['Bastian L', 'Schroeder MP', 'Eckert C', 'Schlee C', 'Tanchez JO', 'Kampf S', 'Wagner DL', 'Schulze V', 'Isaakidis K', 'Lazaro-Navarro J', 'Hanzelmann S', 'James AR', 'Ekici A', 'Burmeister T', 'Schwartz S', 'Schrappe M', 'Horstmann M', 'Vosberg S', 'Krebs S', 'Blum H', 'Hecht J', 'Greif PA', 'Rieger MA', 'Bruggemann M', 'Gokbuget N', 'Neumann M', 'Baldus CD']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Charite -

However, the disease-driving stem cell population is not fully targeted by TKI therapy in the majority of patients, and leukemic stem cells (LSCs) capable of re-inducing the disease can persist. In TKI-resistant CML, STAT3 inhibition was previously shown to reduce malignant cell survival. Here, we show therapy-resistant cell-extrinsic STAT3 activation in TKI-sensitive CML cells, using cell lines, HoxB8-immortalized murine BM cells, and primary human stem cells. Moreover, we identified JAK1 but not JAK2 as the STAT3-activating kinase by applying JAK1/2 selective inhibitors and genetic inactivation. Employing an IL-6-blocking peptide, we identified IL-6 as a mediator of STAT3 activation. Combined inhibition of Bcr-Abl and JAK1 further reduced CFUs from murine CML BM, human CML MNCs, as well as CD34(+) CML cells, and similarly decreased LT-HSCs in a transgenic CML mouse model. In line with these observations, proliferation of human CML CD34(+) cells was strongly reduced upon combined Bcr-Abl and JAK1 inhibition. Remarkably, the combinatory therapy significantly induced apoptosis even in quiescent LSCs.

HSPC fate is controlled by signals from the bone marrow niche resulting in alteration of the stem cell transcription network. Regnase-1, a member of the CCCH zinc finger protein family possessing RNAse activity, mediates post-transcriptional regulatory activity through degradation of target mRNAs. The precise function of Regnase-1 has been explored in inflammation-related cytokine expression but its function in hematopoiesis has not been elucidated. Here, we show that Regnase-1 regulates self-renewal of HSPCs through modulating the stability of Gata2 and Tal1 mRNA. In addition, we found that dysfunction of Regnase-1 leads to the rapid onset of abnormal hematopoiesis.

We report a case of leptomeningeal disease in CLL with a complete clinical response and clearance of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) after treatment with ibrutinib and intrathecal rituximab. In a comprehensive review of the published literature since 1976, we found 136 cases of CLL with leptomeningeal spread. We found that leptomeningeal disease in patients with CLL responds favorably to treatment in most cases and is associated with longer overall survival than is expected for other cancers. Clearance of CSF is associated with improved survival. Treatment with rituximab and ibrutinib is more frequently associated with complete response compared with older agents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The incidence of leptomeningeal CLL is more common than previously described and can be recognized by attention to certain symptoms and signs. This case presentation and literature review reveals that, in many cases, leptomeningeal lymphomatosis is reversible with the use of rituximab and ibrutinib. The authors show a survival benefit associated with treating to cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) clearance by cytology and compare outcomes with various treatment strategies, focusing on novel agents.

One of the affected factors, U2AF1, is involved in splice site selection, and the most common change, S34F, alters a conserved nucleic acid-binding domain, recognition of the 3' splice site, and alternative splicing of many mRNAs. However, the role that this mutation plays in oncogenesis is still unknown. Here, we uncovered a noncanonical function of U2AF1, showing that it directly binds mature mRNA in the cytoplasm and negatively regulates mRNA translation. This splicing-independent role of U2AF1 is altered by the S34F mutation, and polysome profiling indicates that the mutation affects translation of hundreds of mRNA. One functional consequence is increased synthesis of the secreted chemokine interleukin 8, which contributes to metastasis, inflammation, and cancer progression in mice and humans.",['(c) 2019 Palangat et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Palangat, Murali', 'Anastasakis, Dimitrios G', 'Fei, Dennis Liang', 'Lindblad, Katherine E', 'Bradley, Robert', 'Hourigan, Christopher S', 'Hafner, Markus', 'Larson, Daniel R']","['Palangat M', 'Anastasakis DG', 'Fei DL', 'Lindblad KE', 'Bradley R', 'Hourigan CS', 'Hafner M', 'Larson DR']","['Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Insitute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Computational Biology Program, Public Health Sciences and Biological Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.', 'Laboratory of Myeloid Malignancies, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.', 'Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Insitute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20190306,United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Splicing Factor U2AF)', '0 (U2AF1 protein, human)', '0 (U2AF2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytoplasm/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Splicing Factor U2AF/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*IL8', '*U2AF1', '*myeloid leukemia', '*splicing factor mutations', '*translation regulator']",2019/03/08 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.319590.118 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.319590.118 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2019 May 1;33(9-10):482-497. doi: 10.1101/gad.319590.118.

Herein, the cumulative incidence, risk factors, new conservative therapeutic strategies as hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO), and outcome of symptomatic ON were studied in pediatric patients with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2000 and 2017, 495 children and young adolescents with a diagnosis of ALL were evaluated. All the symptomatic patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect bone vascularization and structure. RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 495 patients presented ON (4.6%). ON was associated with an older age (p<0.0001) and a higher steroid dose (p=0.0013). All the patients underwent standard therapies and HBO was performed in 8 of 23 patients. During the follow-up, 15 patients were stable: 6 were totally asymptomatic, 5 complained of pain during activity, and 4 presented mild function limitation. CONCLUSION: Our data highlight the importance of early diagnosis of ON by screening MRI in asymptomatic patients, in order to start conservative treatment strategies. Moreover, HBO could have beneficial effects on ON patients.","['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Biddeci, Giada', 'Bosco, Gerardo', 'Varotto, Elena', 'Corradin, Marco', 'Geranio, Giulia', 'Tridello, Gloria', 'Pillon, Marta', 'Carraro, Elisa', 'Garetto, Giacomo', 'Assadi, Roya', 'Gigante, Cosimo', 'Putti, Maria Caterina']","['Biddeci G', 'Bosco G', 'Varotto E', 'Corradin M', 'Geranio G', 'Tridello G', 'Pillon M', 'Carraro E', 'Garetto G', 'Assadi R', 'Gigante C', 'Putti MC']","[""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Haemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy gerardo.bosco@unipd.it.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Haemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Pediatric Orthopedic Unit, Orthopedic Surgery Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Haemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University Hospital, Verona, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Haemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Haemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'ATIP Hyperbaric Medical Center, Biomedical Science Department, Padua, Italy.', 'ATIP Hyperbaric Medical Center, Biomedical Science Department, Padua, Italy.', 'Pediatric Orthopedic Unit, Orthopedic Surgery Department, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Pediatric Haemato-Oncology, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.""]",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone and Bones/diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Osteonecrosis/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['MRI', 'Pediatric oncology', 'hematology', 'hyperbaric oxygen therapy', 'orthopedic surgery']",2019/03/08 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['39/3/1259 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13236 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Mar;39(3):1259-1266. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13236.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to investigate the disposition of curcumin in the form of Lipocurc in multiple myeloma (MM)-causing plasma cell lines and B-lymphocytes from healthy individuals and compare the uptake to previously published data for red blood cells (RBCs), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals and PBMCs from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL-cells). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two MM-producing cell lines were studied: RPMI-8266, an IgG lambda cell line, and NCL-H929, an IgA kappa line. The distribution of liposomal curcumin and its metabolism to the major stable metabolite tetrahydrocurcumin (THC) were measured in vitro in the cell lines and B-lymphocytes. The cells were incubated in plasma protein-supplemented media with liposomal curcumin (Lipocurc) for 15 min at 37 degrees C and the levels of curcumin and THC in cells and medium were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Extremely intense uptake was seen in both MM lines compared to that in B-lymphocytes and previously published data in RBCs, PBMCs and CLL cells. The levels of curcumin in RPMI-8266 and NCI-H929 cells were 14,225+/-847 and 12,723+/-500 pg/10(6) cells compared to 19+/-5,587+/-86 and 3,122+/-166 pg/10(6) cells in RBCs, PBMCs and CLL cells, respectively. Conversion of curcumin to THC was greatest in PBMCs, considerably less in CLL cells and minimal or absent in B-lymphocytes and MM cell lines. CONCLUSION: The extremely intense uptake of curcumin (as Lipocurc) in both MM lines further suggests that Lipocurc should be investigated in the treatment of patients with this disease.","['Copyright(c) 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Bolger, Gordon T', 'Licollari, Albert', 'Bagshaw, Richard', 'Tan, Aimin', 'Greil, Richard', 'Vcelar, Brigitta', 'Majeed, Muhammed', 'Sordillo, Peter']","['Bolger GT', 'Licollari A', 'Bagshaw R', 'Tan A', 'Greil R', 'Vcelar B', 'Majeed M', 'Sordillo P']","['Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada psordillo@signpathpharma.com bolger@nucro-technics.com.', 'Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada.', 'Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada.', 'Nucro-Technics, Scarborough, ON, Canada.', 'Third Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Oncologic Center Salzburg Cancer Research, Paracelsus Medical University, Institute, Cancer Cluster, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Polymun Scientific Immunbiologische Forschung GmbH, Klosterneuburg, Austria.', 'Sabinsa Corporation, East Windsor, NJ, U.S.A.', 'SignPath Pharma Inc., New York, NY, U.S.A. psordillo@signpathpharma.com bolger@nucro-technics.com.']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/*administration & dosage', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Liposomes', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['B-lymphocytes', 'Curcumin', 'distribution', 'metabolism', 'peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'tetrahydrocurcumin']",2019/03/08 06:00,2019/03/12 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/12 06:00 [medline]']","['39/3/1161 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.13225 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2019 Mar;39(3):1161-1168. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.13225.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the clinical use of adoptive therapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-redirected T cells in lymphoblastic leukemia, treatment failure due to epitope loss occurs. Targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) may thus improve the outcome of CAR-T cell therapies. CARs developed to simultaneously target multiple targets are limited by the large size of each single-chain variable fragment and compromised protein folding when several single chains are linearly assembled. Here, we describe single-domain antibody mimics that function within CAR parameters but form a very compact structure. We show that antibody mimics targeting EGFR and HER2 of the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family can be assembled into receptor molecules, which we call antibody mimic receptors (amR).

The phase 3 RESONATE trial, which compared single-agent ibrutinib to ofatumumab in high-risk, relapsed patients with CLL, provided support for approval of ibrutinib in the United States and Europe. We describe long-term follow-up of patients treated in RESONATE, where continued superiority of progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.133; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.099-0.178) was observed. Overall survival benefit continues (HR, 0.591; 95% CI, 0.378-0.926), although with decreased magnitude relative to that seen before crossover to ibrutinib was implemented for patients on ofatumumab (HR, 0.426; 95% CI, 0.220-0.823). Notably, overall response to ibrutinib increased over time, with 91% of patients attaining a response. The PFS benefit with ibrutinib was independent of baseline risk factors, although patients with >/=2 prior therapies had shorter PFS than those with <2 prior therapies, and the presence of TP53 or SF3B1 mutations showed a trend toward shorter PFS vs without these factors. Median duration of ibrutinib was 41 months, with 46% remaining on treatment at a median follow-up of 44 months.

Several factors have contributed to this discrepant outcome. First, patients with T-cell ALL are generally older than those with B-cell ALL and, therefore, have poorer tolerance to chemotherapy, especially dexamethasone and asparaginase, and have increased risk of extramedullary relapse. Second, a higher proportion of patients with B-cell ALL have favourable genetic subtypes (eg, ETV6-RUNX1 and high hyperdiploidy), which confer a superior outcome compared with favourable subtypes of T-cell ALL. Third, T-cell ALL blasts are generally more resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs than are B-cell ALL blasts. Finally, patients with B-cell ALL are more amendable to available targeted therapies, such as Philadelphia chromosome-positive and some Philadelphia chromosome-like ALL cases to ABL-class tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and CD19-positive and CD22-postive B-cell ALL cases to a variety of immunotherapies. Several novel treatments under investigation might narrow the gap in survival between T-cell ALL and B-cell ALL, although novel treatment options for T-cell ALL are limited.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Macrophages play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. In this study, we discovered an interesting phenomenon: ALV-J replication is weakened from 3 hours post-infection (hpi) to 36 hpi, which was verified using Western blotting and RT-PCR. To further investigate the interaction between ALV-J and macrophages, transcriptome analysis was performed to analyze the host genes' function in chicken primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Compared to the uninfected control, 624 up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEG) and 341 down-regulated DEG at 3 hpi, and 174 up-regulated DEG and 87 down-regulated DEG at 36 hpi were identified in chicken MDM, respectively. ALV-J infection induced strong innate immune responses in chicken MDM at 3 hpi, instead of 36 hpi, according to the analysis results of Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway. Importantly, the host factors, such as up-regulated MIP-3alpha, IL-1beta, iNOS, K60, IRG1, CH25H, NFKBIZ, lysozyme and OASL were involved in the host defense response during the course of ALV-J infection. On the contrary, up-regulated EX-FABP, IL4I1, COX-2, NFKBIA, TNFAIP3 and the Jak STAT pathway inhibitors including CISH, SOCS1 and SOCS3 are beneficial to ALV-J survival in chicken macrophages. We speculated that ALV-J tropism for macrophages helps to establish a latent infection in chicken MDM from 6 to 36 hpi. The present study provides a comprehensive view of the interactions between macrophages and ALV-J. It suggests the mechanisms of defense of chicken macrophages against ALV-J invasion and how ALV-J escape the host innate immune responses.",,"['Feng, Min', 'Xie, Tingting', 'Li, Yuanfang', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Lu, Qiuyuan', 'Zhou, Yaohong', 'Shi, Meiqing', 'Sun, Jingchen', 'Zhang, Xiquan']","['Feng M', 'Xie T', 'Li Y', 'Zhang N', 'Lu Q', 'Zhou Y', 'Shi M', 'Sun J', 'Zhang X']","['Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Division of Immunology, Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China. cyfz@scau.edu.cn.', 'Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Agro-animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, China. xqzhang@scau.edu.cn.', 'Key Lab of Chicken Genetics, Breeding and Reproduction, Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. xqzhang@scau.edu.cn.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190306,England,Vet Res,Veterinary research,9309551,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*immunology/virology', '*Avian Leukosis Virus/immunology/physiology', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Chickens/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/veterinary', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Macrophages/*virology', 'Male', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/veterinary', 'Virus Replication']",,,2019/03/08 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13567-019-0638-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13567-019-0638-y [pii]']",epublish,Vet Res. 2019 Mar 6;50(1):20. doi: 10.1186/s13567-019-0638-y.,PMC6404279,,"['31571269/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '31801030/National Natural Science Foundation Youth Fund of China', 'CARS-41-G03/China Agriculture Research System']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

While PTEN mutations and deletions are rare in B-ALL, promoter hypermethylation and posttranslational modifications are the main pathways of PTEN inactivation. Casein Kinase II (CK2) is often upregulated in B-ALL and phosphorylates both PTEN and DNA methyltransferase 3A, resulting in increased PI3K/AKT signaling and offering a potential mechanism for further regulation of tumor-related pathways. METHODS: Here, we evaluated the effects of CK2 inhibitor CX-4945 alone and in combination with hypomethylating agent decitabine on B-ALL proliferation and PI3K/AKT pathway activation. We further investigated if CX-4945 intensified decitabine-induced hypomethylation and identified aberrantly methylated biological processes after CK2 inhibition. In vivo tumor cell proliferation in cell line and patient derived xenografts was assessed by longitudinal full body bioluminescence imaging and peripheral blood flow cytometry of NSG mice. RESULTS: CX-4945 incubation resulted in CK2 inhibition and PI3K pathway downregulation thereby inducing apoptosis and anti-proliferative effects. CX-4945 further affected methylation patterns of tumor-related transcription factors and regulators of cellular metabolism. No overlap with decitabine-affected genes or processes was detected. Decitabine alone revealed only modest anti-proliferative effects on B-ALL cell lines, however, if combined with CX-4945 a synergistic inhibition was observed. In vivo assessment of CX-4945 in B-ALL cell line xenografts resulted in delayed proliferation of B-ALL cells. Combination with DEC further decelerated B-ALL expansion significantly and decreased infiltration in bone marrow and spleen.

To date, 92 different mutations of KMT2A have been curated in the human gene mutation database (HGMD), resulting in Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WDSTS) and intellectual disability (ID)/developmental delay (DD). CASE PRESENTATION: In this report, we present a de novo heterozygous deletion mutation [c.74delG; p. (Gly26Alafs*2)] in the KMT2A gene, which was identified by trio-based whole exome sequencing from a 5.5-year-old boy with ID/DD, stereotypic hand movements and blood eosinophilia. Many deleterious germline mutations of KMT2A have been documented to affect development of central nervous system, oral and craniofacial tissues, but not blood eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a rare case with ID/DD as well as eosinophilia, resulting from a previously undescribed null mutation of KMT2A. Our findings expand the phenotypical spectrum in affected individuals with KMT2A mutations, and may shed some insight into the role of KMT2A in eosinophil metabolism.",,"['Zhang, Haixia', 'Xiang, Bingwu', 'Chen, Hui', 'Chen, Xiang', 'Cai, Tao']","['Zhang H', 'Xiang B', 'Chen H', 'Chen X', 'Cai T']","['Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410002, Hunan, China.', 'Experimental Medicine Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA.', ""Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China."", 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China.', ""Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China."", 'Experimental Medicine Section, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, 20892, USA. tcai@nih.gov.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2877-8637'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190306,England,BMC Med Genet,BMC medical genetics,100968552,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,"['Child', 'Developmental Disabilities/*genetics', 'Eosinophilia/*genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics', 'Loss of Function Mutation', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Pedigree', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Whole Exome Sequencing']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Case report', '*Eosinophilia', '*Intellectual disability', '*KMT2A mutation', '*Whole exome sequencing']",2019/03/08 06:00,2019/08/21 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2018/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12881-019-0776-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12881-019-0776-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Genet. 2019 Mar 6;20(1):38. doi: 10.1186/s12881-019-0776-0.,PMC6402113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An electronic literature search of PubMed (January 1958 to January 2019) was conducted in PubMed using the MESH terms hairy cell leukemia, hairy cell leukemia variant, cladribine, pentostatin, rituximab, interferon, vemurafenib, moxetumomab pasudotox. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Studies written in the English language were considered for this article. The significance of each article was determined by authors independently. Data Synthesis: HCL and HCLv are rare B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders, each with distinct biologies. Symptoms are characterized by pancytopenia and splenomegaly. Initial treatments for HCL were suboptimal, leading to minimal and transient remissions. PAs significantly improved outcomes, inducing remission in most patients. However, those with purine-resistant disease were left with a dearth of options, leading to implementation of vemurafenib for BRAF V600 mutated disease and chemoimmunotherapy with rituximab. Despite these advances, some HCL and a majority of HCLv patients experience relapse. Newer targeted agents offer promise for relapsed and refractory patients, including the recently approved MPT. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: This review provides a comprehensive update on the pharmacological management of HCL and HCLv for clinicians who encounter patients with this rare disease. Conclusion: HCL and HCLv are uncommon lymphoid neoplasms that lead to a characteristic constellation of symptoms. The emergence of PAs and novel targeted agents have improved the likelihood and durability of responses for these patients.",,"['King, Amber C', 'Kabel, Charlene C', 'Pappacena, Jeremy J', 'Stump, Sarah E', 'Daley, Ryan J']","['King AC', 'Kabel CC', 'Pappacena JJ', 'Stump SE', 'Daley RJ']","['1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', '1 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190306,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",['NOTNLM'],"['*hairy cell', '*hematology', '*leukemia', '*lymphoid malignancies', '*moxetumomab', '*oncology']",2019/03/08 06:00,2020/04/15 06:00,['2019/03/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1060028019836775 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 2019 Sep;53(9):922-932. doi: 10.1177/1060028019836775.

On the cellular level, this highly mutual interaction is granted by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) integrating differentiation, proliferation, and pro-survival signals from the surrounding microenvironment to the inner cell. However, cell(-)cell and cell(-)matrix interactions are also critically involved during malignant transformation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. It has become increasingly apparent that leukemia-associated gene products, such as activated tyrosine kinases and fusion proteins resulting from chromosomal translocations, directly regulate the activation status of adhesion molecules, thereby directing the leukemic phenotype. These observations imply that interference with adhesion molecule function represents a promising treatment strategy to target pre-leukemic and leukemic lesions within the bone marrow niche. Focusing on myeloid leukemia, we provide a current overview of the mechanisms by which leukemogenic gene products hijack control of cellular adhesion to subsequently disturb normal hematopoiesis and promote leukemia development.",,"['Windisch, Roland', 'Pirschtat, Nina', 'Kellner, Christian', 'Chen-Wichmann, Linping', 'Lausen, Jorn', 'Humpe, Andreas', 'Krause, Daniela S', 'Wichmann, Christian']","['Windisch R', 'Pirschtat N', 'Kellner C', 'Chen-Wichmann L', 'Lausen J', 'Humpe A', 'Krause DS', 'Wichmann C']","['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, University Hospital, LMU Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.

To date, the role of TEL-MN1 fusion in leukemogenic process and drug resistance is still largely unknown. METHODS: In the present study, the TEL-MN1 fusion was transfected into HL-60 cells to upregulate TEL-MN1 expression via a retroviral vector. MTT assay was employed to examine cell viability and flow cytometry was performed to evaluate cell apoptosis. Idarubicin was used to treat HL-60 cells for estimating the effect of TEL-MN1 fusion on the chemotherapy resistance. RESULTS: The results showed that overexpression of TEL-MN1 in HL-60 cells could promote cell proliferation, suggesting that TEL-MN1 may be involved in the leukemogenesis process. HL-60 cells treated with idarubicin showed a weakened cell viability, whereas TEL-MN1 overexpression attenuated the idarubicin-induced inhibition of cell viability and acceleration of cell apoptosis of HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results indicated that TEL-MN1 fusion is an oncogene involved in the leukemogenesis process and TEL-MN1 overexpression enhanced resistance of HL-60 cells to idarubicin, which may provide a useful tool for studying the mechanism of leukemogenesis and drug resistance.","['(c) 2019 S.

MS develops as part of acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasm, or myelodysplastic syndrome or at relapse, especially following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. The tumor displays high myeloperoxidase expression, hence the color green, and is called chloroma.

In this study, the clinical achievable concentration of 7-hydroxystaurosporine synergized with all-trans retinoic acid to induce terminal differentiation in all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia cell lines. Though 7-hydroxystaurosporine is a PKC inhibitor, PKC might not be involved in the combination-induced differentiation since other PKC selective inhibitors, Go 6976 and rottlerin failed to cooperate with all-trans retinoic acid to trigger differentiation. The combination significantly enhanced the protein level of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta and/or PU.1 as well as activated MEK/ERK. U0126 (MEK specific inhibitor) not only suppressed the combination-induced differentiation but also restored the protein level of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta and/or PU.1. However, RAF-1 inhibitor had no inhibitory effect on MEK activation and the combination-induced differentiation. Therefore, the combination overcame differentiation block via RAF-1 independent MEK/ERK modulation of the protein level of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta and/or PU.1. These findings may provide a preclinical rationale for the potential role of this combination in the treatment of all-trans retinoic acid resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia patients.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

It is characterized by genetic and epigenetic aberrations. The most remarkable mechanisms involved in epigenetic abnormalities are DNA methylation and acetylation. Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions and acetylation of lysine residues regulate gene expression. Several studies have shown that patients with B-ALL show aberrant DNA methylation in a genome-wide scale. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) adds acetyl groups. A hematologic malignancy like B-ALL may be very sensitive to small-molecule inhibitors that target these epigenetic mechanisms and therefore may induce expression of pro-apoptotic factors. Thus, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi) have been developed as therapies. The objective of this review is to summarize the different epigenetic mechanisms involved in B-ALL.",['Copyright(c) by the Association of Genetic Technologists.'],"['Helmer, Jordan A', 'Iraburu, Rocio', 'Tirado, Carlos A']","['Helmer JA', 'Iraburu R', 'Tirado CA']","['The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Minnesota Chapter, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Hospital Pathology Associates (HPA), Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Navarra Chapter, Pamplona, Spain.', 'University of Navarra School of Medicine, Pamplona, Spain.', 'The International Circle of Genetic Studies, Minnesota Chapter, Minneapolis, MN.', 'Allina Health, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'Hospital Pathology Associates (HPA), Minneapolis, MN, USA.', 'University of Minnesota School of Medicine, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Assoc Genet Technol,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,9807282,,,,,,2019/03/07 06:00,2019/03/07 06:01,['2019/03/07 06:00'],"['2019/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Genet Technol. 2019;45(1):10-13.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. The present study aimed at investigating the expression pattern and biological function of miR-592 in AML and to elucidate the mechanism involved. PATIENTS AND METHODS: qRT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of miR-592 in bone marrow and serum obtained from AML patients and healthy controls. The associations between serum miR-592 expression and clinical features and prognosis of AML patients were statistically analyzed. Then we detected the effect of miR-592 on proliferation, metastasis and apoptosis by CCK-8 assay, Transwell assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to validate the regulation of a putative target of miR-592. Rescue experiments were performed to confirm whether ROCK1 was a direct and functional target of miR-592 in AML. RESULTS: We found that the expression level of miR-592 was significantly lower in AML patients and AML cell lines. Low expression of serum miR-592 was associated with advanced French-American-British classification, cytogenetics and poor prognosis. Multivariate analysis confirmed that serum miR-592 expression was an independent prognostic factor for AML patients. Functionally, overexpression of miR-592 suppressed AML cell growth and metastasis, and promoted apoptosis. Further mechanistic investigation showed ROCK1 was a direct target gene of miR-592. Finally, ROCK1 overexpression rescued the effect of miR-592-mediated AML cell proliferation and metastasis.

However, effective therapeutics for ccRCC are lacking. Novel biomarkers could provide critical information when determining prognoses for patients with ccRCC. In this study, we sought to determine if the expression of receptor tyrosine kinase (TEK) could be a potential novel prognostic biomarker for ccRCC. TEK, originally identified as an endothelial cell-specific receptor, plays an important role in the modulation of vasculogenesis and remodeling. Altered TEK expression has been observed in tumor tissues (e.g., oral squamous cell carcinomas, leukemia) and breast, gastric and thyroid cancers. However, the role of TEK in ccRCC remains unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Differential TEK expression between non-metastatic (stage M0) and metastatic (stage M1) ccRCC patient cohorts was determined from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). Furthermore, TEK expression was assessed as a prognostic factor using the time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) of Uno's C-index, the AUC value of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) at 5 years, Kaplan-Meier survival curves and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A Kaplan-Meier curve analysis revealed that the downregulation of TEK expression was associated with a poor prognosis for patients with ccRCC with good discrimination (p<0.0001 and p=0.0044 for the TGCA and ICGC cohorts, respectively). Analyses of C-indices and receiver operating characteristic AUC values further support this discriminative ability. Moreover, multivariate analyses showed the prognostic significance of TEK expression levels (p<0.001).

RESULTS: Probabilities of disease-free survival, overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse at 10 years were comparable: 79 +/- 2%, 86 +/- 2% and 17.4 +/- 2.1% (ASP-5000) vs. 75 +/- 2% and 82 +/- 2%, and 17.9 +/- 2.0% (ASP-10000), while death in complete remission was significantly lower in arm ASP-5000 (2.7% vs. 6.5%; p = 0.029). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that weekly 5000 U/m(2)E. coli-ASP IM during consolidation therapy are equally effective, more cost-efficient and less toxic than 10000 U/m(2) for SR patients with childhood ALL.",,"['Karachunskiy, Alexander', 'Tallen, Gesche', 'Roumiantseva, Julia', 'Lagoiko, Svetlana', 'Chervova, Almira', 'von Stackelberg, Arend', 'Aleinikova, Olga', 'Bydanov, Oleg', 'Bajdun,

Multicolor flow cytometry (MFC) provides the opportunity to detect low numbers of leukemia cells undetectable by CM. The present study aimed at evaluating the clinical significance of MFC for the diagnosis of CNS involvement at initial manifestation of childhood ALL. METHODS: In 155 children with ALL, CSF samples were studied in parallel by CM and MFC. Patients were treated according to protocol ALL-MB-2008 for childhood ALL. The prognostic impact of the leukemia burden in CSF was determined categorizing the findings as positive/negative. In addition, the absolute blast cell count per 1 ml of CSF was studied as a continuous variable. RESULTS: CSF positivity was significantly more frequent using MFC compared with CM (35.3% vs. 15.3% of patients). The outcome of MFC-positive and MFC-negative patients was not different in clinically relevant patient risk groups-CNS1, standard and intermediate-risk groups. Using the quantitative approach, at the threshold level of 20 blasts per ml of CSF, patients could be divided into two groups with a significantly different outcome, irrespective of the clinical risk group, the type of CNS-directed therapy, and the CNS status determined by CM. CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support the concept of re-stratification and modification of therapy based on qualitative CSF investigation by MFC. However, MFC is a highly sensitive technique of CSF investigation improving the definition of CNS involvement in childhood ALL, and quantitative measurement of blast cells in CSF, if well-organized, can be a useful additional tool for stratification of patients in clinical trials.",,"['Popov, Alexander', 'Henze, Guenter', 'Verzhbitskaya, Tatiana', 'Roumiantseva, Julia', 'Lagoyko, Svetlana', 'Khlebnikova, Olga', 'Streneva, Olga', 'Bidanov, Oleg', 'Tsaur, Grigory', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Karachunskiy, Alexander', 'Fechina, Larisa']","['Popov A', 'Henze G', 'Verzhbitskaya T', 'Roumiantseva J', 'Lagoyko S', 'Khlebnikova O', 'Streneva O', 'Bidanov O', 'Tsaur G', 'Inaba H', 'Karachunskiy A', 'Fechina L']","['Head of Flow Cytometry Laboratory, National Research Center of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, 1, S.

Little international and no national data is available comparing noble metal coated versus uncoated central venous catheters (CVC) in this special population of severely immunocompromised patients. Objective of the study is to compare infectious and non-infectious complications of noble metal coated versus uncoated central venous catheters in patients undergoing stem cell transplantation and receiving chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. Methods: This is a prospective, cross-sectional, randomized study (January to December 2016), enrolling 45 consecutive patients undergoing stem cell transplantation or chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. Patients were randomized in 2 groups. Twenty 23 patients received standard CVC and 22 patients received CVC catheters coated with three noble metals (Gold, Silver, Palladium). Patients were observed for catheter related infectious and noninfectious complications. Data was analysed using SPSS. Results: Mean age was 24.3 (+/-4.91) in uncoated and 25.09 (+/-5.22) in coated CVL group. CRBSI infection was detected in 2 (8.6%) and 3 (13.6%) patients in uncoated and coated group respectively with p-value of .279. There was no statistically significant difference in febrile episodes between coated (95.4%) and uncoated (91.3%) group. While we considered non-infectious complications, 2 patients in coated (8.6%) and 1 in uncoated CVCs group (4.3%) had CVC thrombosis which was not significant statistically.

Both studied compounds exerted comparable cytotoxic activities towards sensitive HL60 cells and their MDR counterparts. It was also found that GA and EA modulated the cellular level of reactive oxygen species in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that GA (IC90 ) and EA (IC50 and IC90 ) significantly increased the percentage of sub-G1 subpopulation of all studied leukaemia cells causing oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Both compounds used at IC90 triggered mainly the apoptotic death of these cells. However, GA had no effect on the activity of caspase-3 as well as caspase-8 in sensitive HL60 cells and their MDR counterparts. In contrast, EA provoked a significant activation of these caspases in all studied leukaemia cells.

We investigated parental employment in painting and printing industries and risk of childhood leukemia, central nervous system (CNS) cancers, and prenatal cancers (acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Wilms tumor, medulloblastoma, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, and hepatoblastoma). Methods Using Danish registries, children aged </=19 years diagnosed from 1968-2015 with leukemia (N=1999), CNS cancers (N=1111) or prenatal cancers (N=2704) were linked to parents and their employment history one year before birth to birth for fathers, and one year before birth to one year after for mothers. Twenty randomly selected controls per case were matched by age and sex. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results For fathers, we found increased risks for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) consistent in painting (OR 2.26, 95% CI 1.07-4.80) and printing industries (OR 2.43, 95% CI 0.94-6.23) and these industries combined (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.14-3.87). For mothers, increased risks of CNS cancers were found for painting industries (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.10-4.95) and painting and printing combined (OR 1.97, 95% CI 1.08-3.64). For fathers working in combined industries, the OR for CNS was increased (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.02-2.31), most prominently in printing industries (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.17-3.75). Conclusion We observed increased risks of CNS tumors in offspring after parental employment in painting and printing industries.

MXD3 has been shown to be overexpressed and to be required for medulloblastoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell proliferation. In this study we leveraged datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas to examine MXD3 across several cancers. We find that MXD3 transcripts are significantly overexpressed in ~72% of the available datasets. The gene itself is not frequently altered, while the promoter appears to be hypomethylated. We examine the possibility that aberrant regulation of the MXD3 message is the cause of abnormal MXD3 expression across cancers. Specifically, we looked at MXD3 alternative splicing in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and find notable functional differences between the splice variants. The 3'UTR confers differential message stability. Furthermore, the different coding sequences lead to different protein stabilities and localizations. Altogether, these data extend our knowledge of MXD3 in the context of human cancers while characterizing a previously unstudied splice variant of MXD3.",,"['Ngo, Tin', 'Corrales, Abraham', 'Bourne, Traci', 'Elmojahid, Samir', 'Lam, Kit S', 'Diaz, Elva']","['Ngo T', 'Corrales A', 'Bourne T', 'Elmojahid S', 'Lam KS', 'Diaz E']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Davis, CA, United States.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190219,Switzerland,Front Mol Biosci,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,101653173,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MXD3', 'MYC/MAX/MXD network', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)', 'alternative splicing', 'glioblastoma']",2019/03/07 06:00,2019/03/07 06:01,['2019/03/07 06:00'],"['2018/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmolb.2019.00005 [doi]'],epublish,Front Mol Biosci. 2019 Feb 19;6:5. doi: 10.3389/fmolb.2019.00005. eCollection 2019.,PMC6390498,,"['DP2 OD006479/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA093373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately, survival rates exceed 90%, however, infectious complications remain a significant issue that can cause reductions in the quality of life and prognosis of patients. Recently, numerous studies have linked shifts in the gut microbiome composition to infection events in various hematological malignances including acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). These studies have been limited to observing broad taxonomic changes using 16S rRNA gene profiling, while missing possible differences within microbial functions encoded by individual species. In this study we present the first combined 16S rRNA gene and metagenomic shotgun sequencing study on the gut microbiome of an independent pediatric ALL cohort during treatment. In this study we found distinctive differences in alpha diversity and beta diversity in samples from patients with infectious complications in the first 6 months of therapy. We were also able to find specific species and functional pathways that were significantly different in relative abundance between samples that came from patients with infectious complications. Finally, machine learning models based on patient metadata and bacterial species were able to classify samples with high accuracy (84.09%), with bacterial species being the most important classifying features.

These trials resulted in rapid FDA approvals of anti-CD19 CAR T cell products for both ALL and certain types of B cell lymphoma - the first approved gene therapies in the USA. However, growing experience with these agents has revealed that remissions will be brief in a substantial number of patients owing to poor CAR T cell persistence and/or cancer cell resistance resulting from antigen loss or modulation. Furthermore, the initial experience with CAR T cells has highlighted challenges associated with manufacturing a patient-specific therapy. Understanding the limitations of CAR T cell therapy will be critical to realizing the full potential of this novel treatment approach. Herein, we discuss the factors that can preclude durable remissions following CAR T cell therapy, with a primary focus on the resistance mechanisms that underlie disease relapse.

Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1), which is activated by DNA damage and replication stress, diminishes sensitivity to cytarabine and anthracyclines as single agents, suggesting that CHK1 inhibitors might increase the effectiveness of CPX-351. The present studies show that CPX-351 activates CHK1 as well as the S and G2/M cell cycle checkpoints. Conversely, CHK1 inhibition diminishes the cell cycle effects of CPX-351. Moreover, CHK1 knockdown or addition of a CHK1 inhibitor such as MK-8776, rabusertib or prexasertib enhances CPX-351-induced apoptosis in multiple TP53-null and TP53-wildtype AML cell lines. Likewise, CHK1 inhibition increases the antiproliferative effect of CPX-351 on primary AML specimens ex vivo, offering the possibility that CPX-351 may be well suited to combine with CHK1-targeted agents.",,"['Vincelette, Nicole D', 'Ding, Husheng', 'Huehls, Amelia M', 'Flatten, Karen S', 'Kelly, Rebecca L', 'Kohorst, Mira A', 'Webster, Jonathan', 'Hess, Allan D', 'Pratz, Keith W', 'Karnitz, Larry M', 'Kaufmann, Scott H']","['Vincelette ND', 'Ding H', 'Huehls AM', 'Flatten KS', 'Kelly RL', 'Kohorst MA', 'Webster J', 'Hess AD', 'Pratz KW', 'Karnitz LM', 'Kaufmann SH']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is developed in HTLV-1-infected T-cells after a long infection period. To examine the mechanism of CADM1 overexpression in ATLL, we first identified that CADM1 is transcriptionally up-regulated by a transcriptional enhancer element through NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In HTLV-1-infected T-cells, CADM1 expression is dependent on HTLV-1/Tax through activation of canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB; however, in ATLL cells with frequent loss of Tax expression, the activation of canonical NF-kappaB only enhances the CADM1 expression. Along with active mutations in signaling molecules under T-cell recepor (TCR) signaling, degradation of p47, a negative regulator of NF-kappaB, was essential for activation of canonical NF-kappaB through stabilization of NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator). The mechanism of p47 degradation is primarily dependent on activation of lysosomal-autophagy and the autophagy is activated in most of the HTLV-infected and ATLL cells, suggesting that the p47 degradation may be a first key molecular event during HTLV-1 infection to T-cells as a connector of two important signaling pathways, NF-kappaB and autophagy.",,"['Sarkar, Bidhan', 'Nishikata, Ichiro', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Ichikawa, Tomonaga', 'Shiraga, Toshiyuki', 'Saha, Hasi Rani', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Sarkar B', 'Nishikata I', 'Nakahata S', 'Ichikawa T', 'Shiraga T', 'Saha HR', 'Fujii M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Shimoda K', 'Morishita K']","['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Department of Foods and Human Nutrition, Faculty of Human Life Sciences, Notre Dame Seishin University, Okayama, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki, Japan. kmorishi@med.miyazaki-u.ac.jp.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190305,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CADM1 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (p37 protein, human)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",,,2019/03/07 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2019/03/07 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-39424-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-39424-7 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 5;9(1):3491. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-39424-7.,PMC6400899,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: After isolation of ICC, the cells were cultured for 24 hours until the cells were adherent. After identification by inverted microscope and immunofluorescence, ICC cells were divided into two groups: A control group and a high glucose group. The control group was added with a medium containing 5 mmol/L of glucose. The high glucose group was added with a medium containing 20 mmol/L of glucose. After 48 h of continuous cultivation, the high glucose group was divided into 3 subgroups: A blank group, an empty lentivirus group, and an experimental group. The blank group, the empty lentivirus group, and the experimental group were added a medium containing PBS solution, empty lentivirus, and a recombinant lentivirus containing the SCL gene with a glucose concentration of 5 mmol/L, respectively. The cultures were incubated for 24 and 48 h. The expression of c-kit protein in ICC in each group was detected by Western blot. Results: After 24 or 48 h, the expression of c-kit protein in ICC was significantly lower in the blank group and the lentivirus group than that in the control group, and the expression of c-kit protein in ICC was significantly higher in the experimental group than that in the blank group and the empty lentivirus group, but it was still lower than that in the control group (all P<0.05).

Lately, the formation of G-quadruplexes in oncogenic promoters like (WT1) has been widely investigated since stabilization of these structures leads to transcriptional inhibition of the oncogene. Daunorubicin and mitoxantrone considered as crucial components of almost all standard acute myeloid leukemia induction regimens. Herein we have proposed a probable molecular mechanism of action through which the drugs may stabilize (WT1) promoter G-quadruplexes. Differential pulse voltammetry, circular dichroism, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electrophoretic mobility shifts assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) stop assays, and quantitative RT-PCR were performed in order to better understanding the nature of interactions between the drugs and G-quadruplexes. Data revealed that both drugs had potential to stabilize G-quadruplexes and down-regulate WT1 transcription but daunorubicin exposed more silencing impact. The results illustrated the therapeutic association of these two commercial FDA-approved drugs in (WT1) transcriptional down-regulation.

Inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are implicated in a host of myeloid malignancies, providing the rationale for strategies aimed at neutralizing IAPs to lower the cancer cell apoptosis threshold. Modes of IAP antagonism may include down-regulating IAP expression, up-regulating endogenous pro-apoptotic proteins, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha or Fas ligand, or directly antagonizing IAP activity against caspases. Direct targeting of IAPs using mimetics of the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (SMAC) protein has shown therapeutic promise by sensitizing the effect of chemotherapy on malignant cells. In pre-clinical studies, SMAC mimetics have demonstrated broad synergistic activity with a wide range of therapeutics, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, agents targeting death receptors and alternative mechanisms of cell death, such as necroptosis or autophagy and immune check point blockade. SMAC mimetics represent a novel approach for further investigation in patients with high-risk, chemo-refractory blood cancers, as single agents or in thoughtfully selected combinations.

These advances, however, have also introduced new clinical challenges, which include problems of prognostic underdetermination and its attendant risks of over- and undertreatment. Genomic data is generated from different technologies, from cytogenetics to next-generation sequencing, which are often interpreted interchangeably and in a binary fashion-as the presence or absence of a given chromosomal deletion or mutation-an oversimplification which may lead to mistaken prognosis. We discuss the clinical use of one such prognostic marker, represented by sequence and copy number alterations in TP53, located on chromosome 17p. Mutations in TP53 are strongly linked to poor prognosis in a variety of haematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We review studies in CLL which utilize the 17p deletion or TP53 mutations for prognostic stratification with specific focus on the technologies used for detection, the thresholds established for clinical significance, and the clinical contexts in which these alterations are identified. The case of CLL illustrates issues arising from simplistic, binary interpretation of genetic testing and highlights the need to apply a critical lens when incorporating genomics into prognostic models.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Chin-Yee, Benjamin', 'Sadikovic, Bekim', 'Chin-Yee, Ian H']","['Chin-Yee B', 'Sadikovic B', 'Chin-Yee IH']","['Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Western University, London, ON, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0737-3603'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190305,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'Chromosome 17 deletion']",IM,"['Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', '*Databases, Genetic', '*Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'Smith-Magenis Syndrome/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*cytogenetics', '*genomics', '*next-generation sequencing', '*prognostic models']",2019/03/06 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/03/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15827 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2020 Mar;188(5):652-660. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15827.

FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS: The blood count showed thrombocytopenia and marked neutropenia of 0.04G/L. Moreover, laboratory work up demonstrated increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin as well as serum creatinine levels. THERAPY AND COURSE: Broad antiinfective therapy was initiated immediately. During the further course of disease the patient developed signs of acute cholecystitis, which was managed conservatively. Only after repeated specific investigation and after initially denying, the patient reported to have taken 1 g of metamizole as self-medication after her initial accident. All symptoms and laboratory parameters gradually improved and finally completely resolved to normal, and the patient could be released from hospital after seven days.

The individual-who is known as the 'Berlin patient'-underwent two allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) procedures using a donor with a homozygous mutation in the HIV coreceptor CCR5 (CCR5Delta32/Delta32) to treat his acute myeloid leukaemia. Total body irradiation was given with each HSCT. Notably, it is unclear which treatment or patient parameters contributed to this case of long-term HIV remission. Here we show that HIV-1 remission may be possible with a less aggressive and toxic approach. An adult infected with HIV-1 underwent allogeneic HSCT for Hodgkin's lymphoma using cells from a CCR5Delta32/Delta32 donor. He experienced mild gut graft-versus-host disease. Antiretroviral therapy was interrupted 16 months after transplantation. HIV-1 remission has been maintained over a further 18 months. Plasma HIV-1 RNA has been undetectable at less than one copy per millilitre along with undetectable HIV-1 DNA in peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes. Quantitative viral outgrowth assays from peripheral CD4 T lymphocytes show no reactivatable virus using a total of 24 million resting CD4 T cells. CCR5-tropic, but not CXCR4-tropic, viruses were identified in HIV-1 DNA from CD4 T cells of the patient before the transplant. CD4 T cells isolated from peripheral blood after transplantation did not express CCR5 and were susceptible only to CXCR4-tropic virus ex vivo. HIV-1 Gag-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses were lost after transplantation, whereas cytomegalovirus-specific responses were detectable.

Several isoflavonoids and flavonoids are known for their cytotoxicity towards various cancer cells. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of isoflavones: osajin (1), 5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-6,8-diprenylisoflavone (2) and biflavonoids: chamaejasmin (3), 7,7''-di-O-methylchamaejasmin (4) and campylospermone A (5), a dimeric chromene [diphysin(6)] and an ester of ferullic acid with long alkyl chain [erythrinasinate (7)] isolated from the stem bark and roots of the Kenyan medicinal plant, Ormocarpum kirkii. The mode of action of compounds 2 and 4 was further investigated. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of compounds was determined based on the resazurin reduction assay. Caspases activation was evaluated using the caspase-Glo assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the cell cycle (propodium iodide (PI) staining), apoptosis (annexin V/PI staining), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (JC-1) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (H2DCFH-DA). CCRF-CEM leukemia cells were used as model cells for mechanistic studies. RESULTS: Compounds 1, 2 and 4 displayed IC50 values below 20microM towards CCRF-CEM and CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells, and were further tested towards a panel of 7 carcinoma cells. The IC50 values of the compounds against carcinoma cells varied from 16.90microM (in resistant U87MG.DeltaEGFR glioblastoma cells) to 48.67microM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for 1, from 7.85microM (in U87MG.DeltaEGFR cells) to 14.44microM (in resistant MDA-MB231/BCRP breast adenocarcinoma cells) for 2, from 4.96microM (towards U87MG.DeltaEGFRcells) to 7.76microM (against MDA-MB231/BCRP cells) for 4, and from 0.07microM (against MDA-MB231 cells) to 2.15microM (against HepG2 cells) for doxorubicin. Compounds 2 and 4 induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mediated by MMP alteration and increased ROS production. CONCLUSION: The present report indicates that isoflavones and biflavonoids from Ormocarpum kirkii are cytotoxic compounds with the potential of being exploited in cancer chemotherapy. Compounds 2 and 4 deserve further studies to develop new anticancer drugs to fight sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

Genetic mutations in human CRBN lead to intellectual disabilities. In addition, it draws pathological attention because direct binding with immunomodulatory drugs can cure multiple myeloma (MM) and lymphocytic leukemia. To further explore the function of CRBN, we focused on its molecular evolution. Since CRBN interacts directly with its substrates and is widely conserved in vertebrates, evolutionary study to identify the selective pressure on CRBN that occur during CRBN-substrate interaction is an effective approach to search for a novel active site. Using mammalian CRBN sequences, dN/dS analysis was conducted to detect positive selection. By multiple sequence alignment we found that the residue at position 366 was under positive selection. This residue is present in the substrate-binding domain of CRBN. Most mammals harbor cysteine at position 366, whereas rodents and chiroptera have serine at this site. Subsequently, we constructed a C366S human CRBN to confirm the potential of positive selection. Auto-ubiquitination activity occurs in E3 ubiquitin ligases, including CRBN, and increased in C366S CRBN, which lead to the conclusion that E3 ubiquitin ligase activity may have changed over the course of mammalian evolution. Furthermore, binding with AMP-activated protein kinase was augmented when the substitution was present, which is supported by coevolution analysis. These results suggest that the molecular evolution of CRBN occurred through codon-based positive selection, providing a new approach to investigate CRBN function.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The CB2 receptor downregulation has been reported in solid tumors and cardiovascular diseases, therefore the CB2 receptor activation has been considered as a viable strategy for chemotherapy as well as cardioprotection. Doxorubicin (DOX) is an important drug that continues to be the mainstay of chemotherapy in solid tumors, leukemia, and lymphoma. However, the use of DOX is often limited due to its lethal cardiotoxicity. Considering the role of CB2 receptors in cardiovascular diseases and cancer, the activation of CB2 receptors may protect against DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity in rats. In the present study, we investigated the cardioprotective effect of a selective CB2 receptor agonist; beta-Caryophyllene (BCP), a natural bicyclic sesquiterpene, against DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity in rats. AM630, a CB2 receptor antagonist was administered as a pharmacological challenge prior to BCP treatment to demonstrate CB2 receptor mediated cardioprotective mechanism of BCP. DOX (2.5mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once a week for five weeks to induce chronic cardiotoxicity in rats. BCP was also injected into rats six days a week for a total duration of five weeks. DOX induced a significant decline in cardiac function and oxidative stress evidenced by the depletion of antioxidant enzymes, glutathione, and increased lipid peroxidation. DOX also triggered activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and increased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta) and expression of the inflammatory mediators (iNOS and COX-2) in the heart. Furthermore, DOX also upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic markers such as Bax, p53, cleaved PARP, active caspase-3 and downregulated anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 in the myocardium. BCP treatment exerted significant cardioprotective effect by salvaging the heart tissues, improving cardiac function, mitigating oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis. The histological and ultrastructural studies also appear in line with our findings of biochemical and molecular parameters. The CB2 receptor-mediated cardioprotective mechanism was further confirmed by the abrogation of the beneficial effects of BCP with prior administration of the CB2 receptor antagonist; AM630. Our study revealed the novel mechanism of BCP in cardioprotection against DOX-induced chronic cardiotoxicity by the activation of CB2 receptors.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

It has not been defined how an increase in plasma creatinine can be best used as a predictor for severely delayed MTX elimination, thus providing a guide for therapeutic interventions to minimize renal toxicity. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic data were retrospectively collected on 218 Danish children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with HD-MTX 5 or 8 g/m(2) on the NOPHO2000 protocol. Moderately delayed MTX elimination was defined as 42-hour plasma MTX >/= 4.0-9.9 muM, and severely delayed elimination was defined as 42-hour plasma MTX >/= 10 muM. RESULTS: Median 42-hour plasma MTX was 0.61 muM (interquartile range, 0.4-1.06 muM). Of 1295 MTX infusions with 5 g/m(2) (n = 140 patients) or 8 g/m(2) (n = 78 patients), 5.1% were severely (1.5%) or moderately (3.6%) delayed. The risk of having delayed elimination was highest in the first of eight infusions with MTX 5 g/m(2) (7.4% vs 0.0 to 4.1% for subsequent MTX infusions) (P < 0.02). A 25 muM increase or a 1.5-fold increase in plasma creatinine within 36 hours from start of the MTX infusion had a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI, 82%-97%) and a specificity of 85% (95% CI, 83%-87%) for predicting 42-hour MTX >/=4.0 muM. CONCLUSIONS: A 25 muM increase or a 1.5-fold in plasma creatinine within 36 hours after start of an HD-MTX infusion can predict delayed MTX elimination, thus allowing intensification of hydration and alkalization to avoid further renal toxicity and promote the elimination of MTX.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Schmidt, Diana', 'Kristensen, Kim', 'Schroeder, Henrik', 'Wehner, Peder Skov', 'Rosthoj, Steen', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Damsgaard, Linn', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Mikkelsen, Torben Stamm']","['Schmidt D', 'Kristensen K', 'Schroeder H', 'Wehner PS', 'Rosthoj S', 'Heldrup J', 'Damsgaard L', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Mikkelsen TS']","['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Development DMPK, PKPD, Novo Nordisk A/S, Maalov, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, H.C.

However, underlying mechanisms to induce the dysfunction of BM MSCs have not yet been clarified. We previously showed that AML cells release abundant exosomal miR-7977, which, in turn, enters BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs). However, the precise function of miR-7977 is not known. In this study, we performed transduction of a miR-7977 mimic into MSCs, compared transcriptomes between control-transduced (n = 3) and miR-7977-transduced MSCs (n = 3), and conducted pathway analysis. The array data revealed that the expression of 0.05% of genes was reduced 2-fold and the expression of 0.01% of genes was increased 2-fold. Interestingly, approximately half of these genes possessed a miR-7977 target site, while the other genes did not, suggesting that miR-7977 regulates the gene expression level directly and indirectly. Gene set enrichment analysis showed that the gene sets of Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) _up were significantly enriched (p<0.001, q<0.25), suggesting that miR-7977 modulates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway. Visualization of pathway and network showed that miR-7977 significantly reduced the expression of Hippo core kinase, STK4. miR-7977 inactivated the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway as proven by GFP-tagged YAP nuclear trans localization and TEAD reporter assay. The miR-7977-transduced MSC cell line, HTS-5, showed elevated saturation density and enhanced entry into the cell cycle. These results suggest that miR-7977 is a critical factor that regulates the Hippo-YAP signaling pathway in BM-MSCs and may be involved in the upregulation of leukemia-supporting stroma growth.",,"['Yoshida, Masahiro', 'Horiguchi, Hiroto', 'Kikuchi, Shohei', 'Iyama, Satoshi', 'Ikeda, Hiroshi', 'Goto, Akari', 'Kawano, Yutaka', 'Murase, Kazuyuki', 'Takada, Kohichi', 'Miyanishi, Koji', 'Kato, Junji', 'Kobune, Masayoshi']","['Yoshida M', 'Horiguchi H', 'Kikuchi S', 'Iyama S', 'Ikeda H', 'Goto A', 'Kawano Y', 'Murase K', 'Takada K', 'Miyanishi K', 'Kato J', 'Kobune M']","['Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3828-8444'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190305,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MIRN7977 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (STK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hippo Signaling Pathway', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",,,2019/03/06 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/03/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0213220 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-32707 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Mar 5;14(3):e0213220. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0213220. eCollection 2019.,PMC6400381,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although several real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) kits for the detection of BCR-ABL1 transcripts are commercially available, their accuracy and efficiency in laboratory practice require reevaluation. We have developed a new in-house RQ-PCR method to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in CML cases. MRD was analyzed in 102 patients with CML from the DOMEST study, a clinical trial to study the rationale for imatinib mesylate discontinuation in Japan. The BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio was evaluated using the international standard (IS) ratio, where IS < 0.1% was defined as a major molecular response. At enrollment, BCR-ABL1 transcripts were undetectable in all samples using a widely-applied RQ-PCR method performed in the commercial laboratory, BML (BML Inc., Tokyo, Japan); however, the in-house method detected the BCR-ABL1 transcripts in five samples (5%) (mean IS ratio: 0.0062 +/- 0.0010%). After discontinuation of imatinib, BCR-ABL1 transcripts were detected using the in-house RQ-PCR in 21 patients (21%) that were not positive using the BML method. Nineteen samples were also tested using a commercially available RQ-PCR assay kit with a detection limit of IS ratio, 0.0032 (ODK-1201, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Tokyo, Japan). This method detected low levels of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in 14 samples (74%), but scored negative for five samples (26%) that were positive using the in-house method. From the perspective of the in-house RQ-PCR method, number of patients confirmed loss of MMR was 4.

An increasing number of studies have shown that SPAG6 expression is associated with the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, the mechanism has not been clearly elucidated. Our previous results indicated that SPAG6 affected cell apoptosis in MDS. In this study, we used reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to demonstrate that the mRNA expression of SPAG6 in bone marrow cells of patients with MDS or MDS-derived acute myeloid leukemia (MDS-AML) was higher than that of cancer-free patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis of published AML found that patients with high expression of SPAG6 had poor survival. The results of the cell counting kit-8, FACS, RT-qPCR, and Western blotting assays indicated that SPAG6 knockdown in the SKM-1 cell line inhibited cell proliferation, and affected cell cycle and differentiation. Furthermore, we found that SPAG6 knockdown affected the proliferation of SKM-1 cells by mediating the G1-to-S transition of the cell cycle. Moreover, we demonstrated that the antiproliferative effect of SPAG6 knockdown was associated with the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1, and regulation of the AKT/FOXO pathway.

METHODS: This research was a 14-year retrospective cohort study of 2,331 healthcare workers at the National Cancer Institute and 7 regional cancer centers in Thailand. The study period consisted of a total of 18,939 person-years of observation. The demographic data, such as occupation and work area were collected by self-administered questionnaires or by use of a proxy. The cases were identified by the diagnoses of physicians. The incidence rates for each type of cancer, occupation and work area among the population of this study were compared with the general working population, based on national cancer statistics. The results were reported in terms of Standard Incidence Ratio (SIR) and a 95% confidence interval (CI), using Fisher's exact method. FINDINGS: There were 12 different types of cancer identified in 35 cases during the 14 years of the study and breast cancer was found to be at the highest number. The overall cancer incidence rates were 221.04 and 173.43 per 100,000 person-years, in males and females, respectively. Leukemia showed statistically significant levels of high SIR among the female healthcare staffs (SIR = 11.54; 95% CI = 2.38-33.72). With regard to occupation, only the male physicians showed significant SIR = 6.02; 95% CI = 1.41-19.93, while this study did not identify significant SIR levels in any of the work areas. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the risk of leukemia was higher than expected among healthcare workers and that physicians may have an increased risk of cancer compared to the general working population, which may be a work-related reflex. However, interpretations should be made with caution due to the small number of cases.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

The effective use of curcumin as an anticancer agent has been demonstrated in clinical trials. Tetrahydrocurcumin, a major curcumin metabolite, exhibits pharmacological activities similar to those of curcumin. Curcumin induces cell death mainly through the apoptosis pathway, and tetrahydrocurcumin induces cell death mainly via an autophagy pathway in HL60 cells. Here, we investigated whether curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin can induce apoptosis- and autophagy-mediated cell deaths in Ara-C-resistant cancer cells, respectively. The results demonstrated that curcumin and tetrahydrocurcumin induced cell death by apoptosis and autophagy, respectively, in Ara-C-resistant HL60 cells.

The incidence data for pediatric cancers were retrieved from the International Incidence of Childhood Cancer project (1990-2015). Poisson regression was applied to detect the sex differences in cancer incidence at global and regional levels. Boys were more susceptible to childhood cancers than girls, with a global boy-to-girl incidence rate ratio of 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.26, 1.28) for leukemia, 1.48 (95% CI: 1.46, 1.51) for lymphomas, 1.10 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.11) for central nervous system neoplasms, 1.11 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.13) for neuroblastoma, 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02, 1.09) for retinoblastoma, and 1.39 (95% CI: 1.33, 1.45) for hepatic tumors. Incidence among girls was predominant only in renal tumors (incidence rate ratio = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.88, 0.92). Significant sex differences were observed in childhood cancers based on global-scale cancer data. The most pronounced disparities were observed mostly in developing countries, highlighting that data registration quality should be improved and that attention is needed for health-care access and service utilization for girls in these regions. Additionally, given the limited exposures to environmental risk factors in children, the differences might be mainly attributable to some endogenous risk factors and warrant further investigations.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Results: Age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) (per 100,000 population) of breast cancer among women increased dramatically from 11.8 in 2001 to 22.7 in 2014, indicating a 92.4% increase over the decade. Colorectal cancer incidence was the highest among men, and its ASR per 100,000 population increased from 5.0 to 10.6 in men and from 5.0 to 8.2 in women. Among communicable diseases, incidences of hepatitis B, measles, chickenpox, and brucellosis decreased while dengue fever increased. An alarming increase was observed in the incidence rate of non-communicable diseases namely, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Conclusion: The incidence rate of non-communicable diseases increased over the decade and was associated with increased mortality and disability, reduced quality of life, and increased health-care costs, indicating an urgent need to establish prevention and control programs. The rising trend in the incidence of cancers may also become a health care issue in Saudi Arabia in the coming years.",,"['Herzallah, Hatem K', 'Antonisamy, Belavendra R', 'Shafee, Mohammed H', 'Al-Otaibi, Sultan T']","['Herzallah HK', 'Antonisamy BR', 'Shafee MH', 'Al-Otaibi ST']","['Department of Public Health, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

We employed both immortalized and primary cells derived from CD22-positive lymphoproliferative disorders to investigate the signaling pathways contributing to IO sensitivity or resistance. We found that the drug reduced the proliferation rate of CD22-positive cell lines expressing wild-type p53, but was remarkably less effective on cells exhibiting mutant p53. In addition, CD22-positive cells surviving IO were mostly blocked in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle because of Chk1 activation that, in the presence of a wild-type p53 background, led to p21 induction. When we combined IO with the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01, we successfully abrogated IO-induced G2/M arrest regardless of the underlying p53 status, indicating that the DNA damage response triggered by IO is also modulated by p53-independent mechanisms. To establish a predictive value for p53 in determining IO responsiveness, we expressed mutant p53 in cell lines displaying the wild-type gene and observed an increase in IO IC50 values. Likewise, overexpression of an inducible wild-type p53 in cells natively presenting a mutant protein decreased their IC50 for IO. These results were also confirmed in primary CD22-positive cells derived from B-ALL patients at diagnosis and from patients with r/r B-ALL. Furthermore, co-treatment with IO and UCN-01 significantly increased cell death in primary cells expressing mutant p53. In summary, our findings suggest that p53 status may represent a biomarker predictive of IO efficacy in patients diagnosed with CD22-positive malignancies.",,"['Tirro, Elena', 'Massimino, Michele', 'Romano, Chiara', 'Pennisi, Maria Stella', 'Stella, Stefania', 'Vitale, Silvia Rita', 'Fidilio, Annamaria', 'Manzella, Livia', 'Parrinello, Nunziatina Laura', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe Alberto', 'La Cava, Piera', 'Romano, Alessandra', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Vigneri, Paolo G']","['Tirro E', 'Massimino M', 'Romano C', 'Pennisi MS', 'Stella S', 'Vitale SR', 'Fidilio A', 'Manzella L', 'Parrinello NL', 'Stagno F', 'Palumbo GA', 'La Cava P', 'Romano A', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Vigneri PG']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Center of Experimental Oncology and Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Drug Sciences, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria ""Policlinico-Vittorio Emanuele"", Catania, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical Sciences and Advanced Technologies ""G.

Despite these encouraging results, questions remain as multiple donors are usually available for transplantation, and choosing the best HLA-haploidentical donor for transplantation remains a challenge. Several approaches to haploidentical transplantation have been developed over time and, based on the graft received, can be grouped as follows: T-cell depleted haploidentical transplants, either complete or partial, or with T-cell replete grafts, performed with post-transplant cyclophosphamide-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, or G-CSF-primed bone marrow graft and enhanced GVHD prophylaxis. Carefully selecting the donor can help optimize transplant outcomes for recipients of haploidentical donor transplants. Variables usually considered in the donor selection include presence of donor-specific antibodies in the recipient, donor age, donor/recipient gender and ABO combinations, and immunogenic variables, such as natural killer cell alloreactivity or KIR haplotype.

Recent data show that SOX6 expression is altered in different cancers, in the majority of cases being downregulated. To date, no data are available about SOX6 role in hematological malignancies. Here we demonstrate that SOX6 overexpressing BCR-ABL1(+) B-ALL cells are unable to promote leukemia in a mouse model. Starting from this observation, we extended our study to a panel of human leukemic cells carrying genetic lesions distinctive of different types of leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders (the BCR-ABL1 translocation and the JAK2V617F amino acid substitution) to dissect the cellular events induced by SOX6. The inhibition of proliferation is the invariant outcome of SOX6 overexpression but it is achieved via two different cellular responses: terminal differentiation in erythroid-biased cells, irrespectively of their mutation, and apoptosis in megakaryocytic-primed and lymphoid cells. Within this context, cells carrying the highest copy number of the JAK2V617F allele better counteract the SOX6-imposed growth arrest. The interrogation of the GEPIA (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis) human dataset reveals that SOX6 is downregulated in a cohort of AML patients, uncovering a wide anti-proliferative role of SOX6 in a variety of mutant backgrounds.",,"['Barbarani, Gloria', 'Fugazza, Cristina', 'Barabino, Silvia M L', 'Ronchi, Antonella E']","['Barbarani G', 'Fugazza C', 'Barabino SML', 'Ronchi AE']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie e Bioscienze, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126, Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie e Bioscienze, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126, Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie e Bioscienze, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126, Milano, Milano, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Biotecnologie e Bioscienze, Universita degli Studi di Milano-Bicocca, Piazza della Scienza 2, 20126, Milano, Milano, Italy. antonella.ronchi@unimib.it.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3584-4417'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190304,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (SOXD Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics/physiology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'SOXD Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,2019/03/06 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/03/06 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-39926-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-39926-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 4;9(1):3388. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-39926-4.,PMC6399316,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS Base on RNA-seq technique and the GEO database, expression profiles of circRNAs/lncRNAs/miRNAs/mRNAs related to PE were obtained. Differentially expressed RNAs were determined using the Limma package in R. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed using GSEA software (v. 3.0) and illustrated by ClusterProfiler and ggplot2 package in R. DAVID database (v. 6.8) was implemented to analyze functional categories and the association between genes and the corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) classification. The R visualization package GOPlot was used to get a better visualization of the relationships between genes and the selected functional categories. CeRNA networks which visualized the correlations between circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA were constructed using Cytoscape software (v. 3.6.0). Targetscan and miRanda database were used to predict target relationships between circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA. QRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay were used to verify the expression and target relationship of has_circ_0088196/LINC01492/miR-100-5p/LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor). RESULTS The jak-stat signaling pathway was activated and miR-100-5p was downregulated in PE compared with normal tissues both in collected placental tissue samples and GEO database. Upregulated LIF, LINC01492, and hsa_circ_0088196 were negatively correlated with miR-100-5p expression and had a targeted relationship with miR-100-5p. CONCLUSIONS miR-100-5p may suppress PE development, while LIF, LINC01492, and hsa_circ_0088196 may promote it though inhibiting miR-100-5p.

Studies have shown that 2-10% of patients with CLL develop RT including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and less common Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). This study aims to assess the risk factors for RT of CLL in a nationwide cohort. Additionally, we want to examine prognostic factors in patients with RT. These findings may guide management of treated as well as untreated patients with CLL in the risk of RT. METHODS: Clinical data for patients diagnosed with CLL between 2008 and 2016 will be retrieved from the Danish National CLL registry (DCLLR). Using the Danish unique person identification number, clinical data will be merged with histologically verified DLBCL and/or HL diagnoses retrieved from the Danish National Pathology Data Bank. This will ensure complete follow-up for all patients.The DCLLR includes data from more than 4000 patients with CLL ensuring a median follow-up of 3 years. With the reported incidences (2-10%) of RT, we expect to identify 80-200 CLL patients with RT enabling analysis of overall survival following RT. From time of CLL diagnosis, estimates of cumulative incidence of RT will be calculated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. From time of RT diagnosis, survival analysis will be performed by Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models will be used for multivariable survival analysis. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Approvals for data collection and analysis was obtained from the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Danish Health Authorities. All data will be managed confidentially according to guidelines and legislation. The dissemination will include a publication of scientific papers and/or presentations of the study findings at international conferences.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the biological function of IARS2 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has not yet been identified. In the present study, qRT-PCR was used to determine the expression of IARS2 in K562, THP1, and HL-60 leukemia cells. Additionally the mRNA levels of IARS2 in CD34 cells and AML cells obtained from patients were detected by qRT-PCR. IARS2-shRNA lentiviral vector was established and used to infect acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis were employed to assess the knockdown effect of IARS2. The proliferation rate and cell cycle phase of HL-60 cells after IARS2 knockdown were evaluated by CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry. The PathScan Antibody Array was used to determine the expression of cell cycle-related proteins in HL-60 cells after IARS2 knockdown. The expression of proliferation-related proteins in HL-60 cells after IARS2 knockdown was determined by Western blot analysis. Results showed that IARS2 expression was stable and much higher in HL-60, THP-1, and K562 leukemia cells and AML cells obtained from patients than that of human CD34 cells. Compared with cells of the shCtrl group, IARS2 was markedly knocked down in cells that were transfected with lentivirus encoding shRNA of IARS2 in HL-60 cells (p < 0.05). IARS2 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced cycle arrest at the G1 phase in HL-60 cells. Additionally IARS2 knockdown significantly increased the expression of p53 and p21, and decreased the expression of PCNA and eIF4E in HL-60 cells. In conclusion, IARS2 knockdown can inhibit acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cell proliferation and cause cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase by regulating the p53/p21/PCNA/eIF4E pathways.",,"['Li, Hong', 'Tian, Yaning', 'Li, Xiang', 'Wang, Bin', 'Zhai, Dongzhi', 'Bai, Yingying', 'Dong, Changhu', 'Chao, Xu']","['Li H', 'Tian Y', 'Li X', 'Wang B', 'Zhai D', 'Bai Y', 'Dong C', 'Chao X']","['The Second Affiliated Hospital of Shaanxi University of Chinese Medicine, Xianyang, P.R.

In this nationwide mortality study, we aimed to assess the mortality of lymphoma and myeloma in 2017 and the changes in the trend from 2004 to 2016. METHODS: Death certificate data obtained from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention's disease surveillance points system (CDC-DSP) and population data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China were used in this study. We described the mortality of lymphoma and myeloma in 2017 by age group, sex, residence, and region and evaluated the temporal trend from 2004 to 2016 using joinpoint regression. RESULTS: An estimated 52,000 deaths associated with lymphoma and myeloma occurred in 2017. The age-standardized mortality rate China (ASMRC) and age-standardized mortality rate worldwide (ASMRW) per 100,000 were 3.74 and 2.60, respectively. Males had higher ASMRC than females (4.54 vs. 2.91 per 100,000). The ASMRC in urban areas was significantly higher than that in rural areas (4.35 vs. 3.47 per 100,000). The age-specific mortality rate showed an upward trend with age and reached a maximum in the age group of over 85 years. In terms of regional variation, Eastern China had the highest mortality rate (3.43/100,000), followed by Central China (3.10/100,000) and Western China (3.02/100,000). The mortality rates of lymphoma and myeloma increased annually by 4.5% during the period 2004-2016, with a significant rapid upward trend in rural areas since 2007. CONCLUSIONS: The mortality of lymphoma and myeloma increased in China from 2004 to 2017.

Within countries, the difference has been related to the socioeconomic status of the parents, even in the context of public health services with universal coverage. In Mexico, differences in the mortality of children with cancer have been reported among sociodemographic zones. The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS), the country's main social security institution, has reported socioeconomic differences in life expectancy within its affiliated population. Here, the socioeconomic inequalities in the survival of children (< 15 years old) enrolled in the IMSS were analyzed. METHODS: Five-year survival data were analyzed in cohorts of patients diagnosed with ALL during the period 2007-2009 in the two IMSS networks of medical services that serve 7 states of the central region of Mexico. A Cox proportional risk model was developed and adjusted for the socioeconomic characteristics of family, community of residence and for the clinical characteristics of the children. The slope of socioeconomic inequality of the probability of dying within five years after the diagnosis of ALL was estimated. RESULTS: For the 294 patients studied, the 5 years survival rate was 53.7%; the median survival was 4.06 years (4.9 years for standard-risk diagnosis; 2.5 years for high-risk diagnosis). The attrition rate was 12%. The Cox model showed that children who had been IMSS-insured for less than half their lives had more than double the risk of dying than those who had been insured for their entire lives. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence of socioeconomic inequalities in the survival of children with ALL associated with family income, educational and occupational level of parents. However, we found a relevant gradient related social security protection: the longer children's life insured by social security, the higher their probability of surviving ALL was. These results add evidence of the effectiveness of social security, as a mechanism of wealth redistribution and a promoter of social mobility. Extending these social security benefits to the entire Mexican population could promote better health outcomes.",,"['Castro-Rios, Angelica', 'Reyes-Morales, Hortensia', 'Pelcastre-Villafuerte, Blanca E', 'Rendon-Macias, Mario E', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, Arturo']","['Castro-Rios A', 'Reyes-Morales H', 'Pelcastre-Villafuerte BE', 'Rendon-Macias ME', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A']","['Unidad de Investigacion en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional SXXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Avenida Cuauhtemoc 330, Col.

Further improvement of treatment protocols is needed through the implementation of pharmacogenomics and pharmacotranscriptomics. Emerging high-throughput technologies, including microarrays and next-generation sequencing, have provided an enormous amount of molecular data with the potential to be implemented in childhood ALL treatment protocols. In the current review, we summarized the contribution of these novel technologies to the pharmacogenomics and pharmacotranscriptomics of childhood ALL. We have presented data on molecular markers responsible for the efficacy, side effects, and toxicity of the drugs commonly used for childhood ALL treatment, i.e., glucocorticoids, vincristine, asparaginase, anthracyclines, thiopurines, and methotrexate. Big data was generated using high-throughput technologies, but their implementation in clinical practice is poor.

Ca(2+) signaling was shown to play a role in RTX-induced cell death. This report concerns the effect of GA101 on Ca(2+) signaling and its involvement in the direct cell death induced by GA101. We reveal that GA101 triggered an intracellular Ca(2+) increase by mobilizing intracellular Ca(2+) stores and activating Orai1-dependent Ca(2+) influx in non-Hodgkin lymphoma cell lines and primary B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL) cells. According to the cell type, Ca(2+) was mobilized from two distinct intracellular compartments. In Raji, BL2, and B-CLL cells, GA101 induced a Ca(2+) release from lysosomes, leading to the subsequent lysosomal membrane permeabilization and cell death. Inhibition of this calcium signaling reduced GA101-induced cell death in these cells. In SU-DHL-4 cells, GA101 mobilized Ca(2+) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Inhibition of ER replenishment, by blocking Orai1-dependent Ca(2+) influx, led to an ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) which sensitized these cells to GA101-induced cell death. These results revealed the central role of Ca(2+) signaling in GA101's action mechanism, which may contribute to designing new rational drug combinations improving its clinical efficacy.",,"['Latour, Simon', 'Zanese, Marion', 'Le Morvan, Valerie', 'Vacher, Anne-Marie', 'Menard, Nelly', 'Bijou, Fontanet', 'Durrieu, Francoise', 'Soubeyran, Pierre', 'Savina, Ariel', 'Vacher, Pierre', 'Bresson-Bepoldin, Laurence']","['Latour S', 'Zanese M', 'Le Morvan V', 'Vacher AM', 'Menard N', 'Bijou F', 'Durrieu F', 'Soubeyran P', 'Savina A', 'Vacher P', 'Bresson-Bepoldin L']","['Institut Bergonie, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, F-33000 Bordeaux, France. simon_latour@hotmail.fr.', 'Department of Life and Health Sciences, University of Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France. simon_latour@hotmail.fr.', 'INSERM, U1218 ACTION, F-33000 Bordeaux, France. simon_latour@hotmail.fr.', 'Institut Bergonie, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, F-33000 Bordeaux, France. marionzanese@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Life and Health Sciences, University of Bordeaux, F-33076 Bordeaux, France. marionzanese@hotmail.com.', 'INSERM, U1218 ACTION, F-33000 Bordeaux, France. marionzanese@hotmail.com.', 'Institut Bergonie, Comprehensive Cancer Centre, F-33000 Bordeaux, France.

Methods: Eighteen patients (17 from Tumor Hospital of Zhengzhou University and 1 from the First People's Hospital of Pingdingshan City) with AML admitted from July 2016 to June 2018, who were in hematologic remission but MRD-positive were treated with different doses of ITI regimen, and the MRD levels were monitored. Results: Among 18 patients who received a conventional dose of ITI regimen for 1 to 2 months, 7 patients had undetectable MRD, 3 had significant decrease in MRD levels, 3 had elevated MRD level and had hematologic recurrence. Three patients with elevated MRD level received a higher dose of ITI regimen, 2 of them turned to MRD negative and the other 1 patient had decreased MRD level.

In a retrospective analysis with 33 patients with hyperleukocytic APL, we found 6 out of 33 hyperleukocytic APL patients presented with thrombosis rather than hemorrhage. A notable feature in these high-risk APL patients with thrombosis is that there were no significant abnormalities in fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Compared with the normal ranges, both the high-risk APL patients with thrombosis and the high-risk APL patients with hemorrhage had a significant increase in fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) and d-dimer levels. However, the group with hemorrhage had noticeably higher plasma levels of FDP and d-dimer than the group with thrombosis. To find a close relationship between coagulation markers and the onset of thrombotic events in patients with high-risk APL, the potential effects of FDP/FIB and d-dimer/FIB ratios as risk markers were investigated. We demonstrated that FDP/FIB and d-dimer/FIB ratios in the patients with high-risk APL with thrombosis showed higher ratios than the normal range but significantly lower ratios than the patients with high-risk APL-related hemorrhage. Our data demonstrated that the alteration in FDP/FIB and d-dimer/FIB ratios have more significant relevance than the levels of FIB, FDP or d-dimer as potential factors for predicting thrombosis and may help with designing more appropriately risk-adapted treatment protocols or personalized therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, patients with persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) exhibit increased risk of relapse. Combining consolidative chemotherapy with TKIs may increase rates of infectious complications, organ toxicity, hospitalization, and non-relapse mortality. Blinatumomab has demonstrated single-agent activity in patients with relapsed B-ALL or persistent MRD, including Ph + B-ALL. We have used blinatumomab concomitantly with commercially available TKIs as consolidative therapy to spare toxicities of conventional chemotherapy. We evaluated 11 adults with previously treated Ph + B-ALL who received blinatumomab concurrent with TKI (ponatinib, n = 5; dasatinib, n = 4; nilotinib, n = 1; imatinib, n = 1) to eradicate MRD or sustain MRD-negativity. Eight of 9 patients with MRD achieved BCR-ABL1 negativity (complete molecular response, CMR) after a median of one cycle; 2/2 patients without measurable disease durably maintained CMR. Cytokine release syndrome (all grade 1-2) was observed in 3/11 patients; one patient experienced transient grade 1 neurologic toxicity. Transient grade 2 transaminitis was observed in 6/11 patients, including 4/5 recipients of blinatumomab + ponatinib. This small series suggests blinatumomab + TKI is a safe and effective consolidation strategy for patients with Ph + ALL to achieve or maintain CMR.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This leads to unnecessarily prolonged antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: Based on ECIL-4 recommendations, we modified our management strategy and discontinued antibiotics after a pre-established duration in patients treated for a first episode of FN between August 2014 and October 2017. RESULTS: Antibiotics were stopped during 62 FN episodes, and maintained in the control group (n = 13). Median age of patients was 54 years. A total of 39 (63%) patients received induction and 23 (37%) consolidation chemotherapy; 36 (58%) patients had fever of unknown origin. Median neutropenia length was 26 days (IQR 24-30). Antibiotics were started at day 9 (IQR 5-13). Most patients received piperacillin-tazobactam (56%) or cefepime (32%). Antimicrobial therapy was longer in the control group than in the policy compliant group, 10 (IQR 7-16) vs. 19 days (IQR 15-23), P = 0.0001. After antibiotics discontinuation, 20% patients experienced fever recurrence, within 5.5 days (IQR 3-7.5). None of these febrile episodes were severe and 80% patients remained afebrile, with neutrophil recovery occurring within 5 days (IQR 2-8.5). Overall, 287 antibiotics days were spared; this represents 49% of all days with antibiotics. No patient had died at day 30 from intervention; six died during late follow-up, two from graft-versus-host disease and four from relapsed or refractory leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Discontinuing antibiotics in neutropenic AML patients treated for a first episode of FN is safe, and results in significant antibiotic sparing.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We identified 13,276 patients with CML newly diagnosed in 2001-2014. Patients who had prior history of cancer, a concurrent diagnosis of other malignancies in the same diagnostic year, or a second leukemia after CML diagnosis were excluded. Second malignancies were observed in 597 patients (4%) with a median follow-up of 69 months. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidences of death for all patients were 30.5% and 41.8%.

OBJECTIVE: To introduce a software tool for the identification of isotopologues from mass spectrometry data. METHODS: DeltaMS relies on XCMS peak detection and X(13)CMS isotopologue grouping and then analyses data for specific isotope ratios and the relative error of these ratios. It provides pipelines for recognition of isotope patterns in three experiment types commonly used in isotopic labeling studies: (1) search for isotope signatures with a specific mass shift and intensity ratio in one sample set, (2) analyze two sample sets for a specific mass shift and, optionally, the isotope ratio, whereby one sample set is isotope-labeled, and one is not, (3) analyze isotope-guided perturbation experiments with a setup described in X(13)CMS. RESULTS: To illustrate the versatility of DeltaMS, we analyze data sets from case-studies that commonly pose challenges in evaluation of natural isotopes or isotopic signatures in labeling experiment. In these examples, the untargeted detection of sulfur, bromine and artificial metal isotopic patterns is enabled by the automated search for specific isotopes or isotope signatures. CONCLUSION: DeltaMS provides a platform for the identification of (pre-defined) isotopologues in MS data from single samples or comparative metabolomics data sets.",,"['Baumeister, Tim U H', 'Ueberschaar, Nico', 'Schmidt-Heck, Wolfgang', 'Mohr, J Frieder', 'Deicke, Michael', 'Wichard, Thomas', 'Guthke, Reinhard', 'Pohnert, Georg']","['Baumeister TUH', 'Ueberschaar N', 'Schmidt-Heck W', 'Mohr JF', 'Deicke M', 'Wichard T', 'Guthke R', 'Pohnert G']","['Department of Bioorganic Analytics, Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena,, Lessingstr. 8, 07743, Jena, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Max Planck Fellow Group on Plankton Community Interaction, Hans-Knoll-Str. 8, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Mass Spectrometric Platform, Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Humboldtstr. 8, 07743, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Hans Knoll Institute (HKI), Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Beutenbergstr. 11a, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Bioorganic Analytics, Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena,, Lessingstr. 8, 07743, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Bioorganic Analytics, Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena,, Lessingstr. 8, 07743, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Bioorganic Analytics, Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena,, Lessingstr. 8, 07743, Jena, Germany. thomas.wichard@uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Hans Knoll Institute (HKI), Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Beutenbergstr. 11a, 07745, Jena, Germany.', 'Department of Bioorganic Analytics, Institute for Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Friedrich Schiller University Jena,, Lessingstr. 8, 07743, Jena, Germany. georg.pohnert@uni-jena.de.', 'Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Max Planck Fellow Group on Plankton Community Interaction, Hans-Knoll-Str. 8, 07745, Jena, Germany. georg.pohnert@uni-jena.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180227,United States,Metabolomics,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,101274889,,,"['Chromatography, Gas', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Humans', '*Isotope Labeling', 'K562 Cells', 'Laccaria/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', '*Metabolomics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Computer-aided tool', '*DeltaMS', '*Isotope signature', '*Metallomics', '*Shiny', '*Stable isotope labeling']",2019/03/05 06:00,2019/08/08 06:00,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2017/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11306-018-1336-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11306-018-1336-x [pii]']",epublish,Metabolomics. 2018 Feb 27;14(4):41. doi: 10.1007/s11306-018-1336-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cases, the classic translocation cannot be identified by conventional methods, since the PML-RARA fusion protein results from complex, variant, or cryptic translocation. The diagnostic algorithm of APL starts with screening methods, such as flow cytometry (FC), followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization or polymerase chain reaction to confirm the diagnosis. Our aim was to develop a novel protocol for analyzing APL samples based on multidimensional dot-plots that can provide comprehensive information about several markers at the same time. The protocol included four optimized multidimensional dot-plots, which were tested by retrospective reanalysis of FC results in APL (n = 8) and non-APL (n = 12) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. After predicting the potential position of hypergranular- and microgranular-type aberrant promyelocytes, the percentages of blast populations were examined within the gates in all AML cases. The percentage of blasts in each predefined gate was well above the cut-off value (95%) in APL cases in all tubes. In non-APL AML cases, the percentage of blasts in the same gates never reached the cut-off value in all investigated tubes, and even when it did in a single tube, the pattern was markedly different from that observed in APL cases. In conclusion, multidimensional dot-plots can be used for screening APL even in cryptic APL cases, although reproducibility across several laboratories would require standardization of antibodies and fluorochromes. This easy-to-use and quick method can support the diagnosis of APL and the prompt initiation of the appropriate treatment.",,"['Karai, Bettina', 'Habok, Mira', 'Remenyi, Gyula', 'Rejto, Laszlo', 'Ujfalusi, Aniko', 'Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Hevessy, Zsuzsanna']","['Karai B', 'Habok M', 'Remenyi G', 'Rejto L', 'Ujfalusi A', 'Kappelmayer J', 'Hevessy Z']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary. karai.bettina@med.unideb.hu.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary.', 'Department of Hematology, Josa Andras County Hospital, Nyiregyhaza, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Debrecen, Nagyerdei krt. 98, Debrecen, H-4032, Hungary.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9489-8189'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20190304,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '104641-95-4 (factor XIII subunit A)', '9013-56-3 (Factor XIII)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', '*Data Display', 'Early Detection of Cancer/*methods', 'Factor XIII/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/instrumentation/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Cryptic translocation', 'Flow cytometry', 'Multidimensional dot-plot']",2019/03/05 06:00,2019/06/06 06:00,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03642-w [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03642-w [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Jun;98(6):1413-1420. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03642-w.

Modulation of inflammatory pathways have proven transformative in the treatment of cancers and have crossed the threshold of clinical reality as treatments to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. The finding that clonal haematopoiesis drives both leukaemia and cardiovascular events provides yet another link between these two seemingly disparate diseases. The nascent specialty of cardio-oncology has initially focused on the cardiovascular complications of cancer therapies. The recognition of a more profound pathophysiologic connection between cancer and cardiovascular diseases should expand the concept of cardio-oncology.

In this study, 5 B-ALL patients who relapsed after allo-HSCT received CAR-DLI (CAR-DLI group), and the outcome was compared with 27 relapsed B-ALL patients who received DLI therapy (DLI group). The median complete remission duration of CAR-DLI group was significantly (P=0.020) longer when compared with DLI group: 9 months (range, 2-29) versus 3.2 months (range, 0-17.4). Furthermore, patients receiving CAR-DLI showed significant (P=0.049) survival advantage over DLI group, with median overall survival of 12 months (range, 3-29) and 3.7 months (range, 0-65), respectively. Of note, no patient developed acute graft versus host disease in the CAR-DLI group, while incidence of acute graft versus host disease grades I-II and grades III-IV were 2 (7%) and 4 (14.8%) in the DLI group, respectively. In addition, cytokine release syndrome in CAR-DLI group was manageable.

Sustained degradation of BETP with small-molecule BET proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), ARV-825, resulted in marked downregulation of surface CXCR4 and CD44, key proteins in leukemia-microenvironment interaction, in AML cells. Abrogation of surface CXCR4 expression impaired SDF-1alpha directed migration and was mediated through transcriptional down-regulation of PIM1 kinase that in turn phosphorylates CXCR4 and facilitates its surface localization. Down-regulation of CD44/CD44v8-10 impaired cystine uptake, lowered intracellular reduced glutathione and increased oxidative stress. More importantly, BETP degradation markedly decreased CD34+CD38-CD90-CD45RA+ leukemic stem cell population and alone or in combination with Cytarabine, prolonged survival in mouse model of human leukemia including AML-PDX.

Our group has developed a protocol to model HSPC gene therapy in nonhuman primates (NHPs), allowing scientists to optimize many of the same reagents and techniques that are applied in the clinic. Here, we describe methods for purifying CD34(+) HSPCs and long-term persisting hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) subsets from primed bone marrow (BM). Identical techniques can be employed for the purification of other HSPC sources (e.g., mobilized peripheral blood stem cells [PBSCs]). Outlined is a 2 day protocol in which cells are purified, cultured, modified with lentivirus (LV), and prepared for infusion back into the autologous host. Key readouts of success include the purity of the CD34(+) HSPC population, the ability of purified HSPCs to form morphologically distinct colonies in semisolid media, and, most importantly, gene modification efficiency. The key advantage to HSPC gene therapy is the ability to provide a source of long-lived cells that give rise to all hematopoietic cell types. As such, these methods have been used to model therapies for cancer, genetic diseases, and infectious diseases. In each case, therapeutic efficacy is established by enhancing the function of distinct HSPC progeny, including red blood cells, T cells, B cells, and/or myeloid subsets. The methods to isolate, modify, and prepare HSPC products are directly applicable and translatable to multiple diseases in human patients.",,"['Radtke, Stefan', 'Perez, Anai M', 'Venkataraman, Rasika', 'Reddy, Sowmya', 'Haworth, Kevin G', 'Humbert, Olivier', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Peterson, Christopher W']","['Radtke S', 'Perez AM', 'Venkataraman R', 'Reddy S', 'Haworth KG', 'Humbert O', 'Kiem HP', 'Peterson CW']","['Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Department of Medicine, University of Washington; Department of Pathology, University of Washington.', 'Stem Cell and Gene Therapy Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Department of Medicine, University of Washington; cwpeters@fredhutch.org.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20190215,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Primates', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",,,2019/03/05 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/58933 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Feb 15;(144). doi: 10.3791/58933.,,,"['R01 HL136135/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL122173/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 HL129902/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI135953/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 OD010425/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) demonstrate clinical efficacy in AML patients and exert immunomodulatory activities. In the present study, we show that guadecitabine augments both antigen processing and presentation, resulting in increased AML susceptibility to T cell-mediated killing. Exposure to HMA results in the activation of the endogenous retroviral pathway with concomitant downstream amplification of critical mediators of inflammation. In an immunocompetent murine leukaemia model, guadecitabine negatively regulates inhibitory accessory cells in the TME by decreasing PD-1 (also termed PDCD1) expressing T cells and reducing AML-mediated expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Therapy with guadecitabine results in enhanced leukaemia-specific immunity, as manifested by increased CD4 and CD8 cells targeting syngeneic leukaemia cells. We have previously reported that vaccination with AML/dendritic cell fusions elicits the expansion of leukaemia-specific T cells and protects against disease relapse. In the present study, we demonstrate that vaccination in conjunction with HMA therapy results in enhanced anti-leukaemia immunity and survival. The combination of a novel personalized dendritic cell/AML fusion vaccine and an HMA has therapeutic potential, and a clinical trial investigating this combination is planned.",['(c) 2019 British Society for Haematology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Nahas, Myrna R', 'Stroopinsky, Dina', 'Rosenblatt, Jacalyn', 'Cole, Leandra', 'Pyzer, Athalia R', 'Anastasiadou, Eleni', 'Sergeeva, Anna', 'Ephraim, Adam', 'Washington, Abigail', 'Orr, Shira', 'McMasters, Malgorzata', 'Weinstock, Matthew', 'Jain, Salvia', 'Leaf, Rebecca K', 'Ghiasuddin, Haider', 'Rahimian, Maryam', 'Liegel, Jessica', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J', 'Slack, Frank', 'Kufe, Donald', 'Avigan, David']","['Nahas MR', 'Stroopinsky D', 'Rosenblatt J', 'Cole L', 'Pyzer AR', 'Anastasiadou E', 'Sergeeva A', 'Ephraim A', 'Washington A', 'Orr S', 'McMasters M', 'Weinstock M', 'Jain S', 'Leaf RK', 'Ghiasuddin H', 'Rahimian M', 'Liegel J', 'Molldrem JJ', 'Slack F', 'Kufe D', 'Avigan D']","['Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA.', 'Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6864-0931', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9749-2704']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190303,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Pdcd1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '2KT4YN1DP7 (guadecitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/immunology/pharmacology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*immunology', 'Virus Activation/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*dendritic cell vaccine', '*endogenous retroviral pathway', '*hypomethylating agent', '*immunotherapy']",2019/03/05 06:00,2020/05/02 06:00,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.15818 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 May;185(4):679-690. doi: 10.1111/bjh.15818.

Furthermore, the internal tandem duplication (ITD) represents the most common mutation of FLT3 in AML. To explore therapeutic strategies for AML patients carrying FLT3-ITD, we analyzed death receptor (DR) signaling networks in AML cells comprising FLT3-ITD. We have started with murine myeloid progenitor 32D cells that ectopically express human FLT3-ITD (32D- FLT3-ITD) and found that RIPK1 is strongly upregulated in these cells. Subsequently, we have shown that combinatorial treatment of 32D-FLT3-ITD cells with the SMAC mimetic BV6 and CD95L sensitizes these cells toward apoptosis and necroptosis. Moreover, combinatorial treatment with death ligands (DLs), for example, CD95L or tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and BV6 enhanced cell death in primary AML blasts from patients carrying FLT3-ITD mutation. Finally, pharmacological and genetic targeting of RIPK1 inhibited DL/BV6-mediated cell death in cells with FLT3-ITD mutations. Taken together, our study suggests a promising therapeutic opportunity for AML cancer cells harboring FLT3-ITD mutation via targeting RIPK1 pathways.",['(c) 2019 UICC.'],"['Hillert, Laura K', 'Bettermann-Bethge, Kira', 'Nimmagadda, Subbaiah Chary', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Naumann, Michael', 'Lavrik, Inna N']","['Hillert LK', 'Bettermann-Bethge K', 'Nimmagadda SC', 'Fischer T', 'Naumann M', 'Lavrik IN']","['Translational Inflammation Research, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation, Center of Dynamic Systems, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Translational Inflammation Research, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation, Center of Dynamic Systems, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation, Otto von Guericke University, Medical Faculty, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation, Otto von Guericke University, Medical Faculty, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Institute of Experimental Internal Medicine, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation, Otto von Guericke University, Medical Faculty, Magdeburg, Germany.', 'Translational Inflammation Research, Health Campus Immunology, Infectiology and Inflammation, Center of Dynamic Systems, Medical Faculty, Otto von Guericke University, Magdeburg, Germany.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9324-309X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190323,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*FLT3-ITD', '*RIPK1', '*cell death', '*death receptor']",2019/03/05 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2018/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32246 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Sep 15;145(6):1558-1569. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32246.

CLL evolution is frequently indolent, and treatment is mostly reserved for those patients with signs or symptoms of disease progression. In this work, we used RNA sequencing data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium CLL cohort to determine new gene expression patterns that correlate with clinical evolution.We determined that a 290-gene expression signature, in addition to immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutation status, stratifies patients into four groups with notably different time to first treatment. This finding was confirmed in an independent cohort. Similarly, we present a machine learning algorithm that predicts the need for treatment within the first 5 years following diagnosis using expression data from 2,198 genes. This predictor achieved 90% precision and 89% accuracy when classifying independent CLL cases.

It is associated with high levels of the methylated metabolite 6-methyl-mercaptopurine (6MMP). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include morning tremulousness, nausea and vomiting. We have previously shown that switching 6MP dosing from evening to morning resolved hypoglycemia by reducing 6MMP; however, the reduction of 6MMP was only transient, potentially resulting in return of hypoglycemia. In children and adults with Crohn's disease, co-prescribing allopurinol with 6MP blocks the activity of thiopurine methytransferase (TPMT), reducing 6MMP and improving its tolerance. As a consequence of inhibiting TPMT, 6MP is shunted toward the production of 6-thioguanine nucleotide (6TGN), which will result in pancytopenia if the dose of 6MP is not reduced. We demonstrate that allopurinol with a reduced dose of 6MP in two patients with ALL and 6MMP-associated hypoglycemia resulted in a complete and sustained suppression of 6MMP and rapid reversal of hypoglycemia and its symptoms.",['Copyright: (c) 2019 Zhang M and Bostrom B.'],"['Zhang, Melissa', 'Bostrom, Bruce']","['Zhang M', 'Bostrom B']","['University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, 55404, USA.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7974-1271'],['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20190211,England,F1000Res,F1000Research,101594320,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Blood Glucose)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/therapeutic use', '*Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Glucose Self-Monitoring', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Hypoglycemia/chemically induced/drug therapy', '*Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",['NOTNLM'],"['*allopurinol', '*hypoglycemia', '*mercaptopurine', '*morning nausea', '*thiopurine methyltransferase']",2019/12/11 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/12/11 06:00'],"['2019/11/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/12/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.12688/f1000research.17760.2 [doi]'],epublish,F1000Res. 2019 Feb 11;8:176. doi: 10.12688/f1000research.17760.2. eCollection 2019.,PMC6392151,['No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,['figshare/10.6084/m9.figshare.7666409'],,,,,,

Most patients with solid tumors however, have experienced transient or no benefit from CAR T cell therapies.

This study aimed at assessing the impact of absolute monocytic count (AMC), and absolute lymphocytic count (ALC) recovery on overall survival (OS) and leukemia free survival (LFS) in AML. 83 de novo AML cases were enrolled in this study. The hemogram parameters including differential leukocyte counts were determined and collected sequentially at days 1, 14, 21 and 28. There was no significant difference regarding AMC or ALC at any time points in relation to the cytogenetics prognostic groups. High AMC >/= 0.8 x 10(9)/L at day 28 was associated with shorter OS and LFS, P value 0.012 and 0.003 respectively. On multivariate models, high AMC was shown as an independent prognostic factor associated with poor OS and LFS (HR 3, 95% CI 1.1-8.1 and P value 0.02) and (HR 5, 95% CI 1.5-17.4 and P value 0.01) respectively. High ALC-D28 (>/= 0.35 x 10(9)/L) was associated with prolonged OS and LFS survival, P value 0.032 and 0.016 respectively. However, it failed to prove the same significance using multivariate analysis. It was concluded that low AMC is an emerging independent predictor of better outcome in AML.",,"['Ismail, Manar M', 'Abdulateef, Nahla A B']","['Ismail MM', 'Abdulateef NAB']","['1Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Science, Umm Al Qura University, Al-Abdya, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.0000 0000 9137 6644grid.412832.e', '3Clinical Pathology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Giza, Egypt.0000 0004 0639 9286grid.7776.1', '1Laboratory Medicine Department, Faculty of Applied Medical Science, Umm Al Qura University, Al-Abdya, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.0000 0000 9137 6644grid.412832.e', '2Laboratory and Blood Bank Department, King Abdullah Medical City, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.0000 0004 0427 1086grid.498593.a']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6806-1406'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180704,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Absolute lymphocyte count', 'Absolute monocyte count', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Induction chemotherapy', 'Leukemia free survival', 'Overall survival', 'Prognostic factors']",2019/03/05 06:00,2019/03/05 06:01,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-0976-3 [doi]', '976 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Jan;35(1):100-108. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-0976-3.

They play a critical role in the progression of malignancies and leukemias including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, microRNA expression levels in Egyptian patients with CLL, and their prognostic value remain elusive. Our main aim was to assess the expression pattern of a panel of microRNAs in CLL patients to create an informative microRNA profile. The study subjects were 40 newly diagnosed CLL patients of both sexes and 40 age and sex matched controls. The expression levels of 12 microRNAs were evaluated by qRT-PCR, including miR-15a, 16, 23b, 24, 29a, 29c, 34a, 146a, 155, 181a, 195, and 221. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression levels of BCL2, CD38, and ZAP-70 in CLL patients. We identified various degrees of upregulated miRNAs (miR-29a, miR-29c, miR-34a, miR-155, miR-146a, and miR-195) and down-regulated ones (miR-15a, miR-16, miR-23b, miR-24, miR-181a, and miR-221) in CLL patients relative to controls. The mean fluorescence intensity ratio (MFI-R) of BCL2 was recorded and was significantly upregulated in CLL patients compared with normal controls. In addition, inverse correlations were observed between microRNAs (miR-15a, miR-16, miR-155, and miR-195) and BCL2 MFI-R while positive correlations were observed between miR-29a and miR-29c, and BCL2 MFI-R. These findings suggest that these miRNAs regulate BCL2 levels. Moreover, we found that miR-15a, miR-16, miR-155, miR-181a, miR-195 and miR-221 were significantly upregulated, while miR-29a and miR-29c were significantly downregulated in ZAP-70 positive CLL patients. Various miRNAs may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CLL and have the potential to be used for the prognosis of patients with CLL.",,"['Farahat, Nahla Mohamed Gamal', 'Elkaffash, Dalal Mohamed Nasr El Din', 'Alghandour, Ashraf Hussein', 'Swelem, Rania Shafik', 'Abo El-Wafa, Reham Abdel Haleem']","['Farahat NMG', 'Elkaffash DMNED', 'Alghandour AH', 'Swelem RS', 'Abo El-Wafa RAH']","['1Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Khartoum Square, El Sultan Hussein Street, Azarita, Alexandria 21131 Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6', '1Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Khartoum Square, El Sultan Hussein Street, Azarita, Alexandria 21131 Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6', '2Internal Medicine (Hematology), Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Azarita, Alexandria Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6', '1Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Khartoum Square, El Sultan Hussein Street, Azarita, Alexandria 21131 Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6', '1Clinical and Chemical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Alexandria University, Khartoum Square, El Sultan Hussein Street, Azarita, Alexandria 21131 Egypt.0000 0001 2260 6941grid.7155.6']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180803,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'CD38', 'CLL', 'ZAP-70', 'miRNA']",2019/03/05 06:00,2019/03/05 06:01,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-1000-7 [doi]', '1000 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Jan;35(1):89-99. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-1000-7.

Hence in these resource constraint settings, timely audit of quality of nucleic acids extractable from samples stored is of utmost importance. In this study, we explore the effect of - 20 degrees C storage over nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) isolated from blood samples of 180 patients with various leukaemia's following a bio-banking initiative. We observed that the integrity and quality of both DNA and RNA were maintained in 70 and 80% samples respectively over time as reflected by their concentration measurements and inherent uniform expression of housekeeping gene GAPDH. Only 3.7% of the RNA samples and 4.2% of the DNA samples yielded very low concentrations despite minimizing processing and technical loss. In nutshell, audit of our biobank sample yield highlights that storage of blood samples at - 20 degrees C does not compromise the fidelity of nucleic acids for future diagnostic and research work in a resource constraint setting.",,"['Kumar, A', 'Singh, M', 'Bhatia, P', 'Singh, A']","['Kumar A', 'Singh M', 'Bhatia P', 'Singh A']","['1University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA.0000 0004 1936 9000grid.21925.3d', '2Pediatric Hematology - Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, APC, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '2Pediatric Hematology - Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, APC, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '2Pediatric Hematology - Oncology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, APC, PGIMER, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, USA.0000 0004 1936 9000grid.21925.3d']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6096-3587'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180621,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Bio-banking', 'Leukemia', 'Nucleic acids', 'Storage']",2019/03/05 06:00,2019/03/05 06:01,['2019/03/05 06:00'],"['2018/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-018-0975-4 [doi]', '975 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Jan;35(1):77-82. doi: 10.1007/s12288-018-0975-4.

The real-world situation may be different. We analyzed patients (>/= 18 years) with chronic phase (CP) CML enrolled over a 7-year period (2002-2008) in an imatinib access program. Event was defined as non-achievement/loss of complete hematological response (CHR), loss of cytogenetic response or progression to accelerated (AP)/blast phase (BC). Progression was defined as development of AP/BC. Any delay of >/= 1 week in reporting for drug refills was categorized as non-adherence. Of the 443 patients with CP-CML who started imatinib [median age: 36 years (18-70); High risk: 32% (Sokal) and 14% (Hasford/EUTOS)], 162 (37%) had received prior therapy [mostly hydroxyurea (N = 153]. CHR was achieved by 430 (97%). After a median follow up of 109.5 months (3.4-184.3), the EFS, PFS and OS at 10 years was 43%, 75% and 76% respectively. Superior EFS was predicted by low-risk Hasford score and adherence to therapy. Adherence to therapy was the only factor which predicted EFS on multivariate analysis (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.50-0.83, P = 0.001). Long-term follow up of patients with CP-CML reflects poorer survival than those reported from clinical trials and reflects multiple issues that affect ""real-world"" patients. The continued drop in EFS, noted during long-term follow up, might take time to impact the PFS and OS due to the chronic nature of the disease.

The LSD1-mediated demethylation of H3K4 promotes the assembly of the c-Myc-induced transcription initiation complex. Although LSD1 and c-Myc are both strongly expressed in human cancers, the mechanisms by which their activities are coordinated remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that LSD1 is a direct target gene of c-Myc. The knockdown of c-Myc decreased the expression of LSD1 in several cancer cell lines. We identified two non-canonical E-boxes in the proximal promoter region of the LSD1 gene. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that c-Myc bound to these E-boxes in the LSD1 promoter. Importantly, LSD1 mRNA expression correlated with c-Myc expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioblastoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma.

We combined single-cell RNA sequencing and genotyping to profile 38,410 cells from 40 bone marrow aspirates, including 16 AML patients and five healthy donors. We then applied a machine learning classifier to distinguish a spectrum of malignant cell types whose abundances varied between patients and between subclones in the same tumor. Cell type compositions correlated with prototypic genetic lesions, including an association of FLT3-ITD with abundant progenitor-like cells. Primitive AML cells exhibited dysregulated transcriptional programs with co-expression of stemness and myeloid priming genes and had prognostic significance. Differentiated monocyte-like AML cells expressed diverse immunomodulatory genes and suppressed T cell activity in vitro. In conclusion, we provide single-cell technologies and an atlas of AML cell states, regulators, and markers with implications for precision medicine and immune therapies.

Although effective genetic labeling approaches are available in model systems, in humans, most approaches require detection of nuclear somatic mutations, which have high error rates, limited scale, and do not capture cell state information. Here, we show that somatic mutations in mtDNA can be tracked by single-cell RNA or assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC) sequencing. We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their utility as highly accurate clonal markers to infer cellular relationships. We track native human cells both in vitro and in vivo and relate clonal dynamics to gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow clonal tracking at a 1,000-fold greater scale than with nuclear genome sequencing, with simultaneous information on cell state, opening the way to chart cellular dynamics in human health and disease.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS: CUSA specimens obtained from 19 pediatric patients with brain tumors were investigated. Flow and mass cytometry methods were applied to analyze the composition of material collected using the CUSA. Cell suspensions were prepared from CUSA aspirates. Then sample viability was assessed by conventional flow cytometry and subsequently stained with a panel of 31 metal-labeled antibodies. RESULTS: Viability assessment was performed using conventional flow cytometry. Viability of cells in the acquired samples was below 50% in 16 of 19 cases. A mass cytometry investigation and subsequent analysis enabled us to discriminate brain tumor cells from contaminating leukocytes, whose proportions varied across the specimens. The addition of the viability marker cisplatin directly into the mass cytometry panel gave the means to selecting viable cells only for subsequent analyses. The proportion of non-viable cells was higher among tumor cells compared leukocytes. CONCLUSIONS: When the analysis of the tumor cell immunophenotype is performed with markers for determining viability, the expression of the investigated markers can be evaluated. Suitable markers can be selected by high-throughput methods, such as mass cytometry, and those that are diagnostically relevant can be investigated using flow cytometry, which is more flexible in terms of time.",,"['Vaskova, Martina', 'Tichy, Michal', 'Zamecnik, Josef', 'Liby, Petr', 'Kuzilkova, Daniela', 'Vicha, Ales', 'Hrabeta, Jan', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Stary, Jan', 'Hrusak, Ondrej']","['Vaskova M', 'Tichy M', 'Zamecnik J', 'Liby P', 'Kuzilkova D', 'Vicha A', 'Hrabeta J', 'Kalina T', 'Stary J', 'Hrusak O']","['CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. martina.vaskova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic. martina.vaskova@lfmotol.cuni.cz.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'CLIP - Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University and Motol University Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7039-7515'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190302,United States,J Neurooncol,Journal of neuro-oncology,8309335,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology/surgery', 'Cell Survival', 'Cisplatin/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Neurosurgical Procedures/instrumentation', 'Single-Cell Analysis', 'Ultrasonic Therapy/instrumentation']",['NOTNLM'],"['Cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA)', 'Flow cytometry', 'Mass cytometry', 'Pediatric brain tumors']",2019/03/04 06:00,2019/08/29 06:00,['2019/03/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11060-019-03135-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11060-019-03135-w [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurooncol. 2019 May;143(1):15-25. doi: 10.1007/s11060-019-03135-w.

However, the impact of T cell depletion due to a shared antigen pool remains an issue to be resolved. Here, we describe a CD4CAR capable of eliminating CD4-positive T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia in a systemic mouse model, with CAMPATH (alemtuzumab) as a natural safety switch to deplete the infused CD4CAR T cells to prevent toxicities associated with CD4 cell aplasia.

However, the mechanism by which this rapid apoptosis occurs remains unknown. We have investigated canonical aspects of apoptosis to determine how the nuphar alkaloid, (+)-6-hydroxythiobinupharidine (6HTBN), induces apoptosis. 6HTBN induced rapid apoptosis in various leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that its mechanism is cell-type independent. It also circumvented resistance of patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells generated by co-culture on survival-promoting stroma. Intriguingly, 6HTBN failed to induce apoptosis in platelets. The mechanism of apoptosis involves activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, but not caspase 8 as previously reported. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria occurred even in the absence of BAX/BAK and in cells that retained mitochondrial membrane potential. These results suggest a novel mechanism of apoptosis that has previously not been reported.

Immune reactions to the drug are associated with its diminished activity. The aim of the study was to determine the level of IgM, IgG and IgE-class anti-L-asp antibodies during the induction and reinduction phases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy and their influence on L-asp activity. METHODS: The study group comprised 65 patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in one pediatric oncology center. L-asp antibodies were assessed using ELISA at the end of the induction and reinduction phases. L-asp activity was assessed prior to each drug administration by colorimetry. RESULTS: At the end of the first exposure to L-asp antibodies were detected in 35 patients (54%). In the reinduction phase of the treatment anti-L-asp antibodies were found in 38/55 patients (69%). In the induction phase patients with inadequate L-asp activity had higher IgM concentrations (median 5.88 versus 2.81 mug/mL, p = 0.03). In the reinduction phase IgG and IgM levels correlated inversely with L-asp activity. Patients with L-asp allergy had higher levels of IgG (median 61.6 versus 18.36 mug/mL, p = 0.01), whereas higher IgE levels were noted in the group of patients with inadequate drug activity (median 0.91 versus 0.64 mug/mL, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Subsequent exposure to L-asp in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia was associated with the increase of anti-L-asp antibodies in all studied classes. However, the changes observed in specific classes of antibodies were not distinctive for L-asp hypersensitivity or inactivation, suggesting that the mechanism is more complex.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier B.V.

Caspases; the key executors of apoptotic cascade are attractive targets for selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Within this approach, various caspase activators were introduced as lead anticancer agents. In the current study, a new series of multifunctional Passerini products was synthesized and evaluated as potent caspase-dependent apoptotic inducers. The synthetic strategy adopted this isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction to possibly mimic the pharmacophoric features of various lead apoptotic inducers, where a series of alpha-acyloxy carboxamides was prepared from p-nitrophenyl isonitrile, cyclohexanone and various carboxylic acids. Accordingly, the main amide-based scaffold was decorated by substituents with varying nature and size to gain more information about structure-activity relationship. All the synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblasts and their potential anticancer activities against three human cancer cell lines; MCF-7 (breast), NFS-60 (myeloid leukemia), and HepG-2 (liver) utilizing MTT assay. Among the most active compounds, 13, 21 and 22 were more potent and safer than doxorubicin with nanomolar IC50 values and promising selectivity indices. Mechanistically, 13, 21 and 22 induced apoptosis by significant caspase activation in all the screened cancer cell lines utilizing flow cytometric analysis and caspase 3/7 activation assay. Again, 13 and 21 recorded higher activation percentages than doxorubicin, while 22 showed comparable results. Apoptosis-inducing factor1 (AIF1) quantification assay declared that 13, 21 and 22 didn't mediate apoptosis through AIF1-dependent pathway (i.e. only by caspase activation). Physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic profiles, ligand efficiency metrics and drug-likeness data of all the synthesized compounds were computationally predicted and showed that 13, 21 and 22 could be considered as drug-like candidates.

Thirty-nine patients were assessable for toxic effects and response. The median age was 54 years. The most common diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (41%). Twenty-two patients (56%) and 17 patients (44%) received their transplants from matched related and matched unrelated donors, respectively. The maximum tolerated bortezomib dose was 1 mg/m(2). The weighted cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III or IV acute GVHD were 50% and 34%, respectively; these incidences and survival rates were not significantly different from those of the control group. Median survival was not reached in patients age </= 50 years and with a long follow-up time of 60.7 months. The R-BEAM regimen has a survival benefit in lymphoma patients age </= 50 years undergoing alloSCT. The addition of bortezomib has no impact on survival or incidence of GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

We showed here that DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and apoptosis were aggravated during rat silicosis induced by SiO2 exposure. Ac-SDKP attenuates lung parenchymal distortion and collagen deposition, and decreases the expression of gammaH2AX, p21, and cleaved caspase-3, as well as improves the reduction of pulmonary function caused by silicosis. In vitro, we found an evolution of smooth muscle actin alpha (alpha-SMA), collagen type I (Col I) in both A549 and MRC-5 cells in response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta1)+SiO2. Only A549 cells showed any reduction in the rate of apoptosis induced by the double stimulation, because of the anti-apoptotic effects of TGF-beta1. N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is an anti-fibrotic tetrapeptide. It also has the ability to promote the apoptosis of leukemia cells. However its role in promoting cell apoptosis in silicosis is still unknown. We here found that Ac-SDKP could induce cell apoptosis and inhibit fibrotic response in A549 and MRC-5 cells treated with TGF-beta1+SiO2, and these effects depended on regulation of alpha-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (alpha-TAT1).

Our previous results demonstrated that maternal microRNAs secreted into the endometrial fluid, specifically miR-30d, act as a transcriptomic regulator of the preimplantation embryo by the maternal intrauterine environment. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the reproductive and fetal effects of murine miR-30d deficiency at the maternal-embryonic interface according to the origin of its maternal or embryonic default. STUDY DESIGN: A miR-30d knockout murine model was used as the animal model to investigate the impact of maternal and/or embryonic origin of miR-30d deficiency on embryonic implantation and fetal development. Wild-type and miR-30d knockout pseudopregnant mice were used to study the effect of miR-30d deficiency on the receptivity markers by means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. We assessed receptivity markers and implantation rates in 6 different transfer conditions in which embryos obtained from wild-type, knockout, and knockout embryos pretreated with a miR-30d analog were transferred into either wild-type or knockout pseudopregnant females. The impact of miR-30d deficiency on fetal development was evaluated by analyzing the implantation sites and resorbing sites under physiological conditions at days 5, 6, 8, and 12 of pregnancy. Fetal growth was evaluated by analyzing fetuses and placentas at days 12 and 16 of pregnancy. RESULTS: Maternal miR-30d deficiency induced a significant downregulation of endometrial receptivity markers. In wild-type recipients, miR-30d knockout embryos had poorer implantation rates than wild-type embryos (48.86 +/- 14.33% vs 75.00 +/- 10.47%, respectively, P = .0061). In miR-30d knockout recipients, the lowest implantation rate was observed when knockout embryos were transferred compared to wild-type embryos (26.04 +/- 7.15% and 49.71 +/- 8.59%, respectively, P = .0059). A positive correlation (r = 0.9978) was observed for maternal leukemia inhibitor factor expression with implantation rates. Further, the course of gestation was compromised in miR-30d knockout mothers, which had smaller implantation sites, greater rates of resorption, and fetuses with smaller crown-rump length and fetal/placental weight ratio. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that maternal and/or embryonic miR-30d deficiency impairs embryonic implantation and fetal development in the animal model. This finding adds a novel miRNA dimension to the understanding of pregnancy and fetal growth restriction in humans.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We analysed long-term follow-up outcomes of these patients. METHODS: ALLR3 was an open-label randomised clinical trial that recruited children aged 1-18 years with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who had late bone marrow relapses. Eligible patients were recruited from centres in Australia, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK. Patients were randomly assigned from Jan 31, 2003, to Dec 31, 2007, and the trial closed to recruitment on Oct 31, 2013. Randomly assigned patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation; after randomisation stopped in Dec 31, 2007, all patients were allocated to receive mitoxantrone. After three blocks of therapy, patients with high minimal residual disease (>/=10(-4) cells) at the end of induction were allocated to undergo allogeneic stem-cell transplantation and those with low minimal residual disease (<10(-4) cells) at the end of induction were allocated to receive chemotherapy. Minimal residual disease level was measured by real-time quantitative PCR analysis of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. The primary endpoint of the original ALLR3 clinical trial was progression-free survival of randomly assigned patients. The primary endpoint of this long-term follow-up analysis was progression-free survival of patients with late bone marrow relapses stratified by minimal residual disease level. Outcomes were correlated with age, site, time to recurrence, and genetic subtypes, and analysed by both intention to treat and actual treatment received. This trial is registered on the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN45724312, and on ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00967057. FINDINGS: Between Feb 2, 2003, and Oct 28, 2013, 228 patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and late bone marrow relapses were treated. After a median follow-up of 84 months (IQR 48-109), progression-free survival of all randomly assigned patients was 60% (95% CI 54-70). 220 patients achieved second complete remission, and minimal residual disease was evaluable in 192 (87%). 110 patients with late bone marrow relapses and high minimal residual disease at the end of induction were allocated to undergo stem-cell transplantation, and 82 patients with low minimal residual disease at the end of induction were allocated to receive chemotherapy. In the patients allocated to undergo stem-cell transplantation, four relapses and three deaths were reported before the procedure, and 11 patients were not transplanted. Of the 92 patients transplanted, 58 (63%) remained in second complete remission, 13 (14%) died of complications, and 21 (23%) relapsed after stem-cell transplantation. In patients allocated to receive chemotherapy, one early treatment-related death was reported and 11 patients were transplanted. Of the 70 patients who continued on chemotherapy, 49 (70%) remained in second complete remission, two (3%) died of complications, and 19 (27%) relapsed. Progression-free survival at 5 years was 56% (95% CI 46-65) in those with high minimal residual disease and 72% (60-81) in patients with low minimal residual disease (p=0.0078). Treatment-related serious adverse events were not analysed in the long-term follow-up. INTERPRETATION: Patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukaemia with late bone marrow relapses and low minimal residual disease at end of induction had favourable outcomes with chemotherapy without undergoing stem-cell transplantation. Patients with high minimal residual disease benefited from stem-cell transplantation, and targeted therapies might offer further improvements in outcomes for these patients.

Phospho-array assay shows that multiple phosphorylated proteins, particularly KIT signaling molecules, were downregulated in PPFIA1 inhibition. Additionally, PPFIA1 bound PARP1, a common molecule downstream of both PPFIA1 and BCR/ABL, to upregulate KIT protein through activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)-P65 expression. Targeted inhibition of PPFIA1 and PARP1 downregulated c-KIT level, inhibited CML cell growth, and prolonged mouse survival.

Unfortunately these intensive chemotherapeutic regimes, often show disappointing results due to the development of drug resistance and higher nonspecific toxicity on normal tissues. In cancer treatment, it is critically important to minimize toxicity while preserving efficacy. We have previously addressed this issue and proposed a nanoparticle-based combination therapy involving both a molecularly targeted therapy and chemotherapeutic agent for neutralizing antiapoptotic survivin (BIRC5) to potentiate the efficacy of doxorubicin (DOX). Although the particles exhibited strong anticancer effect on the lung carcinoma A549 and the cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, there were lower-level therapeutic outcomes on the colon carcinoma HCT-116, the leukemia Jurkat and the pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells. Since targeted therapies are one of the key approaches for overcoming drug resistance, tailoring the treatment of cancer cells with distinct characteristics is necessary to improve the therapeutic outcome of cancer therapy and to minimize potential pharmacokinetic interactions of drugs. In the light of this issue, this study examined whether a cascade therapy with low-dose DOX and survivin-targeted tailored nanoparticles is more effective at sensitizing HCT-116, Jurkat and MIA PaCa-2 cancer cells to DOX-chemotherapy than simultaneous combination therapy. The results demonstrated that the sequential therapy with the protocol comprising addition of the nanoparticles after incubation of cells with DOX clearly advanced the therapeutic outcome of related cancer cells, whereas the reverse protocol resulted in a reduction or delay in apoptosis, emphasizing the critical importance of formulating synergistic drug combinations in cancer therapy.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we show that activin A, a member of the TGF-beta family induced under inflammatory conditions, inhibits the proliferation of normal progenitor B cells but not that of preleukemic TEL-AML1-positive clones, thereby providing a selective advantage to the latter. Finally, we find that activin A inhibits BM-derived mesenchymal stromal cell-mediated secretion of CXCL12, a major chemoattractant in the BM compartment, thereby contributing to shape a leukemia-promoting environment.

We aimed to examine the effect of different feeder layer on proliferation of SSCs. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we compared the in vitro effects of the co-culture of mouse SSCs with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), sandos inbred mice (SIM) embryo-derived thioguanine- and ouabainresistant (STO) feeders, and neonate and adult testicular stroma cell (TSC) feeders on the efficiency of mouse SSC proliferation and colony formation. Cells were cultivated on top of MEFs, STO, and neonate and adult TSCs feeder layers for 30 days. The number and diameter of colonies and also the number of cells were evaluated during day 7, 15, 25, and 30 of culture. The mRNA expression of germ cells and somatic cells were analyzed. Results: In our study, we observed a significant difference in the proliferation rates and colony size of SSCs among the groups, especially for MEFs (P<0.05). SSCs can proliferate on MEFS, but not on STO, neonate or adult TSCs. Using immunocytochemistry by KI67 the proliferative activities of SSC colonies on MEFs were confirmed. The results of Fluidigm real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed a high expression of the germ cell genes the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), deleted in azoospermia-like (DAZL), octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4), and DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 4 (DDX4 or VASA) in SSCs, and a low expression of these genes in the feeder layers. Furthermore, we observed a higher expression of vimentin and integrin-B1 in feeder layers than in SSCs (P<0.05). Conclusion: Based on the optimal effect of MEFs for better colonization of SSCs, these feeder cells seem to be appropriate candidates for SSC cultures prior to transplantation. Therefore, it is suggested using these feeder cells for SSC cultivation.",['Copyright(c) by Royan Institute.

The secretion of these agents from MVs can affect the vital processes of LCs such as cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. According to the effects of MVs components on the vital processes of LCs, it has been postulated that a change in the expression of MVs might be involved in the progression and prognosis of leukemia.

Occupational exposure to styrene causes pulmonary, neurological, genetic and ocular complications, and leukemia and affects reproduction. The aim of this study was to assess the health risks of exposure to styrene in the electronics industry of Neyshabur, Iran. This descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study was carried out in three electronics industries, in Neyshabur city, in 2017-2018. Occupational exposure to styrene was measured according to the NIOSH1501 method, using a low-flow rate sampling pump (0.2 L/min) and an active charcoal absorber tube. Health risk assessment was done according to the Singapore semi-quantitative method and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (OEHHA) method. The average occupational exposure to styrene in men employed in the compact plastic parts production halls was 79.61 mg m(-3) (range 28-208.33). 45.8% of exposed subjects (27 people) encountered exposure above the permitted limit. The average lifetime carcinogenic risk of styrene was 1.4 x 10(-3); therefore, 100% (59 people) had a definite risk of getting cancer. The highest lifetime risk of getting cancer was observed in plastic injection device users (1.9 x 10(-3)) and then in shift managers (1.6 x 10(-3)). The results of this study indicate a definite risk of getting cancer for all workers. Strategies to reduce workers exposure to styrene through engineering controls and routine measurements are necessary.",,"['Mohammadyan, Mahmoud', 'Moosazadeh, Mahmood', 'Borji, Abasalt', 'Khanjani, Narges', 'Rahimi Moghadam, Somayeh', 'Behjati Moghadam, Ali Mohammad']","['Mohammadyan M', 'Moosazadeh M', 'Borji A', 'Khanjani N', 'Rahimi Moghadam S', 'Behjati Moghadam AM']","['Health Sciences Research Center, Addiction Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Mazandaran, Iran.', 'Health Sciences Research Center, Addiction Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Mazandaran, Iran.', 'Basic Sciences Department, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Neyshabur, Iran.', 'Environmental Health Engineering Research Center, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Occupational Health Department, Faculty of Health, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Neyshabur, Iran. s.rahimimoghadam@gmail.com.', 'Student Research Committee, Health Sciences Research Center, Addiction Institute, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, Sari, Iran. s.rahimimoghadam@gmail.com.', 'BSc, Neyshabur University of Medical Sciences, Neyshabur, Iran.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2633-8881'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190301,Germany,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,Environmental science and pollution research international,9441769,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Plastics)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/*analysis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Electronics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'Plastics/analysis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Styrene/*analysis', 'United States']",['NOTNLM'],"['Electronics industries', 'Occupational exposure', 'Risk assessment', 'Styrene']",2019/03/03 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/03/03 06:00'],"['2018/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11356-019-04582-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s11356-019-04582-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Environ Sci Pollut Res Int. 2019 Apr;26(12):11920-11927. doi: 10.1007/s11356-019-04582-8.

Pyridazinones are well known for their anti-microbial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, and cardiovascular activities, among others. In this study, we evaluated the anti-cancer activity of a new pyridazinone derivative and propose it as a potential anti-neoplastic agent in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Pyr-1 cytotoxicity was assessed on several human cancer and two non-cancerous cell lines by the DNS assay. Pyr-1 demonstrated potent cytotoxicity against 22 human cancer cell lines, exhibiting the most favorable selective cytotoxicity on leukemia (CEM and HL-60), breast (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468), and lung (A-549) cancer cell lines, when compared with non-cancerous breast epithelial MCF-10A cells. Analyses of apoptosis/necrosis pathways, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondria health, caspase-3 activation, and cell cycle profile were performed via flow cytometry. Both hmox-1 RNA and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting assays, respectively. Pyr-1 induced apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia cells as confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization, mitochondrial depolarization, caspase-3 activation, DNA fragmentation, and disrupted cell cycle progression. Additionally, it was determined that Pyr-1 generates oxidative and proteotoxic stress by provoking the accumulation of ROS, resulting in the overexpression of the stress-related hmox-1 mRNA transcripts and protein and a marked increase in poly-ubiquitinated proteins. Our data demonstrate that Pyr-1 induces cell death via the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by accumulating ROS and by impairing proteasome activity.",,"['Gutierrez, Denisse A', 'DeJesus, Rebecca E', 'Contreras, Lisett', 'Rodriguez-Palomares, Isela A', 'Villanueva, Paulina J', 'Balderrama, Karol S', 'Monterroza, Lenore', 'Larragoity, Manuel', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando', 'Aguilera, Renato J']","['Gutierrez DA', 'DeJesus RE', 'Contreras L', 'Rodriguez-Palomares IA', 'Villanueva PJ', 'Balderrama KS', 'Monterroza L', 'Larragoity M', 'Varela-Ramirez A', 'Aguilera RJ']","['The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'The Cytometry, Screening, and Imaging Core Facility, Border Biomedical Research Center, Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA. raguilera@utep.edu.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3765-2793'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190301,Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Ubiquitinated Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Necrosis/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridazines/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Ubiquitinated Proteins', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Anti-cancer', '*Apoptosis', '*Proteasome inhibition', '*Pyridazinone', '*ROS', '*hmox-1']",2019/03/03 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/03/03 06:00'],"['2018/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10565-019-09466-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s10565-019-09466-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2019 Dec;35(6):503-519. doi: 10.1007/s10565-019-09466-8.

Meropenem has potent and broad antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, and is recommended as first-line empiric therapy for febrile neutropenia. In contrast, the safety and efficacy of doripenem in patients with febrile neutropenia and hematologic malignancies is limited. In this randomized, prospective, cooperative, open-label trial, we compared doripenem (1.0 g every 8 h) to meropenem (1.0 g every 8 h) as first-line empiric antibacterial treatment of febrile neutropenia. To evaluate efficacy and safety, 133 hospitalized patients with acute leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, who developed febrile neutropenia during or after chemotherapy, were randomized to each drug. Resolution of fever within 3 to 5 days without treatment modification (i.e., the primary endpoint) did not significantly differ between the doripenem and meropenem groups (60.0% vs. 45.6%, respectively; P = 0.136). However, resolution of fever within 7 days of treatment was significantly higher in the doripenem group than in the meropenem group (78.4% vs. 60.2%, respectively; P = 0.037). Similar rates of adverse events (grades 1-2) were observed in both groups. Thus, we conclude that both drugs are safe and well-tolerated for the treatment of febrile neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and that the clinical efficacy of doripenem is noninferior to that of meropenem.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All Mayo Clinic patients with World Health Organization-defined MPNs constituted the core study group and included those with polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). RESULTS: A total of 3023 consecutive patients (median age, 62 years; range, 18-96 years) were considered: 665 PV, 1076 ET, and 1282 PMF. From October 27, 1967, through December 29, 2017, 1631 deaths (54%), 183 leukemic transformations (6%), 244 fibrotic progressions (14%), and 516 thrombotic events (17%) were recorded. Median overall survival (OS) was 18 years for ET, 15 years for PV, and 4.4 years for PMF (P<.05 for all intergroup comparisons). Inferior survival was documented in patients with ET diagnosed more recently (post-1990) (P<.001), whereas survival data were time independent in PV and PMF. After conventional risk stratification, OS in low-risk ET and low-risk PV were superimposed (P=.89) but each differed significantly from that of age- and sex-matched controls (P<.001). Leukemia-free survival was similar for ET and PV (P=.22) and significantly worse with PMF (P<.001). Compared with ET, PV was associated with higher risk of fibrotic progression (P<.001). Thrombosis risk after diagnosis was highest in PV and lowest in PMF (P=.002 for PV vs ET; P=.56 for ET vs PMF; and P=.001 for PV vs PMF). CONCLUSION: This study provides the most mature survival and outcomes data in MPNs and highlights MPN subgroup risk categorization as key in appraising disease natural history. The OS was only marginally better in ET compared with PV, and PV displayed a higher risk of thrombosis and fibrotic progression.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

Super-resolution microcopy was used to examine the structural response of PML bodies in wild-type or the S214L mutant cells upon drug treatment. Different protein density and fluidity were identified with the S214L mutant PML bodies by single particle quantification and FRAP analysis. We discovered that altered SUMOylation and ubiquitination might contribute to the drug resistance. Taken together, we have revealed that the S214L mutation on PML-RARalpha disrupted the organization of PML body and dynamics changes, perturbing structural responses to ATRA and subsequent oncoprotein degradation.

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, The Children's Hospital, Lahore, from October 2016 to November 2017. METHODOLOGY: Children with malignant mediastinal masses were enrolled. The variables studied were median age at presentation, gender distribution, immunisation status, socio-economic background, causes of delayed presentation, presenting complaints, complications of disease, methods for mass biopsy, final diagnosis, staging, and outcome of the disease. Results were described in terms of descriptive statistics. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis was 7.5 years with male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The commonest presenting complaint was fever (82%), respiratory distress (58%), and lymphadenopathy (51%). Seventy-eight percent patients belonged to lower socio-economic class. Eighty-six percent of patients had delayed presentation to the tertiary care hospital and the most common reason was delayed diagnosis by the medical professionals (49%). Fifty-one percent patients had weight-for-age less than 5th percentile. Common complications were airway obstruction (35%), pericardial effusion (19.6%), superior vena cava syndrome and gross pleural effusion (13.7% each). Commonest diagnosis was T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (35%) followed by lymphoblastic lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma (15.7% each). Fourtyfive percent patients expired, 2% defaulted treatment and 5.9% completed treatment; 25% patients were under treatment, 3.9% patients had progressive disease while outcome of 17.6% of patients could not be known. The most significant factor associated with the outcome primary diagnosis (p<0.001), delayed presentation (p=0.007) and educational status of the family. CONCLUSION: The pattern of clinical presentation, complications and diagnoses of pediatric malignant mediastinal masses showed some variation from the already reported.

STUDY DESIGN: An experimental study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics, The Affiliated Hospital North China University of Science and Technology, China, from September 2016 to February 2018. METHODOLOGY: One hundred and sixty patients with gestational hypertension were randomly divided into a control group and an observation group, 80 patients in each group. Control group was given magnesium sulfate alone, while observation group was added with phentolamine and nifedipine on the basis of the treatment in control group. Curative effects, pregnancy outcomes, and levels of serum LIF and Apelin were compared. RESULTS: The total effective rate of treatment in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (p=0.005). After treatment, level of serum LIF in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (p<0.001), and level of serum Apelin in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (p<0.001). Incidence of premature birth, cesarean section and neonatal asphyxia in the observation group were all lower than those in the control group (p=0.005, p<0.001 and p=0.005, respectively), while there was no significant difference in the incidence of neonatal death between the two groups (p=0.316).

This study evaluated patterns of use of oral agents in a larger population across multiple hematologic malignancies. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy and prescribed oral targeted therapy between 2011 and 2016 (N = 18,976) were identified from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters, and Medicare Supplemental databases. Eligible patients were enrolled in monthly prescription plans 6 months before and 12 months after the index date (date of first prescription claim; n = 2442). Multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine predictors of adherence using the medication possession ratio (MPR) and persistence through prescription refill gaps. RESULTS: The overall median adherence was 0.9 (MPR >/= 80%) and was comparable between once-daily (QD) and twice-daily (BID) groups. Overall, 59% of patients were persistent at 12 months. Patients on QD and BID products did not have any significant differences in adherence (fixed-interval MPR, odds ratio 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.75-1.18) or persistence (odds ratio 0.93; 95% CI, 0.75-1.17) 12 months from index. Significant predictors of adherence and persistence included patient age, total inpatient admissions, number of adverse events, and total hospital visits. CONCLUSION: Patient-specific clinical factors, rather than regimen-specific factors, were the main predictors of oral targeted therapy adherence and persistence.

It is possible to encode the update rules in the topology of the so-called expanded graph, analysis of which reveals the long-term behavior, or attractors, of the network. Here, we develop an algorithm to perturb the expanded graph (or, equivalently, the logical update rules) to eliminate stable motifs: subgraphs that cause a subset of components to stabilize to one state. Depending on the topology of the expanded graph, these perturbations lead to the modification or loss of the corresponding attractor. While most perturbations of biological regulatory networks in the literature involve the knockout (fixing to OFF) or constitutive activation (fixing to ON) of one or more nodes, we here consider edgetic perturbations, where a node's update rule is modified such that one or more of its regulators is viewed as ON or OFF regardless of its actual state. We apply the methodology to two biological networks. In a network representing T-LGL leukemia, we identify edgetic perturbations that eliminate the cancerous attractor, leaving only the healthy attractor representing cell death. In a network representing drought-induced closure of plant stomata, we identify edgetic perturbations that modify the single attractor such that stomata, instead of being fixed in the closed state, oscillates between the open and closed states.",,"['Campbell, Colin', 'Albert, Reka']","['Campbell C', 'Albert R']","['Department of Physics, Washington College, Chestertown, Maryland 21620, USA.', 'Department of Physics, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000000337707432', 'ORCID: 0000000294850828']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Chaos,"Chaos (Woodbury, N.Y.)",100971574,,,,,,2019/03/03 06:00,2019/03/03 06:01,['2019/03/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/03 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1063/1.5083060 [doi]'],ppublish,Chaos. 2019 Feb;29(2):023130. doi: 10.1063/1.5083060.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DCA also seems to have antileukemic activity. In order to affirm it we investigate the effect of DCA on cell viability and apoptotic gene expression profiles in leukemia cell lines: CEM/C1, CCRF/CEM, HL-60, HL-60/MX2. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue staining. The expression of 93 genes involved in the process of apoptosis was determined by real-time PCR method using Taqman Low Density Array (TLDA). RESULTS: CEM/C1, CCRF/CEM, HL-60, HL-60/MX2 cells were exposed to DCA for 24 h. The sensitivity of each cell line to DCA is different and depends on the concentration. CEM/C1 was the most sensitive with an half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 30 mM, while HL-60/MX2 was the most resistant with an IC50 value of 75 mM. Exposure of leukemia cells to DCA causes differences in gene expression profiles which cannot indicate that any particular pathway of apoptosis is initiated. However, the presence of 388 statistically significant correlations between expression pattern of gens was determined. CONCLUSION: We showed that DCA causes a decrease in viability of leukemia cells. The decline depends on DCA concentration. The induction of any particular apoptosis pathway is not shown in cells after DCA treatment. For that reason, studies on the molecular mechanism of cell death after exposure to DCA should be continued.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, imatinib resistance remains a common clinical issue. Andrographolide, the major compound of the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata, was reported to exhibit anticancer activity. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of andrographolide and its derivative, NCTU-322, against both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant human CML cell lines. Both andrographolide and NCTU-322 downregulated the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in imatinib-resistant CML cells through an Hsp90-dependent mechanism similar to that observed in imatinib-sensitive CML cells. In addition, NCTU-322 had stronger effects than andrographolide on downregulation of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, induction of Hsp90 cleavage and cytotoxicity of CML cells. Notably, andrographolide and NCTU-322 could induce differentiation, mitotic arrest and apoptosis of both imatinib-sensitive and imatinib-resistant CML cells. Finally, the anticancer activity of NCTU-322 against imatinib-resistant CML cells was demonstrated in vivo. In summary, our data demonstrated that andrographolide and NCTU-322 inhibit Bcr-abl function via a mechanism different from that of imatinib, and they induced multiple anticancer effects in both imatinib-sensitive and resistant CML cells. Our findings demonstrate that andrographolide and NCTU-322 are potential therapeutic agents again CML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been suggested that functions of FA genes are required to maintain genome stability by counteracting endogenous metabolites, such as aldehydes, that damage DNA and stall replication forks. Recent studies have implicated co-transcriptional R-loops, consisting of a DNA:RNA hybrid and displaced single-stranded DNA, as one of the potential endogenous sources that induce genome instability and the FA phenotype. This review focuses on recent literature, including our own, regarding the interplay between FA proteins and R-loops, and will provide readers with a concise summary of this rapidly evolving field.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

In Western societies, Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia has a distinct epidemiology peaking at 3 years old. Exposure to ionising radiation is an established hazard but it is difficult to gauge the precise risk of less than 100 mSv. Since 1983 significant leukaemia incidences have been reported among families residing near nuclear installations. The target cells (naive neonatal lymphocytes) get exposed to multiple xenobiotic challenges and undergo extraordinary proliferation and physiological somatic genetic change. Population movements and ionising radiation are considered taking account of updated understanding of radiation biology, cancer cytogenetics and immunological diversity. Double Strand Breaks in DNA arise through metabolic generation of Reactive Oxygen Species, and nearly always are repaired; but mis-repairs can be oncogenic. Recombinant Activating Gene enzymes in rapidly dividing perinatal pre-B lymphocytes being primed for antibody diversity are targeted to Signal Sequences in the Immunoglobulin genes. off target pseudo-sequences may allow RAG enzymes to create autosomal DSBs which, when mis-repaired, become translocated oncogenes. Immunogens acting by chance at crucial stages may facilitate this.

This rapid progress in technology has urged more countries and institutions to keep pace with the fast-growing and developing technology of producing CAR T cell-based therapies in the race to develop new cancer-targeting drugs. Hence, for stepping in line with global advances and to pave the way for subsequent preclinical and clinical studies, we have established a development protocol for a cancer-targeting CAR T cell; we have chosen CD19 CAR T cell as a well-defined model to set-up T cell expansion, activation, and viral transduction as the prerequisites for diverse CAR T cell therapies. METHODS: T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were activated and expanded. CD19 CAR lentiviral particles were produced in the Lenti-X 293T Cell Line using PolyFect Transfection Reagent. RESULTS: Activation protocol resulted in (65 +/- 4%; P = 0.046) increase in the rate of activated T cells 24 hours after the initiation of the procedure. The expansion methodology resulted in a high purity of the T cell population (96 +/- 3%) in the pool of PBMCs within 14 days of the procedure. Finally, 35 +/- 6% of T cells were transduced with CD19 lentivirus with MOI of 3. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the results of this study prove that we have successfully overcome the first hurdle on the road to reach CAR T cell technology which is the prerequisite for developing preclinical and clinical phases of CAR therapy in settings with basic resources.","['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

The completeness (percentage of study subjects with CCoD) and accuracy (number of subjects with correct CoD from the total number of study subjects) of the GDR were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 3,766 matched cases were enrolled. Overall, the completeness and accuracy of the GDR for identifying CCoD were 92.7% and 53.2%, respectively. There were variations by cancer site and age group, with completeness and accuracy highest for brain cancer (96.3%) and leukaemia (79.8%) while the lowest accuracy was observed for colorectal cancer (29.9%). The completeness and accuracy of GDR was higher in patients aged under 60 years (95.7% and 53.6%, respectively). We also found higher completeness (93.7%) and accuracy (55.8%) in residents of rural areas. CONCLUSION: Linkage of death registry data with cancer registry data can be a significant resource for evaluating quality of the death registry data. Our findings suggested that completeness of the GDR for identifying CCoD is reasonable, but accuracy is relatively low. Access to clinical and pathological data from other sources and enhanced training of death certifiers can improve the present situation.","['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

SLIT-ROBO expression is altered in many tumours. However, no data exist about the role of the whole family in acute myelogenous myeloid leukemia (AML). PURPOSE: Herein, we assessed the expression of all SLIT-ROBO family in bone marrow (BM) biopsy of AML patients and control group on both protein and RNA levels. METHODS: The paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were subjected to immunohistochemistry for SLIT1, SLIT2, SLIT3, ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3, and ROBO4. Microvessel density (MVD) was evaluated by CD34 immunohistochemistry. An in silico analysis using The Cancer Genome Atlas data repository was conducted for assessment of RNA level. RESULTS: Acute myeloid leukemia patients were generally high expressers of ROBO1 and ROBO2 compared to the controls (p < 0.0001, p < 0.001, respectively). In contrast, low expression of SLIT1, SLIT2, and SLIT3 ligands has been noted more commonly in AML than in control BM samples (p < 0.0001, p = 0.003, and p = 0.001, respectively). ROBO4 expression correlated with MVD. The in silico analysis showed a poor prognostic value of high ROBO3 and low SLIT2 RNA levels (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0008, respectively), as well as high ROBO3 and ROBO4 RNA levels in cytogenetic poor risk groups of patients (p = 0.0029 and p = 0.0003, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that SLIT-ROBO family members play a role in the biology of AML. Low expression of SLIT in BM of AML patients may suggest its expression alterations in AML. Increased expression of ROBO1 and ROBO2 in AML patients suggests their participation in AML pathogenesis.",,"['Golos, Aleksandra', 'Jesionek-Kupnicka, Dorota', 'Gil, Lidia', 'Braun, Marcin', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka']","['Golos A', 'Jesionek-Kupnicka D', 'Gil L', 'Braun M', 'Komarnicki M', 'Robak T', 'Wierzbowska A']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland. alexandra_golos@tlen.pl.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland. alexandra_golos@tlen.pl.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.', 'Postgraduate School of Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University, Lodz, Poland.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7780-3587'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190228,Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (ROBO2 protein, human)', '0 (ROBO3 protein, human)', '0 (ROBO4 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (SLIT1 protein, human)', '0 (SLIT3 protein, human)', '0 (roundabout protein)', 'R6FXH13RRC (Slit homolog 2 protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Axon Guidance', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Angiogenesis', 'Nerve tissue proteins', 'ROBO protein', 'SLIT protein']",2019/03/02 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2019/03/02 06:00'],"['2018/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00005-019-00535-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s00005-019-00535-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2019 Apr;67(2):109-123. doi: 10.1007/s00005-019-00535-8.

Activating mutations in FLT3 occur in 25-30% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. Most common are internal tandem duplications of sequence (ITD) leading to constitutive FLT3-ITD kinase activity with an altered signalling quality promoting leukaemic cell transformation. Here, we observed the attenuating role of the receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) CD45/Ptprc in FLT3 signalling in vivo. Low level expression of this abundant RPTP correlates with a poor prognosis of FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients. To get a further insight into the regulatory role of Ptprc in FLT3-ITD activity in vivo, Ptprc knock-out mice were bred with FLT3-ITD knock-in mice. Inactivation of the Ptprc gene in FLT3-ITD mice resulted in a drastically shortened life span and development of severe monocytosis, a block in B-cell development and anaemia. The myeloproliferative phenotype was associated with extramedullary haematopoiesis, splenohepatomegaly and severe alterations of organ structures. The phenotypic alterations were associated with increased transforming signalling of FLT3-ITD, including activation of its downstream target STAT5. These data reveal the capacity of Ptprc for the regulation of FLT3-ITD signalling activity in vivo.

It causes asparagine deficit, resulting in protein synthesis inhibition and subsequent leukemic cell death and ALL remission. However, patients often relapse because of the development of resistance, but the underlying mechanism of ALL cell resistance to l-asparaginase remains unknown. Through unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screening, we identified huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP1) as an ALL biomarker for l-asparaginase resistance. Knocking down HAP1 induces l-asparaginase resistance. HAP1 interacts with huntingtin and the intracellular Ca(2+) channel, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor to form a ternary complex that mediates endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca(2+) release upon stimulation with inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate3 Loss of HAP1 prevents the formation of the ternary complex and thus l-asparaginase-mediated ER Ca(2+) release. HAP1 loss also inhibits external Ca(2+) entry, blocking an excessive rise in [Ca(2+)]i, and reduces activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent calpain-1, Bid, and caspase-3 and caspase-12, leading to reduced number of apoptotic cells. These findings indicate that HAP1 loss prevents l-asparaginase-induced apoptosis through downregulation of the Ca(2+)-mediated calpain-1-Bid-caspase-3/12 apoptotic pathway. Treatment with BAPTA-AM [1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester)] reverses the l-asparaginase apoptotic effect in control cells, supporting a link between l-asparaginase-induced [Ca(2+)]i increase and apoptotic cell death. Consistent with these findings, ALL patient leukemic cells with lower HAP1 levels showed resistance to l-asparaginase, indicating the clinical relevance of HAP1 loss in the development of l-asparaginase resistance, and pointing to HAP1 as a functional l-asparaginase resistance biomarker that may be used for the design of effective treatment of l-asparaginase-resistant ALL.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Lee, Jung Kwon', 'Kang, SungMyung', 'Wang, Xidi', 'Rosales, Jesusa L', 'Gao, Xu', 'Byun, Hee-Guk', 'Jin, Yan', 'Fu, Songbin', 'Wang, Jinghua', 'Lee, Ki-Young']","['Lee JK', 'Kang S', 'Wang X', 'Rosales JL', 'Gao X', 'Byun HG', 'Jin Y', 'Fu S', 'Wang J', 'Lee KY']","['Department of Cell Biology & Anatomy, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Marine Biotechnology, Gangneung-Wonju National University, Gangneung, South Korea; and.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Anatomy, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Anatomy, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Biochemistry & Molecular Biology.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Anatomy, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Biochemistry & Molecular Biology.', 'Department of Marine Biotechnology, Gangneung-Wonju National University, Gangneung, South Korea; and.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, and.', 'Laboratory of Medical Genetics, and.', 'Department of Hematology, Second Affiliated Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Anatomy, Arnie Charbonneau Cancer Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0940-2930', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2543-3801', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8587-6834', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5387-2692']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190228,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (HAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.52 (CAPN1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Calpain/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/03/02 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/03/02 06:00'],"['2018/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42561-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-12-890236 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 May 16;133(20):2222-2232. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-12-890236.

The PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively active in the majority of patients with AML. Given that histone deacetylase inhibitors have been shown to synergize with PI3K inhibitors in preclinical AML models, we investigated the novel dual-acting PI3K and histone deacetylase inhibitor CUDC-907 in AML cells both in vitro and in vivo We demonstrated that CUDC-907 induces apoptosis in AML cell lines and primary AML samples and shows in vivo efficacy in an AML cell line-derived xenograft mouse model. CUDC-907-induced apoptosis was partially dependent on Mcl-1, Bim, and c-Myc. CUDC-907 induced DNA damage in AML cells while sparing normal hematopoietic cells. Downregulation of CHK1, Wee1, and RRM1, and induction of DNA damage also contributed to CUDC-907-induced apoptosis of AML cells. In addition, CUDC-907 treatment decreased leukemia progenitor cells in primary AML samples ex vivo, while also sparing normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.

Median duration of treatment with the last TKI was 77 months [Interquartile Range (IQR) 54;111], median duration of deep molecular response was 46 months (IQR 31;74). Duration of treatment with TKI and duration of deep molecular response were shorter with second generation TKI than with imatinib (P<0.001). Eighty-eight percent of patients discontinued as per clinical practice, and reasons for stopping treatment were: toxicity (20%), pregnancy (6%), and shared decision between treating physician and patient (62%). After a median follow up of 34 months (range, 12-161) overall estimated TFR was 62% (95%CI: 56;68). At 12 months, TFR was 68% (95%CI: 62;74) for imatinib, 73% (95%CI: 64;83) for second generation TKI. Overall median time to restart treatment was six months (IQR 4;11). No progressions occurred. Although our study has the limitation of a retrospective study, our experience within the Italian population confirms that discontinuation of imatinib and second generation TKI is feasible and safe in clinical practice.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Fava, Carmen', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Dogliotti, Irene', 'Cerrano, Marco', 'Berchialla, Paola', 'Dragani, Matteo', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Martino, Bruno', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Capodanno, Isabella', 'Bergamaschi, Micaela', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Rapezzi, Davide', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Cattaneo, Daniele', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'Santoro, Marco', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Giai, Valentina', 'Luciano, Luigia', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Caocci, Giovanni', 'Sora, Federica', 'Iuliano, Francesco', 'Lunghi, Francesca', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Fava C', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Dogliotti I', 'Cerrano M', 'Berchialla P', 'Dragani M', 'Rosti G', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Martino B', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Abruzzese E', 'Elena C', 'Pregno P', 'Gozzini A', 'Capodanno I', 'Bergamaschi M', 'Crugnola M', 'Bocchia M', 'Galimberti S', 'Rapezzi D', 'Iurlo A', 'Cattaneo D', 'Latagliata R', 'Breccia M', 'Cedrone M', 'Santoro M', 'Annunziata M', 'Levato L', 'Stagno F', 'Cavazzini F', 'Sgherza N', 'Giai V', 'Luciano L', 'Russo S', 'Musto P', 'Caocci G', 'Sora F', 'Iuliano F', 'Lunghi F', 'Specchia G', 'Pane F', 'Ferrero D', 'Baccarani M', 'Saglio G']","['Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano carmen.fava@unito.it.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano.', 'Hematology Division, Department of Molecular Biotechnologies and Health Sciences, University of Turin, Turin.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano.', 'Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Orbassano.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L. & A.

Analyzing platelet aggregation response to collagen in platelet-rich plasma allowed us to identify two groups in the healthy population characterized by low or high sensitivity to ibrutinib in vitro Inhibition of drug efflux pumps induced a shift from ibrutinib low-sensitive platelets to high-sensitive ones. At a clinically relevant dose, acalabrutinib, a second-generation BTK inhibitor, did not affect maximal collagen-induced platelet aggregation in the ibrutinib low-sensitive group but did inhibit aggregation in a small fraction of the ibrutinib high-sensitive group. Consistently, acalabrutinib delayed aggregation, particularly in the ibrutinib high-sensitive group. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, acalabrutinib inhibited maximal platelet aggregation only in the ibrutinib high-sensitive group. Acalabrutinib inhibited collagen-induced tyrosine-753 phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma2 in both groups, but, in contrast to ibrutinib, did not affect Src-family kinases. Acalabrutinib affected thrombus growth under flow only in the ibrutinib high-sensitive group and potentiated the effect of cyclooxygenase and P2Y12 receptor blockers in both groups.

Additionally, p66Shc controls the expression and function of chemokine receptors that regulate lymphocyte traffic. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells have a p66Shc expression defect which contributes to their extended survival and correlates with poor prognosis. We analyzed the impact of p66Shc ablation on disease severity and progression in the Emu-TCL1 mouse model of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We showed that Emu-TCL1/p66Shc(-/-) mice developed an aggressive disease that had an earlier onset, occurred at a higher incidence and led to earlier death compared to that in Emu-TCL1 mice. Emu-TCL1/p66Shc(-/-) mice displayed substantial leukemic cell accumulation in both nodal and extranodal sites. The target organ selectivity correlated with upregulation of chemokine receptors whose ligands are expressed therein. This also applied to chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, where chemokine receptor expression and extent of organ infiltration were found to correlate inversely with these cells' level of p66Shc expression. p66Shc expression declined with disease progression in Emu-TCL1 mice and could be restored by treatment with the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib.

Due to the complexity and low throughput of in vivo stem-cell based assays, studying the role of cytokines in the BM niche in a screening setting is challenging. Here, we developed an ex vivo cytokine screen using 11 arrayed molecular barcodes, allowing for a competitive in vivo readout of leukemia-initiating capacity. With this approach, we assessed the effect of 114 murine cytokines on MLL-AF9 AML mouse cells and identified the tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 13 (TNFSF13) as a positive regulator of leukemia-initiating cells. By using Tnfsf13(-/-) recipient mice, we confirmed that TNFSF13 supports leukemia initiation also under physiological conditions. TNFSF13 was secreted by normal myeloid cells but not by leukemia mouse cells, suggesting that mature myeloid BM cells support leukemia cells by secreting TNFSF13. TNFSF13 supported leukemia cell proliferation in an NF-kappaB-dependent manner by binding TNFRSF17 and suppressed apoptosis.

The lack of simple methods for detecting t-loops has hindered progress in understanding the dynamics of t-loop formation and its function in protecting chromosome ends. Here, we employed a classical two-dimensional agarose gel method (2D gel method) to innovatively apply to t-loop detection. Briefly, restriction fragments of genomic DNA were separated in a 2D gel, and the telomere sequence was detected by in-gel hybridization with telomeric probe. Using this method, we found that t-loops are present throughout the cell cycle, and t-loop formation tightly couples to telomere replication. We also observed that t-loop abundance positively correlates with chromatin condensation, i.e. cells with less compact telomeric chromatin (ALT cells and trichostatin A (TSA)-treated HeLa cells) exhibited fewer t-loops. Moreover, we observed that telomere dysfunction-induced foci, ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies, and telomere sister chromatid exchanges are activated upon TSA-induced loss of t-loops.

T cell-based immunotherapy has been progressing over the past several decades, and reached a milestone with the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy for relapsed and refractory leukemia and lymphoma. Although most studies have used viral vectors, a growing number of researchers have come to appreciate in vitro-transcribed (IVT) mRNA for the development, testing, and application of T cell-based immunotherapeutics. IVT mRNA offers inherent safety features, highly efficient recombinant protein translation, and the ability to control pharmacokinetic properties of the therapy. In this review, we discuss the history of IVT mRNA in adoptive T cell therapy, from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and T cell receptor-based therapies to chimeric antigen receptor therapy and gene-editing techniques, as well as prior and ongoing clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

Presence of the H3K36me3 histone mark across the genome has been correlated with transcriptional activation and elongation, but also with the regulation of DNA mismatch repair, homologous recombination and alternative splicing. The role of SETD2 and the H3K36me3 histone mark in cancer is controversial. SETD2 is lost or mutated in various cancers, supporting a tumor suppressive role of the protein. Alterations in the SETD2 gene are also present in leukemia patients, where they are associated with aggressive disease and relapse. In line, heterozygous SETD2 loss caused chemotherapy resistance in leukemia cell lines and mouse models. In contrast, other studies indicate that SETD2 is critically required for the proliferation of leukemia cells. Thus, although studies of SETD2-dependent processes in cancer have contributed to a better understanding of the SETD2(-)H3K36me3 axis, many open questions remain regarding its specific role in leukemia.

However, most diagnostic and prognostic studies with regards to miRNA expression have been focused on combined B cell and T cell lymphoblastic leukemia. There are very few studies reporting the prognostic effects of miRNA expression on T-ALL. Therefore, a pioneer systematic review and meta-analysis was proposed to explore the possibilities of miRNAs as viable prognostic markers in T-ALL. This study is intended to be useful as a guideline for future research into drug evaluation and targeting miRNA as a biomarker for the treatment and prognosis of T-ALL. METHODS: The systematic review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The study search will be conducted by using Cochrane, EMBASE, Medline, Science Direct, and SCOPUS bibliographic databases. The reference lists of included studies will be manually searched to further bolster the search results. A combination of keywords will be used to search the databases. DISCUSSION: To explore the effect of miRNA on prognosis, forest plots will be generated to assess pooled HR and 95% CI. Upregulation, downregulation, and deregulation of specific miRNAs will be individually noted and used to extrapolate patient prognosis when associated with risk factors involved in T-ALL. Subgroup analysis will be carried out to analyze the effect of deregulation of miRNA expression on patient prognosis. A fixed or random-effects model of meta-analysis will be used depending upon between-study heterogeneity. This systematic review and meta-analysis will identify and synthesize evidence to determine the prognosis of miRNA in T-ALL and suggest the possible miRNA from meta-analysis results to predict as a biomarker for further detection and treatment of T-ALL.",,"['Sabarimurugan, Shanthi', 'Madurantakam Royam, Madhav', 'Kumarasamy, Chellan', 'Kodiveri Muthukaliannan, Gothandam', 'Samiappan, Suja', 'Jayaraj, Rama']","['Sabarimurugan S', 'Madurantakam Royam M', 'Kumarasamy C', 'Kodiveri Muthukaliannan G', 'Samiappan S', 'Jayaraj R']","['School of Biosciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, India.', 'School of Biosciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, India.', 'University of Adelaide, North Terrace Campus, Adelaide, Australia.', 'School of Biosciences and Technology, Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT), Vellore, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'College of Health and Human Sciences, Charles Darwin University, Casuarina, Northern Territory, Australia.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', '*Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'MicroRNAs/*blood', '*Observational Studies as Topic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Research Design', 'Risk Factors', '*Systematic Reviews as Topic', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",,,2019/03/01 06:00,2019/03/07 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000014569 [doi]', '00005792-201903010-00014 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Mar;98(9):e14569. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000014569.,PMC6831106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we compared outcome of patients with malignant vs. non-malignant IP in adult North Indian men. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed medical records of patients with IP who presented to a large tertiary care referral center from August 2005 to July 2017. RESULTS: Data of 71 patients were analyzed. The median age was 30 years (range 17-65). The average duration of symptoms was 4.39 days (range 1-10). Most common etiology was idiopathic in 29 (40.84%), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 24 (33.80%), and drug-induced in 15 patients. Thirty-eight patients underwent distal shunts, while nine patients underwent proximal shunt procedure. Men with malignant priapism (CML) had significantly lower success rates with interventions, prolonged hospital stay, and higher complications (p<0.05). Most complications after shunt surgery were minor (Clavein grade 1 and 2). After shunt surgery, bleeding at shunt site was observed in 14 cases, and wound infection developed in five patients. Prevalence of erectile dysfunction in patients at follow-up was high.

TDI-SFC combines the high spectral resolution of spectral flow cytometry (SFC) with a CCD operated in time-delayed integration (TDI) for improved duty cycle and sensitivity. Cells were focused with a 1D-sheathing microfluidic device, and fluorescence emission generated from a 488 nm laser was collected by epi-illumination and dispersed along one axis of a CCD by a spectrograph. Along the other axis, the CCD's shift rate was clocked at a rate that closely matched the cells' velocity through the field of view. This TDI-SFC format allowed the CCD shutter to remain open during signal acquisition, providing a duty cycle approximately 100% and assurance that approximately 95% cells were interrogated. We used fluorescent beads to optimize synchronization of TDI clocking with the sheathed-cell velocity and to improve sensitivity via the excitation intensity, epi-illumination numerical aperture, and integration time. TDI achieved integrated signals of 10(6) counts at a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 610 for beads corresponding to a load of 4 x 10(5) antibodies. We also evaluated multiplexing capabilities by spectral deconvolution and undertook a proof-of-concept application to immunophenotype low-abundance cells; the demonstration consisted of immunophenotyping a model cell line, in this case SUP-B15 cells representing B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The B-ALL cell line was stained against a leukemic marker (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, TdT), and we successfully used spectral unmixing to discriminate TdT(+) cells from TdT(-) cells even at low cell counts ( approximately 100 cells). The TDI-SFC could potentially be used in any application requiring the immunophenotyping of low-abundance cells, such as in monitoring measurable residual disease in acute leukemias following affinity enrichment of circulating leukemia cells from peripheral blood.",,"['Hu, Wenting', 'Soper, Steven A', 'Jackson, J Matt']","['Hu W', 'Soper SA', 'Jackson JM']","['Department of Chemistry , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.', 'Center of BioModular Multi-Scale Systems for Precision Medicine (CBM2) , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.', 'Center of BioModular Multi-Scale Systems for Precision Medicine (CBM2) , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.', 'Department of Mechanical Engineering , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.', 'Department of Cancer Biology , University of Kansas Medical Center , Kansas City , Kansas 66160 , United States.', 'Department of Chemistry , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.', 'Center of BioModular Multi-Scale Systems for Precision Medicine (CBM2) , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66045 , United States.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8292-7058'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20190313,United States,Anal Chem,Analytical chemistry,0370536,"['0 (Antibodies)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Antibodies/chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lasers', 'Microfluidics', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Signal-To-Noise Ratio']",,,2019/03/01 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00021 [doi]'],ppublish,Anal Chem. 2019 Apr 2;91(7):4656-4664. doi: 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b00021.

The introduction of broad spectrum triazoles, which are much better tolerated compared to conventional amphotericin B formulations, has increased survival, particularly in invasive mould infection. However, early initiation of appropriate antifungal treatment remains a major predictor of outcome in invasive mould infection, but despite significant advances in diagnosis of these diseases, early diagnosis remains a challenge. As a result, prophylaxis with mould-active triazoles is widely used for those patients at highest risk for invasive mould infection, including patients with prolonged neutropenia after induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia and patients with graft-versus-host-disease. Posaconazole is the recommended drug of choice for antimould prophylaxis in these high-risk patients. Voriconazole has its primary role in treatment of invasive aspergillosis but not in prophylaxis. Recently, isavuconazole has been introduced as an excellent alternative to voriconazole for primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis in patients with hematological malignancies. Compared to voriconazole, isavuconazole and posaconazole have broader activity against moulds and are therefore also an option for treatment of mucormycosis in the presence of intolerance or contraindications against liposomal amphotericin B.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

However, the functional role of ENDOCAN in the development of leukemia remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression levels of ENDOCAN were detected in THP1, U937, HL60 and K562 cells, and it was found that ENDOCAN was increased in U937 and K562 cells, compared with the other two cell lines. Subsequently, ENDOCAN was knocked down in U937 and K562 cells via lentiviral infection. It was found that cell proliferation and the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen were inhibited in myeloid leukemia cells following the silencing of ENDOCAN. ENDOCAN knockdown induced G0/G1phase cell cycle arrest in myeloid leukemia cells with a decreased expression of cyclin D1. Furthermore, cell apoptosis was increased in response to ENDOCAN silencing, which was accompanied by the downregulation of Bcell lymphoma (BCL2) and the upregulation of BCL2associated X protein, cleaved caspases 3 and 9, and cleaved poly (ADPribose) polymerase. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the knockdown of ENDOCAN inhibited nuclear factorkappaB (NFkappaB) activity, as evidenced by the increased expression of NFkappaB inhibitor alpha (IkappaBalpha), decreased expression of phosphorylated (p)IkappaBalpha, pP65 and nuclear P65, and reduced NFkappaB DNAbinding activity.

Outcomes remain similar for standard and longer PII, and for SER patients assigned to idarubicin/cyclophosphamide and weekly doxorubicin. The EFS and OS advantage of augmented PII is sustained at 10 years for RER patients. Longer PII for RER patients and sequential idarubicin/cyclophosphamide for SER patients offered no advantage.

Its canonical downstream cascade is well known, even though its true complexity and other non-canonical pathways are still being explored. TGFbeta signaling has been described as an important pathway involved in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In the hematopoietic compartment, the TGFbeta pathway is an important regulator of proliferation and differentiation of different cell types and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a diverse variety of bone marrow disorders. Due to its importance in hematological diseases, novel inhibitors of this pathway are being developed against a number of hematopoietic disorders, including myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

Although frequent, the mechanisms by which these abnormalities promote B-ALL remain obscure. Intriguingly, we found copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH) of 12q was recurrent in iAMP21-ALL, but never observed in B-ALL without some form of chromosome 21 gain. As a consequence of CN-LOH 12q, mutations or deletions of the adaptor protein, SH2B3, were converted to homozygosity. In patients without CN-LOH 12q, bi-allelic abnormalities of SH2B3 occurred, but only in iAMP21-ALL, giving an overall incidence of 18% in this sub-type. Review of published data confirmed a tight association between overrepresentation of chromosome 21 and both CN-LOH 12q and SH2B3 abnormalities in B-ALL. Despite relatively small patient numbers, preliminary analysis linked 12q abnormalities to poor outcome in iAMP21-ALL (p = 0.03). Homology modelling of a leukaemia-associated SH2 domain mutation and in vitro analysis of patient-derived xenograft cells implicated the JAK/STAT pathway as one likely target for SH2B3 tumour suppressor activity in iAMP21-ALL.",,"['Sinclair, Paul B', 'Ryan, Sarra', 'Bashton, Matthew', 'Hollern, Shaun', 'Hanna, Rebecca', 'Case, Marian', 'Schwalbe, Edward C', 'Schwab, Claire J', 'Cranston, Ruth E', 'Young, Brian D', 'Irving, Julie A E', 'Vora, Ajay J', 'Moorman, Anthony V', 'Harrison, Christine J']","['Sinclair PB', 'Ryan S', 'Bashton M', 'Hollern S', 'Hanna R', 'Case M', 'Schwalbe EC', 'Schwab CJ', 'Cranston RE', 'Young BD', 'Irving JAE', 'Vora AJ', 'Moorman AV', 'Harrison CJ']","['Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. p.sinclair@newcastle.ac.uk.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS trust, London, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK.', 'Wolfson Childhood Cancer Research Centre, Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. christine.harrison@newcastle.ac.uk.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1190-9469'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190228,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mutation', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/physiology']",,,2019/03/01 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0412-1 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0412-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Aug;33(8):1881-1894. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0412-1.

Balancing increased CAR-T potency with safety, including severe cytokine-release syndrome (sCRS) and neurotoxicity, warrants inclusion of safety mechanisms to control in vivo CAR-T activity. Here, we describe a novel CAR-T cell platform that utilizes expression of the toll-like receptor (TLR) adaptor molecule, MyD88, and tumor-necrosis factor family member, CD40 (MC), tethered to the CAR molecule through an intentionally inefficient 2A linker system, providing a constitutive signal that drives CAR-T survival, proliferation, and antitumor activity against CD19(+) and CD123(+) hematological cancers. Robust activity of MC-enhanced CAR-T cells was associated with cachexia in animal models that corresponded with high levels of human cytokine production. However, toxicity could be successfully resolved by using the inducible caspase-9 (iC9) safety switch to reduce serum cytokines, by administration of a neutralizing antibody against TNF-alpha, or by selecting ""low"" cytokine-producing CD8(+) T cells, without loss of antitumor activity. Interestingly, high basal activity was essential for in vivo CAR-T expansion. This study shows that co-opting novel signaling elements (i.e., MyD88 and CD40) and development of a unique CAR-T architecture can drive T-cell proliferation in vivo to enhance CAR-T therapies.",,"['Collinson-Pautz, Matthew R', 'Chang, Wei-Chun', 'Lu, An', 'Khalil, Mariam', 'Crisostomo, Jeannette W', 'Lin, Pei-Yi', 'Mahendravada, Aruna', 'Shinners, Nicholas P', 'Brandt, Mary E', 'Zhang, Ming', 'Duong, MyLinh', 'Bayle, J Henri', 'Slawin, Kevin M', 'Spencer, David M', 'Foster, Aaron E']","['Collinson-Pautz MR', 'Chang WC', 'Lu A', 'Khalil M', 'Crisostomo JW', 'Lin PY', 'Mahendravada A', 'Shinners NP', 'Brandt ME', 'Zhang M', 'Duong M', 'Bayle JH', 'Slawin KM', 'Spencer DM', 'Foster AE']","['Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, 2130 W.

To assess the susceptibility of adult chickens, quails, and pigeons to ALV-A, three sets of 250-day-old birds were intraperitoneally inoculated with ALV-A. Viremia and cloacal virus shedding were dynamically detected using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA), ALV-P27 antigen ELISA or RT-PCR; pathological lesions were assessed using tissue sections; ALV-A in tissues was detected by IFA; and ALV-A antibody responses were detected using antibody ELISA kits and an immune diffusion test. The results indicated that persistent viremia occurred in 80% (8/10) of infected chickens, and transient viremia occurred in 17% (2/12) of infected quails, but no viremia occurred in infected pigeons. Cloacal virus shedding occurred intermittently in 80% (8/10) of infected chickens and in 8% (1/12) of infected quails but did not occur in infected pigeons. Severe inflammatory pathological lesions occurred in the visceral tissues of most infected chickens, and mild lesions occurred in a few of the infected quails, but no pathological lesions occurred in the infected pigeons. The ALV-A virus was detected in the visceral tissues of most infected chickens but not in the infected quails and pigeons.

Examining the association between male sex and childhood cancer by single year of age and tumor type may highlight important periods of risk such as variation in growth and hormonal changes, which will inform etiologic hypotheses. METHODS: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries (2000-2015), incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were estimated as the measure of association between male sex and childhood cancer by single year of age (0-19). RESULTS: The IRR for male cancer overall was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.18-1.20) and was similar in magnitude at nearly every year of age. Burkitt lymphoma was strongly associated with male sex (IRRs >/=2 at each year of age). Increased incidence was observed among males for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas for nearly all years of age. Medulloblastoma was the only central nervous system tumor with a significant male predominance at nearly every age. Male sex displayed a consistent inverse association with nephroblastoma and thyroid carcinoma over the ages studied. CONCLUSIONS: Male sex was positively associated with most cancers. The higher incidence rates observed in males remained consistent over the childhood and adolescent periods, suggesting that childhood and adolescent hormonal fluctuations may not be the primary driving factor for the sex disparities in childhood cancer. The observed incidence disparities may be due to sex differences in exposures, genetics, or immune responses.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Williams, Lindsay A', 'Richardson, Michaela', 'Marcotte, Erin L', 'Poynter, Jenny N', 'Spector, Logan G']","['Williams LA', 'Richardson M', 'Marcotte EL', 'Poynter JN', 'Spector LG']","['Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3842-4629'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190228,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', '*Sex Ratio', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer incidence', '*epidemiology', '*sex differences']",2019/03/01 06:00,2019/12/19 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27620 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27620. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27620.

This was an open-label, multicenter, phase I study. Seventeen patients (male N = 8) with a median age of 70 years were enrolled in 4 dose cohorts (160 mg once daily [N = 3], 320 mg once daily [N = 3], 480 mg once daily [N = 4] and 300 mg twice daily [N = 7]); 4 patients had continued tirabrutinib administration as of 4 January 2018. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Pneumonitis (N = 1) was the dose-limiting toxicity for 300 mg twice daily. Common adverse events (AEs) were rash (35.3%) and vomiting (29.4%). Eight patients (47.1%) developed grade >/=3 AEs: neutropenia (23.5%), anemia (11.8%) and leukopenia (11.8%) were frequent. The overall response rate (>/=PR) was 76.5% (13/17 patients), including 4 DLBCL patients with no CD79A/B or MYD88 mutations, and 1 CLL patient with a TP53 mutation, providing promising data for future developments. Of 16 patients with measurable lesions during the screening period, 12 showed >/=50% reductions in tumor diameter. In many patients, the tumor size decreased soon after beginning treatment. The maximum serum concentration for tirabrutinib was 611, 1220, 1280 and 886 ng/mL on Day 1 and 484, 971 1940, and 961 ng/mL on Day 28 for Cohorts 1-4, respectively. Tirabrutinib pharmacokinetics were linear, with little accumulation following multiple doses. Tirabrutinib was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy for B-cell NHL/CLL.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

The current use of AsIII in chemotherapy is limited to acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, AsIII was suggested as a potential therapy for other cancer types including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), especially when combined with other drugs. Here, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR-based approach to identify modulators of AsIII toxicity in K562, a human CML cell line. We found that disruption of KEAP1, the inhibitory partner of the key antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2, or TXNDC17, a thioredoxin-like protein, markedly increased AsIII tolerance. Loss of the water channel AQP3, the zinc transporter ZNT1 and its regulator MTF1 also enhanced tolerance to AsIII whereas loss of the multidrug resistance protein ABCC1 increased sensitivity to AsIII. Remarkably, disruption of any of multiple genes, EEFSEC, SECISBP2, SEPHS2, SEPSECS, and PSTK, encoding proteins involved in selenocysteine metabolism increased resistance to AsIII. Our data suggest a model in which an intracellular interaction between selenium and AsIII may impact intracellular AsIII levels and toxicity. Together this work revealed a suite of cellular components/processes which modulate the toxicity of AsIII in CML cells. Targeting such processes simultaneously with AsIII treatment could potentiate AsIII in CML therapy.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Methods: A nationwide HTLV-1 register was created in Spain in 1989. A total of 351 infected persons had been reported by the end of 2017. We examined all new HTLV-1 diagnoses during the last decade and compared their clinical presentation. Results: A total of 247 individuals with HTLV-1 infection had been reported in Spain since year 2008. The incidence has remained stable with 20-25 new diagnoses yearly. Women represented 62%. Only 12% were native Spaniards, most of whom were foreigners from Latin America (72.5%). Up to 57 (23%) individuals presented clinically with HTLV-1-associated conditions, including subacute myelopathy (n = 24; 42.1%), T-cell lymphoma (n = 19; 33.3%), or Strongyloides stercoralis infestation (n = 8; 14%). Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 diagnosis had been made either at blood banks (n = 109; 44%) or at clinics (n = 138; 56%). It is interesting to note that Spaniards and especially Africans were overrepresented among patients presenting with HTLV-1-associated illnesses, suggesting that misdiagnosis and late presentation are more frequent in these populations compared to Latin Americans. Conclusions: Given that 23% of new HTLV-1 diagnoses in Spain are symptomatic, underdiagnosis must be common. Although screening in blood banks mostly identifies asymptomatic Latin American carriers, a disproportionately high number of Spaniards and Africans are unveiled too late, that is, they already suffer from classic HTLV-1 illnesses.",,"['De Mendoza, Carmen', 'Piron, Maria', 'Gonzalez, Rocio', 'Jimenez, Ana', 'Caballero, Estrella', 'Roc, Lourdes', 'Benito, Rafael', 'Ramos, Jose Manuel', 'Soriano, Vicente']","['De Mendoza C', 'Piron M', 'Gonzalez R', 'Jimenez A', 'Caballero E', 'Roc L', 'Benito R', 'Ramos JM', 'Soriano V']","['Puerta de Hierro Research Institute and University Hospital, Majadahonda, Madrid.', 'Blood and Tissue Bank, Barcelona.', 'Regional Transfusion Center, Madrid.', 'Centro de Hemoterapia de Castilla-Leon, Valladolid.', ""Hospital Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona."", 'Hospital Miguel Servet, Zaragoza.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario Lozano Blesa, Zaragoza.', 'General Hospital, Alicante.', 'UNIR Health Sciences School, Madrid.', 'La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190116,United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['HTLV-1', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'epidemiology', 'myelopathy', 'screening']",2019/03/01 06:00,2019/03/01 06:01,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofz036 [doi]', 'ofz036 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2019 Jan 16;6(2):ofz036. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofz036. eCollection 2019 Feb.,PMC6386801,,,,,,['HTLV Spanish Study Group'],,,,,,,,"['Rodriguez C', 'Vera M', 'Del Romero J', 'Marcaida G', 'Ocete MD', 'Caballero E', 'Molina I', 'Aguilera A', 'Rodriguez-Calvino JJ', 'Navarro D', 'Rivero C', 'Vilarino MD', 'Benito R', 'Algarate S', 'Gil J', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu R', 'Rojo S', 'Eiros JM', 'San Miguel A', 'Manzardo C', 'Miro JM', 'Garcia J', 'Paz I', 'Poveda E', 'Calderon E', 'Escudero D', 'Trigo M', 'Diz J', 'Garcia-Campello M', 'Rodriguez-Iglesias M', 'Hernandez-Betancor A', 'Martin AM', 'Ramos JM', 'Gimeno A', 'Gutierrez F', 'Rodriguez JC', 'Sanchez V', 'Gomez-Hernando C', 'Cilla G', 'Perez-Trallero E', 'Lopez-Aldeguer J', 'Fernandez-Pereira L', 'Niubo J', 'Hernandez M', 'Lopez-Lirola AM', 'Gomez-Sirvent JL', 'Force L', 'Cifuentes C', 'Perez S', 'Morano L', 'Raya C', 'Gonzalez-Praetorius A', 'Perez JL', 'Penaranda M', 'Hernaez-Crespo S', 'Montejo JM', 'Roc L', 'Martinez-Sapina A', 'Viciana I', 'Cabezas T', 'Lozano A', 'Fernandez JM', 'Garcia-Bermejo I', 'Gaspar G', 'Garcia R', 'Gorgolas M', 'Vegas C', 'Blas J', 'Miralles P', 'Valeiro M', 'Aldamiz T', 'Margall N', 'Guardia C', 'do Pico E', 'Polo I', 'Aguinaga A', 'Ezpeleta C', 'Sauleda S', 'Piron M', 'Torres P', 'Gonzalez R', 'Jimenez A', 'Blanco L', 'Suarez A', 'Rodriguez-Avial I', 'Perez-Rivilla A', 'Parra P', 'Fernandez M', 'Fernandez-Alonso M', 'Trevino A', 'Requena S', 'Benitez-Gutierrez L', 'Cuervas-Mons V', 'de Mendoza C', 'Barreiro P', 'Soriano V', 'Corral O', 'Gomez-Gallego F']","['Rodriguez, C', 'Vera, M', 'Del Romero, J', 'Marcaida, G', 'Ocete, M D', 'Caballero, E', 'Molina, I', 'Aguilera, A', 'Rodriguez-Calvino, J J', 'Navarro, D', 'Rivero, C', 'Vilarino, M D', 'Benito, R', 'Algarate, S', 'Gil, J', 'Ortiz de Lejarazu, R', 'Rojo, S', 'Eiros, J M', 'San Miguel, A', 'Manzardo, C', 'Miro, J M', 'Garcia, J', 'Paz, I', 'Poveda, E', 'Calderon, E', 'Escudero, D', 'Trigo, M', 'Diz, J', 'Garcia-Campello, M', 'Rodriguez-Iglesias, M', 'Hernandez-Betancor, A', 'Martin, A M', 'Ramos, J M', 'Gimeno, A', 'Gutierrez, F', 'Rodriguez, J C', 'Sanchez, V', 'Gomez-Hernando, C', 'Cilla, G', 'Perez-Trallero, E', 'Lopez-Aldeguer, J', 'Fernandez-Pereira, L', 'Niubo, J', 'Hernandez, M', 'Lopez-Lirola, A M', 'Gomez-Sirvent, J L', 'Force, L', 'Cifuentes, C', 'Perez, S', 'Morano, L', 'Raya, C', 'Gonzalez-Praetorius, A', 'Perez, J L', 'Penaranda, M', 'Hernaez-Crespo, S', 'Montejo, J M', 'Roc, L', 'Martinez-Sapina, A', 'Viciana, I', 'Cabezas, T', 'Lozano, A', 'Fernandez, J M', 'Garcia-Bermejo, I', 'Gaspar, G', 'Garcia, R', 'Gorgolas, M', 'Vegas, C', 'Blas, J', 'Miralles, P', 'Valeiro, M', 'Aldamiz, T', 'Margall, N', 'Guardia, C', 'do Pico, E', 'Polo, I', 'Aguinaga, A', 'Ezpeleta, C', 'Sauleda, S', 'Piron, M', 'Torres, P', 'Gonzalez, R', 'Jimenez, A', 'Blanco, L', 'Suarez, A', 'Rodriguez-Avial, I', 'Perez-Rivilla, A', 'Parra, P', 'Fernandez, M', 'Fernandez-Alonso, M', 'Trevino, A', 'Requena, S', 'Benitez-Gutierrez, L', 'Cuervas-Mons, V', 'de Mendoza, C', 'Barreiro, P', 'Soriano, V', 'Corral, O', 'Gomez-Gallego, F']"

The PI3K and KIT genes are key genes of this pathway. Previous studies have reported the importance of these genes in the development of gastrointestinal carcinoma, leukaemia, and melanomas. The role of mutations and overexpression of PI3K and KIT genes in breast cancer has been previously proved. This study investigates the correlation between PI3K and KIT gene mutations in sporadic breast cancer. Methods: Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique was used to determine the Copy Number Variation (CNV) of PI3K and KIT genes in 34 breast cancer tumours and PCR-sequencing was used to detect the mutation in PI3K exons 9 and 20. Results: Our results reported that 27% of patients had CNV of the KIT gene; whereas, 20% and 17.5% of patients, had mutation and CNV in the PI3K gene, respectively.

However, long term complications of post transplantation interfere with the patients' full recovery. The objective of this review was to identify the various long term complications and to assess their individual prevalences. Methods: Electronic databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and Cochrane were searched for years 2004-2017. The keywords used were leukaemia, allogenic stem cell transplantation, prevalence, side effects, long term, delayed, adverse effects, complications and outcome. Results: A total of ten articles were included for analysis. There were 5 prospective studies, 3 retrospective studies and 2 cross sectional studies. A total of 40,069 patients, (20,189 males and 17,191 females) participated in these 10 studies. The gender of 2689 patients were not disclosed. Most common late complications and prevalence were chronic graft versus host disease (43% at 5 years post HSCT), secondary tumor (21% at 20 years post HSCT), hypothyroidism (11% at 15 years), bronchiolitis obliterans (9.7% at 122 days), cardiovascular disease (7.5% at 15 years) and avascular necrosis (5.4% at 10 years). The prevalence of azoospermia was 71.1% and depression, 18%. For the latter two conditions no time limit was available. Follow up duration ranged from 2 years till 30 years post HSCT.

In MLL rearranged acute leukemia (MLLre) MLL/KMT2A fuses with over 90 partner genes. Mechanistic studies provided clues of MLL fusion protein leukemogenic potential, but models failed to fully recapitulate the disease. Recently, expression of oncogenic fusion circular RNAs (f-circ) by MLL-AF9 fusion was proven. This discovery, together with emerging data on the importance and diversity of circRNAs formed the incentive to study the circRNAs of the MLL recombinome. Through interactions with other RNAs, such as microRNAs, and with proteins, circRNAs regulate cellular processes also related to cancer development. CircRNAs can translate into functional peptides too. MLL and most of the 90 MLL translocation partners do express circRNAs and exploration of our RNA-seq dataset of sorted blood cell populations provided new data on alternative circular isoform generation and expression variability of circRNAs of the MLL recombinome. Further, we provided evidence that rearrangements of MLL and three of the main translocation partner genes can impact circRNA expression, supported also by preliminary observations in leukemic cells. The emerging picture underpins the view that circRNAs are worthwhile to be considered when studying MLLre leukemias and provides a new perspective on the impact of chromosomal translocations in cancer cells at large.",,"['Dal Molin, Anna', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Gaffo, Enrico', 'Tretti, Caterina', 'Boldrin, Elena', 'Meyer, Lueder H', 'Guglielmelli, Paola', 'Vannucchi, Alessandro M', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruij', 'Bortoluzzi, Stefania']","['Dal Molin A', 'Bresolin S', 'Gaffo E', 'Tretti C', 'Boldrin E', 'Meyer LH', 'Guglielmelli P', 'Vannucchi AM', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Bortoluzzi S']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'CRIMM, Center for Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, AOU Careggi, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', 'CRIMM, Center for Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, AOU Careggi, Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, University of Padua, Padua, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190213,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['MLL rearrangements', 'blood cells', 'circRNA', 'fusion-circRNA', 'leukemia', 'translocation breakpoint region']",2019/03/01 06:00,2019/03/01 06:01,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2019.00088 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2019 Feb 13;10:88. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2019.00088. eCollection 2019.,PMC6382020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The miRNAs involved in modulation of apoptotic events in T cells are partially known. However, heterogeneity associated with cell lines makes it difficult to interpret gene expression signatures, especially in cancer-related cell lines. Treatment of the Jurkat T-cell leukemia cell line with the universal apoptotic drug, camptothecin, resulted in identification of two Jurkat subpopulations: one that is sensitive to camptothecin and another that is rather intrinsically resistant. We sorted apoptotic Jurkat cells from nonapoptotic ones prior to profiling miRNAs through deep sequencing. Our data showed that a total of 184 miRNAs were dysregulated. Interestingly, the apoptotic and nonapoptotic subpopulations exhibited distinct miRNA expression profiles. In particular, 6 miRNAs were inversely expressed in these two subpopulations. The pyrosequencing results were validated by real-time qPCR. Altogether, these results suggest that miRNAs modulate apoptotic events in T cells and that cellular heterogeneity requires careful interpretation of miRNA expression profiles obtained from drug-treated cell lines.",,"['Erdogan, Ipek', 'Cosacak, Mehmet Ilyas', 'Nalbant, Ayten', 'Akgul, Bunyamin']","['Erdogan I', 'Cosacak MI', 'Nalbant A', 'Akgul B']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology , Gulbahcekoyu, Urla, Izmir , Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology , Gulbahcekoyu, Urla, Izmir , Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology , Gulbahcekoyu, Urla, Izmir , Turkey.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Izmir Institute of Technology , Gulbahcekoyu, Urla, Izmir , Turkey.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180427,Turkey,Turk J Biol,Turkish journal of biology = Turk biyoloji dergisi,9434434,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Jurkat', 'deep sequencing', 'microRNAs']",2019/03/01 06:00,2019/03/01 06:01,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3906/biy-1710-62 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Biol. 2018 Apr 27;42(2):113-122. doi: 10.3906/biy-1710-62. eCollection 2018.,PMC6353281,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work examines the antitumoral effect of maintained neutrophilia induced via the injection of recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, 100 mug/kg/day) in a Panc-1 subcutaneous xenograft murine model of pancreatic cancer. This treatment was compared with gemcitabine administration (120 mg/kg every two days) and a saline control (n = 6-7 mice per group). Compared to the controls, both the rhG-CSF- and gemcitabine-treated mice showed significantly suppressed tumor growth by day 4 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.013 respectively). From a mean starting volume of 106.9 +/- 3.1 mm(3) for all treatment groups, the final mean tumor volumes reached were 282.0 +/- 30.7 mm(3) for the rhG-CSF-treated mice, 202.6 +/- 18.1 mm(3) for the gemcitabine-treated mice and 519.4 +/- 62.9 mm(3) for the control mice (p < 0.004 and p < 0.01, respectively, vs. control). The rhG-CSF-treated tumors showed higher percentage necrosis than those treated with gemcitabine (37.4 +/- 4.6 vs. 7.5 +/- 3.0; p < 0.001). This is the first report of a clear anti-tumoral effect of rhG-CSF when used in monotherapy against pancreatic cancer.

Consistent with this, host cell multiprotein complexes, such as polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), were proposed to act as epigenetic regulators of herpesviral latency. In particular, PRC2 has recently been shown to contribute to the silencing of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genomes. Here, we identify a novel proviral role of PRC1 and PRC2, the two main polycomb repressive complexes, during productive HCMV infection. Western blot analyses revealed strong HCMV-mediated upregulation of RING finger protein 1B (RING1B) and B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1) as well as of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12), and embryonic ectoderm development (EED), which constitute the core components of PRC1 and PRC2, respectively. Furthermore, we observed a relocalization of PRC components to viral replication compartments, whereas histone modifications conferred by the respective PRCs were specifically excluded from these sites. Depletion of individual PRC1/PRC2 proteins by RNA interference resulted in a significant reduction of newly synthesized viral genomes and, in consequence, a decreased release of viral particles. Furthermore, accelerated native isolation of protein on nascent DNA (aniPOND) revealed a physical association of EZH2 and BMI1 with nascent HCMV DNA, suggesting a direct contribution of PRC proteins to viral DNA replication. Strikingly, substances solely inhibiting the enzymatic activity of PRC1/2 did not exert antiviral effects, while drugs affecting the abundance of PRC core components strongly compromised HCMV genome synthesis and particle release. Taken together, our data reveal an enzymatically independent, noncanonical function of both PRC1 and PRC2 during HCMV DNA replication, which may serve as a novel cellular target for antiviral therapy.IMPORTANCE Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are primarily known as transcriptional repressors that modify chromatin and contribute to the establishment and maintenance of cell fates. Furthermore, emerging evidence indicates that overexpression of PcG proteins in various types of cancers contributes to the dysregulation of cellular proliferation. Consequently, several inhibitors targeting PcG proteins are presently undergoing preclinical and clinical evaluation. Here, we show that infection with human cytomegalovirus also induces a strong upregulation of several PcG proteins. Our data suggest that viral DNA replication depends on a noncanonical function of polycomb repressor complexes which is independent of the so-far-described enzymatic activities of individual PcG factors. Importantly, we observe that a subclass of inhibitory drugs that affect the abundance of PcG proteins strongly interferes with viral replication. This principle may serve as a novel promising target for antiviral treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Microbiology.'],"['Svrlanska, Adriana', 'Reichel, Anna', 'Schilling, Eva-Maria', 'Scherer, Myriam', 'Stamminger, Thomas', 'Reuter, Nina']","['Svrlanska A', 'Reichel A', 'Schilling EM', 'Scherer M', 'Stamminger T', 'Reuter N']","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany thomas.stamminger@uniklinik-ulm.de.', 'Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, Friedrich Alexander Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Erlangen, Germany.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190417,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (BMI1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (EED protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SUZ12 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (EZH2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', '*Virus Replication']",['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA replication', '*HCMV', '*PRC repressor', '*antiviral agents', '*cytomegalovirus', '*polycomb group proteins']",2019/03/01 06:00,2020/01/29 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.02143-18 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.02143-18 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Apr 17;93(9). pii: JVI.02143-18. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02143-18.

AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase L-dependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZA-induced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.",['Copyright (c) 2019 the Author(s).

A common mutation in AML is the inversion of chromosome 16 [inv (16)], which generates a fusion between the genes for core binding factor beta (CBFB) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene (MYH11), forming the oncogene CBFB-MYH11. The expressed protein, CBFbeta-SMMHC, forms a heterodimer with the key hematopoietic transcription factor RUNX1. Although CBFbeta-SMMHC was previously thought to dominantly repress RUNX1, recent work suggests that CBFbeta-SMMHC functions together with RUNX1 to activate transcription of specific target genes. However, the mechanism of this activity or a requirement for additional cofactors is not known. Here, we show that the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) forms a complex with CBFbeta-SMMHC, colocalizes with RUNX1 and CBFbeta-SMMHC on the promoters of known fusion protein target genes, and that Hdac1 is required for expression of these genes. These results imply that HDAC1 is an important component of the CBFbeta-SMMHC transcriptional complex, and that leukemia cells expressing the fusion protein may be sensitive to treatment with HDAC1 inhibitors. Using a knock-in mouse model expressing CBFbeta-SMMHC, we found that in vivo treatment with the HDAC1 inhibitor entinostat decreased leukemic burden, and induced differentiation and apoptosis of leukemia cells. Together, these results demonstrate that HDAC1 is an important cofactor of CBFbeta-SMMHC and a potential therapeutic target in inv (16) AML. IMPLICATIONS: This report describes a novel role for HDAC1 as a cofactor for the leukemogenic fusion protein CBFbeta-SMMHC and shows that inhibitors of HDAC1 effectively target leukemia cells expressing the fusion protein in vivo.",['(c)2019 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Richter, Lisa E', 'Wang, Yiqian', 'Becker, Michelle E', 'Coburn, Rachel A', 'Williams, Jacob T', 'Amador, Catalina', 'Hyde, R Katherine']","['Richter LE', 'Wang Y', 'Becker ME', 'Coburn RA', 'Williams JT', 'Amador C', 'Hyde RK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Fred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska. kate.hyde@unmc.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Hdac1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosome Inversion/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*genetics', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",,,2019/03/01 06:00,2020/05/02 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['1541-7786.MCR-18-0922 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0922 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2019 Jun;17(6):1241-1252. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-18-0922.

Pluripotency factors maintain uncommitted cells of the blastocyst and embryonic stem cells in the pluripotent state. However, little is known about the role played by these factors during later development, despite being expressed in the postimplantation epiblast. Using a dual transgene system for controlled expression at postimplantation stages, we found that Nanog blocks primitive hematopoiesis in the gastrulating embryo, resulting in a loss of red blood cells and downregulation of erythropoietic genes. Accordingly, Nanog-deficient embryonic stem cells are prone to erythropoietic differentiation. Moreover, Nanog expression in adults prevents the maturation of erythroid cells.

Dimensional reduction reduced the number of critical proteins from 231 to 20. Deep Learning found an excellent correlation between FLT3-ITD mutation with the levels of these 20 critical proteins (accuracy 97%, sensitivity 90%, and specificity 100%). Our Deep Learning network could hone in on 20 proteins with the strongest association with FLT3-ITD.

NCAM1 is widely used as a marker of minimal residual disease; however, the biological function of NCAM1 in AML remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the impact of NCAM1 expression on leukemogenesis, drug resistance, and its role as a biomarker to guide therapy. Beside t(8;21) leukemia, NCAM1 expression was found in most molecular AML subgroups at highly heterogeneous expression levels. Using complementary genetic strategies, we demonstrated an essential role of NCAM1 in the regulation of cell survival and stress resistance. Perturbation of NCAM1 induced cell death or differentiation and sensitized leukemic blasts toward genotoxic agents in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Ncam1 was highly expressed in leukemic progenitor cells in a murine leukemia model, and genetic depletion of Ncam1 prolonged disease latency and significantly reduced leukemia-initiating cells upon serial transplantation. To further analyze the mechanism of the NCAM1-associated phenotype, we performed phosphoproteomics and transcriptomics in different AML cell lines. NCAM1 expression strongly associated with constitutive activation of the MAPK-signaling pathway, regulation of apoptosis, or glycolysis. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2 specifically inhibited proliferation and sensitized NCAM1(+) AML cells to chemotherapy. In summary, our data demonstrate that aberrant expression of NCAM1 is involved in the maintenance of leukemic stem cells and confers stress resistance, likely due to activation of the MAPK pathway.

As a trade-off for its physiological function, AID also contributes to tumor development through its mutagenic activity. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), AID is overexpressed in the proliferative fractions (PFs) of the malignant B lymphocytes, and its anomalous expression has been associated with a clinical poor outcome. Recent preclinical data suggested that ibrutinib and idelalisib, 2 clinically approved kinase inhibitors, increase AID expression and genomic instability in normal and neoplastic B cells. These results raise concerns about a potential mutagenic risk in patients receiving long-term therapy. To corroborate these findings in the clinical setting, we analyzed AID expression and PFs in a CLL cohort before and during ibrutinib treatment. We found that ibrutinib decreases the CLL PFs and, interestingly, also reduces AID expression, which correlates with dampened AKT and Janus Kinase 1 signaling. Moreover, although ibrutinib increases AID expression in a CLL cell line, it is unable to do so in primary CLL samples. Our results uncover a differential response to ibrutinib between cell lines and the CLL clone and imply that ibrutinib could differ from idelalisib in their potential to induce AID in treated patients.

The aim of this study was to explore the kinetics of double strand break (DSB) formation of three ALL cell lines following exposure to daunorubicin and to investigate the effects of daunorubicin on the cell cycle and the protein kinases involved in specific checkpoints following DNA damage and recovery periods. METHODS: Three ALL cell lines CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 derived from T lymphocytes and SUP-B15 derived from B lymphocytes were examined following 4 h treatment with daunorubicin chemotherapy and 4, 12 and 24 h recovery periods. Cell viability was measured via MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2-5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by flow cytometry, double stranded DNA breaks by detecting gammaH2AX levels while stages of the cell cycle were detected following propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect specific proteins while RNA was extracted from all cell lines and converted to cDNA to sequence Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM). RESULTS: Daunorubicin induced different degrees of toxicity in all cell lines and consistently generated reactive oxygen species. Daunorubicin was more potent at inducing DSB in MOLT-4 and CCRF-CEM cell lines while SUP-B15 cells showed delays in DSB repair and significantly more resistance to daunorubicin compared to the other cell lines as measured by gammaH2AX assay. Daunorubicin also causes cell cycle arrest in all three cell lines at different checkpoints at different times. These effects were not due to mutations in ATM as sequencing revealed none in any of the three cell lines. However, p53 was phosphorylated at serine 15 only in CCRF-CEM and MOLT-4 but not in SUP-B15 cells. The lack of active p53 may be correlated to the increase of SOD2 in SUP-B15 cells. CONCLUSIONS: The delay in DSB repair and lower sensitivity to daunorubicin seen in the B lymphocyte derived SUP-B15 cells could be due to loss of function of p53 that may be correlated to increased expression of SOD2 and lower ROS production.",,"['Al-Aamri, Hussain Mubarak', 'Ku, Heng', 'Irving, Helen R', 'Tucci, Joseph', 'Meehan-Andrews, Terri', 'Bradley, Christopher']","['Al-Aamri HM', 'Ku H', 'Irving HR', 'Tucci J', 'Meehan-Andrews T', 'Bradley C']","['Department of Pharmacy and Applied Sciences, La Trobe Institute for Molecular Science (LIMS), La Trobe University, P.O.

Reactivation of miR-9 by hypomethylating agents and forced expression of miR-9 in EVI1(high) leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells results in apoptosis and decreased proliferation of EVI1(high) leukemia cells.

Our results suggest that EVI1-induced hypermethylation and downregulation of the miR-9 plays an important role in leukemogenesis in EVI-1(high) pediatric AML, indicating that hypomethylating agents may be a potential therapeutic strategy for EVI1(high) pediatric AML.",,"['Mittal, Nupur', 'Li, Liping', 'Sheng, Yue', 'Hu, Chao', 'Li, Fuxing', 'Zhu, Tongyu', 'Qiao, Xiaohong', 'Qian, Zhijian']","['Mittal N', 'Li L', 'Sheng Y', 'Hu C', 'Li F', 'Zhu T', 'Qiao X', 'Qian Z']","['Department of Medicine and UI Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and UI Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Urology, Fudan University ZhongShan Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine and UI Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, FL32610, 2033 Mowry Road, Rm257, Gainesville, FL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and UI Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Urology, Fudan University ZhongShan Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Urology, Fudan University ZhongShan Hospital, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Medicine and UI Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. zhijian.qian@medicine.ufl.edu.', 'Department of Medicine and UF Health Cancer Center, University of Florida, FL32610, 2033 Mowry Road, Rm257, Gainesville, FL, USA. zhijian.qian@medicine.ufl.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Letter', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (MIRN92 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Oligoribonucleotides)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine/pharmacology', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oligoribonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['NOTNLM'],"['*EVI1', '*Hyper methylation', '*Hypomethylating agents', '*Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*miR9']",2019/03/01 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-019-0952-z [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-019-0952-z [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2019 Feb 27;18(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s12943-019-0952-z.,PMC6391809,,['R01 HL131444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies, characterized by a combination of different somatic genetic abnormalities, some of which act as events driving leukemic development. Studies carried out in the last years have shown that AML cells invariably have abnormalities in one or more apoptotic pathways and have identified some components of the apoptotic pathway that can be targeted by specific drugs. Clinical results deriving from studies using B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors in combination with standard AML agents, such as azacytidine, decitabine, low-dose cytarabine, provided promising results and strongly support the use of these agents in the treatment of AML patients, particularly of elderly patients. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its receptors are frequently deregulated in AML patients and their targeting may represent a promising strategy for development of new treatments. Altered mitochondrial metabolism is a common feature of AML cells, as supported through the discovery of mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene and in mitochondrial electron transport chain and of numerous abnormalities of oxidative metabolism existing in AML subgroups. Overall, these observations strongly support the view that the targeting of mitochondrial apoptotic or metabolic machinery is an appealing new therapeutic perspective in AML.",,"['Castelli, Germana', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Testa, Ugo']","['Castelli G', 'Pelosi E', 'Testa U']","['Department of Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy. germana.castelli@iss.it.', 'Department of Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy. elvira.pelosi@iss.it.', 'Department of Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy. ugo.testa@iss.it.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7900-8942'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190222,Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'MCL-1', 'TRAIL', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'leukemia']",2019/03/01 06:00,2019/03/01 06:01,['2019/03/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11020260 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11020260 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Feb 22;11(2). pii: cancers11020260. doi: 10.3390/cancers11020260.,PMC6406361,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is well tolerated by most patients and helps in the achievement of complete remission, a few rare imatinib-associated adverse effects such as pulmonary interstitial fibrosis have been reported. Because of its rareity, the clinical features of imatinib-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD) remain unclear. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 49-year-old Chinese man with chronic myeloid leukemia received oral treatment with imatinib and initially exhibited a good response. However, he presented with cough and fever 9 months after treatment initiation. DIAGNOSES: Pulmonary computed tomography indicated diffuse interstitial fibrosis in both lungs. All tests for possible infectious pathologies provided negative results. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia and treated with antibiotics; however, there was no improvement. On the basis of a suspicion of imatinib-induced ILD, imatinib was discontinued and prednisone treatment was initiated. OUTCOMES: The patient's symptoms ameliorated with treatment, and imatinib was reintroduced. However, he developed cough and dyspnea again, and his treatment was switched to nilotinib as a second-line regimen. He was regularly monitored, and although his clinical symptoms ameliorated, computed tomography performed 29 months after he was diagnosed with ILD showed irreversible pulmonary interstitial fibrosis without progression.

The nanoencapsulation of this enzyme is strategic to avoid its immediate immunogenic effects that lead to a decrease in the enzyme half-life. In this work, ASNase-containing nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by double emulsification, through an ultrasonic sonicator or an Ultra-Turrax, using two copolymers of 50:50 (w/w) poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) with different ranges of molecular weight (24-38kDa and 30-60kDa) and varying the concentration of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as a stabilizer (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0%) as well as the emulsification time (30 and 60s). Using 24-38kDa PLGA and 1.0% PVA, we obtained by cavitation NPs with hydrodynamic diameter of 384nm, polydispersity index of 0.143 and Zeta potential of -16.4mV, whose ASNase encapsulation efficiency was as high as 87+/-2%. The encapsulated enzyme showed an activity 22% higher than that of the free enzyme, and no conformational changes were detected by circular dichroism. The enzyme release from NPs entrapped in dialysis bags (500kDa molecular weight cut-off) allowed selecting a controlled system able to release about 60% of the enzyme within 14days, for which the Korsmeyer-Peppas model provided the best correlation (R(2)=0.966).",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

There are limited reports of other JAK2 variants of potential clinical relevance. This study was designed to survey JAK2 variants in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and to determine their contributions to disease pathogenesis. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing of the coding region of JAK2 and 27 other genes was performed on bone marrow DNA samples. The study population was classified into 3 cohorts: chronic MPNs only (the MPN cohort); MPNs transformed into AML (the MPN>>AML cohort); and AML only, with MPN>>AML patients excluded (the AML cohort). RESULTS: Testing was performed for 2154 patients, and non-V617F/non-exon 12 JAK2 sequence variants were identified in 114 (5.3%). They included 35 unique JAK2 variants across all functional domains. Sixteen of the 114 JAK2 variants occurred without somatic mutations in the remaining 27 genes. JAK2 variants were detected at a higher frequency in the MPN>>AML cohort (15.3%) in comparison with the MPN (4.6%; P < .001) and AML cohorts (5.2%; P < .001).

However, the epidemiologic distribution and precise triggers for AML in Canada remain poorly understood. METHODS: In this study, demographic data for AML patients in Canada from 1992 to 2010 were analyzed using 3 independent population-based cancer registries. The AML incidence and mortality rates were examined at the levels of province/territory, city, and forward sortation area (FSA) postal code. RESULTS: In total, 18,085 patients were identified. AML incidence was documented to be 30.61 cases per million individuals per year (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.17-31.06) from 1992 to 2010. Five industrial cities in Ontario were identified where incidence rates were significantly higher than the national average: Sarnia, Sault Ste. Marie, Thunder Bay, St. Catharines, and Hamilton. Analysis at the FSA postal code level identified significant patient clusters of AML in these cities. Specifically, FSA N7V in Sarnia, Ontario had an incidence of 106.81 (95% CI, 70.96-161.86) cases per million individuals per year, which is >3 times higher than the national average. The pollution from local oil refineries and chemical plants in Sarnia may be implicated as a risk factor for AML in that city. Analysis of mortality rates at the province and city levels corroborated the findings from the incidence data. CONCLUSION: These results provide a comprehensive analysis of AML burden in Canada and reveal striking geographic case clustering in industrial Ontario cities and potentially implicate exposure to materials/pollution from these plants as an important risk factor for developing AML in Canada.",['(c) 2019 American Cancer Society.'],"['Ghazawi, Feras M', 'Le, Michelle', 'Cyr, Janelle', 'Netchiporouk, Elena', 'Rahme, Elham', 'Alakel, Akram', 'Zubarev, Andrei', 'Powell, Mathieu', 'Moreau, Linda', 'Roshdy, Osama', 'Glassman, Steven J', 'Sasseville, Denis', 'Popradi, Gizelle', 'Litvinov, Ivan V']","['Ghazawi FM', 'Le M', 'Cyr J', 'Netchiporouk E', 'Rahme E', 'Alakel A', 'Zubarev A', 'Powell M', 'Moreau L', 'Roshdy O', 'Glassman SJ', 'Sasseville D', 'Popradi G', 'Litvinov IV']","['Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Clinical Epidemiology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Dermatology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7422-307X'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Industrial Development', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/*etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Urban Health', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Sarnia', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*epidemiology in Canada', '*geographic clustering', '*incidence in Canada', '*mortality in Canada']",2019/02/28 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/09/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32034 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Jun 1;125(11):1886-1897. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32034.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of methotrexate in infants with ALL. METHODS: A total of 672 methotrexate plasma concentrations were obtained from 71 infants enrolled in the Children's Oncology Group (COG) Clinical Trial P9407. Infants received methotrexate 4 g/m(2) intravenously for four cycles during weeks 4-12 of intensification. A population PK analysis was performed using NONMEM((R)) version 7.4. The final model was evaluated using a non-parametric bootstrap and a visual predictive check. Simulations were performed to evaluate methotrexate dose and the utility of a bedside algorithm for dose individualization. RESULTS: Methotrexate was best characterized by a two-compartment model with allometric scaling. Weight was the only covariate included in the final model. The coefficient of variation for interoccasion variability (IOV) on CL was relatively high at 25.4%, compared with the interindividual variability for CL and central volume of distribution (10.7% and 13.2%, respectively). Simulations identified that 21.1% of simulated infants benefitted from bedside dose adjustment, and adjustment of methotrexate doses during infusions can avoid supratherapeutic concentrations. CONCLUSION: Infants treated with high-dose methotrexate demonstrated a relatively high degree of IOV in methotrexate CL. The magnitude of IOV in the CL of methotrexate suggests that use of a bedside algorithm may avoid supratherapeutic methotrexate concentrations resulting from high IOV in methotrexate CL.",,"['Beechinor, Ryan J', 'Thompson, Patrick A', 'Hwang, Michael F', 'Vargo, Ryan C', 'Bomgaars, Lisa R', 'Gerhart, Jacqueline G', 'Dreyer, ZoAnn E', 'Gonzalez, Daniel']","['Beechinor RJ', 'Thompson PA', 'Hwang MF', 'Vargo RC', 'Bomgaars LR', 'Gerhart JG', 'Dreyer ZE', 'Gonzalez D']","['Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7569, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7569, USA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7569, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7569, USA.', 'Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, and Drug Metabolism, Merck & Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7569, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7569, USA.', ""Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA."", 'Division of Pharmacotherapy and Experimental Therapeutics, UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, CB #7569, Chapel Hill, NC, 27599-7569, USA. daniel.gonzalez@unc.edu.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5522-5686'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', '*Models, Biological', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism']",,,2019/02/28 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-018-00734-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-018-00734-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2019 Jul;58(7):899-910. doi: 10.1007/s40262-018-00734-0.,PMC6658326,,"['K23 HD083465/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM086330/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['NIHMS1522782'],,,,,,,,,,,

A recent study found that APA was involved in the mediation of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, unlike gene expression heterogeneity, little attention has been directed toward variations in single-cell APA for different cell types during AML development. Here, we used single-cell RNA-seq data of a massive population of 16,843 bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) from healthy and AML patient samples to investigate dynamic APA usage in different cell types. Abnormalities of APA dynamics in the BMMCs from AML patient samples were uncovered compared to the stable APA dynamics in samples from healthy individuals, as well as lower APA diversity between eight cell types in AML patients. Genes with APA dynamics specific to the AML samples were significantly enriched in cellular signal transduction pathways that contribute to AML development. Moreover, many leukaemic cell marker genes such as NF-kappaB, GATA2 and IAP-Family genes exhibited APA dynamics that specifically affected abnormal proliferation and differentiation of leukemic BMMCs. Additionally, mature erythroid cells displayed greater APA dynamics and global 3' UTR shortening compared with other cell types. Our results revealed extensive involvement of APA regulation in leukemia development and erythropoiesis at the single-cell level, providing a high-resolution atlas to navigate cellular mRNA processing landscapes of differentiated cells in AML.",,"['Ye, Congting', 'Zhou, Qian', 'Hong, Yiling', 'Li, Qingshun Quinn']","['Ye C', 'Zhou Q', 'Hong Y', 'Li QQ']","['a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Coastal and Wetland Ecosystems , College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University , Xiamen , Fujian , China.', 'a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Coastal and Wetland Ecosystems , College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University , Xiamen , Fujian , China.', 'b Graduate College of Biomedical Sciences , Western University of Health Sciences , Pomona , CA , USA.', 'c College of Veterinary Medicine , Western University of Health Sciences , Pomona , CA , USA.', 'a Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education for Coastal and Wetland Ecosystems , College of the Environment and Ecology, Xiamen University , Xiamen , Fujian , China.', 'b Graduate College of Biomedical Sciences , Western University of Health Sciences , Pomona , CA , USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20190313,United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Polyadenylation', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Alternative polyadenylation', '*RNA processing', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*erythropoiesis', '*single-cell RNA-seq']",2019/02/28 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15476286.2019.1586139 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2019 Jun;16(6):785-797. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2019.1586139.

Medical workers constitute the largest occupational radiation-exposed group whose doses are typically received gradually over time. METHODS: A unique opportunity exists to establish an Institutional Review Board/Privacy Board (IRB/PB) approved, retrospective feasibility sub-cohort of diseased Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) medical radiation workers to reconstruct occupational/work history, estimate organ-specific radiation absorbed doses, and review existing publicly available records for mortality from cancer (including leukemia) and other diseases. Special emphasis will be placed on dose reconstruction approaches as a means to provide valid organ dose estimates that are as accurate and precise as possible based on the available data, and to allow proper evaluation of accompanying uncertainties. Such a study that includes validated dose measurements and information on radiation exposure conditions would significantly reduce dose uncertainties and provided greatly improved information on chronic low-dose risks. RESULTS: The feasibility sub-cohort will include deceased radiation workers from MSK who worked during the nearly seventy-year timeframe from 1946 through 2010 and were provided individual personal radiation dosimetry monitors. A feasibility assessment focused on obtaining records for about 25-30,000 workers, with over 124,000 annual doses, including personnel/work histories, specific dosimetry data, and appropriate information for epidemiologic mortality tracing will be conducted. MSK radiation dosimetry measurements have followed stringent protocols complying with strict worker protection standards in order to provide accurate dose information for radiation workers that include detailed records of work practices (including specific task exposure conditions, radiation type, energy, geometry, personal protective equipment usage, badge position, and missed doses), as well as recorded measurements. These dose measurements have been ascertained through a variety of techniques that have evolved over the years, from film badges to thermoluminescent dosimetry technology to optically stimulated luminescent methodologies. It is expected that individual total doses for the sub-cohort will have a broad range from <10 mSv to > =1000 mSv. CONCLUSIONS: MSK has pioneered the use of novel radiation diagnostic and therapeutic approaches over time (including initial work with x-rays, radium, and radon), with workplace safety in mind, resulting in a variety of radiation worker exposure scenarios. The results of this feasibility sub-cohort of deceased radiation workers, and associated lessons learned may potentially be applied to an expanded multicenter study of about 170,000 medical radiation worker component of the MPS.",,"['Dauer, Lawrence T', 'Woods, Meghan', 'Miodownik, Daniel', 'Serencsits, Brian', 'Quinn, Brian', 'Bellamy, Michael', 'Yoder, Craig', 'Liang, Xiaolin', 'Boice, John D Jr', 'Bernstein, Jonine']","['Dauer LT', 'Woods M', 'Miodownik D', 'Serencsits B', 'Quinn B', 'Bellamy M', 'Yoder C', 'Liang X', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Bernstein J']","['a Department of Radiology & Medical Physics , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'b Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics , Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'c Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'c Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'c Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center , New York , NY , USA.', 'd Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Oak Ridge , TN , USA.', 'e Landauer, Inc.

Various genetic studies have assessed the contributory roles of several single nucleotide polymorphisms with the development of leukemia. The role of genetic variation in the ARID5B and IKZF1 genes has previously been identified in various population groups; however, the role of these variants in the north Indian populations of Jammu and Kashmir is unknown. AIM: In this study, we explored the association of the newly identified genetic variants, rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1, with leukemic patients from Jammu and Kashmir of northern India. METHODS: The variants were genotyped using TaqMan allele discrimination assays for 616 individuals (210 leukemic cases and 406 healthy controls). The association of each SNP with the disease was evaluated using logistic regression. RESULTS: It was observed that the variants rs6964823 (IKZF1) and rs10740055 (ARID5B) showed significant associations with odds ratio (OR) and p-values of 1.5 (1.0-2.3 at 95% confidence interval [CI]) and 0.04; and 2.5 (1.5-4.1 at 95% CI) and 0.0002, respectively. We also evaluated the cumulative effect for both the variants by combining the risk genotypes and obtained and OR of 4.9. DISCUSSION: It was found that the variants rs10740055 of ARID5B and rs6964823 of IKZF1 act individually and additively as risk factors in the development of leukemia in the populations of Jammu and Kashmir in Northern India.",,"['Bhat, Amrita', 'Shah, Ruchi', 'Bhat, Gh Rasool', 'Verma, Sonali', 'Sharma, Varun', 'Sharma, Indu', 'Pandita, Monika', 'Bakshi, Divya', 'Sharma, Bhanu', 'Suri, Jyotsna', 'Kumar, Rakesh']","['Bhat A', 'Shah R', 'Bhat GR', 'Verma S', 'Sharma V', 'Sharma I', 'Pandita M', 'Bakshi D', 'Sharma B', 'Suri J', 'Kumar R']","['1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '2 Human Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '2 Human Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '2 Human Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '3 Department of Pathology, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', '1 Cancer Genetics Research Group, School of Biotechnology, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University, Katra, Jammu and Kashmir, India.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190227,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (ARID5B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Asians/genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/genetics', 'Genome-Wide Association Study', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/physiology', 'India', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Risk Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['(AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 5B)', '(IKAROS Zinc Finger 1)', 'Jammu and Kashmir', 'leukemia']",2019/02/28 06:00,2019/05/22 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2018.0283 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2019 Mar;23(3):176-179. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2018.0283.

The challenges of adapting VI to the continuous operation are two-fold: 1) achieving fluid homogeneity and 2) a narrow residence time distribution (RTD) for fluid incubation. To address these challenges, a dynamic active in-line mixer and a packed-bed continuous virus inactivation reactor (CVIR) are implemented, which act as a narrow RTD incubation chamber. The developed concept is applied using solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment for inactivation of two commonly used model viruses. The in-line mixer is characterized and enables mixing of the viscous S/D chemicals to +/-1.0% of the target concentration in a small dead volume. The reactor's RTD is characterized and additional control experiments confirm that the VI is due to the S/D action and not induced by system components. The CVIR setup achieves steady state rapidly before two reactor volumes and the logarithmic reduction values of the continuous inactivation process are identical to those obtained by the traditional batch operation. The packed-bed reactor for continuous VI unites fully continuous processing with very low-pressure drop and scalability.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

Serum BCMA is elevated in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and might represent a novel prognostic and monitoring tool. Serum BCMA levels can predict both progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Several therapeutic strategies are currently under investigation including BCMA-directed monoclonal Abs (either naked or with drug conjugates, and bispecific Abs) and cellular T-cell therapies (chimeric antigen receptor T-cells) with impressive clinical results. Areas covered: This review aims to present the mechanisms of action and the available data on efficacy and safety of therapies targeting BCMA. Expert opinion: The preliminary preclinical and clinical results from the phase 1 and 2 studies have demonstrated significant activity of the anti-BCMA therapeutic strategies. The main toxicities induced include Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) and ocular toxicity.

We analyzed the incidence of JL1 expression and compared the clinical, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics of de novo pediatric acute leukemia patients with respect to JL1 expression status to determine the therapeutic potential of an anti-JL1 antibody. METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with pediatric acute leukemia (52 with ALL, 26 with AML) diagnosed between December 2014 and January 2016 were enrolled prospectively. Flow cytometry for JL1 expression was performed at diagnosis. Clinical, immunophenotypic, and genetic characteristics were compared with respect to JL1 expression status by the Student t-test/Mann-Whitney U test and chi-square test/Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: The incidence of JL1 expression was 76.9% and 84.6% in ALL and AML patients, respectively. ALL patients with JL1 expression showed higher CD10 and cytoplasmic IgM expressions than those without JL1 expression (P=0.022 and 0.003, respectively) and were associated with TCF3-PBX1 and KMT2A-MLLT1 translocations. AML patients with JL1 expression showed higher CD13 and lower CD65 and CD15 expressions than those without JL1 expression (P=0.013, 0.007, and 0.024, respectively) and were associated with RUNX1-RUNX1T1, PML-RARA, and CBFB-MYH11 translocations.

We analyzed 11 data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus Database and found that MMP7 and MMP15 were highly expressed in multiple carcinomas. GSE13204 showed that MMP7 and MMP15 were overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The Cancer Genome Atlas data set exhibited that high expression of MMP7 or MMP15 in bone marrow (BM) of AML patients predicted poor overall survival. The chi (2) test results indicated that high expression level of MMP7 and MMP15 were correlated with high-risk stratification and high BM blast cell percentage in AML patients. To confirm these findings, we performed reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and found that MMP7 and MMP15 were highly expressed in three AML cell lines. Further study showed that MMP7 and MMP15 were highly expressed both in BM and peripheral blood in collected AML samples compared with healthy individuals. Additionally, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) microarray of BM samples of AML patients revealed that multiple lncRNAs were correlated with MMP7 and MMP15, suggesting that lncRNAs might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML via modulating MMPs. In conclusion, our study uncovers the potential roles of MMP7 and MMP15 in the prognosis of AML.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wu, Yingjie', 'Pan, Shan', 'Leng, Jun', 'Xie, Tian', 'Jamal, Muhammad', 'Yin, Qian', 'Li, Jingyuan', 'He, Chunjiang', 'Dong, Xin', 'Shao, Liang', 'Zhang, Qiuping']","['Wu Y', 'Pan S', 'Leng J', 'Xie T', 'Jamal M', 'Yin Q', 'Li J', 'He C', 'Dong X', 'Shao L', 'Zhang Q']","['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Genetics, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Science, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', 'Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Developmentally Originated Disease, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2633-5824'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190227,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MMP15 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinase 15)', 'EC 3.4.24.23 (MMP7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.23 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 15/*genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 7/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*matrix metalloproteinase-15', '*matrix metalloproteinase-7', '*overall survival', '*prognosis']",2019/02/28 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2018/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.28351 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Jun;120(6):10613-10624. doi: 10.1002/jcb.28351.

Point-of-care (PoC) antibody detection kits, which had been the mainstay for diagnosing FIV infection since the early 1990s, were no longer considered accurate to use in FIV-vaccinated cats, because of the production of vaccine-induced antibodies that were considered indistinguishable from those produced in natural FIV infections. Consequently, attention shifted to alternative diagnostic methods such as nucleic acid detection. However, over the past 5 years we have published a series of studies emphasising that FIV PoC test kits vary in their methodology, resulting in differing accuracy in FIV-vaccinated cats. Importantly, we demonstrated that two commercially available FIV antibody test kits (Witness and Anigen Rapid) were able to accurately distinguish between FIV-vaccinated and FIV-infected cats, concluding that testing with either kit offers an alternative to PCR testing. This review summarises pertinent findings from our work published in a variety of peer-reviewed research journals to inform veterinarians (particularly veterinarians in Australia, New Zealand and Japan, where the FIV vaccine is currently commercially available) about how the approach to the diagnosis of FIV infection has shifted. Included in this review is our work investigating the performance of three commercially available FIV PoC test kits in FIV-vaccinated cats and our recommendations for the diagnosis of FIV infection; the effect of primary FIV vaccination (three FIV vaccines, 4 weeks apart) on PoC test kit performance; our recommendations regarding annual testing of FIV-vaccinated cats to detect 'vaccine breakthroughs'; and the potential off-label use of saliva for the diagnosis of FIV infection using some FIV PoC test kits. We also investigated the accuracy of the same three brands of test kits for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) diagnosis, using both blood and saliva as diagnostic specimens. Based on these results, we discuss our recommendations for confirmatory testing when veterinarians are presented with a positive FeLV PoC test kit result. Finally, we conclude with our results from the largest and most recent FIV and FeLV seroprevalence study conducted in Australia to date.",['(c) 2019 Australian Veterinary Association.'],"['Westman, M E', 'Malik, R', 'Norris, J M']","['Westman ME', 'Malik R', 'Norris JM']","['Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Centre for Veterinary Education, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Sydney School of Veterinary Science, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7400-1960'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)', '0 (feline leukemia virus vaccine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis/blood', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Cats', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Feline/*diagnosis/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/immunology', 'Saliva/virology', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Vaccines/immunology']",['NOTNLM'],"['feline immunodeficiency virus', 'feline leukaemia virus', 'point-of-care diagnosis', 'vaccination']",2019/02/28 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2017/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/avj.12781 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2019 Mar;97(3):47-55. doi: 10.1111/avj.12781.,,,,,,,,,['Aust Vet J. 2019 Sep;97(9):371.

This view is primarily based on and apparently supported by an increased incidence of such diseases in patients with specific forms of immunodeficiencies that are caused by high penetrant gene defects. As I will review and discuss herein, such constellations merely represent the tip of an iceberg. The overall situation is by far more varied and complex, especially if one takes into account the growing difficulties to define what actually constitutes an immunodeficiency and what defines a cancer predisposition. The enormous advances in genome sequencing, in bioinformatic analyses and in the functional in vitro and in vivo assessment of novel findings together with the availability of large databases provide us with a wealth of information that steadily increases the number of sequence variants that concur with clinically more or less recognizable immunological problems and their consequences. Since many of the newly identified hard-core defects are exceedingly rare, their tumor predisposing effect is difficult to ascertain. The analyses of large data sets, on the other hand, continuously supply us with low penetrant variants that, at least in statistical terms, are clearly tumor predisposing, although their specific relevance for the respective carriers still needs to be carefully assessed on an individual basis. Finally, defects and variants that affect the same gene families and pathways in both a constitutional and somatic setting underscore the fact that immunodeficiencies and cancer predisposition can be viewed as two closely related errors of development. Depending on the particular genetic and/or environmental context as well as the respective stage of development, the same changes can have either a neutral, predisposing and, in some instances, even a protective effect. To understand the interaction between the immune system, be it ""normal"" or ""deficient"" and tumor predisposition and development on a systemic level, one therefore needs to focus on the structure and dynamic functional organization of the entire immune system rather than on its isolated individual components alone.",,"['Haas, Oskar A']",['Haas OA'],"[""Department of Clinical Genetics, Children's Cancer Research Institute, Vienna, Austria.""]",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190212,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', '*Disease Susceptibility/immunology', 'Environment', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer predisposition', '*childhood leukemia', '*down syndrome', '*immune activation', '*immune editing', '*inflammation', '*microbiome', '*primary immunodeficiency']",2019/02/28 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.03136 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Feb 12;9:3136. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.03136. eCollection 2018.,PMC6379258,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to analyze the expression and clinical pathological significance of provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus 1 (Pim1) in clinical NPC, and to elucidate the effect of LMP1 on Pim1 expression and its mechanism. Methods: Immunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of Pim1 in clinical NPC tissues and control nasopharyngeal chronic inflammation (NPI) tissues, and the correlation between Pim1 and clinical parameters of NPC patients was analyzed. The LMP1 stable expression cell line CNE1-LMP1-OV was constructed through infecting the well-differentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells CNE1 with LMP1 overexpressing lentivirus. Then the in vivo experiments were conducted. Results: Among 89 NPC patients, 48 cases (53.93%) were positive for Pim1, while only one case was Pim1 positive in 15 NPI controls (6.67%). Pim1 expression was not correlated with gender, age, smoking status and clinical classification of NPC patients, but positively correlated with T, N and M classification. CNE1-LMP1-OV cell line was successfully established, which displayed a higher cell proliferation ability and Pim1 expression. NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC, PKC inhibitor GF109203X and STAT3 inhibitor Stattic significantly attenuated LMP1-induced Pim1 expression, and while AP-1 inhibitor SR11302 showed no inhibitory effect. Interestingly, Pim1 inhibitor quercetagetin significantly inhibited the proliferation of CNE1-LMP1-OV cells. Conclusion: LMP1 mediates Pim1 expression through NF-kappaB, PKC and STAT3 signaling, which promotes the proliferation of NPC cells and participate in the clinical progression of NPC.",,"['Ding, Ran-Ran', 'Yuan, Jian-Ling', 'Jia, Ya-Nan', 'Liao, Xiao-Min', 'Wang, Si-Si', 'Shao, Zhong-Ming', 'Feng, Mu-Yin', 'Jie, Wei', 'Shen, Zhi-Hua']","['Ding RR', 'Yuan JL', 'Jia YN', 'Liao XM', 'Wang SS', 'Shao ZM', 'Feng MY', 'Jie W', 'Shen ZH']","['Department of Pathology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', ""Department of Pathology, Dongguan People's Hospital, Dongguan 523059, China."", 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Basic Medicine Sciences, Guangdong Medical University, Zhanjiang 524023, China, szh75@126.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190211,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['LMP1', 'Pim1', 'cell proliferation', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma']",2019/02/28 06:00,2019/02/28 06:01,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S190274 [doi]', 'ott-12-1137 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Feb 11;12:1137-1146. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S190274. eCollection 2019.,PMC6376889,['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heavy chains have also been shown to be biomarkers in plasma cell disorders. An unanswered question is whether these Ig biomarkers are heritable, i.e., influenced by germline factors. CLL is heritable but highly heterogeneous. Heritable biomarkers could elucidate steps of disease pathogenesis that are affected by germline factors, and may help partition heterogeneity and identify genetic pleiotropies across malignancies. Relatives in CLL pedigrees present an opportunity to identify heritable biomarkers. We compared FLCs and heavy chains between relatives in 23 high-risk CLL pedigrees and population controls. Elevated IgM (eIgM) and abnormal FLC (aFLC) ratio was significantly increased in relatives, suggesting that these Ig biomarkers are heritable and could offer risk stratification in pedigree relatives. Within high-risk CLL pedigrees, B-cell lymphoid malignancies were five times more prevalent in close relatives of individuals with eIgM, prostate cancer was three times more prevalent in relatives of individuals with aFLC, and monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis increased surrounding individuals with normal Ig levels. These different clustering patterns suggest Ig biomarkers have the potential to partition genetic heterogeneity in CLL and provide insight into distinct heritable pleiotropies associated with CLL.",,"['Glenn, Martha J', 'Madsen, Michael J', 'Davis, Ethan', 'Garner, Cassandra D', 'Curtin, Karen', 'Jones, Brandt', 'Williams, Justin A', 'Tomasson, Michael H', 'Camp, Nicola J']","['Glenn MJ', 'Madsen MJ', 'Davis E', 'Garner CD', 'Curtin K', 'Jones B', 'Williams JA', 'Tomasson MH', 'Camp NJ']","['University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA.', 'Carver College of Medicine, University ofIowa, Iowa City, IA, 52242, USA.', 'University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA. nicola.camp@hci.utah.edu.', 'Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 84112, USA. nicola.camp@hci.utah.edu.']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7200-6706', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4788-1998']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20190226,United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Early Detection of Cancer', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*diagnosis', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocytosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pedigree', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",,,2019/02/28 06:00,2020/01/03 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41408-019-0186-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41408-019-0186-8 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2019 Feb 26;9(3):25. doi: 10.1038/s41408-019-0186-8.,PMC6391432,,"['P30 CA086862/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261201100016I/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA134674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is regarded as a curative strategy for AML, the efficacy of autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) for patients without a matched sibling donor (MSD) has remained controversial. METHODS: To compare survival outcomes after alloSCT versus autoSCT for patients with intermediate-risk AML in CR1, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 clinical studies. The outcomes included relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), relapse rate (RR), and treatment-related mortality (TRM). RESULTS: Compared with autoSCT, alloSCT showed better RFS, OS, and RR benefits, but higher TRM. Subgroup analysis based on donor category (MSD and matched unrelated donor [MUD]) of alloSCT showed alloSCT from MSD rather than from MUD had better OS benefits compared to autoSCT. For fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) wild-type patients, alloSCT and autoSCT had comparable RFS and OS outcomes. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, in the absence of an available MSD, autoSCT remains a viable PRT alternative for intermediate-risk AML in CR1, especially for FLT3-ITD wild-type patients.","['(c) 2019 S.

Disease progression and associated costs may affect these models, particularly if such programs do not account for differences in disease severity and progression risk within the cohort. This study estimated the incremental cost of disease progression in patients diagnosed with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and compared costs among patients with and without progression. METHODS: This was a retrospective study using U.S. administrative claims data from commercial and Medicare Advantage health care enrollees with evidence of CLL, AML, and NHL and systemic antineoplastic agent use from July 1, 2006 to August 31, 2014. Outcome measures included disease progression, 12-month health care costs, and 3-year cumulative predictive health care costs. RESULTS: Of 1,056 patients with CLL, 514 patients with AML, and 7,601 patients with NHL, 31.1% of patients with CLL, 63.8% of those with AML, and 36.9% of those with NHL had evidence of disease progression. Among patients with CLL and NHL, adjusted and unadjusted health care costs were significantly higher among progressors versus nonprogressors. Per-patient-per-month costs, accounting for variable follow-up time, were almost twice as high among progressors versus nonprogressors in patients with CLL, AML, and NHL. In each of the three cancer types, the longer disease progression was delayed, the lower the health care costs. CONCLUSION: Progression of CLL, AML, and NHL was associated with higher health care costs over a 12-month period. Delaying cancer progression resulted in a substantial cost reduction in patients with all three cancer types. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Data on the rates and incremental health care costs of disease progression in patients with hematologic malignancies are lacking. This study estimated the incremental costs of disease progression in patients diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and compared health care costs in patients with and without evidence of disease progression in a real-world population. The data obtained in this study will assist future studies in quantifying the cost impact of decreased progression rates and will inform payers and physician groups about setting rates for episode and bundled payment programs.",['(c) AlphaMed Press 2019.'],"['Reyes, Carolina', 'Engel-Nitz, Nicole M', 'DaCosta Byfield, Stacey', 'Ravelo, Arliene', 'Ogale, Sarika', 'Bancroft, Tim', 'Anderson, Amy', 'Chen, May', 'Matasar, Matthew']","['Reyes C', 'Engel-Nitz NM', 'DaCosta Byfield S', 'Ravelo A', 'Ogale S', 'Bancroft T', 'Anderson A', 'Chen M', 'Matasar M']","['Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Optum, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA nicole.engel-nitz@optum.com.', 'Optum, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA.', 'Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Optum, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA.', 'Optum, Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA.', 'South Bay Oncology Hematology, San Jose, California, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190226,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/economics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/economics/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Costs', 'Female', '*Health Care Costs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*economics/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*economics/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*economics/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Medicare', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', '*Costs', ""*Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", '*Progression']",2019/02/28 06:00,2020/07/22 06:00,['2019/02/28 06:00'],"['2018/01/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2018-0019 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0019 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2019 Sep;24(9):1219-1228. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0019.

We examined 5215 transplant recipients with ALL reported to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research registry. Overall survival (OS) was compared according to the presence and severity of GVHD and evaluated in 3 cohorts: 2593 adults in first or second complete remission (CR1/CR2), 1619 pediatric patients in CR1/CR2, and 1003 patients with advanced (CR >/=3 or active disease) ALL. For patients in CR1/CR2, development of acute GVHD (aGVHD) or chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was associated with lower risk of relapse than no GVHD (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49-0.69). Patients with advanced ALL developing grades III and IV aGVHD or cGVHD were also at lower risk of relapse (HRs varied from 0.52 to 0.67). Importantly, adult and children in CR1/CR2 with grades I and II aGVHD without cGVHD experienced the best OS compared with no GVHD (reduction of mortality with HR, 0.83-0.76). Increased nonrelapse mortality accompanied grades III and IV aGVHD (HRs varied from 2.69 to 3.91) in all 3 cohorts and abrogated any protection from relapse, resulting in inferior OS. Patients with advanced ALL had better OS (reduction in mortality; HR, 0.69-0.73) when they developed cGVHD with or without grades I and II aGVHD. In conclusion, GVHD was associated with an increased GVL effect in ALL.

Neurotoxicity represents a common and potentially life-threatening adverse effect of CAR T cells, and clinical experience is limited. Here, we describe the clinical presentation and management of 25 adult patients who presented with neurotoxic syndromes after CAR T-cell therapy at the Massachusetts General Hospital. This cohort includes 24 patients treated with CD19-directed CAR T cells for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 23) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 1), and 1 patient treated with alpha-fetoprotein-directed CAR T cells for hepatocellular carcinoma (n = 1). Twelve of the 25 patients (48%) developed grade 1-2 neurotoxicity and 13 patients (52%) presented with grade 3-4 neurotoxicity. We found that lower platelet counts at time of CAR T-cell infusion were associated with more severe neurotoxicity (P = .030). Cytokine release syndrome occurred in 24 of 25 patients (96%). Serum levels of ferritin peaked with onset of neurologic symptoms, and higher ferritin levels were associated with higher neurotoxicity grade. Grade 3-4 neurotoxicity correlated negatively with overall survival (OS) (P = .013). Median OS of the entire cohort was 54.7 weeks. Eight patients (32%) with grade 3-4 neurotoxicity were deceased at database closure, whereas none died with neurotoxicity grade 1-2. High pretreatment lactate dehydrogenase was frequently encountered in lymphoma patients with grade 3-4 neurotoxicity and correlated negatively with progression-free survival (P = .048). We did not find evidence that steroid use >/=7 days altered the patient's outcome when compared with <7 days of steroids.

There is heterogeneity in the data and reported diagnostic yields range from 26 to 69%. Therefore, selection criteria for BAL to maximize yield and minimize complications are unclear. Objectives of this study were to determine the diagnostic yield and complication rate of BAL in immunocompromised patients presenting with lung infiltrates, and identify factors impacting these outcomes. Exploratory aims included characterization of pathogens, rate of treatment modification and mortality. METHODS: Retrospective study from January 2012 to December 2016. Patients on mechanical ventilation were excluded. Positive diagnostic yield was defined as confirmed microbiological or cytological diagnosis. RESULTS: A total of 217 patients were recruited (70.1% male and mean age: 51.7 +/- 14.6 years). Diagnostic yield was 60.8% and complication rate 14.7%. Complications (hypoxemia and endobronchial bleeding) were all sell-limiting. Treatment modification based on BAL results was 63.3%. In 97.0% an infectious aetiology was identified. HIV infection (OR 5.304, 95% CI 1.611-17.458, p = 0.006) and severe neutropenia (OR 4.253, 95% CI 1.288-14.045, p = 0.018) were associated with positive yield. Leukemia (OR 0.317, 95% CI 0.102-0.982, p = 0.047) was associated with lower yield. No factors impacted complication rate. Overall mortality (90-day) was 17.5% and in those with hematologic malignancy, it was 28.3%. CONCLUSION: BAL retains utility in diagnosis of immunocompromised patients with lung infiltrates. However, patients with hematologic malignancy have a high mortality and alternative sampling should be considered because of poor results with BAL.

Seminal plasma (SP) contains very large amounts of exosomes which are deposited in female genital tract after insemination. Although the response of vaginal cells to seminal exosomes (SE) is recently being elucidated, the interaction of uterine cells with SE is still unknown. Here, we aimed to evaluate the effect of SE on cytokine secretion by human endometrial stromal cells (eSC). STUDY DESIGN: Exosomes were isolated from the semen samples of healthy men with proven fertility and characterized using common exosome characterization methods. Human eSC were isolated from endometrial biopsies obtained from healthy premenopausal women. For exosome internalization analysis, SE were labeled with PKH67 green fluorescent dye and incubated with the cells. For investigating the effect of SE on cytokine secretion of eSC, we measured levels of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1alpha, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the culture supernatants of control and experimental groups by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after 24 h of incubation. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that SE are internalized by eSC and subsequently induce them to produce IL-6 and IL-8, the cytokines which are involved in the immunology of embryo implantation. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study suggest that SE contribute to the immunoregulatory functions of SP in the uterus and may participate in embryo implantation process. Therefore dysfunction of intracellular machineries of SE biogenesis and secretion, inadequate production, defective transportation to the uterus and impaired communication with endometrium may play a distinct role in pathophysiology of embryo implantation failure.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: TBI (1200 or 1320 cGy given twice daily in 6 or 8 fractions) was used as part of 3 HSCT preparative regimens, allowing institutional flexibility regarding TBI techniques, including lung shielding. Lung doses as reported by each participating institution were calculated for different patient setups, with and without shielding, with a variety of dose calculation techniques. The association between lung dose and transplant-related mortality, relapse-free survival, and overall survival (OS) was examined using the Cox proportional hazards regression model controlling for the following variables: TBI dose rate, TBI fields, patient position during TBI, donor type, and pre-HSCT minimal residual disease level. RESULTS: Of a total of 143 eligible patients, 127 had lung doses available for this analysis. The TBI techniques were heterogeneous. The mean lung dose was reported as 904.5 cGy (standard deviation, +/-232.3). Patients treated with lateral fields were more likely to receive lung doses >/=800 cGy (P < .001). The influence of lung dose >/=800 cGy on transplant-related mortality was not significant (hazard ratio [HR], 1.78; P = .21). On univariate analysis, lung dose >/=800 cGy was associated with inferior relapse-free survival (HR, 1.76; P = .04) and OS (HR, 1.85; P = .03). In the multivariate analysis, OS maintained statistical significance (HR, 1.85; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: The variability in TBI techniques resulted in uncertainty with reported lung doses. Lateral fields were associated with higher lung dose, and thus they should be avoided. Patients treated with lung dose <800 cGy in this study had better outcomes. This approach is currently being investigated in the Children's Oncology Group AALL1331 study.

However, the genetic mechanisms and mutational background of these patients have not been fully explored. To improve our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this subgroup of CLL, seven CLL patients with several chromosomal gains were sequenced using a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-targeted approach. The mutational status of 54 genes was evaluated using a custom-designed gene panel including recurrent mutated genes observed in CLL and widely associated with CLL pathogenesis. A total of 21 mutations were detected; TP53 (42.8%), ATM (28.5%), SF3B1 (28.5%), and BRAF (28.5%) were the most recurrently mutated genes. Of these mutations, 61.9% were detected in genes previously associated with a poor prognosis in CLL. Interestingly, five of the seven patients exhibited alterations in TP53 or ATM (deletion and/or mutation), genes involved in the DNA damage response (DDR), which could be related to a high genetic instability in this subgroup of patients. In conclusion, CLL patients with several chromosomal gains exhibit high genetic instability, with mutations in CLL driver genes and high-risk genetic alterations involving ATM and/or TP53 genes.",['Copyright (c) 2019.

In neuroendocrine tumor pathology, Ki-67 was first described as a prognostic factor in the pancreas and incorporated into the grading system of digestive tract neuroendocrine neoplasms in the 2010 WHO classification. However, the significance of Ki-67 in pNETs was still a controversial issue. This study was to investigate the potentially diagnostic value of Ki-67 in pNETs. METHODS: We retrieved 159 surgical specimens of pNETs, including 35 typical carcinoids (TCs), 2 atypical carcinoid (ACs), 28 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs), 94 small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs). Manual conventional method (MCM) and computer-assisted image analysis method (CIAM) were used to calculate the Ki-67 proliferative index. In CIAM, 6 equivalent fields (500 x 500 mum) at 10x magnification were manually annotated for digital image analysis. RESULTS: The Ki-67 index among the 4 groups with ranges of 0.38% to 12.66% for TC, 4.34% to 29.48% for AC, 30.67% to 93.74% for LCNEC, and 40.71% to 96.87% for SCLC. The cutoff value of Ki-67 index to distinguish low grade with high grade was 30.07%. For the univariate survival analyses in pNETs, both the overall survival and progression-free survival correlated with Ki-67 index. In addition, the Ki-67 index performed by CIAM was proved to be of great positive correlation with MCM. CONCLUSIONS: Ki-67 index counted by CIAM is a reliable method and can be a useful adjunct to classify the low- and high-grade NETs.",,"['Wang, Hai-Yue', 'Li, Zhong-Wu', 'Sun, Wei', 'Yang, Xin', 'Zhou, Li-Xin', 'Huang, Xiao-Zheng', 'Jia, Ling', 'Lin, Dong-Mei']","['Wang HY', 'Li ZW', 'Sun W', 'Yang X', 'Zhou LX', 'Huang XZ', 'Jia L', 'Lin DM']","['Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Translational Research (Ministry of Education), Department of Pathology, Peking University Cancer Hospital & Institute, Beijing 100142, China.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-67 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/*metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'World Health Organization']",,,2019/02/27 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/CM9.0000000000000109 [doi]', '00029330-201903050-00007 [pii]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2019 Mar 5;132(5):551-561. doi: 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000109.,PMC6416093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the inhibitory effect of Echi-A on antigen-stimulated degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells, which were suppressed in a dose dependent manner.. The antigens bind to the high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor, which is expressed on the surface of mast cells and basophils and activate intracellular signal transduction, resulting in the release of biologically active mediators such as histamine. In order to disclose the inhibitory mechanisms of degranulation by Echi-A, we examined the elevation in intracellular C(2)(+) concentration ([Ca(2)(+)]i), production levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and early intracellular signaling events. Both elevation of [Ca(2)(+)] and intracellular ROS production were markedly suppressed in cells treated with Echi-A. Echi-A also suppressed the activation of Lyn, Syk, and PLCyl/2 in antigen-stimulated cells. These results indicated that inhibition of antigen-stimulated degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells by Echi-A is mainly due to the inactivation of Lyn/Syk/PLCy signaling pathways.

METHODS: A total of 96 children with ALL undergoing therapy with MCP-841 protocol were screened for all the ten exons of TPMT, exon 2, exon 3 and intron 2 of ITPA using bidirectional sequencing. This dataset was used to construct prediction models of leucopenia grade by constructing classification and regression trees (CART) followed by smart pruning. RESULTS: The developed CART model indicated TPMT*12 and TPMT*3C as the key determinants of toxicity. TPMT int3, int4 and int7 polymorphisms exert toxicity when co-segregated with one mutated allele of TPMT*12 or TPMT*3C or ITPA exon 3. The developed CART model exhibited 93.6% accuracy in predicting the toxicity. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.9649. CONCLUSIONS: TPMT *3C and TPMT*12 are the key determinants of 6-MP-mediated hematological toxicity while other variants of TPMT (int3, int4 and int7) and ITPA ex2 interact synergistically with TPMT*3C or TPMT*12 variant alleles to enhance the toxicity.

During this process, the proteins to be degraded are recognized by cellular chaperones such as HSC70 and presented to the CMA receptor LAMP2A, which then translocate them into lysosomes for degradation. In this punctum, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the response and resistance to Azacitidine (Aza) in MDS/AML cell lines and bone marrow CD34+ blasts from MDS/AML patients. We show that treatment of MDS/AML cell lines and bone marrow samples from MDS/AML patients with Aza triggers loss of LAMP2 expression leading to CMA defects. LAMP2 deficiency is responsible for CMA defects, Aza resistance and hypersensitivity to lysosome and autophagy inhibitors. Low levels of LAMP2 expression in CD34+ blasts from MDS/AML patients correlate with an absence of response to Aza and are associated to a pejorative overall survival.

Many studies have indicated that IKZF1 alterations may be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, but the results remain controversial. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of the rs4132601 T/G and rs10272724 T/C IKZF1 gene polymorphisms with the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and to determine whether these genetic variants affect the clinical parameters and the iron profiles of these children cohort. METHODS: This case control study was conducted on 170 Egyptian children comprising of two groups: group (I) included 90 children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and group (II) comprised of 80 ages and sex-matched healthy control children. The studied polymorphisms were genotyped using PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). RESULTS: A higher frequency of the mutant GG genotype and G allele of rs4132601 was found in the patient group than in the control group. The results also showed a significant difference among the rs10272724 genotypes, with a higher frequency of the mutant CC genotype and C allele in the patients than in controls. The mutant GG genotype of rs4132601 and the mutant CC genotype of rs10272724 were associated with a higher serum ferritin level and transferrin saturation and an older age at diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia than the other genotypes. CONCLUSION: IKZF1 rs4132601 and rs10272724 could be considered significant risk contributors to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and may impact the iron profiles in these children.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Tayel, Safaa I', 'El-Hefnway, Sally M', 'Abo El-Fotoh, Wafaa Moustafa M', 'El-Zayat, Rania S']","['Tayel SI', 'El-Hefnway SM', 'Abo El-Fotoh WMM', 'El-Zayat RS']","['Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Menoufia Governorate, Egypt.', 'Medical Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Menoufia Governorate, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Medicine Departments, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Menoufia Governorate, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Medicine Departments, Faculty of Medicine, Menoufia University, Menoufia Governorate, Egypt.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Curr Mol Med,Current molecular medicine,101093076,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood/genetics', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Iron/blood', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Egyptian', '*Ferritin', '*IKZF1', '*Lukemia', '*Lymphoblastic', '*PCR-RFLP.']",2019/02/27 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['CMM-EPUB-96745 [pii]', '10.2174/1566524019666190219123900 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Mol Med. 2019;19(1):32-39. doi: 10.2174/1566524019666190219123900.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study provides evidence that induction of autophagy is required for ATRA to induce differentiation of APL (NB4) cells into granulocytes. ATRA treatment causes ~12-fold increase in the number of acidic vesicular organelles and induces marked up-regulation of LC3-II, autophagy-related 5 (ATG5), and Beclin-1. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a decrease in mitochondria and ATRA-induced differentiation. To determine the role of autophagy in the differentiation of APL, we knocked down ATG5 in NB4 cells to find that ATRA-induced differentiation is significantly inhibited during ATG5 knock down in cells, indicating the role of autophagy in differentiation of APL. Further experiments revealed restriction of autophagy during ATRA-induced differentiation and inhibition of tissue transglutaminase 2 (TG2) and phospho-focal adhesion kinase (p-FAK), which are known to have roles in differentiation and cell attachment. We examined expression of Beclin-1 and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and levels of mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) after ATRA treatment. ATRA inhibits Bcl-2, up-regulates Beclin-1 expression, and reduces induction of mTOR activation/phosphorylation in NB4 cells. Our results reveal that autophagy has roles in regulation of differentiation, mitochondria elimination, and cell attachment during ATRA-induced APL differentiation.",,"['Tekedereli, Ibrahim', 'Akar, Ugur', 'Alpay, S Neslihan', 'Lopez-Berestein, Gabriel', 'Ozpolat, Bulent']","['Tekedereli I', 'Akar U', 'Alpay SN', 'Lopez-Berestein G', 'Ozpolat B']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Breast Medical Oncology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol,"Journal of environmental pathology, toxicology and oncology : official organ of the International Society for Environmental Toxicology and Cancer",8501420,"['0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TGM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Autophagy/*physiology', 'Beclin-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Glutamine gamma Glutamyltransferase 2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",,,2019/02/27 06:00,2019/03/22 06:00,['2019/02/27 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/22 06:00 [medline]']","['4b309b253eb144f8,289131ab731beb1d [pii]', '10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2018027885 [doi]']",ppublish,J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol. 2019;38(1):13-20. doi: 10.1615/JEnvironPatholToxicolOncol.2018027885.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we tested the radical scavenging activity and antimicrobial and anticancer potential of methanol extracts of F. pinicola from central Italy. Molecular identification confirmed that the samples were F. pinicola; a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool search showed a close match (99% sequence identity) with European isolates of this species. The free radical scavenging capacities, measured by DPPH assay, showed that the extract activity was 3.5% that of Trolox. The MTT test, evaluated after 72 hours of treatment with increasing doses of extract (5-500 mug . mL-1), considerably inhibited proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in 2 human tumor cell lines. This reduction was coupled with a relevant induction of apoptosis in the human leukemia THP-1 cell line after 24 hours of treatment, but a relevant toxic effect occurred in the human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 cell line. The genotoxic potential of the methanol extracts was studied by single-cell gel electrophoresis of normal human leukocytes exposed to 20 mug extract at 37 degrees C for 30 minutes; no DNA damage was observed. The F. pinicola methanol extract was found to have varying degrees of antifungal effects against the pathogenic fungi tested (minimum inhibitory concentration from 23.63 to 66.81 mug . mL-1).

Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry provides data that can assist in the diagnosis and classification of myeloid neoplasms. The immunophenotypic features of myeloid neoplasms with monosomy 7 or del(7q) have not been previously described in a comprehensive fashion. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed flow cytometric data of myeloid neoplasms with monosomy 7 or del(7q) and summarized associated immunophenotypic features. RESULTS: Myeloid neoplasms with monosomy 7 typically demonstrate multiple immunophenotypic abnormalities on myeloid blasts and maturing myelomonocytic cells. Increased CD14 expression on maturing granulocytic cells was characteristically seen in myeloid neoplasms with monosomy 7. This abnormality was significantly more frequent in myeloid neoplasms with monosomy 7 than in those with del(7q) (92.9% vs. 8.2%, P < 0.0001). The presence of increased CD14 expression on maturing granulocytic cells could be seen in cases with monosomy 7 in the setting of a normal blast percentage and when minimal (<3) other immunophenotypic abnormalities were seen on myeloid populations. CONCLUSIONS: Increased CD14 expression on maturing granulocytic cells can be helpful in identifying patients with myeloid neoplasms who have monosomy 7.

METHODS: We calculated age, year, sex, and race-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cancer sites in the AHS relative to the general population. RESULTS: Overall AHS cancer incidence was lower than the general population (SIRprivate = 0.91, CI 0.89-0.93; SIRspouse = 0.89, CI 0.86-0.92; SIRcommercial = 0.83, CI 0.76-0.92), with notable deficits across applicators and spouses for oral cavity, pancreas, and lung cancers. Cancer excesses included prostate cancer, lip cancer, certain B-cell lymphomas (e.g., multiple myeloma), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), thyroid cancer, testicular cancer, and peritoneal cancer. The lung cancer deficit was strongest among applicators reporting potential exposure to endotoxin at study enrollment (tasks such as raising animals and handling stored grain). CONCLUSIONS: Although an overall deficit in cancer was observed, there were notable exceptions, including newly observed excesses for AML, thyroid, testicular, and peritoneal cancers. Furthermore, endotoxin exposure may, in part, account for observed lung cancer incidence deficits.

We found that t(8;21) AML were extremely sensitive to THZ1, which triggered apoptosis after only 4 h. We used precision nuclear run-on transcription sequencing (PROseq) to define the global effects of THZ1 and other CDK inhibitors on RNA polymerase II dynamics. Inhibition of CDK7 using THZ1 caused wide-spread loss of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase. This loss of 5' pausing was associated with accumulation of polymerases in the body of a large number of genes. However, there were modest effects on genes regulated by 'super-enhancers'. At the 3' ends of genes, treatment with THZ1 suppressed RNA polymerase 'read through' at the end of the last exon, which resembled a phenotype associated with a mutant RNA polymerase with slower elongation rates. Consistent with this hypothesis, polyA site-sequencing (PolyA-seq) did not detect differences in poly A sites after THZ1 treatment. PROseq analysis after short treatments with THZ1 suggested that these 3' effects were due to altered CDK7 activity at the 5' end of long genes, and were likely to be due to slower rates of elongation.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

The scarcity of human samples is responsible for the delayed progress in the study and the clinical management of this disease, especially compared with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, its leukemic counterpart. In the present work, we have determined by immunohistochemistry that S194-P-FADD protein is significantly reduced in a cohort of 22 samples from human T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. Notably, the extent of such reduction varies significantly among samples and has revealed determinant for the outcome of the tumour. We demonstrate that Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) phosphorylation status affects protein stability, subcellular localization and non-apoptotic functions, specifically cell proliferation. Phosphorylated FADD would be more stable and preferentially localized to the cell nucleus; there, it would favour cell proliferation. We show that patients with higher levels of S194-P-FADD exhibit more proliferative tumours and that they present worse clinical characteristics and a significant enrichment to an oncogenic signature. This supports that FADD phosphorylation may serve as a predictor for T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma aggressiveness and clinical status. In summary, we propose FADD phosphorylation as a new biomarker with prognostic value in T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press.

The frequency of high dose methotrexate (HDMTX)-associated toxicity is variable. In this study, we investigated the frequency of myelotoxicity and hepatotoxicity 7 days after HDMTX infusion. Patients and methods: This study included children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) between January 2010 and April 2015. The patient blood counts and biochemical parameters measured before and after 7 days of HDMTX infusion were retrospectively recorded. We assessed HDMTX infusions for 48 children. The number of patients and drug doses included the following: 17 children receiving 1 g/m(2) (68 infusions), 14 children receiving 2 g/m(2) (56 infusions), and 17 children receiving 5 g/m(2) (68 infusions). The classification of toxicity was made based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 2010 criteria. Myelotoxicity was defined as a hemoglobin level <10 g/L and absolute neutrophil count <1 x 10(9)/L or platelet count <75 x 10(9)/L. The presence of transaminase levels >/=5 times the upper limit was considered to be hepatotoxicity grade >/=3. The MTX levels at 42 h in patients with and without toxicity were compared to evaluate the correlation between MTX levels, hematologic parameters, and transaminase levels. Results: Myelotoxicity was observed in 35.2%, 37.5%, and 33.8% of the infusions, and hepatotoxicity grade >/=3 was detected in 13.2%, 12.5%, and 11.7% of the infusions in patients receiving 1, 2 and 5 g/m(2) HDMTX after 7 days, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between MTX levels at 42 h in patients with and without toxicity (P > .05, for all). There was no correlation between hematologic parameters and transaminase levels and MTX levels at 42 h. Conclusion: Hematologic toxicity was the most common toxicity observed. The data indicate the hematologic toxicity increased after repeated cycles in patients receiving 5 g/m(2). However, the hepatic toxicity decreased with additional cycles. Our results show the level of MTX at 42 h is not effective to identify toxicity.",,"['Ozdemir, Zeynep Canan', 'Bozkurt Turhan, Ayse', 'Duzenli Kar, Yeter', 'Bor, Ozcan']","['Ozdemir ZC', 'Bozkurt Turhan A', 'Duzenli Kar Y', 'Bor O']","['Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Meselik Kampusu, 26480, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Meselik Kampusu, 26480, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Meselik Kampusu, 26480, Eskisehir, Turkey.', 'Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Faculty of Medicine, Meselik Kampusu, 26480, Eskisehir, Turkey.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20160912,Netherlands,Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med,International journal of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,101670718,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Children', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'High dose methotrexate', 'Leukemia', 'Myelotoxicity']",2016/12/01 00:00,2016/12/01 00:01,['2019/02/27 06:00'],"['2016/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2016/08/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ijpam.2016.08.008 [doi]', 'S2352-6467(16)30058-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2016 Dec;3(4):162-168. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpam.2016.08.008.

Additionally, aberrations in the mechanisms involved in gene expression have been identified to have a role in the development of AML. Contradictory evidence has been reported concerning the expression of the CEBPA gene in AML patients. Additionally, investigation into the expression of the CEBPA-AS gene has yet to be explored in AML patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the expression of the CEBPA and CEBPA-AS genes and AML in Iranian patients. Methods: Using quantitative real-time PCR, the expression of the CEBPA and CEBPA-AS genes was examined in the peripheral blood samples of 58 patients with de novo adult AML, and in 20 healthy controls. Results: Overall, CEBPA expression analysis showed a significant up-regulation in AML patients compared with healthy controls. Interestingly, a significant up-regulation of CEBPA was detected in the male AML patients. Significant CEBPA over-expression was observed in M0 (p-value=0.0001), M3 (p-value= 0.012) and M4 (p-value= 0.000) FAB subtypes. Our data has also demonstrated that CEBPA expression is up-regulated in favorable (p-value= 0.006) and adverse (p-value= 0.042) cytogenetic risk groups. In addition, the expression of CEBPA was significantly increased in AML patients with an abnormal karyotype. Ectopic expression of CEBPA-AS was detected in seven of the AML patients. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence for the up-regulation of CEBPA and the ectopic expression of CEBPA-AS in AML patients, suggesting that these two genes may play an important role in the pathogenesis of AML. The role of CEBPA and CEBPA-AS in AML patients should be further explored.

Higher levels of CD3+ T-cells in the graft have been associated with increased risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but also beneficial graft-versus-leukemia effect and reduced infections. To tackle post-transplant complications, donor lymphocyte infusions have been used but with an increased risk of GVHD. To reduce this risk, we performed depletion of alphabeta T-cells and treated 12 patients post-HSCT suffering from infections and/or poor immune reconstitution. The alphabeta T-cell depleted cell products were characterized by flow cytometry. The median log depletion of alphabeta T-cells was -4.3 and the median yield of gammadelta T-cells was 73.5%. The median CD34+ cell dose was 4.4 x 10(6)/kg. All 12 patients were alive 3 months after infusion and after 1 year, two patients had died.

HIV-infected patients diagnosed in Lao PDR are enrolled in a registration network and receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) covered by governmental financial support. Based on the registration network, we investigated intestinal helminth infections and coinfection with HTLV-1 in HIV-infected patients treated with an early intervention using ART in Lao PDR. Methods: This cross-sectional study of all 252 HIV-infected patients at Savannakhet Provincial Hospital, located in the southern part of Lao PDR, was conducted between February and March 2018. Socioepidemiological information and clinical information were collected from a registration network database and by questionnaire administered to participants. Microscopic examination of intestinal helminth infections in stool samples and particle agglutination for anti-HTLV-1 antibody in plasma were performed. Results: The median age of all 252 participants was 39 years old (range, 18-59). Based on the registration network database, there were 156 (61.9%) HIV-infected patients with a CD4-positive cell count >/= 200 cells/muL and 146 (57.9%) with an HIV viral load < 250 copies/mL. Among 212 stool samples, 75 (35.4%) were found to contain one or more intestinal helminth species, including Opisthorchis viverrini (16.5%), Strongyloides stercoralis (10.8%), hookworm (10.4%), and Taenia saginata (3.3%). This rate of intestinal helminth infections was lower than that of a previous report conducted before the establishment of the registration network for HIV-infected patients in Lao PDR. There was no significant association between intestinal helminth infections and a lower CD4-positive T cell count or higher HIV viral load. HIV-infected patients with anti-HTLV-1 antibody positivity were not found in this cohort. Conclusion: The registration network and an early intervention using ART may provide good medical care and improve the clinical course of HIV-infected patients in Lao PDR. However, the incidence of intestinal helminth infections remains high at 35.4%. The development of a specific medical care system for helminth infection for HIV-infected patients is necessary.",,"['Kaneshiro, Yukako', 'Sourinphoumy, Khamphang', 'Imaizumi, Naoki', 'Rasaphon, Mangkhalar', 'Kuba-Miyara, Megumi', 'Sakihama, Shugo', 'Guerrero, Carmina Louise Hugo', 'Nhativong, Ketsaphone', 'Nonaka, Daisuke', 'Pongvongsa, Tiengkham', 'Kobayashi, Jun', 'Kounnavong, Sengchanh', 'Fukushima, Takuya']","['Kaneshiro Y', 'Sourinphoumy K', 'Imaizumi N', 'Rasaphon M', 'Kuba-Miyara M', 'Sakihama S', 'Guerrero CLH', 'Nhativong K', 'Nonaka D', 'Pongvongsa T', 'Kobayashi J', 'Kounnavong S', 'Fukushima T']","['1Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', ""Savannakhet Provincial Hospital, Savannakhet, Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '3Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', ""Savannakhet Provincial Hospital, Savannakhet, Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '1Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', '4Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', '1Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', ""Savannakhet Provincial Health Department, Savannakhet, Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '6Department of Global Health, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', ""Savannakhet Provincial Health Department, Savannakhet, Lao People's Democratic Republic."", '6Department of Global Health, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2', ""7National Institute of Public Health, Vientiane, Lao People's Democratic Republic.grid.489073.1"", '1Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, University of the Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa Japan.0000 0001 0685 5104grid.267625.2']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190211,Japan,Trop Med Health,Tropical medicine and health,101215093,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Helminth infections', 'Human T cell leukemia virus type I', 'Human immunodeficiency virus', ""Lao People's Democratic Republic"", 'Registration network']",2019/02/26 06:00,2019/02/26 06:01,['2019/02/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41182-019-0142-0 [doi]', '142 [pii]']",epublish,Trop Med Health. 2019 Feb 11;47:14. doi: 10.1186/s41182-019-0142-0. eCollection 2019.,PMC6371529,"['This study was approved by the National Ethics Committee for Health Research,', 'Ministry of Health, Lao PDR (no. 2017. 88.

Nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) has been implicated in transcriptional repression and embryonic organ development, but its role in hematopoiesis is yet to be fully elucidated. Here, we showed that hematopoietic-specific loss of NCoR1 leads to expansion of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool due to aberrant cell cycle entry of long-term HSCs under steady-state conditions. Moreover, NCoR1-deficient HSCs exhibited normal self-renewal capacity but severely impaired lymphoid-differentiation potential in competitive hematopoietic-reconstitution assays. Transcriptome analysis further revealed that several hematopoiesis-associated genes are regulated by NCoR1. In addition, NCoR1 deficiency in hematopoietic cells delayed the course of leukemia and promoted leukemia cell differentiation in an MLL-AF9-induced mouse model. NCoR1 and its partner, histone deacetylase 3, can modulate histone acetylation and gene transcription through binding the promoter regions of myeloid-differentiation genes.

CD203c, an ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase-phosphodiesterase 3, is overexpressed on neoplastic mast cells (MCs) in systemic mastocytosis (SM), thus representing a promising target for antibody-mediated therapy. In this study, we have found that human neoplastic MC lines (ROSA(KIT D816V) and ROSA(KIT D816V-Gluc)), which express high levels of CD203c, are highly and specifically sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of an ADC against CD203c (AGS-16C3F). In these cell lines, AGS-16C3F induced cell apoptosis at very low concentrations. To characterize the effects of AGS-16C3F on leukemia progression in vivo, ROSA(KIT D816V-Gluc) NOD-SCID gamma mouse models of advanced SM (AdvSM) were treated with AGS-16C3F or an ADC control for 2 weeks. Whereas AGS-16C3F had no apparent toxicity in xenotransplanted mice, in vivo neoplastic MC burden significantly decreased in both hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic organs. Furthermore, animals treated with AGS-16C3F had prolonged survival compared with the animals treated with control ADC, and AGS-16C3F efficiently prevented disease relapse.

Ten years later, a European LeukemiaNet expert panel has reviewed the recent advances in the management of APL in both frontline and relapse settings in order to develop updated evidence- and expert opinion-based recommendations on the management of this disease. Together with providing current indications on genetic diagnosis, modern risk-adapted frontline therapy, and salvage treatment, the review contains specific recommendations for the identification and management of the most important complications such as the bleeding disorder APL differentiation syndrome, QT prolongation, and other all-trans retinoic acid- and ATO-related toxicities, as well as recommendations for molecular assessment of the response to treatment. Finally, the approach to special situations is also discussed, including management of APL in children, elderly patients, and pregnant women.

Seventy-two patients received parsaclisib monotherapy (5-45 mg once daily). Expansion doses were 20 and 30 mg once daily; intermittent dosing at 20 mg (once daily for 9 weeks, then once weekly) was explored. No dose-limiting toxicities were identified, and maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Most common nonhematologic treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were diarrhea/colitis (36%), nausea (36%), fatigue (31%), and rash (31%). Grade 3/4 neutropenia occurred in 19% of patients. Serious TEAEs (>2 patients) were diarrhea/colitis (n = 9), pyrexia (n = 4), hypotension (n = 3), and sepsis (n = 3). Aspartate and alanine transaminase elevations occurring before treatment discontinuation were grade 1, except 1 grade 3 event each, secondary to sepsis. Two patients experienced 3 fatal parsaclisib-unrelated TEAEs (respiratory failure; respiratory failure and sepsis). In non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), objective response rates to monotherapy were 71% in follicular lymphoma, 78% in marginal zone lymphoma, 67% in mantle cell lymphoma, and 30% in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; 93% of responses occurred at first assessment ( approximately 9 weeks). Parsaclisib has demonstrated antitumor activity in relapsed or refractory B-cell NHL with the potential for improved long-term patient outcomes.

MAIN METHOD: RT-PCR and Rq-PCR were adopted for transcript typing and quantitation of PML-RARalpha transcripts while FLT3-ITD was detected by PCR in APL patients. KEY FINDINGS: PML-RARalpha bcr-1, bcr-2 and bcr-3 transcripts were found in 26, 3 and 16 cases respectively. 64.4% patients achieved complete remission, 22.2% expired early wherein majority of the cases expressed bcr-3 transcript (p=0.03). 50% relapse rate was observed in patients with bcr-3 transcripts. Multivariate analysis showed expression of bcr-3 transcript associated with early death (p=0.027) and increased relapse risk (P=0.046). Patients expressing bcr-3 hybrid transcript showed lowest OS of 28.0 months (+/-5.26) (p=0.027). FLT3-ITD mutation was detected in 5 (11.1%) patients and presence of these mutations was not associated either with PML-RARalpha transcripts or with disease outcome.

There is a need to evaluate and disseminate information for other ethnicities, particularly from the Middle East. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Registry, Saudi Arabia (SA-NCR), for pediatric patients (age 0-14 years) diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 and for similar patients at our institution during the same period were analyzed. Population numbers reported in the 2007 national census were used to calculate the annual incidence of childhood cancer. RESULTS: Data from SA-NCR on 3885 patients were included in this analysis. The median age was 5.58 years, and 57.3% were males. The annual age-specific cancer incidence rate (ASR) for children in SA is 99.83 per million population; ASR per million for lymphoid leukemia is 25.75, 12.05 for brain tumors, and 9.82 for Hodgkin lymphoma. Of all childhood cancers in SA, 35% were treated at our institution. The five-year overall survival for these 1350 patients is 74.6% (median follow-up 7.52 years [95% confidence interval: 7.36-7.68]). Significant differences in the distribution of childhood malignancy subtypes were evident compared with other countries. CONCLUSION: We have reported differences in the cancer ASR and cancer subtype distribution for children in SA as compared with the worldwide incidence and with other populations. This paper provides a comprehensive epidemiological overview of childhood cancer in SA, which could be extrapolated to other regional Arab populations.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Belgaumi, Asim F', 'Pathan, Ghulam Q', 'Siddiqui, Khawar', 'Ali, Afshan A', 'Al-Fawaz, Ibrahim', 'Al-Sweedan, Suleimman', 'Ayas, Mouhab', 'Al-Kofide, Amani A']","['Belgaumi AF', 'Pathan GQ', 'Siddiqui K', 'Ali AA', 'Al-Fawaz I', 'Al-Sweedan S', 'Ayas M', 'Al-Kofide AA']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", 'Department of Oncology, Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", 'Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", 'Al-Faisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and the King Fahad National Center for Children's Cancer, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."", 'Al-Faisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0135-7509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5740-1302']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190225,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospital Distribution Systems/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Saudi Arabia', '*cancer', '*incidence', '*outcome', '*pediatric']",2019/02/26 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27684 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27684. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27684.

Our aim was to apply the internationally endorsed Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines to children (<15 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and to assess differences in survival by stage at diagnosis. PROCEDURE: Stage was defined by extent of involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) for ALL and AML and using the Ann Arbor and St Jude-Murphy systems for HL and NHL, respectively. The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry, consisting of children diagnosed with one of these four blood cancers between 2006 and 2014 with follow-up to 2015. Five-year observed survival was estimated from the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: Stage was assigned to 2201 of 2351 eligible patients (94%), ranging from 85% for AML to 95% for ALL, HL, and NHL. Survival following ALL varied from 94% (95% CI = 93%-95%) for CNS1 disease to 89% (95% CI = 79%-94%) for CNS2 (P = 0.07), whereas for AML there was essentially no difference in survival between CNS(-) (77%) and CNS(+) disease (78%; P = 0.94). Nearly all children with HL survived for five years. There was a trend (P = 0.04) toward worsening survival with higher stage for NHL. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first population-wide picture of the distribution and outcomes for childhood blood cancers in Australia by extent of disease at diagnosis and provide a baseline for future comparisons.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Youlden, Danny R', 'Gupta, Sumit', 'Frazier, A Lindsay', 'Moore, Andrew S', 'Baade, Peter D', 'Valery, Patricia C', 'Green, Adele C', 'Aitken, Joanne F']","['Youlden DR', 'Gupta S', 'Frazier AL', 'Moore AS', 'Baade PD', 'Valery PC', 'Green AC', 'Aitken JF']","['Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Division of Haematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, Translational Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', ""Oncology Services Group, Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", 'UQ Child Health Research Centre, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Mathematical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'CRUK Manchester Institute and Division of Musculoskeletal and Dermatological Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Council Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'Menzies Health Institute Queensland, Griffith University, Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.', 'Institute for Resilient Regions, University of Southern Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.', 'School of Public Health, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2721-9083', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1334-3670', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4748-8552']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190225,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging/*standards', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic/*standards', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data']",['NOTNLM'],"['*blood cancers', '*childhood', '*population-based cancer registry', '*stage at diagnosis', '*survival']",2019/02/26 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27683 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Jun;66(6):e27683. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27683.

In addition, cyto-toxic effect on cell viability was assessed to reveal their nature of interaction in binary mixture. The individual cytotoxic characteristics of these metals on RBL-2H3 cell viability showed a concentration-dependent reduction of cell viability. We observed that concentration-dependent cytotoxic potency on RBL-2H3 cells of these metals range in the following order Cd(2+)>Cr(+6)>As O4(3-)>Pb(2+) with LC50 values of 0.11muM, 93.58muM, 397.9muM and 485.3muM respectively. Additive effects were observed with Pb(2+) + Cd(2+), Pb(2+) + AsO4(3-), Pb(2+) + Cr(+6) and AsO4(3-) + Cr(+6). The study revealed that Pb(2+), Cd(2+), AsO4(3-) and Cr(+6) could induce significant (P<0.01) cell death by apoptosis in RBL-2H3. Highly significant necrotic cell death was observed with Pb(2+) and Cr(+6) (P<0.01) than Cd(2+) and AsO4(3-) (P<0.05). Overall, it can be deduced that several cell death executing pathways may be concomitantly activated on exposure to heavy metals and the predominance of one over others might depend on the type of heavy metal, concentration and the metabolic state of the cell. Eventually, binary mixtures of some of these metals showed less cytotoxicity than would be expected from their individual actions and may depend on the co-exposure of the metal ions and their modes of action.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This could be due to exclusion of patients with cytopenia from most clinical trials for this particular complication and the lack of standard diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches. We herein evaluate the prevalence and the prognostic significance of AICs among patients with CLL. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study. Data on 101 patients with CLL were derived from the Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt, database, which contains information on demographic and clinical characteristics at diagnosis and follow-up records. RESULTS: The prevalence of immune cytopenias was 11.9% among patients studied. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia was the most common autoimmune form in patients with cytopenia due to pure immune etiology (C immune group) with a prevalence of 6.9%. Patients with AICs and those in the C immune subgroup presented with more unfavorable parameters. Besides, patients with AICs showed lesser response to treatment and on restaging after initial treatment, significantly more patients without AICs moved to a more favorable stage. However, no parallel significant difference in the overall survival was found between patients without AICs and those with AICs or with immune and combined or infiltrative cytopenia. CONCLUSION: We have shown a prevalence of 11.8% for AIC among our CLL patients. AIC was associated with unsatisfactory normalization of the hematological parameters even with therapy and lower number of patients with CLL downstaging in comparison with patients without AIC. These results suggest that AIC is a fingerprint of a biologically more aggressive disease even if no significant impact on overall survival was found.","['Copyright (c) 2019 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

PML protein is essential for formation of PML NBs. Sp100 and Small Ubiquitin-Like Modifier (SUMO) are also permanently residing within PML NBs. Often, large DNA viruses disassemble and reorganize PML NBs to counteract their intrinsic antiviral activity and support establishment of infection. However, human papillomavirus (HPV) requires PML protein to retain incoming viral DNA in the nucleus for subsequent efficient transcription. In contrast, Sp100 was identified as a restriction factor for HPV. These findings suggested that PML NBs are important regulators of early stages of the HPV life cycle. Nuclear delivery of incoming HPV DNA requires mitosis. Viral particles are retained within membrane-bound transport vesicles throughout mitosis. The viral genome is released from transport vesicles by an unknown mechanism several hours after nuclear envelope reformation. The minor capsid protein L2 mediates intracellular transport by becoming transmembranous in the endocytic compartment. Herein, we tested our hypothesis that PML protein is recruited to incoming viral genome prior to egress from transport vesicles. High-resolution microscopy revealed that PML protein, SUMO-1, and Sp100 are recruited to incoming viral genomes, rather than viral genomes being targeted to preformed PML NBs. Differential immunofluorescent staining suggested that PML protein and SUMO-1 associated with transport vesicles containing viral particles prior to egress, implying that recruitment is likely mediated by L2 protein. In contrast, Sp100 recruitment to HPV-harboring PML NBs occurred after release of viral genomes from transport vesicles. The delayed recruitment of Sp100 is specific for HPV-associated PML NBs. These data suggest that the virus continuously resides within a protective environment until the transport vesicle breaks down in late G1 phase and imply that HPV might modulate PML NB assembly to achieve establishment of infection and the shift to viral maintenance.",,"['Guion, Lucile', 'Bienkowska-Haba, Malgorzata', 'DiGiuseppe, Stephen', 'Florin, Luise', 'Sapp, Martin']","['Guion L', 'Bienkowska-Haba M', 'DiGiuseppe S', 'Florin L', 'Sapp M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Department of Virology and Research Center for Immunotherapy (FZI), University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Center for Molecular and Tumor Virology, Feist-Weiller Cancer Center, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, Shreveport, Louisiana, United States of America.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8426-7316', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9925-9850', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4310-7329', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3916-8890']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190225,United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Nuclear/metabolism', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'Capsid Proteins', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies', 'Intranuclear Space', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics/*metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*metabolism/physiology', 'SUMO-1 Protein/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Virus Replication']",,,2019/02/26 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1007590 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-18-01615 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2019 Feb 25;15(2):e1007590. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007590. eCollection 2019 Feb.,PMC6405170,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],"['P30 GM110703/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI081809/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 3-year experience of a single centre.,424-431,10.1111/ejh.13224 [doi],"PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the feasibility and the potential effects of the Haematological Home Care (HHC) programme for acute leukaemia (AL) patients, either in active chemotherapy or in the terminal phase of disease. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed a group of AL patients assisted at home in terms of number of hospitalisations, accesses to emergency department and place of death. We also used historical data to evaluate potential effects of HHC. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 44 patients, 36 of whom (82%) required palliative treatment, and eight (18%) had ongoing active chemotherapy. The mean number of hospitalisations was 0.64 (range 0-7) per patient, and the number of emergency department (ED) visits was 0.82 (range 0-4) per patient. Place of death was at home for 51.4% of patients and in hospital for 40.5%. Considering a historical group of 17 patients assisted at home the rate of hospitalisations and ED visits were 2.53 (range 0-9) and one (range 0-3), respectively. Place of death was home and hospital in 6% and 65%, respectively.

Here, we examine the correlation between approved IgRT indications, treatment recommendations, and clinical practice in SID. METHODS: An international online survey of 230 physicians responsible for the diagnosis of SID and the prescription of IgRT in patients with hematological malignancies was conducted. RESULTS: Serum immunoglobulin was measured in 83% of patients with multiple myeloma, 76% with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 69% with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most physicians (85%) prescribed IgRT after >/=2 severe infections. In Italy, Germany, Spain, and the United States, immunoglobulin use was above average in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, while in the UK considerably fewer patients received IgRT. The use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin was highest in France (34%) and lowest in Spain (19%). Immunologists measured specific antibody responses, performed test immunization, implemented IgRT, and used subcutaneous immunoglobulin more frequently than physicians overall. CONCLUSIONS: The management of SID in hematological malignancies varied regionally. Clinical practice did not reflect treatment guidelines, highlighting the need for robust clinical studies on IgRT in this population and harmonization between countries and disciplines.","['(c) 2019 The Authors.

METHODS: We retrospectively assessed the impact of the pretransplant WT1 mRNA level on survival after allo-HCT in non-CR AML patients. RESULTS: A total of 125 AML patients, including 46 non-CR patients (36.8%), were analyzed. On multivariate analysis of non-CR AML patients, WT1 mRNA >/=5000 copies/mug RNA was significantly related to increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-5.5; P = 0.008). Furthermore, in the entire cohort, log10-transformed WT1 mRNA before allo-HCT was found to be significantly associated with the increased risk of mortality irrespective of whether the disease status was CR or non-CR, using Akaike's information criterion. As the pretransplant WT1 mRNA level elevated, the hazard ratio of mortality monotonically increased in a nonlinear manner regardless of remission status, suggesting that WT1 mRNA level in peripheral blood might reflect tumor burden. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that the pretransplant WT1 mRNA level was a powerful prognostic factor in allo-HCT even for non-CR AML patients, and there may be a WT1 mRNA threshold in non-CR patients for benefiting from allo-HCT.",,"['Ido, Kentaro', 'Nakamae, Mika', 'Koh, Hideo', 'Okamura, Hiroshi', 'Nanno, Satoru', 'Nishimoto, Mitsutaka', 'Takeoka, Yasunobu', 'Hirose, Asao', 'Nakashima, Yasuhiro', 'Hashimoto, Yoshinori', 'Nakane, Takahiko', 'Hino, Masayuki', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa']","['Ido K', 'Nakamae M', 'Koh H', 'Okamura H', 'Nanno S', 'Nishimoto M', 'Takeoka Y', 'Hirose A', 'Nakashima Y', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Nakane T', 'Hino M', 'Nakamae H']","['Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tottori Prefectural Central Hospital, Tottori, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.', 'Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka City University, Osaka, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*epidemiology', 'Preoperative Period', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'Reference Values', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'WT1 Proteins/*blood/genetics', 'Young Adult']",,,2019/02/26 06:00,2020/06/20 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/TP.0000000000002662 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2019 Oct;103(10):2201-2210. doi: 10.1097/TP.0000000000002662.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we use spin dynamics simulations to derive an upper bound of 10 parts per million on the effect of a 1 muT ELF magnetic field on the yield of a radical pair reaction. By comparing this figure with the corresponding effects of changes in the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, we conclude that if exposure to such weak 50/60 Hz magnetic fields has any effect on human biology, and results from a radical pair mechanism, then the risk should be no greater than travelling a few kilometres towards or away from the geomagnetic north or south pole.","['(c) 2019, Hore.']","['Hore, P J']",['Hore PJ'],"['Department of Chemistry, Physical & Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8863-570X'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190225,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,['0 (Free Radicals)'],IM,"['Free Radicals/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment']",['NOTNLM'],"['*extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields', '*magnetic field effects', '*magnetoreception', '*none', '*physics of living systems', '*radical pairs', '*spin dynamics']",2019/02/26 06:00,2020/03/20 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.44179 [doi]', '44179 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Feb 25;8. pii: 44179. doi: 10.7554/eLife.44179.,PMC6417859,['PH No competing interests declared'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, we applied multistage fed-batch cultivation divided in four distinct phases to produce ASNase II and determine the fermentation parameters, namely specific growth rate, biomass yield, and enzyme activity. Cultivation of recombinant P. pastoris under favorable conditions in a modified defined medium ensured a dry biomass concentration of 31 gdcw.L(-1) during glycerol batch phase, corresponding to a biomass yield of 0.77 gdcw.g glycerol - 1 and a specific growth rate of 0.21 h(-1). After 12 h of glycerol feeding under limiting conditions, cell concentration achieved 65 gdcw.L(-1) while ethanol concentration was very low.

These consist of the more common FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) in approximately 20-25% of AML cases, and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) in approximately 5-10%. FLT3 mutations, especially FLT3-ITD, are associated with proliferative disease, increased risk of relapse, and inferior overall survival when treated with conventional regimens. However, the recent development of well tolerated and active FLT3 inhibitors has significantly improved the outcomes of this aggressive subtype of AML. The multikinase inhibitor midostaurin was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) in April 2017 for the frontline treatment of patients with FLT3-mutated (either ITD or TKD) AML in combination with induction chemotherapy, representing the first new drug approval in AML in nearly two decades. In November 2018, the US FDA also approved the second-generation FLT3 inhibitor gilteritinib as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory FLT3-mutated AML. Promising phase I and II efficacy data for quizartinib is likely to lead to a third regulatory approval in relapsed/refractory AML in the near future. However, despite the significant progress made in managing FLT3-mutated AML, many questions remain regarding the best approach to integrate these inhibitors into combination regimens, and also the optimal sequencing of different FLT3 inhibitors in various clinical settings. This review comprehensively examines the FLT3 inhibitors currently in clinical development, with an emphasis on their spectra of activity against different FLT3 mutations and other kinases, clinical safety and efficacy data, and their current and future roles in the management of AML. The mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors and potential combination strategies to overcome such resistance pathways are also discussed.",,"['Short, Nicholas J', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Daver, Naval']","['Short NJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Ravandi F', 'Daver N']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Unit 428, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190215,England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'gilteritinib', 'midostaurin', 'quizartinib', 'resistance', 'sorafenib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2019/02/26 06:00,2019/02/26 06:01,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719827310 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719827310 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Feb 15;10:2040620719827310. doi: 10.1177/2040620719827310. eCollection 2019.,PMC6378516,"['Conflict of interest statement: ND has received research funding from', 'Daiichi-Sankyo, Novartis, Astellas and served as an advisor/consultant to', 'Daiichi-Sankyo, Novartis, Astellas, and Arog pharmaceuticals.

This modulation includes induction of genes which encode CC-chemokines and their receptors. In this study, a recombinant vector containing Tax-1 gene was made and tested for its ability to induce CCR5 (CC chemokine receptor 5) expression in K562 cell line. Methods: In order to perform this research, two blood samples of HTLV-1 positive were obtained from Urmia blood transfusion center. After DNA extraction, a complete sequence of Tax-1 gene was amplified by specific primers. Recombinant vectors carrying Tax-1 gene were synthesized and transformed into Escherichia coli (E. coli). After bacteria transformation, bacteria containing recombinant plasmid were selected and purified. Then, the recombinant shuttle vectors, pCDNA3.1-TAX, were transfected into the cell culture (K562 cell line). Expression of CCR5 was measured after 72 hr by Syber Green Real-Time PCR method compared to control cell culture. Normalization was done with GAPDH as a standard gene. Results: Cloning of Tax-1 gene in the vector, pCDNA3.1 was confirmed by colony PCR, restriction digestion, and sequencing methods. Expression of Tax-1 and CCR5 genes were confirmed by real time PCR and also, expression of CCR5 gene showed an 8-fold increase in comparison to mock-treated controls (p<0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggested that recombinant Tax-1 may have the enhancing effect on CCR5 expression rate at mRNA levels in K562 cell line. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of pCDNA3.1-TAX on cell surface CCR5 expression.",,"['Haghnazari Sadaghiani, Nasrin', 'Pirayeshfard, Lila', 'Aghaie, Afsaneh', 'Sharifi, Zohreh']","['Haghnazari Sadaghiani N', 'Pirayeshfard L', 'Aghaie A', 'Sharifi Z']","['Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research Center, High Institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Iran,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol,Avicenna journal of medical biotechnology,101511065,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CCR5', 'Human T-cell Leukemia Virus', 'Tax-1 protein']",2019/02/26 06:00,2019/02/26 06:01,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Avicenna J Med Biotechnol. 2019 Jan-Mar;11(1):67-71.,PMC6359701,"['Conflict of Interest None of the authors have any conflicts of interest to', 'declare.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNAs obtained from slides has limitations in utility because of their low quality and highly fragmented nature. MicroRNAs are small (<22 nt) noncoding RNAs with various cellular regulatory roles. Due to their small size, microRNAs are less prone to degradation and modification, therefore, can be preserved well in archived tissues. Methods: The current study investigated the efficacy of archived bone marrow aspirate slides for miRNA expression analysis in pediatric leukemia. Total RNA was isolated from air-dried unstained archived slides using High pure miRNA isolation Kit with some modifications and from fresh samples using TRizol. After cDNA synthesis, RT-qPCR was then carried out using specific hsa-miR-326 LNA primers. Finally, statistical analyses were conducted using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Results: The difference observed in miRNA expression due to disease state was far greater than the differences between archived slides and their matching fresh bone marrow specimens. In fact, the expression of archival slide smears for the miR-326 closely mimicked that of fresh-frozen tissues (0.035+/-0.04 vs. 0.03+/-0.04) (Mean+/-SD, p>0.05). Differential expression of hsa-miR-326 was detected between leukemic and non-leukemic samples from archived slides or fresh frozen bone marrows.

Primary antibody deficiency (PAD) is the result of intrinsic genetic defects, whereas secondary antibody deficiency may arise as a consequence of underlying conditions or medication use. On a global level, malnutrition, HIV, and malaria are major causes of secondary immunodeficiency. In this review we consider secondary antibody deficiency, for which common causes include hematological malignancies, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or multiple myeloma, and their treatment, protein-losing states, and side effects of a number of immunosuppressive agents and procedures involved in solid organ transplantation. Secondary antibody deficiency is not only much more common than PAD, but is also being increasingly recognized with the wider and more prolonged use of a growing list of agents targeting B cells. SAD may thus present to a broad range of specialties and is associated with an increased risk of infection. Early diagnosis and intervention is key to avoiding morbidity and mortality. Optimizing treatment requires careful clinical and laboratory assessment and may involve close monitoring of risk parameters, vaccination, antibiotic strategies, and in some patients, immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT).

We examine hospital length of stay (LOS), mortality, and readmission rates for Medicare cancer patients with delayed clearance of Mtx treated with glucarpidase. Methods: Using 2010-2017 Medicare claims data, we identified glucarpidase patients as those hospitalized with indications of select lymphomas or leukemia, inpatient chemotherapy, and glucarpidase treatment. We assessed outcomes of glucarpidase patients relative to those experienced by patients treated for presumed Mtx toxicity using other therapies. These nonglucarpidase patients were identified with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma, indications of cancer-chemotherapy toxicity, and acute kidney injury during hospitalization (not present on admission), and were divided into two groups: treated with dialysis (dialysis(+)) and treated with or without dialysis (dialysis(+/-)). Inverse-probability treatment weighting using propensity scores was used to adjust for differences between groups. Results: Patients treated with glucarpidase (n=30) had an average LOS of 14.7 days. They had inpatient, 30-day, and 90-day mortality rates of 3.3%, 13.3%, and 16.7%, respectively, and a 90-day all-cause unplanned readmission rate of 24.1%. The dialysis(+) and dialysis(+/-) groups, respectively, had higher average LOS (40.2, 21.9), higher inpatient mortality (50.6%, 20.8%), and higher 90-day mortality (58.6%, 37.6%). No statistically significant differences in 30-day mortality or 90-day readmission rates were detected between the glucarpidase group and either of the nonglucarpidase groups.

These options often lack comparative evidence or are characterized by low response rates and short remission duration in relapsed/refractory disease. The approval of mogamulizumab, a humanized, glycoengineered IgG1kappa monoclonal antibody targeting the chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4) chemokine receptor, brings a novel tool into the spectrum of treatment options for advanced CTCL and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). CCR4 is expressed in almost all cases of ATLL, and in a majority of CTCLs, particularly when blood involvement is present. In a Phase III randomized trial, mogamulizumab was associated with 28% overall response rate among patients with relapsed CTCL, median progression-free survival of 7.7 months, and median duration of remission of 14.1 months. Responses are more frequent among patients with Sezary syndrome and within the blood compartment. Common adverse effects include rash and infusion reactions, which are usually low grade. Sentinel reports indicate that exposure to mogamulizumab may result in severe or refractory graft vs host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, highlighting the need for vigilance and expert management. Further research may establish incremental efficacy of combining mogamulizumab with cytotoxic or immunomodulatory agents in CTCL, ATLL, and possibly other lymphomas and even solid tumors.",,"['Ollila, Thomas A', 'Sahin, Ilyas', 'Olszewski, Adam J']","['Ollila TA', 'Sahin I', 'Olszewski AJ']","['Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA, thomas_ollila@brown.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA, thomas_ollila@brown.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA, thomas_ollila@brown.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA, thomas_ollila@brown.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI, USA, thomas_ollila@brown.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI, USA, thomas_ollila@brown.edu.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20190207,New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CCR4', 'Sezary syndrome', 'adult T-cell leukemia', 'cutaneous T-cell lymphoma', 'lymphoma', 'mogamulizumab', 'mycosis fungoides']",2019/02/26 06:00,2019/02/26 06:01,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S165615 [doi]', 'ott-12-1085 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Feb 7;12:1085-1094. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S165615. eCollection 2019.,PMC6369856,"['Disclosure AJO reports research funding from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, TG', 'Therapeutics, and Genentech, and consulting from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals.

GCA manifests with arthritis and occlusive symptoms of headaches, stroke or vision loss. Macrophages and T-helper lymphocytes infiltrate the vascular wall and produce a pro-inflammatory response that lead to vessel damage and ischemia. To date, there is no GCA biomarker that can monitor disease activity and guide therapeutic response. Folate receptor beta (FRB) is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol protein that is anchored on cell membranes and normally expressed in the myelomonocytic lineage and in the majority of myeloid leukemia cells as well as in tumor and rheumatoid synovial macrophages, where its expression correlates with disease severity. The ability of FRB to bind folate compounds, folic acid-conjugates and antifolate drugs has made it a druggable target in cancer and inflammatory disease research. This report describes the histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods used to assess expression and distribution of FRB in relation to GCAimmunopathology. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded temporal artery biopsies from GCA and normal controls were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin to review tissue histology and identify pathognomonic features.Immunohistochemistry was used to detect FRB, CD68 and CD3 expression. A microscopic analysis was performed to quantify the number of positively stained cells on 10 selected high-power-field sections and their respective locations in the arterial wall. Lymphohistiocytic (LH) inflammation accompanied by intimal hyperplasia and disrupted elastic lamina was seen in GCA with none found in controls. The LH infiltrate was composed of approximately 60% lymphocytes and 40% macrophages. FRB expression was restricted to macrophages, comprising 31% of the total CD68+ macrophage population and localized to the media and adventitia. No FRB was seen in controls. This protocol demonstrated a distinct numerical and spatial pattern of the FRB macrophage relative to the vascular immune microenvironment in GCA.",,"['Albano-Aluquin, Shirley', 'Malysz, Jozef', 'Kidacki, Michal', 'Ratnam, Manohar', 'Olsen, Nancy J']","['Albano-Aluquin S', 'Malysz J', 'Kidacki M', 'Ratnam M', 'Olsen NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Penn State University; salbanoaluquin@hmc.psu.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Penn State University.', 'Penn State College of Medicine.', 'Department of Oncology, Wayne State University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Medicine, Penn State University.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20190208,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (FOLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Folate Receptor 2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Arteries/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Folate Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Giant Cell Arteritis/*diagnosis/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inflammation/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",,,2019/02/26 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/58713 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Feb 8;(144). doi: 10.3791/58713.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations on both their sugar and the heterocyclic parts may lead to significant changes in the spectrum of their biological activity and the degree of selective toxicity, as well as in their physicochemical properties. METHODS: C5-arylalkynyl-beta-D-ribofuranonucleosides 3-6, 3-deoxy 12-15, 3-deoxy-3-C-methyl- beta-D-ribofurananucleosides 18-21 and 2-deoxy-beta-D-ribofuranonucleosides 23-26 of uracil, were synthesized using a one-step Sonogashira reaction under microwave irradiation and subsequent deprotection. RESULTS: All newly synthesized nucleosides were tested for their antitumor or antiviral activity. Moderate cytostatic activity against cervix carcinoma (HeLa), murine leukemia (L1210) and human lymphocyte (CEM) tumor cell lines was displayed by the protected 3-deoxy derivatives 12b,12c,12d, and the 3-deoxy-3-methyl 18a,18b,18c. The antiviral evaluation revealed appreciable activity against Coxsackie virus B4, Respiratory syncytial virus, Yellow Fever Virus and Human Coronavirus (229E) for the 3-deoxy compounds 12b,14, and the 3-deoxy-3-methyl 18a,18c,18d, accompanied by low cytotoxicity. CONCLUSION: This report describes the total and facile synthesis of modified furanononucleosides of uracil, with alterations on both the sugar and the heterocyclic portions. Compounds 12b,14 and 18a,c,d showed noticeable antiviral activity against a series of RNA viruses and merit further biological and structural optimization investigations.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Kollatos, Nikolaos', 'Mitsos, Christos', 'Manta, Stella', 'Tzioumaki, Niki', 'Giannakas, Christos', 'Alexouli, Tania', 'Panagiotopoulou, Aggeliki', 'Schols, Dominique', 'Andrei, Graciela', 'Komiotis, Dimitri']","['Kollatos N', 'Mitsos C', 'Manta S', 'Tzioumaki N', 'Giannakas C', 'Alexouli T', 'Panagiotopoulou A', 'Schols D', 'Andrei G', 'Komiotis D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Institute of Biosciences and Applications, National Centre for Scientific Research ""Demokritos"", Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Med Chem,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),101240303,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic', '*Drug Design', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology']",['NOTNLM'],"['C5-pyrimidine ribofurano nucleosides', 'Sonogashira reaction', 'antiviral activity', 'cytotoxic activity', 'microwave irradiation.']",2019/02/26 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/02/26 06:00'],"['2018/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['MC-EPUB-96840 [pii]', '10.2174/1573406415666190225112950 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Chem. 2020;16(3):368-384. doi: 10.2174/1573406415666190225112950.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, ibrutinib is administered continuously until disease progression. Combination regimens with ibrutinib are being developed to deepen response which could allow for ibrutinib maintenance (IM) discontinuation. Among untreated older patients with CLL, clinical investigators had the following questions: (i) does ibrutinib + venetoclax + obinutuzumab (IVO) with IM have superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared with ibrutinib + obinutuzumab (IO) with IM, and (ii) does the treatment strategy of IVO + IM for patients without minimal residual disease complete response (MRD- CR) or IVO + IM discontinuation for patients with MRD- CR have superior PFS compared with IO + IM. DESIGN: Conventional designs randomize patients to IO with IM or IVO with IM to address the first objective, or randomize patients to each treatment strategy to address the second objective. A sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) design and analysis is proposed to address both objectives. RESULTS: A SMART design strategy is appropriate when comparing adaptive interventions, which are defined by an individual's sequence of treatment decisions and guided by intermediate outcomes, such as response to therapy. A review of common applications of SMART design strategies is provided. Specific to the SMART design previously considered for Alliance study A041702, the general structure of the SMART is presented, an approach to sample size and power calculations when comparing adaptive interventions embedded in the SMART with a time-to-event end point is fully described, and analyses plans are outlined. CONCLUSION: SMART design strategies can be used in cancer clinical trials with adaptive interventions to identify optimal treatment strategies. Further, standard software exists to provide sample size, power calculations, and data analysis for a SMART design.","['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

However, little is known about its function and regulatory mechanism in hematological malignancies. The biological function of Erbin on cell proliferation was measured in vitro and in vivo. The predicted target of Erbin was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assay and rescue experiment. We found that overexpression of Erbin could inhibit the cell proliferation and promote the cell differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, whereas depletion of Erbin could enhance the cell proliferation and block the cell differentiation in AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Besides, miR-183-5p was identified as the upstream regulator that negatively regulated the Erbin expression. The results were confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA pull-down assay. Furthermore, we found that miR-183-5p negatively regulated Erbin, resulting in enhanced cell proliferation of AML cells via activation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a pathways. The activation of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT/FoxO3a pathways was mediated by Erbin interacting with Grb2. These results were also validated by rescue experiments in vitro and in vivo. All above-mentioned findings indicated that the miR-183-5p/Erbin signaling pathway might represent a novel prognostic biomarker or therapeutic target for treatment of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Changes to the structure of these components can also alter cell phenotype, which points to the critical importance of cell mechanoresponse for diagnostic applications. The response to mechanical stress depends strongly on the forces experienced by the cell. Here, we use cell deformability in both shear-dominant and inertia-dominant microfluidic flow regimes to probe different aspects of the cell structure. In the inertial regime, we follow cellular response from (visco-)elastic through plastic deformation to cell structural failure and show a significant drop in cell viability for shear stresses >11.8 kN/m(2). Comparatively, a shear-dominant regime requires lower applied stresses to achieve higher cell strains. From this regime, deformation traces as a function of time contain a rich source of information including maximal strain, elastic modulus, and cell relaxation times and thus provide a number of markers for distinguishing cell types and potential disease progression. These results emphasize the benefit of multiple parameter determination for improving detection and will ultimately lead to improved accuracy for diagnosis. We present results for leukemia cells (HL60) as a model circulatory cell as well as for a colorectal cancer cell line, SW480, derived from primary adenocarcinoma (Dukes stage B). SW480 were also treated with the actin-disrupting drug latrunculin A to test the sensitivity of flow regimes to the cytoskeleton. We show that the shear regime is more sensitive to cytoskeletal changes and that large strains in the inertial regime cannot resolve changes to the actin cytoskeleton.","['Copyright (c) 2019 Biophysical Society.

Application of the international scale (IS) for the quantification of major BCR-ABL1 mRNA has been recommended in several sets of guidelines, including those of the European LeukemiaNet. The aim of this study was to clarify the efficacy of digital PCR technology for the IS of BCR-ABL1 mRNA in the patients with CML by comparing with real-time PCR. METHODS: The analysis of BCR-ABL1 mRNA was carried out by the Ipsogen((R)) BCR-ABL1 Mbcr IS-MMR DX Kit (Qiagen), and the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using 20 peripheral blood samples obtained from the 9 patients with CML at Sapporo Medical University Hospital. RESULTS: The correlation between the data obtained by digital PCR and by real-time PCR was really high at R = 0.96. The detection limit of digital PCR was up to 0.003% and was equal to IS with 0.01% or less in comparison with real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: Digital PCR technology is promising for predicting the IS value with similar efficacy to real-time PCR and should be useful for simple monitoring of the effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatments.",,"['Furuya, Daisuke', 'Moriai, Mikako', 'Koizumi, Yuki', 'Endo, Teruo', 'Asanuma, Kouichi', 'Yanagihara, Nozomi', 'Takahashi, Satoshi']","['Furuya D', 'Moriai M', 'Koizumi Y', 'Endo T', 'Asanuma K', 'Yanagihara N', 'Takahashi S']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Infection Control and Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Division of Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University Hospital, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan. stakahas@sapmed.ac.jp.', 'Department of Infection Control and Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South 1, West 16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan. stakahas@sapmed.ac.jp.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7953-8935'],['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20190223,Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/standards', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Limit of Detection', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood/standards', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*blood/standards', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Reference Standards']",['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)', 'Digital PCR', 'International scale (IS)', 'Major BCR-ABL1', 'Real-time PCR']",2019/02/25 06:00,2019/08/08 06:00,['2019/02/25 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-019-01419-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-019-01419-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2019 Jul;24(7):871-875. doi: 10.1007/s10147-019-01419-9.

The BCR-ABL1 transcript rate decline from baseline to 3 months has been demonstrated to be more predictive than a single BCR-ABL1 level at 3 months (M3). However, it cannot be used routinely because ABL1, as an internal gene control, is not reliable for BCR-ABL1 quantification above 10%. This study aimed to compare clinical outcome and molecular response of chronic phase CML patients, depending on the percentage of BCR-ABL1 transcript decrease from month 3 to month 6 using ABL1 as an internal control gene. Two hundred sixteen chronic phase CML patients treated with imatinib 400 mg for whom M3 and month 6 molecular data were available were included in the study. Associations with event-free (EFS), failure-free (FFS), progression-free (PFS), and overall survivals (OS) molecular response 4 log and 4.5 log were assessed. The percentage of BCR-ABL1 decline from month 3 to month 6 was significantly linked to the EFS and the FFS (p < 0.001). A common cut-off of 67% of decline predicted the better risk of event. Patients with a decrease below 67% have worse EFS and FFS as compared to those having a higher decrease (p < 0.001). The impact was confirmed by multivariate analysis. Since the slope between diagnosis and 3 months cannot be reliable using ABL1 as an internal gene control, the second decline rate of BCR-ABL1 transcript between month 3 and month 6 could efficiently identify patients at higher risk of event.",,"['Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Morisset, Stephane', 'Klein, Emilie', 'Chollet, Claudine', 'Robbesyn, Fanny', 'Turcq, Beatrice', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Nicolini, Franck E', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Dulucq S', 'Etienne G', 'Morisset S', 'Klein E', 'Chollet C', 'Robbesyn F', 'Turcq B', 'Tigaud I', 'Hayette S', 'Nicolini FE', 'Mahon FX']","['Laboratory of Hematology, Bordeaux University Hospital, Avenue de Magellan, 33604, Pessac Cedex, France. stephanie.dulucq@chu-bordeaux.fr.', 'INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat CS 61292, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France. stephanie.dulucq@chu-bordeaux.fr.', ""French Group of CML (Fi-LMC), Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France. stephanie.dulucq@chu-bordeaux.fr."", ""French Group of CML (Fi-LMC), Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France."", ""Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France."", 'Lieu-dit La Caillatte, 01150, Chazey sur Ain, France.', 'Leon Berard Cancer Institute and INSERM U1052, 28, rue Laennec, 69373, Lyon Cedex 08, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Bordeaux University Hospital, Avenue de Magellan, 33604, Pessac Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Bordeaux University Hospital, Avenue de Magellan, 33604, Pessac Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Bordeaux University Hospital, Avenue de Magellan, 33604, Pessac Cedex, France.', 'INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat CS 61292, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495, Pierre Benite Cedex, France.', ""French Group of CML (Fi-LMC), Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France."", 'Laboratory of Hematology, Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, 165 chemin du Grand Revoyet, 69495, Pierre Benite Cedex, France.', ""French Group of CML (Fi-LMC), Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France."", 'Leon Berard Cancer Institute and INSERM U1052, 28, rue Laennec, 69373, Lyon Cedex 08, France.', 'INSERM U1218, University of Bordeaux, 146 rue Leo Saignat CS 61292, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.', ""French Group of CML (Fi-LMC), Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France."", ""Bergonie Cancer Institute, 229 Cours de l'Argonne, CS61283, 33076, Bordeaux Cedex, France.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2728-7243'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190223,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",['NOTNLM'],"['Early molecular response (EMR)', 'Event-free survival (EFS)', 'Failure-free survival (FFS)', 'Imatinib', 'Second slope']",2019/02/25 06:00,2019/04/26 06:00,['2019/02/25 06:00'],"['2018/09/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03633-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03633-x [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 May;98(5):1159-1168. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03633-x.

It has been suggested that loss of spectrin isoforms may be associated with tumorigenesis of lymphoma, leukemia, gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recently reported that betaI spectrin expression was present in normal hepatocytes but lost in HCC cells, which suggested that spectrins may be helpful markers in diagnosis of HCC. In this study, using immunohistochemical staining, we further investigated the expression pattern of four spectrin isoforms (alphaII, betaI-III) on different benign and malignant liver tumors including focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), hepatic adenoma (HA), HCC, and cholangiocarcinoma (CC). The results revealed that betaI spectrin was moderately to strongly positive in FNH and HA tissues, but was only weakly positive or lost in HCC cases and was weakly positive in all CC cases. In addition, the betaIII spectrin, majority of which was moderately positive in both FNH and HA tissues, was mostly lost in poorly differentiated HCC but remained at least moderately positive in most CC cases. These results suggest that spectrins betaI and betaIII may be used to differentiate well differentiated HCC from FNH or HA, and poorly differentiated HCC from CC, respectively.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The development of VOD/SOS may be rapid and unpredictable, and the importance of identifying risk factors to facilitate prompt diagnosis and timely treatment has become increasingly recognized. The reporting of new retrospective study data for adults and children and the emergence of novel anticancer therapies that may increase the risk of VOD/SOD also necessitate updates on risk factors, as provided in this review. The latest studies reporting VOD/SOS risk factors support previously published data, although the importance of patient-related factors, such as acute kidney injury, increased international normalized ratio, female sex (in children), and platelet refractoriness, is given greater emphasis in the recent data. Non-transplantation-related chemotherapies associated with increased risk for VOD/SOS include oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapies. The novel antibody drug conjugates gemtuzumab ozogamicin and inotuzumab ozogamicin are now reported in product labeling to pose risks for VOD/SOS based on clinical trial data; an expert consensus panel has issued recommendations for risk reduction measures with inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment, including VOD/SOS prophylaxis and limitation to </=2 inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment cycles. A wide range of biomarkers, including genetic, hematologic, hepatic, and inflammatory factors, as well as novel diagnostic techniques such as thromboelastography and measures of liver stiffness, may further enhance future risk calculation for VOD/SOS, although none has been widely adopted. Continual monitoring for and recognition of VOD/SOS risk factors are essential for optimal management of this complication.","['Copyright (c) 2019 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Safety of dasatinib after thrombolytic therapy in acute ischemic stroke is unknown. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 63-year-old man with multiple vascular risk factors and chronic myelogenous leukemia (in molecular remission) on dasatinib presented with signs and symptoms of right hemispheric stroke owing to acute intracranial internal carotid artery occlusion that was treated with intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy resulting in near-complete resolution of stroke symptoms. The patient developed clinical worsening (>24 hours of thrombolytic therapy) after receiving a second dose of dasatinib that was due to symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage and necessitated decompressive hemicraniectomy. Routine coagulation profile was normal. The etiology of this hemorrhagic complication was likely secondary to primary platelet dysfunction due to dasatinib as reported in some recent in vitro and ex vivo studies.

We investigated the risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA cancer. METHODS: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 200 945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15-39 years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16 types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female); Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital; leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per 10 000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer. FINDINGS: During the 2 631 326 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16.8 years, IQR 10.5-25.2), 12 321 subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11 565 survivors, most frequently among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19.5 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 17.4-21.5) in survivors of breast cancer, 10.2 (8.0-12.4) in survivors of cervical cancer, 18.9 (16.6-21.1) in survivors of testicular cancer, 55.7 (50.4-61.1) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29.9 (26.3-33.6) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11.9% (95% CI 11.3-12.6) in survivors of breast cancer, 15.8% (14.8-16.7) in survivors of cervical cancer, 20.2% (18.9-21.5) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26.6% (24.7-28.6) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16.5% (15.2-18.0) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated. INTERPRETATION: Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.

The role of miR-378 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) remains unclear. The aim of the study was to reveal the potential effects of miR-378 in the pathological process and progress in CML. Our results showed general level of miR-378 was significant higher in CML patients compared to controls. Overexpression of miR-378 dramatically promoted cell proliferation and drug-resistance. Additionally, apoptosis was inhibited in cells transfected with miR-378. More and bigger stem cell sphere formation was observed in miR-378 transfected cells. Furthermore, enhanced expression of miR-378 was associated with upregulation of stem-cell makers OCT4 and c-Myc. Further study validated that miR-378 inhibited the expression of FUS1. Our research demonstrated the oncogenic nature of miR-378 in CML, and might contribute to the progress of CML.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Hypogelsolinemia occurs in a wide range of traumatic injuries and inflammatory reactions. We hypothesize that blood GSN levels will be altered in patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that develop sepsis, and assessment of GSN concentration will be a useful marker to determine their clinical outcome. To achieve this task, we evaluated the plasma gelsolin concentration in blood samples collected from patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at initial stages of sepsis. MATERIAL AND METHODS To assess if AML patients might be at risk of sepsis, a SOFA score was determined. Plasma gelsolin concentration was evaluated using an immunoblotting technique. RESULTS We found that GSN concentration in the blood of the AML group with developing sepsis was significantly lower (32+/-41 microg/ml; p<0.05) compared to the AML group (65+/-35 microg/ml) and control group (176+/-37 microg/ml; p<0.001). Additionally, low gelsolin concentration in the blood of AML patients developing sepsis was associated with a high SOFA score. A decrease of GSN concentration in the blood of AML subjects with developing sepsis suggests that GSN level in blood reflects not only chronic inflammation stage associated with leukemia, but that GSN depletion also manifests the inflammation associated with sepsis development. CONCLUSIONS The results presented here suggest the possible utility of GSN evaluation for diagnostic purposes. Overall, these data support the that reversing plasma GSN deficiency might be a possible new strategy in sepsis treatment.",,"['Watek, Marzena', 'Wnorowska, Urszula', 'Wollny, Tomasz', 'Durnas, Bonita', 'Wolak, Przemyslaw', 'Kosciolek-Zgodka, Sylwia', 'Pasiarski, Marcin', 'Gozdz, Stanislaw', 'Bucki, Robert']","['Watek M', 'Wnorowska U', 'Wollny T', 'Durnas B', 'Wolak P', 'Kosciolek-Zgodka S', 'Pasiarski M', 'Gozdz S', 'Bucki R']","['Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiological and Nanobiomedical Engineering, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Pediatric and Social Nursing, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science of The Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Holy Cross Oncology Center of Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences of the Jan Kochanowski University in Kielce, Kielce, Poland.', 'Department of Microbiological and Nanobiomedical Engineering, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190223,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Gelsolin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Female', 'Gelsolin/*analysis/blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sepsis/diagnosis/*metabolism']",,,2019/02/24 06:00,2019/04/11 06:00,['2019/02/24 06:00'],"['2019/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/11 06:00 [medline]']","['911904 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.911904 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Feb 23;25:1452-1458. doi: 10.12659/MSM.911904.,PMC6397619,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is activated by BCR-ABL playing a crucial rule in CML. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Everolimus, in CML models sensitive and resistant to Imatinib. We used one CML cell line sensitive to Imatinib (K562) and two resistant (K562-RC and K56-RD). Cell lines were treated with Everolimus alone and in combination with Imatinib. Cell viability was analysed by resazurin assay. Cell death and cell cycle were analysed by flow cytometry. Additionally, we also studied peripheral blood samples obtained from 52 patients under TKI treatment. Everolimus reduced cell line viability in sensitive (IC50 = 20 microM) and resistant models (K562-RC, IC50 = 25 microM; K562-RD, IC50 = 30 microM). This drug induced cell death by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Everolimus also reduced cell viability by increasing apoptosis of haematopoietic stem cells (CD34(+) cells) with low cytotoxicity to lymphocytes.

The potential effects of cancer treatments on a patient's future fertility are a major concern affecting the quality of life for cancer survivors. The effects of imatinib on future fertility are unknown. It is teratogenic. Therefore, patients are advised to stop treatment before pregnancy. Unfortunately, CML and GIST have high rates of recurrence in the absence of the drug, therefore halting imatinib during pregnancy endangers the mother. Possible long-term (post-treatment) effects of imatinib on reproduction have not been studied. We have used a mouse model to examine the effects of imatinib on the placenta and implantation after long-term imatinib exposure. We found significant changes in epigenetic markers of key imprinted genes in the placenta. There was a significant decrease in the labyrinth zone and vasculature of the placenta, which could impact fetal growth later in pregnancy. These effects on placental growth occurred even when imatinib was stopped prior to pregnancy. These results indicate potential long-term effects of imatinib on pregnancy and implantation.

However, MCL1 can promote drug resistance and overall cancer cell survival. Thus, there is a critical need to develop an effective drug that antagonizes MCL1. However, most putative MCL1 inhibitors have been misclassified as they fail to directly inhibit MCL1 in cells, but rather induce the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA. We have investigated three putative MCL1 inhibitors: MIM1, UMI-77, and A-1210477. All three compounds were developed in cell-free assays and then found to be cytotoxic, and hence assumed to directly target MCL1 in cells. Here, we investigated whether these compounds directly inhibit MCL1 or inhibit MCL1 indirectly through the induction of NOXA. Both MIM1- and UMI-77-induced NOXA through the unfolded protein response pathway, and sensitized leukemia cells to ABT-199; this cytotoxicity was dependent on NOXA suggesting that these compounds do not directly target MCL1. A-1210477 was the only compound that did not induce NOXA, but it still sensitized cells to ABT-199. A-1210477 induced accumulation of MCL1 protein consistent with it binding and preventing MCL1 degradation. However, at concentrations used in several prior studies, A-1210477 also induced cytochrome c release, caspase activation, and apoptosis in a BAX/BAK-independent manner. Furthermore, the release of cytochrome c occurred without loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. This apoptosis was extremely rapid, sometimes occurring within 0.5-1 h. Hence, we have identified a novel mechanism of apoptosis that circumvents the known mechanisms of cytochrome c release. It remains to be determined whether these unexpected mechanisms of action of putative BH3 mimetics will have therapeutic potential.",,"['Mallick, David J', 'Soderquist, Ryan S', 'Bates, Darcy', 'Eastman, Alan']","['Mallick DJ', 'Soderquist RS', 'Bates D', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Molecular and Systems Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University, Durham, NC, 27710, USA.', 'Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Systems Biology, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA.

DAXX and ATRX are also components of promyelocytic nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), which have been identified as sites of H3.3 chromatin assembly. Here, we use a transgene array that can be visualized in single living cells to investigate the mechanisms that recruit PML-NB proteins (i.e. PML, DAXX, ATRX, and SUMO-1, SUMO-2 and SUMO-3) to heterochromatin and their functions in H3.3 chromatin assembly. We show that DAXX and PML are recruited to the array through distinct SUMOylation-dependent mechanisms. Additionally, PML is recruited during S phase and its depletion increases H3.3 deposition. Since this effect is abrogated when PML and DAXX are co-depleted, it is likely that PML represses DAXX-mediated H3.3 chromatin assembly.

Mutations have been shown to arise in hematopoietic stem cells early in disease development and lead to altered DNA methylation landscapes and an increased risk of hematopoietic malignancy. Here, we show by genome-wide mapping of TET2 binding sites in different cell types that TET2 localizes to regions of open chromatin and cell-type-specific enhancers. We find that deletion of Tet2 in native hematopoiesis as well as fully transformed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results in changes in transcription factor (TF) activity within these regions, and we provide evidence that loss of TET2 leads to attenuation of chromatin binding of members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TF family. Together, these findings demonstrate that TET2 activity shapes the local chromatin environment at enhancers to facilitate TF binding and provides an example of how epigenetic dysregulation can affect gene expression patterns and drive disease development.",['(c) 2019 Rasmussen et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],"['Rasmussen, Kasper D', 'Berest, Ivan', 'Kebetaler, Sandra', 'Nishimura, Koutarou', 'Simon-Carrasco, Lucia', 'Vassiliou, George S', 'Pedersen, Marianne T', 'Christensen, Jesper', 'Zaugg, Judith B', 'Helin, Kristian']","['Rasmussen KD', 'Berest I', 'Kebetaler S', 'Nishimura K', 'Simon-Carrasco L', 'Vassiliou GS', 'Pedersen MT', 'Christensen J', 'Zaugg JB', 'Helin K']","['Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (Danstem), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'European Molecular Biology Institute, Structural and Computational Unit, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (Danstem), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (Danstem), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge CB2 0XY, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, Cambridge CB2 0PT, United Kingdom.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (Danstem), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (Danstem), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'European Molecular Biology Institute, Structural and Computational Unit, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Stem Cell Biology (Danstem), Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10065, USA.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4337-8022', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8324-4040', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1975-6097']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190222,United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatin/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Dioxygenases', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism']",,,2019/02/24 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2019/02/24 06:00'],"['2018/05/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['gr.239277.118 [pii]', '10.1101/gr.239277.118 [doi]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2019 Apr;29(4):564-575. doi: 10.1101/gr.239277.118.

Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the persistence and regenerative potential of LSCs is expected to result in the development of more effective therapies. We therefore interrogated functionally validated data sets of LSC-specific genes together with their known protein interactors and selected 64 candidates for a competitive in vivo gain-of-function screen to identify genes that enhanced stemness in human cord blood hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. A consistent effect observed for the top hits was the ability to restrain early repopulation kinetics while preserving regenerative potential. Overexpression (OE) of the most promising candidate, the orphan gene C3orf54/INKA1, in a patient-derived AML model (8227) promoted the retention of LSCs in a primitive state manifested by relative expansion of CD34(+) cells, accumulation of cells in G0, and reduced output of differentiated progeny. Despite delayed early repopulation, at later times, INKA1-OE resulted in the expansion of self-renewing LSCs. In contrast, INKA1 silencing in primary AML reduced regenerative potential. Mechanistically, our multidimensional confocal analysis found that INKA1 regulates G0 exit by interfering with nuclear localization of its target PAK4, with concomitant reduction of global H4K16ac levels. These data identify INKA1 as a novel regulator of LSC latency and reveal a link between the regulation of stem cell kinetics and pool size during regeneration.",['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kaufmann, Kerstin B', 'Garcia-Prat, Laura', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Ng, Stanley W K', 'Takayanagi, Shin-Ichiro', 'Mitchell, Amanda', 'Wienholds, Erno', 'van Galen, Peter', 'Cumbaa, Christian A', 'Tsay, Mike J', 'Pastrello, Chiara', 'Wagenblast, Elvin', 'Krivdova, Gabriela', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Lechman, Eric R', 'Zandi, Sasan', 'Jurisica, Igor', 'Wang, Jean C Y', 'Xie, Stephanie Z', 'Dick, John E']","['Kaufmann KB', 'Garcia-Prat L', 'Liu Q', 'Ng SWK', 'Takayanagi SI', 'Mitchell A', 'Wienholds E', 'van Galen P', 'Cumbaa CA', 'Tsay MJ', 'Pastrello C', 'Wagenblast E', 'Krivdova G', 'Minden MD', 'Lechman ER', 'Zandi S', 'Jurisica I', 'Wang JCY', 'Xie SZ', 'Dick JE']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Regenerative Medicine Laboratories, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Krembil Research Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics.', 'Department of Computer Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; and.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5013-6123', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1263-4257', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0735-1570', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7543-3917', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9527-8317']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190222,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Inka1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (PAK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (p21-Activated Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Up-Regulation', 'p21-Activated Kinases/analysis']",,,2019/02/24 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/02/24 06:00'],"['2018/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)42559-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-10-881441 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 May 16;133(20):2198-2211. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-10-881441.

The extension of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells (CARTs) to T-ALL remains challenging because the shared expression of target antigens between CARTs and T-ALL blasts leads to CART fratricide. CD1a is exclusively expressed in cortical T-ALL (coT-ALL), a major subset of T-ALL, and retained at relapse. This article reports that the expression of CD1a is mainly restricted to developing cortical thymocytes, and neither CD34(+) progenitors nor T cells express CD1a during ontogeny, confining the risk of on-target/off-tumor toxicity.

To elucidate metabolism and toxicity of arsenic, we analyzed time course of arsenic species in red blood cells (RBCs) of APL patients. METHODS: Nine APL patients received ATO (0.16 mg/kg/day) through 18-h infusion. Blood was collected before daily administration (days 2 to 9), and at different time points on day 8. Inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) were detected by HPLC-ICP-MS. RESULTS: Arsenic species reached Cmax at 18 h on day 8. Arsenicals gradually accumulated during days 2 to 9, whereas their percentages remained almost constant. The general trend in red blood cells (RBCs) was iAs > MMA > DMA. MMA was consistently the predominant methylated arsenic metabolite in RBCs. iAs, MMA, and tAs (tAs = iAs + DMA + MMA) concentrations (P < 0.0001), MMA/DMA ratios (P = 0.0016) and iAs% (P = 0.0013) were higher in RBCs than in plasma. CONCLUSIONS: Time course of arsenic species reveal kinetic characteristic of ATO metabolites in RBCs. Arsenic species accumulated with administration frequency. Arsenic species in RBCs were remarkably different from those in plasma. Time course of arsenic species in RBCs is important in ATO clinical application.",,"['Guo, Meihua', 'Wang, Bin', 'Liu, Shuchuan', 'Wang, Wenjing', 'Gao, Chunlu', 'Hu, Shuang', 'Fan, Shengjin', 'Hai, Xin', 'Zhou, Jin']","['Guo M', 'Wang B', 'Liu S', 'Wang W', 'Gao C', 'Hu S', 'Fan S', 'Hai X', 'Zhou J']","['a Department of Pharmacy , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'b Department of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'c Heilongjiang Institute of Hematology & Oncology , Harbin , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'b Department of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'c Heilongjiang Institute of Hematology & Oncology , Harbin , China.', 'a Department of Pharmacy , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'b Department of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University , Harbin , China.', 'c Heilongjiang Institute of Hematology & Oncology , Harbin , China.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8476-6702'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190311,England,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,101278296,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', 'AJ2HL7EU8K (Cacodylic Acid)', 'J37VJ5709S (monomethylarsonic acid)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic/blood', 'Arsenic Trioxide/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenicals/blood', 'Cacodylic Acid/blood', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Erythrocytes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry/methods', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'arsenic speciation', 'arsenic trioxide', 'red blood cells', 'slow-rate infusion', 'time course']",2019/02/24 06:00,2019/04/06 06:00,['2019/02/24 06:00'],"['2019/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17512433.2019.1586532 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Apr;12(4):371-378. doi: 10.1080/17512433.2019.1586532.

Pediatric patients have a favourable prognosis, with 5-years overall survival rates near 90%, while adult ALL still correlates with poorer survival. However, during the past few decades, the therapeutic outcome of adult ALL was significantly ameliorated, mainly due to intensive pediatric-based protocols of chemotherapy. Mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a conserved serine/threonine kinase belonging to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-related kinase family (PIKK) and resides in two distinct signalling complexes named mTORC1, involved in mRNA translation and protein synthesis and mTORC2 that controls cell survival and migration. Moreover, both complexes are remarkably involved in metabolism regulation. Growing evidence reports that mTOR dysregulation is related to metastatic potential, cell proliferation and angiogenesis and given that PI3K/Akt/mTOR network activation is often associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in ALL, there is a constant need to discover novel inhibitors for ALL treatment. Here, the current knowledge of mTOR signalling and the development of anti-mTOR compounds are documented, reporting the most relevant results from both preclinical and clinical studies in ALL that have contributed significantly into their efficacy or failure.",,"['Simioni, Carolina', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Melloni, Elisabetta', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Simioni C', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Melloni E', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Medical Sciences, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. carolina.simioni@unife.it.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy. alberto.martelli@unibo.it.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. giorgio.zauli@unife.it.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. elisabetta.melloni@unife.it.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. luca.neri@unife.it.', 'LTTA-Electron Microscopy Center, University of Ferrara, 44121 Ferrara, Italy. luca.neri@unife.it.']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0801-7811', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5196-7260']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20190221,Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/metabolism', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2/metabolism', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cell signalling', '*mTOR', '*metabolism', '*targeted therapy']",2019/02/24 06:00,2019/02/24 06:01,['2019/02/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/24 06:01 [medline]']","['cells8020190 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8020190 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Feb 21;8(2). pii: cells8020190. doi: 10.3390/cells8020190.,PMC6406494,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVES: To examine the mortality experience of workers employed in four Italian oil refineries. METHODS: The cohort included 5112 male workers ever employed between 1949 and 2011. The average follow-up period was 49 years. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using as reference age-gender-calendar specific regional rates. Analyses by duration of employment and latency were performed. RESULTS: In the whole cohort, pleural cancer (6 deaths, SMR 1.59; 95% CI 0.71-3.53), brain cancer (14 deaths, SMR 1.47; 95% CI 0.87-2.49) and lymphatic leukemia (LL) (8 deaths, SMR 1.81; 95% CI 0.91-3.62) showed increased risks. All pleural cancers occurred after 10 years of latency and the highest risk was observed among workers with duration >/=20 years; the brain cancer excess was confined in the shortest duration and latency. The LL (and chronic lymphatic leukemia in particular) excess regarded workers with latency and duration longer than 20 years. Four deaths from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were observed and all occurred after 20 years of latency (SMR 1.55, 95% CI 0.58-4.12); a two-fold-increased risk was observed in the longest duration.

However, the use of viral vectors to provide long-term CAR expression is associated with high production costs and cumbersome quality controls, impacting the final cost of CAR T cell therapies. Nonviral integrative vectors, such as Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposons, provide an alternative to modify primary T cells. Therefore, we developed a protocol to expand SB-transfected 19BBzeta CAR T cells using a lymphoblastoid cell line, and evaluated T cell phenotype as well as function along the T cell expansion. Electroporation of PBMCs with transposon plasmid decreased cell viability on day 1 but had a minor impact on the frequency of memory subpopulations when compared to mock condition. CAR+ lymphocytes showed increased proliferation compared to mock control and high cytotoxic activity towards CD19+ cells without significant differences in exhaustion markers expression. Moreover, CAR+ lymphocytes showed an increased frequency by the end of the stimulation cycle compared with day 1, suggesting that CAR expression confers a selective proliferation advantage. Immunodeficient NOD scid gamma chain knockout (NSG) mice engrafted with the human pre-B leukemic cell line RS4;11 and treated with 19BBzeta CAR T cells showed improved overall survival when compared to mock T cells treated animals. The results showed that electroporation using the SB system is a simple and affordable method for inducing long-term CAR expression in T lymphocytes.

Currently, most reports of AML-inv(3)/t(3;3) were from Western countries, and few reports were from Asian countries. Racial differences in patients with AML-inv(3)/t(3;3) are still unknown. METHODS: Between January 1996 and April 2018, a total of 37 AML cases with inv(3)/t(3;3) were studied retrospectively. They were collected from 2229 primary AML cases performed with conventional cytogenetic analysis (37/2229, 1.66%). RESULTS: Here, some differences were found by comparing our data with those from Western countries. In our series, AML with inv(3)(q21q26) had a lower incidence than that with t(3;3)(q21;q26) (11 vs 26 cases). Our patients seemed to be more younger (median, 43 years) and have lower hemoglobin concentrations (median, 73 g/L) and higher platelet count (median, 351 x 10(9) /L). A higher incidence of acute monoblastic and monocytic leukemia (45.9%) was observed in our patients. Immunophenotypic studies showed that CD38 (30.8%) was not so frequently expressed as that in the earlier reports. Mutations analysis showed a high frequency of NRAS mutations (45.0%), followed by SF3B1(15.0%), GATA2(15.0%), FLT3-ITD(10.0%), C-Kit/D816(5.0%), and CEBPA(5.0%), without mutation of NPM1(Exon12)or JAK2V617.

Here, we show that Ebp1 p48, a predominant expression isoform, is highly expressed in the majority of human colon tumor cells compared with normal adjacent tissues and its expression is required for the oncogenic activities of these cells. Depletion of Ebp1 expression in primary colon cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation, colony forming, and invasion in vitro as well as tumor formation in vivo and enhances cell sensitivity to irradiation. We further demonstrated that Ebp1 interacts with TIF-90, a splice variant of transcription initiation factor IA (TIF-IA) of the RNA polymerase I complex, allowing for regulation of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) synthesis and oncogenesis in human colon cancer cells. Moreover, Ebp1 expression is essential for Akt protected TIF-90 stability by preventing TIF-90's ubiquitination by Mdm2 and hence, its proteasomal degradation. The results of the present study support a mechanism of underlying oncogenic activities by means of Ebp1 through regulation of TIF-90-mediated rRNA synthesis and suggest the potential therapeutic treatment of colon cancer by targeting Ebp1 and its signaling.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Nguyen, Dang Quan', 'Hoang, Dinh Hoa', 'Nguyen, Thanh Thao Vo', 'Ho, Huu Duc', 'Huynh, Vu', 'Shin, June Ho', 'Ly, Quoc Trung', 'Thi Nguyen, Dai Dong', 'Ghoda, Lucy', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong']","['Nguyen DQ', 'Hoang DH', 'Nguyen TTV', 'Ho HD', 'Huynh V', 'Shin JH', 'Ly QT', 'Thi Nguyen DD', 'Ghoda L', 'Marcucci G', 'Nguyen LXT']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Thong Nhat Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Medicine, Phuong Chau International Hospital, Soc Trang, Vietnam.', 'Department of Oncology, Thong Nhat Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5464-0861'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190222,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (PA2G4 protein, human)', '0 (Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RRN3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Pol1 Transcription Initiation Complex Proteins/*metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'RNA, Ribosomal/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitination']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Ebp1', '*TIF-90', '*colon cancer', '*rRNA synthesis']",2019/02/23 06:00,2020/06/09 06:00,['2019/02/23 06:00'],"['2018/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.28385 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Aug;234(10):17612-17621. doi: 10.1002/jcp.28385.

While highly efficacious, post-infusion T cell activity often results in massive cytokine release precipitating cytokine release syndrome (CRS), the signature toxicity of CAR T cells. This toxicity is characterized by systemic immune activation resulting in fever, hypotension, respiratory insufficiency and capillary leak. Either in conjunction with or in the absence of CRS, a subset of patients may also develop mild to severe neurotoxicity. Although the precise pathogenesis of CRS and neurotoxicity aren't fully elucidated, risk factors and mitigation strategies have been reported. Areas covered: This manuscript provides an in-depth overview of the pathogenesis, clinical characteristics, current toxicity management strategies, and future perspectives pertaining to CRS and neurotoxicity. Expert Opinion: As CAR T cell based therapies gain popularity in the management of various malignancies, the complimentary toxicities of CRS and neurotoxicity pose a clinical challenge in practice. Risk adaptive modeling incorporating disease profile, patient demographics, lymphodepletion, cell dosing, CAR T construct, and potentially cytokine gene polymorphisms may be instructive to assess individualized risk and optimal CRS/neurotoxicity management.",,"['Acharya, Utkarsh H', 'Dhawale, Tejaswini', 'Yun, Seongseok', 'Jacobson, Caron A', 'Chavez, Julio C', 'Ramos, Jorge D', 'Appelbaum, Jacob', 'Maloney, David G']","['Acharya UH', 'Dhawale T', 'Yun S', 'Jacobson CA', 'Chavez JC', 'Ramos JD', 'Appelbaum J', 'Maloney DG']","['a Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine , University of Washington School of Medicine , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'b Clinical Research Division , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'c Divisions of Hematologic Malignancies & Immune Effector Cell Therapy, Department of Medical Oncology , Dana-Farber Cancer Institute , Boston , MA , USA.', 'd Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine , University of Washington , Seattle , WA , USA.', 'e Department of Malignant Hematology , H.

However, secondary resistance to this agent often occurs during treatment and leads to treatment failure. It is important to clarify the mechanisms underlying the resistance for improving the efficacy. In this study, by gradually increasing concentration after a continuous induction of DAC, we established the DAC-resistant K562 cell line (K562/DAC) from its parental cell line K562. The proliferation and survival rate of K562/DAC was significantly increased, whereas the apoptosis rate was remarkably decreased than that of K562 after DAC treatment. In K562/DAC, a total of 108 genes were upregulated and 118 genes were downregulated by RNA-Seq. In addition, we also observed aberrant expression of DDX43/H19/miR-186 axis (increased DDX43/H19 and decreased miR-186) in K562/DAC cells.

The frequency of complete blood count abnormalities and its combinations, symptoms and physical findings were investigated in Hispanic children from an open population at the diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methods: The patient charts and electronic records of under 16-year-old children diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia over 10 years at a regional hematology center of a university hospital were analyzed to retrieve data concerning the complete blood count at first evaluation. Type and distribution of abnormal data, frequency of symptoms and physical findings at presentation were documented. Results: The records of 203 children aged 0-15 years diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia from 2006 to 2016 were revisited. The results of the blood workup showed a median white blood cell count of 7120 x 10(9)/L (range: 450-600,000 x 10(9)/L), and a median hemoglobin concentration of 7.5 g/dL (range: 2.4-15.3 g/dL), whereas the median platelet count was 47,400 x 10(9)/L (range: 4000-544,000 x 10(9)/L). Leukocytosis and leukopenia were present in 36.6% and 36.1% of cases, respectively; anemia was diagnosed in 82.9% children. The order of frequency for major clinical symptoms was fatigue 62%, fever 60%, bone and joint pain 39%, hyporexia 33% and weight loss 21%, while main physical findings were hepatomegaly 78%, splenomegaly 63%, lymphadenopathy 57%, pallor 48%, and purpura 30%.

Along with disease-related factors, patient-related factors, in particular age, are a strong predictor of outcome that influence treatment decisions. Many acute myeloid leukemia risk stratification models have been developed to predict the outcome of intensive chemotherapy. However, these models did not include physical function assessments. Methods: This study investigated the impact of several factors, namely the performance status, physical function and age on the short-term outcomes of intensive chemotherapy in a cohort of 50 Egyptian patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia. Results: Complete remission after intensive chemotherapy in these myeloid leukemia patients at Day 28 was 56% and the mortality rate was 12% and 34% at Day 28 and Day 60, respectively. The pretreatment Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was significantly correlated with outcomes on Day 28 and Day 60 (p-value = 0.041 and p-value = 0.032, respectively). There were significant correlations between the two-minute walk test and outcomes of therapy on Day 28 and 60 (p-value = 0.032 and p-value = 0.047, respectively) and between grip strength test and outcomes of therapy on Day 28 and 60 (p-value = 0.046 and p-value = 0.047 respectively). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between chair stand test and outcome of therapy on Day 28 (p-value = 0.023). Conclusion: Performance status and physical function assessments were strong predictors of outcome of intensive chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia and we recommend the incorporation of these variables in risk stratification models for the personalization of therapy before treating acute myeloid leukemia patients with intensive chemotherapy.",,"['Fateen, Mohamed A', 'El Demerdash, Doaa M', 'Zayed, Rania A', 'Mattar, Mervat M']","['Fateen MA', 'El Demerdash DM', 'Zayed RA', 'Mattar MM']","['Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.', 'Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.

However, available evidence from the literature seems to be conflicting as to the impact of incompatibility on overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, graft-versus-host disease, and time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment. Methods: This single-center, prospective, cohort study included patients with hematological malignancies who underwent a first allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation between 2008 and 2014. Patients receiving umbilical cord blood as the stem cell source were excluded from this analysis. The impact of ABO incompatibility was evaluated in respect to overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, acute graft-versus-host disease and engraftment. Results: A total of 130 patients were included of whom 78 (60%) were males. The median age at transplant was 36 (range: 2-65) years, 44 (33%) presented ABO incompatibility, 75 (58%) had acute leukemia, 111 (85%) had a related donor, 100 (77%) received peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells as graft source and 99 (76%) underwent a myeloablative conditioning regimen. There was no statistically significant association between ABO incompatibility and overall survival, event-free survival, transplant-related mortality, grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease, neutrophil or platelet engraftment in multivariate analysis.

We suggest a model of transgenerational segregation of the susceptibility genes based on the study of malignant blood disorders in Norwegian and Danish families with unrelated parents, and in the inbred Faroese population with related parents. This model, consisting of parental genomic imprinting and mother-son microchimerism, can explain the male predominance in most of the diseases, the predominance of affected parent-offspring when parents are not related, and the different modes of segregation in males and females.

Following the initial discovery of BCL-2 in the context of B-cell lymphoma in the 1980s, a number of homologous proteins have since been identified. The members of the Bcl-2 family are designated as such due to their BCL-2 homology (BH) domains and involvement in apoptosis regulation. The BH domains facilitate the family members' interactions with each other and can indicate pro- or anti-apoptotic function. Traditionally, these proteins are categorised into one of the three subfamilies; anti-apoptotic, BH3-only (pro-apoptotic), and pore-forming or 'executioner' (pro-apoptotic) proteins. Each of the BH3-only or anti-apoptotic proteins has a distinct pattern of activation, localisation and response to cell death or survival stimuli. All of these can vary across cell or stress types, or developmental stage, and this can cause the delineation of the roles of BCL-2 family members. Added to this complexity is the presence of relatively uncharacterised isoforms of many of the BCL-2 family members. There is a gap in our knowledge regarding the function of BCL-2 family isoforms. BH domain status is not always predictive or indicative of protein function, and several other important sequences, which can contribute to apoptotic activity have been identified. While therapeutic strategies targeting the BCL-2 family are constantly under development, it is imperative that we understand the molecules, which we are attempting to target. This review, discusses our current knowledge of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family isoforms. With significant improvements in the potential for splicing therapies, it is important that we begin to understand the distinctions of the BCL-2 family, not limited to just the mechanisms of apoptosis control, but in their roles outside of apoptosis.",,"['Warren, Chloe F A', 'Wong-Brown, Michelle W', 'Bowden, Nikola A']","['Warren CFA', 'Wong-Brown MW', 'Bowden NA']","['Faculty of Health and Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.', 'Faculty of Health and Medicine, School of Biomedical Sciences and Pharmacy, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.', 'Hunter Medical Research Institute, Newcastle, NSW, Australia.

However, the underlying molecular pathways, including the role of micro-RNA, are not completely understood. To assess the contribution of micro-RNA, we performed micro-RNA profiling of hematopoietic stem cells and their immediate downstream progeny multi-potent progenitors from wild-type control and Pbx1-conditional knockout mice, whose stem cells display a profound self-renewal defect. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis separated stem cells from multi-potent progenitors, suggesting that micro-RNA might regulate the first transition step in the adult hematopoietic development. Notably, Pbx1-deficient and wild-type cells clustered separately, linking micro-RNAs to self-renewal impairment. Differential expression analysis of micro-RNA in the physiological stem cell-to-multi-potent progenitor transition and in Pbx1-deficient stem cells compared to control stem cells revealed miR-127-3p as the most differentially expressed. Furthermore, miR-127-3p was strongly stem cell-specific, being quickly down-regulated upon differentiation and not re-expressed further downstream in the bone marrow hematopoietic hierarchy. Inhibition of miR-127-3p function in Lineage-negative cells, achieved through a lentiviral-sponge vector, led to severe stem cell depletion, as assessed with serial transplantation assays. miR-127-3p-sponged stem cells displayed accelerated differentiation, which was uncoupled from proliferation, accounting for the observed stem cell reduction. miR-127-3p overexpression in Lineage-negative cells did not alter stem cell pool size, but gave rise to lymphopenia, likely due to lack of miR-127-3p physiological downregulation beyond the stem cell stage. Thus, tight regulation of miR-127-3p is crucial to preserve the self-renewing stem cell pool and homeostasis of the hematopoietic system.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Crisafulli, Laura', 'Muggeo, Sharon', 'Uva, Paolo', 'Wang, Yulei', 'Iwasaki, Masayuki', 'Locatelli, Silvia', 'Anselmo, Achille', 'Colombo, Federico S', 'Carlo-Stella, Carmelo', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Villa, Anna', 'Gentner, Bernhard', 'Ficara, Francesca']","['Crisafulli L', 'Muggeo S', 'Uva P', 'Wang Y', 'Iwasaki M', 'Locatelli S', 'Anselmo A', 'Colombo FS', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Cleary ML', 'Villa A', 'Gentner B', 'Ficara F']","['UOS Milan Unit, Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica (IRGB), CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.', 'UOS Milan Unit, Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica (IRGB), CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.', 'CRS4, Science and Technology Park Polaris, Pula, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Flow Cytometry Core, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Flow Cytometry Core, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.', 'Humanitas Huniversity, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Pieve Emanuele, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'UOS Milan Unit, Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica (IRGB), CNR, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET), IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'UOS Milan Unit, Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica (IRGB), CNR, Milan, Italy francesca.ficara@humanitasresearch.it.', 'Humanitas Clinical and Research Center - IRCCS, Rozzano, Italy.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190221,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn127 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/metabolism']",,,2019/02/23 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/02/23 06:00'],"['2018/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.198499 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.198499 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Sep;104(9):1744-1755. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.198499.

While there is a growing understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of the disease, the extent of metabolic heterogeneity and its relation to molecular heterogeneity has not been systematically studied. Here, we assessed 11 bioenergetic features, primarily reflecting cell oxidative phosphorylation and glycolytic activity, in leukemic cells from 140 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients using metabolic flux analysis. We examined these bioenergetic features for relationships with molecular profiles (including genetic aberrations, transcriptome and methylome profiles) of the tumors, their ex vivo responses to a panel of 63 compounds, and with clinical data. We observed that leukemic cells with mutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain show significantly lower glycolytic activity than cells with unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain. Accordingly, several key glycolytic genes (PFKP, PGAM1 and PGK1) were found to be down-regulated in samples harboring mutated immunoglobulin variable heavy-chain. In addition, 8q24 copy number gains, 8p12 deletions, 13q14 deletions and ATM mutations were identified as determinants of cellular respiration. The metabolic state of leukemic cells was associated with drug sensitivity; in particular, higher glycolytic activity was linked to increased resistance towards several drugs including rotenone, navitoclax, and orlistat. In addition, we found glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve to be predictors of overall survival (P<0.05) independently of established genetic predictors. Taken together, our study shows that heterogeneity in the energy metabolism of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells is influenced by genetic variants and this could be therapeutically exploited in the selection of therapeutic strategies.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Lu, Junyan', 'Bottcher, Martin', 'Walther, Tatjana', 'Mougiakakos, Dimitrios', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Huber, Wolfgang']","['Lu J', 'Bottcher M', 'Walther T', 'Mougiakakos D', 'Zenz T', 'Huber W']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', 'Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 5, Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany dimitrios.mougiakakos@uk-erlangen.de.', 'Molecular Therapy in Hematology and Oncology, National Center for Tumor Diseases and German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany thorsten.zenz@usz.ch.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), Heidelberg, Germany wolfgang.huber@embl.de.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190221,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Genetic Variation', '*Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/02/23 06:00,2020/07/29 06:00,['2019/02/23 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.203067 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.203067 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Sep;104(9):1830-1840. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.203067.

RUNX1 alterations affect its DNA binding capacity and transcriptional activities, leading to the deregulation of transcriptional targets, and abnormal proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells. Identification of RUNX1 target genes and clarification of their biological functions are of great importance in the search for new therapeutic strategies for RUNX1-altered leukemia. In this study, we identified and confirmed that KLF4, a known tumor suppressor gene, as a direct target of RUNX1, was down-regulated in RUNX1-ETO leukemia. RUNX1 bound to KLF4 promoter in chromatin to activate its transcription, while the leukemogenic RUNX1-ETO fusion protein had little effect on this transactivation. KLF4 was also identified as a novel binding partner of RUNX1. RUNX1 interacted with KLF4 through Runt domain and further co-activated its target genes. However, RUNX1-ETO competed with RUNX1 to bind KLF4 through Runt and ETO domains, and abrogated transcription of KLF4. Finally, overexpression experiments indicated that RUNX1 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of t(8;21) leukemia cells via KLF4-mediated upregulation of P57. These data suggest KLF4 dysregulation mediated by RUNX1-ETO enhances proliferation and retards apoptosis, and provides a potential target for therapy of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Liu, Shuang', 'Xing, Yanyan', 'Lu, Wenting', 'Li, Shouyun', 'Tian, Zheng', 'Xing, Haiyan', 'Tang, Kejing', 'Xu, Yingxi', 'Rao, Qing', 'Wang, Min', 'Wang, Jianxiang']","['Liu S', 'Xing Y', 'Lu W', 'Li S', 'Tian Z', 'Xing H', 'Tang K', 'Xu Y', 'Rao Q', 'Wang M', 'Wang J']","['State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology wangjx@ihcams.ac.cn wangjxm@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology wangjx@ihcams.ac.cn wangjxm@ihcams.ac.cn.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Blood Diseases, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, P.R.

Thrombocytopenia is a major and sometimes fatal complication in patients with acute leukemia. However, the mechanisms underlying defective thrombopoiesis in leukemia have not been fully elucidated. In the steady state, platelets are continuously produced by megakaryocytes. Using an MLL-AF9-induced acute myeloid leukemia mouse model, we demonstrated a preserved number and proportion of megakaryocyte-primed hematopoietic stem cell subsets, but weakened megakaryocytic differentiation via both canonical and non-canonical routes. This primarily accounted for the dramatic reduction of megakaryocytic progenitors observed in acute myeloid leukemia bone marrow and a severe disruption of the maturation of megakaryocytes. Additionally, we discovered overproduction of interleukin-4 from bone marrow endothelial cells in acute myeloid leukemia and observed inhibitory effects of interleukin-4 throughout the process of megakaryopoiesis in vivo Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of interleukin-4 in combination with induction chemotherapy not only promoted recovery of platelet counts, but also prolonged the duration of remission in our acute myeloid leukemia mouse model.

However, many patients acquire resistance, demonstrating the need for new and improved drugs. We previously demonstrated that the natural process of antibody hexamer formation on targeted cells allows for optimal induction of complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Complement-dependent cytotoxicity can be potentiated by introducing a single point mutation such as E430G in the IgG Fc domain that enhances intermolecular Fc-Fc interactions between cell-bound IgG molecules, thereby facilitating IgG hexamer formation. Antibodies specific for CD37, a target that is abundantly expressed on healthy and malignant B cells, are generally poor inducers of complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Here we demonstrate that introduction of the hexamerization-enhancing mutation E430G in CD37-specific antibodies facilitates highly potent complement-dependent cytotoxicity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells ex vivo Strikingly, we observed that combinations of hexamerization-enhanced CD20 and CD37 antibodies cooperated in C1q binding and induced superior and synergistic complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient-derived cancer cells compared to the single agents. Furthermore, CD20 and CD37 antibodies colocalized on the cell membrane, an effect that was potentiated by the hexamerization-enhancing mutation. Moreover, upon cell surface binding, CD20 and CD37 antibodies were shown to form mixed hexameric antibody complexes consisting of both antibodies each bound to their own cognate target, so-called hetero-hexamers.

Imaging examination is the gold standard for diagnosis. PRES frequently occurrence in patients with hematological malignancies results in poorer prognosis and higher mortality. We aim to establish a practical and operable scale for early prediction, assessment of the severity of the Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome, and timely intervention for better prognosis. METHODS: The scale designed by reviewing the literature and by referring to clinical practice. We assessed the reliability and validity of the scale. Scale-based assessment of children undergoing chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia conducted as early warning and intervention for those who may have PRES. RESULTS: Establishment of Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome early warning scoring (PEWS) scale included three parts, as follows: (1) risk factors, including underlying disease, hypertension, Infection, and drug toxicity; (2) clinical features, including high cranial pressure, visual symptoms, seizure, and disturbance of consciousness; and (3) EEG features, including slow wave and epileptiform discharges. Utility assessment of PEWS scale showed that in 57 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 54 scored less than 10 and none of them detected as PRES. The other two had scores of 12 and 13 both diagnosed with PRES by brain MRI scan. CONCLUSIONS: PEWS scale can predict PRES early. PRES was highly suspected when the score was 10 points and more. Thus, prophylactic intervention can give to improve the prognosis of PRES.",,"['Zou, Li-Ping', 'Liu, Li-Ying', 'Li, Hui', 'Wang, Yang-Yang', 'Liu, Ying', 'Chen, Jing', 'Hu, Lin-Yan', 'Liu, Meng-Jia', 'Zhang, Meng-Na', 'Lu, Qian', 'Ma, Shu-Fang']","['Zou LP', 'Liu LY', 'Li H', 'Wang YY', 'Liu Y', 'Chen J', 'Hu LY', 'Liu MJ', 'Zhang MN', 'Lu Q', 'Ma SF']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China. zouliping21@hotmail.com."", 'Center of Epilepsy, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, 100069, China. zouliping21@hotmail.com.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology & Oncology, Ministry of Health, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200127, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China."", 'Center of Epilepsy, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, 100069, China.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, 100853, People's Republic of China.""]",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7233-9378'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190221,England,BMC Neurol,BMC neurology,100968555,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Early Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome/*diagnosis', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors']",['NOTNLM'],"['Electroencephalogram', 'Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome', 'Prevention', 'Scale', 'Seizure']",2019/02/23 06:00,2019/03/29 06:00,['2019/02/23 06:00'],"['2018/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12883-019-1247-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12883-019-1247-0 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Neurol. 2019 Feb 21;19(1):30. doi: 10.1186/s12883-019-1247-0.,PMC6385440,,"['81471329/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '2016YFC1000707/National Science and Technology Major Project', 'Z141100002114001/Public health program of Capital']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of six small molecule pharmacological agents, which interfere with endocytic and other processes, on SA-mediated augmentation of saporin and saporin-based immunotoxins (ITs) directed against CD7, CD19, CD22 and CD38 on human lymphoma and leukaemia cell lines. Inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis or endosomal acidification abolished the SA augmentation of saporin and of all four immunotoxins tested but the cytotoxicity of each IT or saporin alone was largely unaffected. The data support the hypothesis that endocytic processes are involved in the augmentative action of SA for saporin ITs targeted against a range of antigens expressed by leukaemia and lymphoma cells. In addition, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger tiron reduced the cytotoxicity of BU12-SAP and OKT10-SAP but had no effect on 4KB128-SAP or saporin cytotoxicity. Tiron also had no effect on SA-mediated augmentation of the saporin-based ITs or unconjugated saporin. These results suggest that ROS are not involved in the augmentation of saporin ITs and that ROS induction is target antigen-dependent and not directly due to the cytotoxic action of the toxin moiety.",,"['Smith, Wendy S', 'Johnston, David A', 'Holmes, Suzanne E', 'Wensley, Harrison J', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U', 'Flavell, David J']","['Smith WS', 'Johnston DA', 'Holmes SE', 'Wensley HJ', 'Flavell SU', 'Flavell DJ']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.

Control of malignant clone emergence and the subsequent normal-leukemic hematopoietic cell out-competition require antitumor monitoring mechanisms. Investigation of cancer surveillance innate cells may be critical to understand the mechanisms contributing in either disease progression or relapse, and to promote displacement of leukemic hematopoiesis by the normal counterpart. We report here that NK cell production is less and low hematopoietic progenitor numbers contribute to this defect. By investigating the expression of the activation molecule class I restricted T-cell associated molecule (CRTAM) along the hematopoietic lineage differentiation pathway, we have identified lymphoid precursor populations coexpressing CD34, CD56/CD3/CD19, and CRTAM as the earliest developmental stage where activation may take place in specialized niches that display the ligand nectin-like-2. Of note, bone marrow (BM) from patients with ALL revealed high contents of preactivated CD56(high) NK cells expressing CRTAM and endowed with an exhaustion-like phenotype and the functional capability of producing IL-10 and TGF-beta in vitro. Our findings suggest, for the first time, that the tumor microenvironment in ALL directly contribute to exhaustion of NK cell functions by the CRTAM/Necl-2 interaction, and that the potential regulatory role of exhausted-like NK cells may favor malignant progression at the expense of anti-tumor responses. Phenotypic and functional identity of this unique suppressor-like NK cell population within the leukemic BM would be of special interest for the pathobiology of ALL and development of targeting strategies.",['(c)2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.'],"['Ramirez-Ramirez, Dalia', 'Padilla-Castaneda, Sandra', 'Galan-Enriquez, Carlos Samuel', 'Vadillo, Eduardo', 'Prieto-Chavez, Jessica Lakshmi', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Vilchis-Ordonez, Armando', 'Sandoval, Antonio', 'Balandran, Juan Carlos', 'Perez-Tapia, Sonia Mayra', 'Ortiz-Navarrete, Vianney', 'Pelayo, Rosana']","['Ramirez-Ramirez D', 'Padilla-Castaneda S', 'Galan-Enriquez CS', 'Vadillo E', 'Prieto-Chavez JL', 'Jimenez-Hernandez E', 'Vilchis-Ordonez A', 'Sandoval A', 'Balandran JC', 'Perez-Tapia SM', 'Ortiz-Navarrete V', 'Pelayo R']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Enfermedades Oncologicas, UMAE Hospital Oncologia, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente, Delegacion Puebla, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Puebla, Mexico.', 'National School of Biological Sciences ENCB, Instituto Politecnico Nacional (IPN), Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Enfermedades Oncologicas, UMAE Hospital Oncologia, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica de Oriente, Delegacion Puebla, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, Puebla, Mexico.', 'Departament of Molecular Biomedicine, CINVESTAV, IPN.

The degree of HLA compatibility between donor and recipient in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is critical. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: In this report, we describe an acute myeloid leukemia case with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) encompassing the entire HLA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HLA molecular typing was performed on peripheral blood (PB) and buccal swabs (BS). Chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA) was performed using a whole genome platform. RESULTS: Typing results on PB sample collected during blast crisis demonstrated homozygosity at the -A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ loci. A BS sample demonstrated heterozygosity at all loci. A subsequent PB sample drawn after count recovery confirmed heterozygosity. The CMA performed on PB samples collected during and after blast crisis revealed a large terminal region of copy-neutral LOH involving chromosome region 6p25.3p21.31, spanning approximately 35.9Mb. The results of the CMA assay on sample collected after count recovery did not demonstrate LOH. CONCLUSIONS: LOH at the HLA gene locus may significantly influence the donor search resulting in mistakenly choosing homozygous donors.

Self-renewal is a specialized cell division that generates daughter cells with the same features as the parental stem cell. Although many factors are involved in the regulation of self-renewal, perhaps the most well-known factors are members of the Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family, especially KLF4, because of the landmark discovery that this protein is required to reprogram somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells. Because KLF4 regulates gene expression through transcriptional activation or repression via either DNA binding or protein-to-protein interactions, the outcome of KLF4-mediated regulation largely depends on the cellular context, cell cycle regulation, chromatin structure, and the presence of oncogenic drivers. This study first summarizes the current understanding of the regulation of self-renewal by KLF proteins in embryonic stem cells through a KLF circuitry and then delves into the potential function of KLF4 in normal hematopoietic stem cells and its emerging role in leukemia-initiating cells from pediatric patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia via repression of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 pathway.

Near-haploidy (24-30 chromosomes), a subgroup of hypodiploidy (<46 chromosomes), and BCR/ABL1 gene fusions are both recurrent genetic abnormalities in B-ALL and are considered adverse prognostic findings, although outcomes in BCR/ABL1-positive patients have improved with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. While near-haploid clones are primarily observed in children and rarely harbor structural abnormalities, BCR/ABL1-positive B-ALL is primarily observed in adults. Importantly, recurrent genetic abnormalities are considered mutually exclusive and rarely exist within the same neoplastic clone. We report only the second case to our knowledge of a near-haploid clone that harbors a BCR/ABL1 fusion in an adult with newly diagnosed B-ALL. Conventional chromosome studies revealed a near-haploid clone (27 chromosomes) along with a der(22)t(9;22)(q34.1;q11.2) in 17 of 20 metaphases analyzed. Our B-ALL fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) panel confirmed the BCR/ABL1 fusion and monosomies consistent with chromosome studies in approximately 95% of interphase nuclei. Moreover, no evidence of a ""doubled"" near-haploid clone was observed by chromosome or FISH studies. This highly unusual case illustrates that while rare, recurrent genetic abnormalities in B-ALL can exist within the same neoplastic clone.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Peterson, Jess F', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Huang, Li', 'Finn, Laura E', 'Shi, Min', 'Hoppman, Nicole L', 'Greipp, Patricia T', 'Baughn, Linda B']","['Peterson JF', 'Ketterling RP', 'Huang L', 'Finn LE', 'Shi M', 'Hoppman NL', 'Greipp PT', 'Baughn LB']","['Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Pathology and Laboratory Medicine William G.

Most of such histological transformations are from RS to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL-RS, 90%) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL-RS, 10%). Histopathological examination is a prerequisite for diagnosis. It is crucial to assess the relationship between the RS clone and the underlying CLL/SLL because clonally related DLBCL-RS has a poor outcome, while clonally unrelated cases have a prognosis similar to de novo DLBCL. An anti-CD20 antibody-based immunochemotherapy is hitherto the frontline treatment of choice for DLBCL-RS; nonetheless, the results are unsatisfactory.

L-asparaginase is an important enzyme with known antineoplastic effect against acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: Novel L-asparaginase genes were identified from a locally isolated halo-thermotolerant Bacillus strain and the recombinant enzymes were overexpressed in modified E. coli strains, Origami(TM) B and BL21. In addition, the biochemical properties of the purified enzymes were characterized, and the enzyme activity was evaluated at different temperatures, pH, and substrate concentrations. Results: The concentration of pure soluble enzyme obtained from Origami strain was ~30 mg/L of bacterial culture, which indicates the significant improvement compared to L-asparaginase produced by E. coli BL21 strain. The catalytic activity assay on the identified L-asparaginases (ansA1 and ansA3 genes) from Bacillus sp. SL-1 demonstrated that only ansA1 gene codes an active and stable homologue (ASPase A1) with high substrate affinity toward L-asparagine. The Kcat and Km values for the purified ASPase A1 enzyme were 23.96(s-1) and 10.66 microM, respectively. In addition, the recombinant ASPase A1 enzyme from Bacillus sp. SL-1 possessed higher specificity to L-asparagine than L-glutamine. The ASPase A1 enzyme was highly thermostable and resistant to the wide range of pH 4.5-10. Conclusion: The biochemical properties of the novel ASPase A1 derived from Bacillus sp.

It is an important partner in chromosomal rearrangement that usually occurs in hematological malignancies such as leukemia. Besides these malignancies, its role in solid tumors has been reported. In the present study, we aimed to quantify of MOZ messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues from a northwest population of Iran and consequently to assess the effect of MOZ in CRC. Methods: Tumorous and adjacent non-tumorous tissues recruited from 26 patients with CRC. mRNA extraction and complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis were performed from these tissues, at the next step quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was carried out. Finally, expression levels were statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics 24.0 software and independent t-test. Statistical significance was considered as P</=0.05. Results: The results showed significantly higher expression of MOZ in the majority of CRC tissues compared to normal colorectal tissues (P=0.048). There were no significant correlations between expression levels of MOZ and clinical parameters of patients (P>0.05). Conclusions: Our data showed that dysregulation of MOZ is potentially involved in the pathogenesis of CRC and we could suggest that there is a straight relationship between tumor formation and MOZ expression.

The mTOR signaling pathway has been designated an attractive anti-tumor target in multiple myeloma. NVP-BEZ235, a novel, dual class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, is an imidazoquinoline derivative. NVP-BEZ235 binds to the ATP-binding clefts of PI3K and mTOR kinase, thereby inhibiting their activities. Increasing evidence shows that NVP-BEZ235 is able to effectively and specifically reverse the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, resulting not only in potent antiproliferative and antitumor activities in a broad range of cancer cell lines and experimental tumors but also in autophagy. METHOD: The antitumor, apoptosis, and autophagy effects of NVP-BEZ235 were measured in three MM cell lines, two leukemia cell lines, and primary CD138+ myeloma cells from MM patients and nude mouse MM models. In addition, the relationships between autophagy, cell death and apoptosis induced by NVP-BEZ235 were analyzed in MM cells. Furthermore, we explored the mechanism of autophagy induced by NVP-BEZ235 in MM cells. RESULTS: NVP-BEZ235 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis and autophagy in MM cells and in primary MM cells from patients and nude mouse MM models. Autophagy played an important role in the cell death and apoptosis of MM cell lines induced by NVP-BEZ235, and the mechanism involved the mTOR2-Akt-FOXO3a-BNIP3 pathway. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, NVP-BEZ235 showed the strongest antitumor and autophagy induction activity. Moreover, the mechanism involved the mTOR2-Akt-FOXO3a-BNIP3 pathway.

Diapedesis of neoplastic cells across endothelium and perivascular cells is facilitated by adhesion molecules and chemokines, which act in concert to tightly regulate directional motility. Intravital microscopy provides spatio-temporal views of neoplastic cell trafficking, and is crucial for testing and developing therapies against hematologic cancers. Multiple myeloma (MM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are hematologic malignancies characterized by continuous neoplastic cell trafficking during disease progression. A common feature of these neoplasias is the homing and infiltration of blood cancer cells into the bone marrow (BM), which favors growth and survival of the malignant cells. MM cells traffic between different BM niches and egress from BM at late disease stages. Besides the BM, CLL cells commonly home to lymph nodes (LNs) and spleen. Likewise, ALL cells also infiltrate extramedullary organs, such as the central nervous system, spleen, liver, and testicles. The alpha4beta1 integrin and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 are key molecules for MM, ALL, and CLL cell trafficking into and out of the BM. In addition, the chemokine receptor CCR7 controls CLL cell homing to LNs, and CXCR4, CCR7, and CXCR3 contribute to ALL cell migration across endothelia and the blood brain barrier. Some of these receptors are used as diagnostic markers for relapse and survival in ALL patients, and their level of expression allows clinicians to choose the appropriate treatments. In CLL, elevated alpha4beta1 expression is an established adverse prognostic marker, reinforcing its role in the disease expansion. Combining current chemotherapies with inhibitors of malignant cell trafficking could represent a useful therapy against these neoplasias. Moreover, immunotherapy using humanized antibodies, CAR-T cells, or immune check-point inhibitors together with agents targeting the migration of tumor cells could also restrict their survival.

A. baumannii infections are difficult to treat due to the intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance of strains of this bacterium, which frequently limits therapeutic options. In this study, five A. baumannii strains (810CP, 433H, 434H, 483H, and A-2), all of which were isolated from a child with leukemia M2, were characterized through antibiotic susceptibility profiling, the detection of genes encoding carbapenem hydrolyzing oxacillinases, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), adherence and invasion assays toward the A549 cell line, and the whole-genome sequence (WGS). The five strains showed Multidrug resistant (MDR) profiles and amplification of the bla OXA-23 gene, belonging to ST758 and grouped into two PFGE clusters. WGS of 810CP revealed the presence of a circular chromosome and two small plasmids, pAba810CPa and pAba810CPb. Both plasmids carried genes encoding the Sp1TA system, although resistance genes were not identified. A gene-by-gene comparison analysis was performed among the A. baumannii strains isolated in this study and others A. baumannii ST758 strains (HIMFG and INCan), showing that 86% of genes were present in all analyzed strains. Interestingly, the 433H, 434H, and 483H strains varied by 8-10 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), while the A2 and 810CP strains varied by 46 SNVs. Subsequently, an analysis using BacWGSTdb showed that all of our strains had the same resistance genes and were ST758. However, some variations were observed in relation to virulence genes, mainly in the 810CP strain. The genes involved in the synthesis of hepta-acylated lipooligosaccharides, the pgaABCD locus encoding poly-beta-1-6-N-acetylglucosamine, the ompA gene, Csu pili, bap, the two-component system bfms/bfmR, a member of the phospholipase D family, and two iron-uptake systems were identified in our A. baumannii strains genome. The five A. baumannii strains isolated from the child were genetically different and showed important characteristics that promote survival in a hospital environment. The elucidation of their genomic sequences provides important information for understanding their epidemiology, antibiotic resistance, and putative virulence factors.",,"['Mancilla-Rojano, Jetsi', 'Castro-Jaimes, Semiramis', 'Ochoa, Sara A', 'Bobadilla Del Valle, Miriam', 'Luna-Pineda, Victor M', 'Bustos, Patricia', 'Laris-Gonzalez, Almudena', 'Arellano-Galindo, Jose', 'Parra-Ortega, Israel', 'Hernandez-Castro, Rigoberto', 'Cevallos, Miguel A', 'Xicohtencatl-Cortes, Juan', 'Cruz-Cordova, Ariadnna']","['Mancilla-Rojano J', 'Castro-Jaimes S', 'Ochoa SA', 'Bobadilla Del Valle M', 'Luna-Pineda VM', 'Bustos P', 'Laris-Gonzalez A', 'Arellano-Galindo J', 'Parra-Ortega I', 'Hernandez-Castro R', 'Cevallos MA', 'Xicohtencatl-Cortes J', 'Cruz-Cordova A']","['Laboratorio de Investigacion en Bacteriologia Intestinal, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Ciencias Genomicas, Programa de Genomica Evolutiva, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion en Bacteriologia Intestinal, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Enfermedades Infecciosas Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y de Nutricion ""Salvador Zubiran"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion en Bacteriologia Intestinal, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Ciencias Genomicas, Programa de Genomica Evolutiva, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Epidemiologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Infectologia, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio Central, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Ecologia de Agentes Patogenos Hospital General ""Dr. Manuel Gea Gonzalez"", Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Centro de Ciencias Genomicas, Programa de Genomica Evolutiva, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Cuernavaca, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion en Bacteriologia Intestinal, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.', 'Laboratorio de Investigacion en Bacteriologia Intestinal, Hospital Infantil de Mexico Federico Gomez, Mexico City, Mexico.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190206,Switzerland,Front Microbiol,Frontiers in microbiology,101548977,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Acinetobacter baumannii', 'adherence', 'invasion', 'molecular typing', 'resistance', 'virulence factors', 'whole-genome sequence analysis']",2019/02/23 06:00,2019/02/23 06:01,['2019/02/22 06:00'],"['2018/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fmicb.2019.00132 [doi]'],epublish,Front Microbiol. 2019 Feb 6;10:132. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2019.00132. eCollection 2019.,PMC6372515,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Collectively, 34/44 patients were considered evaluable for response, with an overall response rate of 76.25% (26/34 cases): 17 patients showed a durable response, 9 patients early lost response and 8 patients never responded.

Moreover, Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that this mutated cluster was significantly associated with a shorter OS, LFS, and duration of response.

In all the imatinib-resistant patients BCR-ABL gene was PCR amplified and sequenced. The sequence analysis showed four novel missense mutations p.(Leu301Ile), p.(Tyr320His), p.(Glu373Asp), p.(Asp381Asn) and six already reported mutations p.(Val256Gly), p.(Thr315Ile), p.(Gly250Glu), p.(Tyr253His), p.(Phe317Leu), p.(Met351Thr) which contributed in the formation of inactive enzyme and also two novel frameshift mutations p.(Glu281*) and p.(Tyr393*), which resulted in truncated protein formation. Further, the structural analysis revealed all these mutations affected P-loop, gatekeeper, catalytic and activation loop domain regions of the enzyme causing poor imatinib binding in the ATP region. The primary intention of the study was to find out the mutations in the BCR-ABL gene causing imatinib resistance.

However, their generation mechanisms are not entirely understood. Histone H1, a positively charged nuclear protein located in the linker region of chromatin, is involved in higher-order chromatin structures and tight chromatin packing. On the basis of the physical and biochemical characteristics of histone H1, we hypothesized that histone H1 plays a role in determining the efficiencies of apoptotic DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. Therefore, we examined histone H1 quantity in five human leukemia cell lines and compared the efficiencies. The cell lines were categorized into two groups according to their origins: (i) Ramos and Molt-4 cells of lymphoid origin and (ii) U937, ML-1, and HL60 cells of myeloid origin. Compared to the lymphoid-origin group, the myeloid-origin group had lower levels of histone H1 but more open chromatin. Furthermore, the myeloid-origin group showed marked DNA fragmentation but less chromatin condensation during apoptosis. These results suggested that histone H1 determined chromatin structure and that its quantity affected the efficiencies of DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in apoptosis.",,"['Kijima, Marie', 'Mizuta, Ryushin']","['Kijima M', 'Mizuta R']","['Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science.', 'Research Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Tokyo University of Science.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biomed Res,"Biomedical research (Tokyo, Japan)",8100317,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics/*metabolism', '*DNA Fragmentation/radiation effects', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,,2019/02/23 06:00,2019/06/05 06:00,['2019/02/22 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2220/biomedres.40.51 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res. 2019;40(1):51-56. doi: 10.2220/biomedres.40.51.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this retrospective study, the impact of KIR/HLA inc. on clinical outcomes and NK cell reconstitution was studied in a cohort of 51 consecutive patients receiving a T cell-replete haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after a reduced-intensity conditioning using peripheral blood stem cells as the source of the graft and PTCy as graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. The NK cell repertoire reconstitution was examined by multiparameter flow cytometry in 34 of these 51 patients from day 0 to day 100 posttransplant. Genetic KIR2DL/HLA inc. were found to be significantly associated with more GvHD (81.2 versus 45.7%, p = 0.01) and less relapse (6.2 versus 42.8%, p = 0.008) in this context. GvHD is associated with increased levels of differentiated and activated NK cells. A significant loss of KIR2DL2/3(+) NK cells was observed at day 30 in patients with inhibitory KIR/HLA inc., suggesting that responsive KIR NK cells are particularly targeted by the immunosuppressive PTCy treatment. Further investigations are needed from a larger cohort with an identical clinical approach to consolidate these results and to identify the NK cell subsets that may be beneficial for the graft-versus-leukemia effect observed. Because many haploidentical donors can be identified in a family, the prediction of KIR NK cell alloreactivity could be of crucial importance for donor selection and patient outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Willem, Catherine', 'Makanga, Dhon Romeo', 'Guillaume, Thierry', 'Maniangou, Bercelin', 'Legrand, Nolwenn', 'Gagne, Katia', 'Peterlin, Pierre', 'Garnier, Alice', 'Bene, Marie C', 'Cesbron, Anne', 'Le Bourgeois, Amandine', 'Chevallier, Patrice', 'Retiere, Christelle']","['Willem C', 'Makanga DR', 'Guillaume T', 'Maniangou B', 'Legrand N', 'Gagne K', 'Peterlin P', 'Garnier A', 'Bene MC', 'Cesbron A', 'Le Bourgeois A', 'Chevallier P', 'Retiere C']","['Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Hematology Clinic, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'LabEX Transplantex, Universite de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France; and.', 'Hematology Clinic, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Hematology Clinic, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 44000 Nantes, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Hematology Biology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France.', 'LabEX Transplantex, Universite de Strasbourg, 67000 Strasbourg, France; and.', 'Hematology Clinic, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 44000 Nantes, France.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Hematology Clinic, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, 44000 Nantes, France.', 'Etablissement Francais du Sang, 44011 Nantes Cedex 01, France; christelle.retiere@efs.sante.fr.', ""Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie et Immunologie Nantes-Angers, INSERM, CNRS, Universite d'Angers, Universite de Nantes, 44000 Nantes, France."", 'LabEX IGO, 44000 Nantes, France.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5482-8565', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8081-0462', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6569-7414', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1201-3429', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5943-6990']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190220,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Group Incompatibility/immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Haploidentical/methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,2019/02/23 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/02/22 06:00'],"['2018/11/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1801489 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1801489 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Apr 1;202(7):2141-2152. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1801489.

DESIGN: Systematic review DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Childhood Cancer Group Specialized Register through CENTRAL from inception to August 2018. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Superiority, parallel RCTs of haematological malignancy treatments in paediatric patients that assessed an outcome related to survival, relapse or remission; reported a sample size calculation with a delta value to allow for calculation of the threshold NNT, and that included parameters required to calculate the NNT and associated CI. RESULTS: A total of 43 RCTs were included, representing 45 randomised questions, of which none reported the NNT. Among acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) RCTs, 29.2% (7/24) of randomised questions were found to have a NNT corresponding to benefit, in comparison to acute myeloid leukaemia (ALM) RCTs with 50% (3/6), and none in lymphoma RCTs (0/13). Only 28.6% (2/7) and 33.3% (1/3) had a NNT that was less than the threshold NNT for ALL and AML, respectively. Of these, 100% (2/2 ALL and 1/1 AML) were determined to be possibly clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that decision-makers in paediatric oncology use the NNT and associated confidence limits as a supportive tool to evaluate evidence from RCTs while placing careful attention to the inherent limitations of this measure.","['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

The HTLV-1 viral trans-activator/oncoprotein Tax is a major driver of ATL, yet it induces rapid p21(Cip1/Waf1) (p21)- and p27(Kip1)-mediated cellular senescence through constitutive activation (hyperactivation) of NF-kappaB. Although constitutive NF-kappaB activation is a common feature of T/B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, including ATL, it is not known how ATL cells maintain chronic NF-kappaB activation without undergoing senescence. Here, we demonstrate that, in contrast to HTLV-1(-) T-cell lines, ATL cell lines no longer undergo Tax-induced senescence. Although Tax(+) and Tax(-) ATL cell lines showed signatures of constitutive NF-kappaB activation, their ability to progress through the cell cycle was unaffected. In some cases, ATL cell lines continued to proliferate despite significant upregulation of p21; additionally, many cell lines displayed altered expression of G1 and G1/S cyclins, particularly overexpression of cyclin D2. We propose that, during the course of ATL development, leukemia cells acquire genetic/epigenetic changes that can mitigate the senescence response triggered by NF-kappaB hyperactivation. Restoring the NF-kappaB-induced senescence response would likely help to control the development and progression of ATL and similar lymphoid malignancies.",,"['Shudofsky, Abigail M Druck', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Shudofsky AMD', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD.']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9656-5097'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cellular Senescence', '*Genes, pX', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology']",,,2019/02/23 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,['2019/02/22 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018029322 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029322 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Feb 26;3(4):564-569. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018029322.,PMC6391679,,"['R01 CA140963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA216660/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: The study had a qualitative descriptive longitudinal design and included a total of 35 interviews with 13 children at three different times during their treatment period. Data were analyzed using a matrix-based method inspired by the work of Miles et al. RESULTS: Initially, most children reported a fear of needles, but during the treatment period, fewer children reported this fear. Children's coping strategies also changed over time, as they wanted more involvement and control during needle-related procedures. Other fears were having adhesive tapes removed, having a nasogastric tube, and taking tablets. During the treatment period, existential fears related to the seriousness of ALL and its consequences, such as having impaired physical fitness and being different from before and different from others, became more prominent and caused feelings of loneliness and alienation. CONCLUSIONS: The children described various fears through their treatment period, which they coped with using cognitive, emotional, and functional strategies. Over the 2.5-year period, their strategies changed.

High doses of corticosteroids are used in diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), lymphomas, or connective tissue diseases. Post-steroid hyperglycaemia arises as a result of increased gluconeogenesis and increased glycogen synthesis. Steroid-induced diabetes most often is asymptomatic; therefore it is important to monitor the glycaemic level in patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids. So far, no separate guidelines for steroid-induced diabetes have been developed, so the criteria for diagnosing drug-related diabetes mellitus do not differ from the criteria for diagnosing type 2 diabetes. Hyperglycaemia adversely affects the immune system: it impairs the function of granulocytes, immunoglobulins, and also causes T-lymphocyte apoptosis. A hyperglycaemic environment favours the development of bacterial and fungal infections. Numerous studies confirm that hyperglycaemia increases the risk of infection and severity of infection. There have also been reports of adverse effects of steroid-induced hyperglycaemia in the course of treatment for the underlying disease in the adult population. Reports related to the paediatric population are not as numerous.

It is crucial to assign the genetic variants to their correct genes both to gain insights into perturbed functions and better assess the risk of disease. METHODS: In this study, we generated high-resolution genomic interaction maps ( approximately 750 bases) in aortic endothelial, smooth muscle cells and THP-1 (human leukemia monocytic cell line) macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide using Hi-C coupled with sequence capture targeting 25 429 features, including variants associated with coronary artery disease. We also sequenced their transcriptomes and mapped putative enhancers using chromatin immunoprecipitation with an antibody against H3K27Ac. RESULTS: The regions interacting with promoters showed strong enrichment for enhancer elements and validated several previously known interactions and enhancers. We detected interactions for 727 risk variants obtained by genome-wide association studies and identified novel, as well as established genes and functions associated with cardiovascular diseases. We were able to assign potential target genes for additional 398 genome-wide association studies variants using haplotype information, thereby identifying additional relevant genes and functions. Importantly, we discovered that a subset of risk variants interact with multiple promoters and their expression levels were strongly correlated. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present a catalog of candidate genes regulated by coronary artery disease-related variants and think that it will be an invaluable resource to further the investigation of cardiovascular pathologies and disease.",,"['Akerborg, Orjan', 'Spalinskas, Rapolas', 'Pradhananga, Sailendra', 'Anil, Anandashankar', 'Hojer, Pontus', 'Poujade, Flore-Anne', 'Folkersen, Lasse', 'Eriksson, Professor Per', 'Sahlen, Pelin']","['Akerborg O', 'Spalinskas R', 'Pradhananga S', 'Anil A', 'Hojer P', 'Poujade FA', 'Folkersen L', 'Eriksson PP', 'Sahlen P']","['Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Gene Technology, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden (O.A., R.S., S.P., A.A., P.H., P.S.).', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Gene Technology, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden (O.A., R.S., S.P., A.A., P.H., P.S.).', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Gene Technology, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden (O.A., R.S., S.P., A.A., P.H., P.S.).', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Gene Technology, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden (O.A., R.S., S.P., A.A., P.H., P.S.).', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Gene Technology, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden (O.A., R.S., S.P., A.A., P.H., P.S.).', 'Cardiovascular Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (F.-A.P., P.E.).', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Technical University of Denmark, Copenhagen, Denmark (L.F.).', 'Cardiovascular Medicine Unit, Department of Medicine, Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden (F.-A.P., P.E.).', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Division of Gene Technology, School of Engineering Sciences in Chemistry, Biotechnology and Health, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Solna, Sweden (O.A., R.S., S.P., A.A., P.H., P.S.).']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Circ Genom Precis Med,Circulation.

Umbilical cord blood is one of donor sources for HSCT in JMML patients who do not have an HLA-compatible relative, but engraftment failure remains a major problem. Here, we report two cases of JMML who were successfully rescued by HSCT from an HLA-mismatched parent after development of primary engraftment failure following unrelated CBT. Both patients had severe splenomegaly and underwent unrelated CBT from an HLA-mismatched donor. Immediately after diagnosis of engraftment failure, both patients underwent HSCT from their parent. For the second HSCT, we used RIC regimens consisting of FLU, CY, and a low dose of rabbit ATG with or without TBI and additionally administered ETP considering their persistent severe splenomegaly. Both patients achieved engraftment without severe treatment-related adverse effects. After engraftment of second HSCT, their splenomegaly was rapidly regressed, and both patients showed no sign of relapse for over 4 years. These observations demonstrate that HSCT from an HLA-mismatched parent could be a feasible salvage treatment for primary engraftment failure in JMML patients.","['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Akahane, Koshi', 'Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Furuichi, Yoshiyuki', 'Somazu, Shinpei', 'Oshiro, Hiroko', 'Goi, Kumiko', 'Sakashita, Kazuo', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Hama, Asahito', 'Takahashi, Yoshiyuki', 'Koike, Kenichi', 'Kojima, Seiji', 'Sugita, Kanji', 'Inukai, Takeshi']","['Akahane K', 'Watanabe A', 'Furuichi Y', 'Somazu S', 'Oshiro H', 'Goi K', 'Sakashita K', 'Muramatsu H', 'Hama A', 'Takahashi Y', 'Koike K', 'Kojima S', 'Sugita K', 'Inukai T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagano Children's Hospital, Nagano, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shinonoi General Hospital, Minami Nagano Center, Nagano, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8591-1281', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4181-8111']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],20190220,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Hepatomegaly/surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Recurrence', 'Splenomegaly/surgery', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Treatment Outcome']",['NOTNLM'],"['*CBT', '*GVHD', '*HLA-mismatched parent', '*JMML', '*RIC', '*engraftment failure']",2019/02/21 06:00,2020/03/26 06:00,['2019/02/21 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13378 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 May;23(3):e13378. doi: 10.1111/petr.13378.

Yet, statistical methods proposed to address challenges arising with the high-dimensionality of omics-type data predominately rely on linear models and emphasize associations deriving from prognostic biomarkers. Existing methods are often limited for discovering predictive biomarkers that interact with treatment and fail to elucidate the predictive power of their resultant selection rules. In this article, we present a Bayesian predictive method for personalized treatment selection that is devised to integrate both the treatment predictive and disease prognostic characteristics of a particular patient's disease. The method appropriately characterizes the structural constraints inherent to prognostic and predictive biomarkers, and hence properly utilizes these complementary sources of information for treatment selection. The methodology is illustrated through a case study of lower grade glioma. Theoretical considerations are explored to demonstrate the manner in which treatment selection is impacted by prognostic features. Additionally, simulations based on an actual leukemia study are provided to ascertain the method's performance with respect to selection rules derived from competing methods.","['(c) 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Ibrutinib has an increased risk of atrial fibrillation but the mechanism is unknown, and hypertension may play a role in the pathogenesis of this adverse drug reaction. METHODS: We aimed to review the risk of hypertension and atrial fibrillation as adverse events associated with ibrutinib through a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) retrieved in December 2018 on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL and ClinicalTrials.gov. The data were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses using the risk ratio (RR) with the 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The confidence on the pooled estimates was ascertained through the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: There were 8 eligible RCTs (2580 patients), all reporting safety data of interest.

We applied metagenomic technology to avian virus surveillance to study the main viruses infecting six poultry farms in two provinces in eastern China. Cloacal/throat double swabs were collected from 60 birds at each farm according to a random sampling method. The results showed that the method could simultaneously detect major viruses infecting farms, including avian influenza virus, infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, rotavirus G, duck hepatitis B virus, and avian leukemia virus subgroup J in several farms. The test results were consistent with the results from traditional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription-PCR analyses. Five H9N2 and one H3N8 avian influenza viruses were detected at the farms and were identified as low pathogenic avian influenza viruses according to HA cleavage sites analysis. One detected Newcastle disease virus was classified as Class II genotype I and avirulent type according to F0 cleavage sites analysis. Three avian infectious bronchitis viruses were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I and TC07-2 genotypes by phylogenetic analysis of S1 genes.

This study was aimed to assess anti-leukemia activity and its underlying mechanism in K562 cells. MTT assay results showed that BW18 inhibited cell viability and proliferation of K562 cells. We also found that BW18 could induce S phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that BW18 regulated the expression of apoptosis and cell cycle related proteins. Mechanism investigation revealed that the anti-leukemia activity of BW18 may be mediated through MAPK pathway. These findings indicate that BW18 possesses an excellent anti-leukemia activity via regulating MAPK pathway leading to S phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, which suggested BW18 could be as a potential alternative therapeutic agent for CML patients.","['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

To explore the mechanism of difference in pathogenesis and prognosis in different BCR-ABL subtype-related leukemia, expression profile microarray analysis was conducted between p190 and p210 patients and verified by RT-PCR. The p21-activated kinase (PAK1) gene was chosen and regulation of the PAK1-STAT5 biological axis and its influence on proliferation and apoptosis in leukemia cells were also analyzed. The results showed that PAK1 might be an important molecular mechanism of the pathogenic difference between different BCR-ABL subtypes. In P210 (+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), down-regulated PAK1 gene expressions may lead to the suppression of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis through phosphorylation of STAT5, with a reverse effect in P190 (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL), especially acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Additionally, in P210 (+) CML, down-regulated PAK1 expression may enhance the effect of TKI, whereas the reverse is true in P190 (+) B-ALL, demonstrating that PAK1 might also be an important therapeutic target between different BCR-ABL subtypes.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Detailed insights into LSCs' survival will facilitate the identification of targets for therapeutic approaches. Here, we develop an inhibitor, LYZ-81, which targets ORP4L with high affinity and specificity and selectively eradicates LCSs in vitro and in vivo. ORP4L is expressed in LSCs but not in normal HSCs and is essential for LSC bioenergetics and survival. It extracts PIP2 from the plasma membrane and presents it to PLCbeta3, enabling IP3 generation and subsequent Ca(2+)-dependent bioenergetics. LYZ-81 binds ORP4L competitively with PIP2 and blocks PIP2 hydrolysis, resulting in defective Ca(2+) signaling. The results provide evidence that LSCs can be eradicated through the inhibition of ORP4L by LYZ-81, which may serve as a starting point of drug development for the elimination of LSCs to eventually cure leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Author(s).

To discover potential risk factors resulting from in utero exposures, we are investigating HSA-Cys34 adducts in archived newborn dried blood spots (DBS) that reflect systemic exposures during the last month of gestation. The workflow includes extraction of proteins from DBS, measurement of hemoglobin (Hb) to normalize for blood volume, addition of methanol to enrich HSA by precipitation of Hb and other interfering proteins, digestion with trypsin, and detection of HSA-Cys34 adducts via nanoflow liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. As proof-of-principle, we applied the method to 49 archived DBS collected from newborns whose mothers either actively smoked during pregnancy or were nonsmokers. Twenty-six HSA-Cys34 adducts were detected, including Cys34 oxidation products, mixed disulfides with low molecular weight thiols (e.g., cysteine, homocysteine, glutathione, cysteinylglycine), and other modifications.

We investigated the dynamics of NPM1-mutated-specific T cells on PB and BM samples, collected from 31 adult NPM1-mutated AML patients throughout the disease course, and stimulated with mixtures of 18 short and long peptides (9-18mers), deriving from the complete C-terminal of the NPM1-mutated protein. Two 9-mer peptides, namely LAVEEVSLR and AVEEVSLRK (13.9-14.9), were identified as the most immunogenic epitopes. IFNgamma-producing NPM1-mutated-specific T cells were observed by ELISPOT assay after stimulation with peptides 13.9-14.9 in 43/85 (50.6%) PB and 34/80 (42.5%) BM samples. An inverse correlation between MRD kinetics and anti-leukemic specific T cells was observed. Cytokine Secretion Assays allowed to predominantly and respectively identify Effector Memory and Central Memory T cells among IFNgamma-producing and IL2-producing T cells. Moreover, NPM1-mutated-specific CTLs against primary leukemic blasts or PHA-blasts pulsed with different peptide pools could be expanded ex vivo from NPM1-mutated AML patients or primed in healthy donors.

In this study, we compared the differences of cell proliferation, population, protein expression and chemoresistance profiles between two dimensional (2D) and 3D culture of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) Jurkat cell line. Polycaprolactone (PCL) is used for 3D culture owing to its biochemical properties and compatibility. Culturing of ALL Jurkat cell line in collagen type I coated polycaprolactone scaffold for 168 h increased cell proliferation, attachment, as well as the drug resistance to cytarabine (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (DNR) without changing the original CD2(+)CD3(+)CD4(+dim)CD8(-)CD34(-)CD45(+dim) phenotype, compared to uncoated PCL scaffold and tissue culture plate systems. Molecularly, increased chemoresistance is associated with the upregulation of discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) and transcription factor STAT3. Inhibition of DDR1 activity by DDR1-specific inhibitor DDR-IN-1 accelerated cell death in the presence of Ara-C, DNR or their combination. These results demonstrated that 3D culture enhances chemoresistance of ALL Jurkat cell line by increasing DDR1 expression. Importantly, the cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance induced by DDR1 in the scaffold was similar to the clinical situation, indicating the 3D culture of cancer cells recapitulate the in vivo tumor environment and this platform can be used as a promising pre-clinic drug-screen system.",,"['Guo, Jun', 'Zhao, Chunting', 'Yao, Ruyong', 'Sui, Aihua', 'Sun, Lingjie', 'Liu, Xiaodan', 'Wu, Shaoling', 'Su, Zhan', 'Li, Tianlan', 'Liu, Shanshan', 'Gao, Yan', 'Liu, Jiaxiu', 'Feng, Xianqi', 'Wang, Wei', 'Zhao, Hongguo', 'Cui, Zhongguang', 'Li, Guanglun', 'Meng, Fanjun']","['Guo J', 'Zhao C', 'Yao R', 'Sui A', 'Sun L', 'Liu X', 'Wu S', 'Su Z', 'Li T', 'Liu S', 'Gao Y', 'Liu J', 'Feng X', 'Wang W', 'Zhao H', 'Cui Z', 'Li G', 'Meng F']","['College of Medicine, Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266071, P.R.

GADD34 has opposing effects on different stimuli-induced cell apoptosis events, but the reason for this is unclear. Here, using immunoblotting analyses and various molecular genetic approaches in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells, we demonstrate that GADD34 protects hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells from tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis by stabilizing a BCL-2 family member, myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1). We found that GADD34 knockdown decreased MCL-1 levels and that GADD34 overexpression up-regulated MCL-1 expression in HCC cells. GADD34 did not affect MCL-1 transcription but enhanced MCL-1 protein stability. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 abrogated GADD34 depletion-induced MCL-1 down-regulation, suggesting that GADD34 inhibits the proteasomal degradation of MCL-1. Furthermore, GADD34 overexpression promoted extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation through a signaling axis that consists of the E3 ubiquitin ligase tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and transforming growth factor-beta-activated kinase 1 (MAP3K7)-binding protein 1 (TAB1), which mediated the up-regulation of MCL-1 by GADD34. Of note, TRAIL up-regulated both GADD34 and MCL-1 levels, and knockdown of GADD34 and TRAF6 suppressed the induction of MCL-1 by TRAIL. Correspondingly, GADD34 knockdown potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and MCL-1 overexpression rescued TRAIL-treated and GADD34-depleted HCC cells from cell death.

However, the direct TFCP2L1 target genes are uncharacterized. Here, using gene overexpression, immunoblotting, quantitative real-time PCR, ChIP, and reporter gene assays, we show that TFCP2L1 primarily induces estrogen-related receptor beta (Esrrb) expression that supports mouse ESC identity and also selectively enhances Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) expression and thereby promotes human ESC self-renewal. Specifically, we found that in mouse ESCs, TFCP2L1 binds directly to the Esrrb gene promoter and regulates its transcription. Esrrb knockdown impaired Tfcp2l1's ability to induce interleukin 6 family cytokine (leukemia inhibitory factor)-independent ESC self-renewal and to reprogram epiblast stem cells to naive pluripotency. Conversely, Esrrb overexpression blocked differentiation induced by Tfcp2l1 down-regulation. Moreover, we identified Klf4 as a direct TFCP2L1 target in human ESCs, bypassing the requirement for activin A and basic fibroblast growth factor in short-term human ESC self-renewal. Enforced Klf4 expression recapitulated the self-renewal-promoting effect of Tfcp2l1, whereas Klf4 knockdown eliminated these effects and caused loss of colony-forming capability. These findings indicate that TFCP2L1 functions differently in naive and primed pluripotency, insights that may help elucidate the different states of pluripotency.",['(c) 2019 Wang et al.'],"['Wang, Xiaohu', 'Wang, Xiaoxiao', 'Zhang, Shuyuan', 'Sun, Hongwei', 'Li, Sijia', 'Ding, Huiwen', 'You, Yu', 'Zhang, Xuewu', 'Ye, Shou-Dong']","['Wang X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang S', 'Sun H', 'Li S', 'Ding H', 'You Y', 'Zhang X', 'Ye SD']","['From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601.', 'the Department of Anesthesiology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230001, China.', 'From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601.', 'From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601.', 'From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601.', 'From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601.', 'From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601; the Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, China.', 'the Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'From the Center for Stem Cell and Translational Medicine, School of Life Sciences, Anhui University, Hefei 230601; the Institute of Physical Science and Information Technology, Anhui University, Hefei 230601, China.

We designed a T cell stimulated to kill AML cells based on recognition of the AML-associated surface marker CLEC12A, via secretion of a CLEC12AxCD3 bispecific ""engager"" molecule (CLEC12A-ENG). CLEC12A-ENG T cells are specifically activated by CLEC12A, are not toxic to hematopoietic progenitor cells, and exhibit antigen-dependent AML killing. Next, we coupled stimulation of T-cell survival to triggering of a chimeric IL7 receptor with an ectodomain that binds a second AML-associated surface antigen, CD123. The resulting T cells, identified as CLEC12A-ENG.CD123IL7Ralpha T cells, demonstrate improved activation upon dual target recognition, kill AML, and exhibit antitumor activity in xenograft models. Enhanced T-cell activation conferred by CD123.IL7Ralpha was dependent both on recognition of the CD123 target and on IL7Ralpha-mediated downstream signaling.

It is assumed that CD8(+) T cell responses promote the establishment of the reservoir, as B cell follicles do not permit CD8(+) T cell entry. Here we analyzed the infected cell population in the Friend retrovirus (FV) infection and investigated whether FV can similarly infect follicular cells. For analysis of FV-infected cells, we constructed a recombinant FV encoding the bright fluorescent protein mWasabi and performed flow cytometry with cells isolated from spleens, lymph nodes and bone marrow of FV-mWasabi-infected mice. Using t-stochastic neighbor embedding for data exploration, we demonstrate how the target cell population changes during the course of infection. While FV was widely distributed in erythrocytes, myeloid cells, B cells, and CD4(+) T cells in the acute phase of infection, the bulk viral load in the late phase was carried by macrophages and follicular B and CD4(+) T cells, suggesting that FV persists in cells that are protected from CD8(+) T cell killing. Importantly, seeding into follicular cells was equally observed in CD8(+) T cell-depleted mice and in highly FV-susceptible mice that mount a very weak immune response, demonstrating that infection of follicular cells is not driven by immune pressure. Our data demonstrate that infection of cells in the B cell follicle is a characteristic of the FV infection, making this murine retrovirus an even more valuable model for development of retrovirus immunotherapy approaches.IMPORTANCE Human immunodeficiency virus is notorious for its ability to avoid clearance by therapeutic interventions, which is partly attributed to the establishment of reservoirs in latently infected cells and cells that reside in immunologically privileged B cell follicles. In the work presented here, we show that cells of the B cell follicle are equally infected by a simple mouse gammaretrovirus. Using fluorescently labeled Friend retrovirus, we found that B cells and T cells in the B cell follicle, while not carrying the bulk of the virus load, were indeed infected by Friend virus in the early acute phase of the infection and persisted in the chronic infection. Our results suggest that infection of follicular cells may be a shared property of lymphotropic viruses and propose the FV infection of mice as a useful model to study strategies for follicular reservoir elimination.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Windmann et al.'],"['Windmann, Sonja', 'Otto, Lucas', 'Hrycak, Camilla Patrizia', 'Malyshkina, Anna', 'Bongard, Nadine', 'David, Paul', 'Gunzer, Matthias', 'Dittmer, Ulf', 'Bayer, Wibke']","['Windmann S', 'Otto L', 'Hrycak CP', 'Malyshkina A', 'Bongard N', 'David P', 'Gunzer M', 'Dittmer U', 'Bayer W']","['Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Immunology and Imaging, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Institute for Virology, University Hospital Essen, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen, Germany wibke.bayer@uni-due.de.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5885-5592'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190219,United States,mBio,mBio,101519231,['0 (Luminescent Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/virology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Spleen/virology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",['NOTNLM'],"['*follicular B cells', '*murine leukemia virus', '*persistence', '*retroviruses', '*viral immunity', '*viral pathogenesis']",2019/02/21 06:00,2019/03/26 06:00,['2019/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['mBio.00004-19 [pii]', '10.1128/mBio.00004-19 [doi]']",epublish,mBio. 2019 Feb 19;10(1). pii: mBio.00004-19. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00004-19.,PMC6381274,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We confirm the frequent occurrence of TP53 alterations in this subgroup and further characterize the allele expression profile and transcript alterations of this gene. We also document that the RAS pathway (N/KRAS, NF1, PTPN11, BRAF) is frequently altered in this disease. Targeted chemical interrogation of genetically characterized primary CK AML samples identifies polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) inhibitors as the most selective agents for this disease subgroup.

ATL carries a poor prognosis due to chemotherapy resistance. Thus, it is urgent to develop new treatment strategies. Hypericin (HY) is a new-type of photosensitizer in the context of photodynamic therapy (PDT) due to its excellent photosensitizing properties and anti-tumor activities. RESULTS: In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of hypericin in ATL cells. Clinically achievable concentrations of hypericin in association with PDT induced the inhibition of cell proliferation in ATL cell lines with minimal effect on peripheral blood CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Moreover, hypericin-PDT treatment caused apoptosis and G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in leukemic cells. Western blot analyses revealed that hypericin-PDT treatment resulted in downregulation of Bcl-2 and enhanced the expression of Bad, cytochrome C, and AIF. Cleavage of caspases-3/-7/-9/-8, Bid, and PARP was increased in hypericin-PDT-treated ATL cells. In a luciferase assay, hypericin-PDT treatment was able to activate the promoter activity of Bax and p53, resulting in enhanced expression of Bax and p53 proteins. Finally, hypericin-PDT treatment suppressed the expression of viral protein HBZ and Tax by blocking the promoter activity via HTLV-1 5'LTR and 3'LTR. CONCLUSIONS: Our results revealed that hypericin-PDT is highly effective against ATL cells by induction of apoptosis and suppression of viral transcription. These studies highlight the promising use of hypericin-PDT as a targeted therapy for ATL.",,"['Xu, Lingling', 'Zhang, Xueqing', 'Cheng, Wenzhao', 'Wang, Yong', 'Yi, Kaining', 'Wang, Zhilong', 'Zhang, Yiling', 'Shao, Linxiang', 'Zhao, Tiejun']","['Xu L', 'Zhang X', 'Cheng W', 'Wang Y', 'Yi K', 'Wang Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Shao L', 'Zhao T']","['College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'Biomedical Department, Huaqiao University, Quanzhou, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China.', 'College of Chemistry and Life Sciences, Zhejiang Normal University, 688 Yingbin Road, Jinhua, 321004, Zhejiang, China. tjzhao@zjnu.cn.']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8266-8076'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190219,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '5QD5427UN7 (Perylene)', '7V2F1075HD (hypericin)']",IM,"['Anthracenes', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', '*Light', 'Models, Biological', 'Perylene/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",['NOTNLM'],"['*ATL', '*Apoptosis', '*HTLV-1', '*Hypericin', '*Photodynamic therapy']",2019/02/21 06:00,2019/03/28 06:00,['2019/02/21 06:00'],"['2018/09/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12977-019-0467-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12977-019-0467-0 [pii]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2019 Feb 19;16(1):5. doi: 10.1186/s12977-019-0467-0.,PMC6381730,,"['31470262/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '31200128/National Natural Science Foundation of China/International', '2015C33149/Zhejiang Province Public Welfare Technology Application Research', 'Project/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the extent of trophoblast proliferation and apoptosis have not been found to differ from those of normal placentation. MicroRNA-125a (miR-125a) induces apoptosis in colon cancer cell by targeting myeloid cell leukemia-1 gene (MCL1). We aimed to investigate the influence of miR-125a on ISIT cells in PAS disorders in 15 patients (self-paired trials) with placenta previa and PAS disorders. Expression of miR-125a and MCL1 were measured in villous trophoblasts and basal plate myometrial fibers from creta site and adjacent noncreta tissues by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and expression of the MCL1 protein was assayed by Western blotting. Flow-cytometry was used to examine the effect of miR-125a overexpression on apoptosis in vitro in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and luciferase activity assays was used to confirm miR-125a targeting of MCL1. In vivo, the expression levels of miR-125a was significantly lower in creta versus noncreta tissues, and the expression of MCL1 was upregulated; moreover, immunohistochemistry showed that the increased ISIT cells in the creta were positive for MCL1 protein. MCL1 was downregulated in the miR-125a-overexpressing HTR-8/SVneo cells in vitro, and overexpression of miR-125a-induced apoptosis in the HTR-8/SVneo trophoblast line. Finally, luciferase activity assays confirmed that miR-125a directly target the 3' untranslated region of MCL1 in the 293T cell line. In conclusion, downregulation of MCL1-targeting miR-125a exerts an antiapoptotic effect on ISIT cells in PAS disorders.",,"['Gu, Yongzhong', 'Meng, Jinlai', 'Zuo, Changting', 'Wang, Shan', 'Li, Hongyan', 'Zhao, Shigang', 'Huang, Tao', 'Wang, Xietong', 'Yan, Junhao']","['Gu Y', 'Meng J', 'Zuo C', 'Wang S', 'Li H', 'Zhao S', 'Huang T', 'Wang X', 'Yan J']","[""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""National Research Center for Assisted Reproductive Technology and Reproductive Genetics, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key laboratory for Reproductive Endocrinology of Ministry of Education, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""National Research Center for Assisted Reproductive Technology and Reproductive Genetics, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key laboratory for Reproductive Endocrinology of Ministry of Education, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Birth Regulation and Control Technology of National Health and Family Planning Commission of China, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Maternal and Child Health Care of Shandong Province, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, People's Republic of China."", ""Center for Reproductive Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""National Research Center for Assisted Reproductive Technology and Reproductive Genetics, Jinan, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key laboratory for Reproductive Endocrinology of Ministry of Education, Jinan, People's Republic of China.""]",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0969-1026'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190219,United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epithelial Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myometrium/metabolism', 'Placenta Accreta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Trophoblasts/*metabolism']",['NOTNLM'],"['*MCL1', '*antiapoptosis', '*intermediate trophoblast', '*microRNA-125a', '*placenta accreta spectrum']",2019/02/21 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2019/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1933719119828040 [doi]'],ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2019 Dec;26(12):1582-1589. doi: 10.1177/1933719119828040.

However, Malat1 knockout mice develop and grow normally, and do not show alterations in alternative splicing. While MALAT1 was originally described as a prognostic marker of lung cancer metastasis, emerging evidence has linked this lncRNA to other cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma, and leukemia. The role described for MALAT1 is dependent on the cancer types and the experimental model systems. Notably, different or opposite phenotypes resulting from different strategies for inactivating MALAT1 have been observed, which led to distinct models for MALAT1's functions and mechanisms of action in cancer and metastasis.

In these earlier studies, we reasoned that diminished ADCC due to the functional deficit in natural killer (NK) cell activity in NOD/SCID mice resulted in a failure of effective perforin/granzyme-mediated cytotoxicity necessary for the delivery of the augmentative effect. Poly-inosinic-cytidylic acid [poly (I:C)] is a synthetic dsRNA toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist that possesses a number of biological properties that includes the in vivo activation of NK cells. We show here that intravenous (i.v.) injection of SCID mice with [poly (I:C)] results in characteristic time-related changes in serum interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-12, and interferon gamma (INFgamma) cytokine levels that are consistent with TLR3 driven activation of SCID mouse NK cells. Concomitantly, there are changes in the expression levels of CD2, CD16/32 (FcgammaRII/RIII), CD161 (NK1.1), and F4/80 in the bulk splenocyte population. These observed changes correlate with an increase in the in vitro lytic capabilities of putative NK cells from within the splenocyte population of [poly (I:C)] treated SCID mice. We demonstrate that the in vivo activation of NK cells with [poly (I:C)] in SCID mice bearing disseminated human T-cell leukaemia xenografts resulted in a significant improvement in the therapeutic activity exerted by an intact murine monoclonal antibody against human CD7. This was also seen for a saporin-based immunotoxin constructed with the same intact antibody (HB2-SAPORIN), but not with an F(ab')(2) derivative of the same antibody or of an IT constructed with the same F(ab')(2) HB2 antibody derivative. This study further demonstrates the previously reported reinforcing role of ADCC for the therapeutic activity of IT in an SCID mouse model of human T-ALL and the potential to significantly boost this further with [poly (I:C)]. Our study provides the rationale to justify the exploration of the clinical utility of IT based therapeutics in combination with TLR3 agonists, such as [poly (I:C)], for the treatment of haematological, and possibly other, malignancies.",,"['Flavell, David J', 'Holmes, Suzanne E', 'Warnes, Sarah L', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U']","['Flavell DJ', 'Holmes SE', 'Warnes SL', 'Flavell SU']","['The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK. davidf@leukaemiabusters.org.uk.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK. suzanneh@leukaemiabusters.org.uk.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK. beef@leukaemiabusters.org.uk.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190216,Switzerland,Biomedicines,Biomedicines,101691304,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CD7', 'SCID mouse', 'T-ALL', 'TLR3 agonist', 'augmentation', 'immunotoxin', 'therapy']",2019/02/20 06:00,2019/02/20 06:01,['2019/02/21 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/20 06:01 [medline]']","['biomedicines7010013 [pii]', '10.3390/biomedicines7010013 [doi]']",epublish,Biomedicines. 2019 Feb 16;7(1). pii: biomedicines7010013. doi: 10.3390/biomedicines7010013.,PMC6466153,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],['1157147/Leukaemia Busters'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preceding the development of T2DM is insulin resistance (IR), a disorder associated with suppressed or delayed responses to insulin. The effects of this response are predominately mediated through aberrant cell signalling processes and compromised glucose uptake into peripheral tissue including adipose, liver and skeletal muscle. Moreover, a major factor considered to be the cause of IR is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This subcellular organelle plays a pivotal role in protein folding and processes that increase ER stress, leads to maladaptive responses that result in cell death. Recently, zinc and the proteins that transport this metal ion have been implicated in the ER stress response. Specifically, the ER-specific zinc transporter ZIP7, coined the ""gate-keeper"" of zinc release from the ER into the cytosol, was shown to be essential for maintaining ER homeostasis in intestinal epithelium and myeloid leukaemia cells. Moreover, ZIP7 controls essential cell signalling pathways similar to insulin and activates glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Accordingly, ZIP7 may be essential for the control of ER localized zinc and mechanisms that disrupt this process may lead to ER-stress and contribute to IR. Accordingly, understanding the mechanisms of ZIP7 action in the context of IR may provide opportunities to develop novel therapeutic options to target this transporter in the treatment of IR and subsequent T2DM.",,"['Adulcikas, John', 'Sonda, Sabrina', 'Norouzi, Shaghayegh', 'Sohal, Sukhwinder Singh', 'Myers, Stephen']","['Adulcikas J', 'Sonda S', 'Norouzi S', 'Sohal SS', 'Myers S']","['College of Health and Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, TAS 7005, Australia. johna6@utas.edu.au.', 'College of Health and Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, TAS 7005, Australia. sabrina.sonda@utas.edu.au.', 'College of Health and Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, TAS 7005, Australia. shaghayeg.norouzi@utas.edu.au.', 'College of Health and Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, TAS 7005, Australia. sukhwinder.sohal@utas.edu.au.', 'College of Health and Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Tasmania, TAS 7005, Australia.

Traditional chemotherapeutic agents are relatively ineffective and are associated with significant toxicities. Molecular studies have demonstrated that the development and progression of DTC are associated with a series of consistent abnormalities in pathways such as MAPK/ERK and PI3/Akt, which govern cellular growth, proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Small molecular inhibitors that target these pathogenic pathways, without many of the impairments associated with cytotoxic chemotherapy, have demonstrated efficacy in a variety of malignancies, including renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small-cell lung cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia.

Our present study aimed to detect the expression of miR-504-3p and its biological effect in AML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to evaluate the expression level of miR-504-3p in AML cell lines and the serum from AML cases. The correlations between miR-504-3p and AML patients' clinicopathological characteristics, as well as AML patients' overall survival, were statistically assessed. Moreover, we investigated the effect of miR-504-3p knockdown on AML cells by CCK-8, Transwell assays and flow cytometry, in vitro. The Western blot, RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay were performed to evaluate the relationship between miR-504-3p and its downstream target genes. Finally, the biological function of MTHFD2 was also analyzed. RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-504-3p were significantly down-regulated in the serum of AML patients and cell lines, and its low expression was positively associated with advanced clinical stages and poor prognosis of AML patients. Functional assays indicated that overexpression of miR-504-3p leads to AML cell growth arrest, invasion and migration inhibition, and elevated rates of apoptosis. We also found that miR-504-3p regulated the expression of MTHFD2 by binding to its 3'-UTR, and knockdown of MTHFD2 significantly suppressed AML cells proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened from GSE67684 (treatment), GSE28460 (relapse), and GSE60926 (relapse). The expression of AEBP1 at different stages of cALL was analyzed followed by functional enrichment analysis of its co-expressed genes. Expression of AEBP1 was determined in different leukemia cell lines and knocked down in Jurkat cells. Cell behaviors as well as the expression of p53, Bax, and Bcl-2 were also evaluated after silencing AEBP1 in Jurkat cells. RESULTS: Two clusters: Profile 1 (downward) and Profile 26 (upward) were identified in GSE67684, and 53 Profile 1-specific DEGs were identified compared with DEGs in GSE28460 and GSE60926. AEBP1 was one of these genes and was significantly downregulated after treatment but upregulated in relapse samples. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that AEBP1 co-expressed genes were significantly enriched in GO terms including immune response, blood coagulation etc. and in the hematopoietic cell lineage and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. AEBP1 was significantly increased in leukemia cell lines, especially in Jurkat cells, compared with the Pbmc cells. Silencing AEBP1 markedly reduced proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in Jurkat cells, but also promoted apoptosis of Jurkat cells. Silencing AEBP1 also inhibited the expression of p53 and Bcl-2 but promoted Bax in Jurkat cells. CONCLUSIONS: AEBP1 was highly-expressed in the diagnosis and relapse cALL, and silencing AEBP1 significantly reduced proliferation but promoted apoptosis in Jurkat cells via a p53-dependent pathway.",,"['Li, S', 'Juan, C-X', 'Feng, A-M', 'Bian, H-L', 'Liu, W-D', 'Zhang, G-Q', 'Wang, C-Z', 'Cao, Q', 'Zhou, G-P']","['Li S', 'Juan CX', 'Feng AM', 'Bian HL', 'Liu WD', 'Zhang GQ', 'Wang CZ', 'Cao Q', 'Zhou GP']","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China. guopzhou2018@163.com.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (AEBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carboxypeptidases/*genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Datasets as Topic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Multigene Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",,,2019/02/20 06:00,2020/07/09 06:00,['2019/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201902_17011 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Feb;23(3):1184-1195. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201902_17011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MRD diagnostics performed by real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) is still the gold standard and currently the most sensitive and the most broadly applied method in follicular lymphoma (FL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Alternatively, droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) can be used for MRD monitoring in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma, and follicular lymphoma with comparable sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility.The most broadly applicable MRD target in B-NHL is the junctional regions of the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGHV). Chromosomal translocations like the t(14;18) translocation in FL and t(11;14) translocation in MCL can be used as MRD target in selected lymphoma subtypes. In patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, both flow-cytometry and RQ-PCR are equally suited for MRD assessment as long as a sensitivity of 10(-4) shall be achieved.MRD diagnostics targeting the IGHV gene is complex and requires extensive knowledge and experience because the junctional regions of each lymphoma have to be identified before the patient-specific RQ-PCR assays can be designed for MRD monitoring. In addition, the presence and load of somatic hypermutation (SHM) within the rearranged IG heavy variable (IGHV) gene occurring as during B-cell development of germinal center and post-germinal center lymphomas may hamper appropriate primer binding leading to false-negative results. The translocations mentioned above have the advantage that consensus forward primers and probes, both placed in the breakpoint regions of chromosome 18 in FL and chromosome 11 in MCL, can be used in combination with a reverse primer placed in the IGH joining region of chromosome 14. RQ-PCR-based methods can reach a good sensitivity (</=10(-4)). This chapter provides all relevant background information and technical aspects for the complete laboratory process from detection of the clonal IGHV gene rearrangement and the chromosomal translocations at diagnosis to the actual MRD measurements in clinical follow-up samples of B-NHL. However, it should be noted that MRD diagnostics for clinical treatment protocols has to be accompanied by regular international quality control rounds to ensure the reproducibility and reliability of the MRD results.",,"['Pott, Christiane', 'Bruggemann, Monika', 'Ritgen, Matthias', 'van der Velden, Vincent H J', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Kneba, Michael']","['Pott C', 'Bruggemann M', 'Ritgen M', 'van der Velden VHJ', 'van Dongen JJM', 'Kneba M']","['Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany. c.pott@med2.uni-kiel.de.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus MC, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Second Medical Department, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],,"['DNA/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel/methods', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Translocation, Genetic']",['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL)', '*Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)', '*Follicular lymphoma (FL)', '*Immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IGH)', '*Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)', '*Minimal residual disease (MRD)', '*Quantitative range', '*Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR)', '*Sensitivity', '*ddPCR', '*t(11;14) translocation', '*t(14;18) translocation']",2019/02/20 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2019/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-9151-8_9 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;1956:199-228. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9151-8_9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This finding strongly supports selection by common epitopes or classes of structurally similar epitopes in the ontogeny of these tumors. BcR IG stereotypy was initially described in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the stereotyped fraction of the disease accounts for a remarkable one-third of patients. However, subsequent studies showed that stereotyped BcR IG are also present in other neoplasms of mature B cells, including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL). Subsequent cross-entity comparisons led to the conclusion that stereotyped IG are mostly ""disease-specific,"" implicating distinct immunopathogenetic processes. Interestingly, mounting evidence suggests that a molecular subclassification of lymphomas based on BcR IG stereotypy is biologically and clinically relevant. Indeed, particularly in CLL, patients assigned to the same subset due to expressing a particular stereotyped BcR IG display remarkably consistent biological background and clinical course, at least for major and well-studied subsets. Thus, the robust assignment to stereotyped subsets may assist in the identification of mechanisms underlying disease onset and progression, while also refining risk stratification. In this book chapter, we provide an overview of the recent BcR IG stereotypy studies in mature B cell malignancies and outline previous and current methodological approaches used for the identification of stereotyped IG.",,"['Agathangelidis, Andreas', 'Psomopoulos, Fotis', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas']","['Agathangelidis A', 'Psomopoulos F', 'Stamatopoulos K']","['Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Institute of Applied Biosciences, Centre for Research and Technology Hellas, Thessaloniki, Greece. kostas.stamatopoulos@gmail.com.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. kostas.stamatopoulos@gmail.com.']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/genetics', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/chemistry/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/chemistry/*genetics']",['NOTNLM'],"['*Antigen', '*Bioinformatics', '*Immunoglobulin gene', '*Pattern', '*Stereotypy', '*Subset', '*VH CDR3']",2019/02/20 06:00,2019/07/28 06:00,['2019/02/20 06:00'],"['2019/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-9151-8_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;1956:139-155. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9151-8_7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The approach allows the unbiased characterization of the human antibody repertoire at single-cell level through the generation of recombinant monoclonal antibodies from single primary human B cells of defined origin. This protocol offers a detailed description of the method starting from the flow-cytometric isolation of single human B cells to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based amplification of the expressed immunoglobulin (Ig) transcripts (IGH, IGK, and IGL) and their subsequent cloning into expression vectors for the in vitro production of recombinant monoclonal antibodies.

In some patients, response to therapy may be affected by aberrant function of genes involved in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drugs. The aim of this research was to assess the impact of pharmacogenetic variability, namely expression of SLC28A3 gene and the presence of CYP2B6*6 variant allele, on the FC treatment efficacy. Forty-four CLL patients with functional TP53 gene at the time of FC initiation were enrolled in this study. CYP2B6 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. SLC28A3 expression was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Significantly higher pretreatment levels of SLC28A3 mRNA were detected in patients who failed to respond to FC in comparison to patients who achieved complete and partial response (p = 0.01). SLC28A3 high-expressing cases were almost ten times more likely not to respond to FC than low-expressing cases (OR = 9.8; p = 0.046). However, association of SLC28A3 expression with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was not observed.

In this randomized trial, we sought to investigate whether a telephone intervention strategy (called AMA) delivered by an oncology nurse could reduce the risk of RDI < 80% by alleviating adverse events and supporting patients' adherence. Sixty FCR patients were randomized 1:1 for AMA (stratified on Binet stage C). As per guidelines, patients received pegfilgrastim as primary prophylaxis of febrile neutropenia. At the end of therapy, RDI < 80% was reported in 31% of patients, shortening PFS (median 26 months versus not reached, P = 0.021) and OS at 3 years (100 vs 70%, P = 0.0089). Oncology nurse interventions tended to significantly reduce this event (RDI < 80%: 41.4% in non-AMA versus 20.7% in AMA patients (p = 0.09)). By adjusting our logistic regression model on published parameters exposing to RDI < 80%, we found that AMA protected significantly against the risk of reduced RDI (OR = 0.22, IC95% 0.05-0.84, p = 0.04), independently of grade 3/4 neutropenia (< 15% per cycle) and febrile neutropenia (< 5% per cycle) events.

The cardiotoxicity of anti-cancer treatments leads to a dysfunction of the cardiac autonomic nervous system. Protection strategies, with dexrazoxane treatments, were used to counter these adverse effects. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the treatments on the cardiac autonomic nervous system. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 203 cALL survivors were included in our analyses and were classified into 3 categories based on the prognostic risk group: standard risk, high risk with and without dexrazoxane. A 24-h Holter monitoring was performed to study the cardiac autonomic nervous system. The frequency domain heart rate variability (HRV) was used to validate the cardiac autonomic nervous system modifications. Other analyses were performed using linear HRV indexes in the time domain and non-linear indexes. A frequency domain HRV parameters analysis revealed significant differences on an overall time-period of 24 h. A repeated measures ANOVA indicated a group-effect for the low frequency (p = 0.029), high frequency (p = 0.03) and LF/HF ratio (p = 0.029). Significant differences in the time domain and in the non-linear power spectral density HRV parameters were also observed. CONCLUSION: Anti-cancer treatments induced significant changes in the cardiac autonomic nervous system. The HRV was sensitive enough to detect cardiac autonomic nervous system alterations depending on the cALL risk category. Protection strategies (i.e., dexrazoxane treatments), which were used to counter the adverse effects of doxorubicin, could prevent changes observed in the cardiac autonomic nervous system.",,"['Caru, Maxime', 'Corbin, Denis', 'Perie, Delphine', 'Lemay, Valerie', 'Delfrate, Jacques', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Andelfinger, Gregor', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Caru M', 'Corbin D', 'Perie D', 'Lemay V', 'Delfrate J', 'Drouin S', 'Bertout L', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Andelfinger G', 'Sinnett D', 'Curnier D']","[""Laboratoire de Physiopathologie de l'EXercice (LPEX), Departement de Kinesiologie, Universite de Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, H3C 3J7, Montreal, QC, Canada. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca."", 'Department of Psychology, University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, Ile-deFrance, France. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430-Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, Ile-de-France, France. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada. maxime.caru@umontreal.ca.', ""Laboratoire de Physiopathologie de l'EXercice (LPEX), Departement de Kinesiologie, Universite de Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, H3C 3J7, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Laboratoire de Physiopathologie de l'EXercice (LPEX), Departement de Kinesiologie, Universite de Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, H3C 3J7, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Laboratoire de Physiopathologie de l'EXercice (LPEX), Departement de Kinesiologie, Universite de Montreal, CEPSUM, 2100, boulevard Edouard Montpetit, H3C 3J7, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2904-9185'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190218,Germany,Clin Res Cardiol,Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society,101264123,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Autonomic Nervous System/*drug effects/physiopathology', 'Blood Pressure/physiology', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Cardiotoxicity/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Electrocardiography, Ambulatory', 'Heart Rate/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Cardiac autonomic nervous system', 'Doxorubicin treatments', 'Electrophysiology', 'Heart rate variability']",2019/02/20 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/02/20 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00392-019-01427-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00392-019-01427-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Res Cardiol. 2019 Sep;108(9):1000-1008. doi: 10.1007/s00392-019-01427-9.

Many stresses, such as infection/inflammation, reactive oxygen species, nutritional deprivation and hypoxia, activate unfolded protein response signalling, which induces either adaptive changes to resolve the stress or apoptosis to clear the damaged cell. Whether unfolded-protein-response signalling plays any role in HSC regulation remains to be established. Here, we report that the adaptive signalling of the unfolded protein response, IRE1alpha-XBP1, protects HSCs from endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis. IRE1alpha knockout leads to reduced reconstitution of HSCs. Furthermore, we show that oncogenic N-Ras(G12D) activates IRE1alpha-XBP1, through MEK-GSK3beta, to promote HSC survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress. Inhibiting IRE1alpha-XBP1 abolished N-Ras(G12D)-mediated survival under endoplasmic reticulum stress and diminished the competitive advantage of Nras(G12D) HSCs in transplant recipients.

The regulation/induction of NK cell function is mediated by an array of activating or inhibitory surface receptors. In humans, major activating receptors involved in target cell killing are the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and NKG2D. Activating receptors recognize ligands that are overexpressed or expressed de novo upon cell stress, viral infection, or tumor transformation. The HLA-class I-specific inhibitory receptors, including KIRs recognizing HLA-class I allotypic determinants and CD94/NKG2A recognizing the class-Ib HLA-E, constitute a fail-safe mechanism to avoid unwanted NK-mediated damage to healthy cells. Other receptors such as PD-1, primarily expressed by activated T lymphocytes, are important inhibitory checkpoints of immune responses that ensure T-cell tolerance. PD-1 also may be expressed by NK cells in cancer patients. Since PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) may be expressed by different tumors, PD-1/PD-L1 interactions inactivate both T and NK cells. Thus, the reliable evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumors has become a major issue to select patients who may benefit from therapy with mAbs disrupting PD-1/PD-L1 interactions. Recently, NKG2A was revealed to be an important checkpoint controlling both NK and T-cell activation. Since most tumors express HLA-E, mAbs targeting NKG2A has been used alone or in combination with other therapeutic mAbs targeting PD-1 or tumor antigens (e.g., EGFR), with encouraging results. The translational value of NK cells and their receptors is evidenced by the extraordinary therapeutic success of haploidentical HSCT to cure otherwise fatal high-risk leukemias.",,"['Sivori, Simona', 'Vacca, Paola', 'Del Zotto, Genny', 'Munari, Enrico', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina', 'Moretta, Lorenzo']","['Sivori S', 'Vacca P', 'Del Zotto G', 'Munari E', 'Mingari MC', 'Moretta L']","['Department of Experimental Medicine (DIMES) and Centre of Excellence for Biomedical Research (CEBR), University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy.', ""Department of Immunology, IRCCS Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Research and Diagnostics, Istituto G.

Due to the widespread use of MWCNTs, it is important to investigate their effects on human health. The precise mechanism of MWCNT toxicity has not been fully elucidated. The present study was designed to examine the mechanisms of MWCNT toxicity toward human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. First, we found that MWCNTs decreased the viability of neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells but not undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Because neutrophil-like differentiated HL-60 cells exhibit enhanced phagocytic activity, the cytotoxicity of MWCNTs is dependent on the intracellularly localized MWCNTs. Next, we revealed that the cytotoxicity of MWCNTs is correlated with the intracellular accumulation of iron that is released from the engulfed MWCNTs in an acidic lysosomal environment. The intracellular accumulation of iron was repressed by treatment with cytochalasin D, a phagocytosis inhibitor. In addition, our results indicated that iron overload enhanced the release of interleukin-8 (IL-8), a chemokine that activates neutrophils, and subsequently elevated intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i). Finally, we found that the sustained [Ca(2+)]i elevation resulted in the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the increase of caspase-3 activity, thereby inducing apoptotic cell death. These findings suggest that the iron overload caused by engulfed MWCNTs results in the increase of IL-8 production and the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i, thereby activating the mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.",,"['Tabei, Yosuke', 'Fukui, Hiroko', 'Nishioka, Ayako', 'Hagiwara, Yuji', 'Sato, Kei', 'Yoneda, Tadashi', 'Koyama, Tamami', 'Horie, Masanori']","['Tabei Y', 'Fukui H', 'Nishioka A', 'Hagiwara Y', 'Sato K', 'Yoneda T', 'Koyama T', 'Horie M']","['Health Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa, 761-0395, Japan. y-tabei@aist.go.jp.', 'Safety Evaluation Center, Showa Denko K.K., 1-1-1 Ohnodai, Midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 267-0056, Japan.', 'Safety Evaluation Center, Showa Denko K.K., 1-1-1 Ohnodai, Midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 267-0056, Japan.', 'Safety Evaluation Center, Showa Denko K.K., 1-1-1 Ohnodai, Midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 267-0056, Japan.', 'Safety Evaluation Center, Showa Denko K.K., 1-1-1 Ohnodai, Midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 267-0056, Japan.', 'Safety Evaluation Center, Showa Denko K.K., 1-1-1 Ohnodai, Midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 267-0056, Japan.', 'Institute for Advanced and Core Technology, Showa Denko K.K., 1-1-1 Ohnodai, Midori-ku, Chiba-shi, Chiba, 267-0056, Japan.', 'Health Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, Kagawa, 761-0395, Japan.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190218,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Nanotubes, Carbon)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/biosynthesis', 'Iron/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Iron Overload/*etiology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Nanotubes, Carbon/chemistry/toxicity', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*metabolism']",,,2019/02/20 06:00,2020/09/12 06:00,['2019/02/20 06:00'],"['2018/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/02/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-38598-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-38598-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Feb 18;9(1):2224. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-38598-4.,PMC6379482,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By contrast, a chronic lymphocytic leukemia-derived BCR forms dimers and oligomers in the absence of a stimulus, but a single amino acid exchange reverts its organization to monomers in unstimulated B cells.

We interrogated chromosome 1q23.3 and the nearby focal amplicon 1q21.3, as both are associated with increased lymph node disease in patients with urothelial carcinoma. Specifically, we assessed whether the oncogene MCL1 that resides in 1q21.3 and the genes that reside in the 1q23.3 amplicon were required for the proliferation or survival of urothelial carcinoma. We observed that suppressing MCL1 or the death effector domain-containing protein (DEDD) in the cells that harbor amplifications of 1q21.3 or 1q23.3, respectively, inhibited cell proliferation. We also found that overexpression of MCL1 or DEDD increased anchorage independence growth in vitro and increased experimental metastasis in vivo in the nonamplified urothelial carcinoma cell line, RT112. The expression of MCL1 confers resistance to a range of apoptosis inducers, while the expression of DEDD led to resistance to TNFalpha-induced apoptosis. These observations identify MCL1 and DEDD as genes that contribute to aggressive urothelial carcinoma.

Alisertib (MLN8237) is a potent and selective AAK inhibitor. In pediatric preclinical models, antitumor activity was observed in neuroblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and sarcoma xenografts. We conducted a phase 2 trial of alisertib in pediatric patients with refractory or recurrent solid tumors or acute leukemias (NCT01154816). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Alisertib (80 mg/m(2)/dose) was administered orally, daily for 7 days every 21 days. Pharmacogenomic (PG) evaluation for polymorphisms in the AURK gene and drug metabolizing enzymes (UGT1A1*28), and plasma pharmacokinetic studies (PK) were performed. Using a 2-stage design, patients were enrolled to 12 disease strata (10 solid tumor and 2 acute leukemia). Response was assessed after cycle 1, then every other cycle. RESULTS: A total of 139 children and adolescents (median age, 10 years) were enrolled, 137 were evaluable for response. Five objective responses were observed (2 complete responses and 3 partial responses). The most frequent toxicity was myelosuppression. The median alisertib trough concentration on day 4 was 1.3 mumol/L, exceeding the 1 mumol/L target trough concentration in 67% of patients. No correlations between PG or PK and toxicity were observed.

METHODS: We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on 611 adults free of diagnosed disease, living in Italy and Sweden, in whom we also measured plasma concentrations of 6 PCB congeners, DDE and hexachlorobenzene. RESULTS: We identified 650 CpG sites whose methylation correlates strongly (FDR<0.01) with plasma concentrations of at least one PCB congener. Stronger effects were observed in males and in Sweden. This epigenetic exposure profile shows extensive and highly statistically significant overlaps with published profiles associated with the risk of future B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as well as with clinical CLL (38 and 28 CpG sites, respectively). For all these sites, the methylation changes were in the same direction for increasing exposure and for higher disease risk or clinical disease status, suggesting an etiological link between exposure and CLL. Mediation analysis reinforced the suggestion of a causal link between exposure, changes in DNA methylation and disease. Disease connectivity analysis identified multiple additional diseases associated with differentially methylated genes, including melanoma for which an etiological link with PCB exposure is established, as well as developmental and neurological diseases for which there is corresponding epidemiological evidence. Differentially methylated genes include many homeobox genes, suggesting that PCBs target stem cells. Furthermore, numerous polycomb protein target genes were hypermethylated with increasing exposure, an effect known to constitute an early marker of carcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides mechanistic evidence in support of a link between exposure to PCBs and the etiology of CLL and underlines the utility of omic profiling in the evaluation of the potential toxicity of environmental chemicals.",['Copyright (c) 2019 The Authors.

Therefore, herein, a new low-cost, simple to fabricate, disposable, electrochemical mast cell-based paper sensor is proposed and developed to sensitively determine the major milk allergen casein. Then, a graphene (GN)/carbon nanofiber (CN)/ Gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) composite material with high conductivity and good biocompatibility was modified on the cell-based paper sensor to improve the electrical conductivity and provide a sensing recognition interface for the immobilization of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells. The cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry measurement of the mast cells in the paper sensor revealed an irreversible anodic peak, whose peak current is proportional to the number of cells in the range from 1x10(2) to 1x10(8) cells/mL. For the milk allergen detection tests, mast cells exposed to the casein caused a significant reduction in the current signal, displaying an inverse dose-dependent relationship. The developed cell sensor exhibited a range of linearity between 1x10(-7) and 1x10(-6) g/mL of casein with a detection limit of 3.2x10(-8) g/mL and a great reproducibility and selectivity. The electrochemical responses obtained using the cell-based paper sensor were well consistent with the conventional detection assay, with good stability and reproducibility. Therefore, a simple and novel electrochemical method for food allergens detection was developed, demonstrating its potential application in the food safety determination and evaluation.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AIM: To examine the associations of parental age at birth with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) among children aged 0-14 years using individual-level data from the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) and non-CLIC studies. MATERIAL/METHODS: We analyzed data of 3182 incident AML cases and 8377 controls from 17 studies [seven registry-based case-control (RCC) studies and ten questionnaire-based case-control (QCC) studies]. AML risk in association with parental age was calculated using multiple logistic regression, meta-analyses, and pooled-effect estimates. Models were stratified by age at diagnosis (infants <1 year-old vs. children 1-14 years-old) and by study design, using five-year parental age increments and controlling for sex, ethnicity, birthweight, prematurity, multiple gestation, birth order, maternal smoking and education, age at diagnosis (cases aged 1-14 years), and recruitment time period. RESULTS: Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) derived from RCC, but not from the QCC, studies showed a higher AML risk for infants of mothers >/=40-year-old (OR = 6.87; 95% CI: 2.12-22.25).

New treatments for AML have recently been introduced, including a chemotherapy formulation called CPX-351, which is administered via less time-intensive IV infusion than the standard ""7 + 3"" continuous infusion regimen of cytarabine plus an anthracycline. The purpose of this study was to estimate utilities that could be used in economic modeling of AML treatment. Materials and methods: In time trade-off interviews, participants from the UK general population valued 12 health states drafted based on literature and clinician interviews. To identify disutility associated with chemotherapy, two types of induction and four types of consolidation were added to an otherwise identical health state describing AML. The decrease in utility when adding these chemotherapy regimens represents the disutility of each regimen. Five additional health states were valued to estimate utilities associated with other AML treatments. Results: Two hundred participants completed interviews. Mean (SD) utilities were 0.55 (0.31) for pre-treatment AML and 0.66 (0.29) for AML in temporary remission. Adding any chemotherapy significantly decreased utility (p < 0.0001). Induction had a mean disutility of -0.11 with CPX-351 and -0.15 with 7 + 3. Mean disutility for consolidation ranged from -0.03 with outpatient CPX-351 to -0.11 with inpatient 5 + 2. Utilities are also reported for other AML treatments (e.g. transplant, low-intensity chemotherapy). Limitations: One limitation is that the differences in adverse event profiles between the treatment regimens were based on clinician opinion. Future use of CPX-351 in clinical trials or clinical settings will provide additional information on its adverse event profile. Conclusions: While all chemotherapy regimens were associated with disutility, regimens with shorter hospitalization and less time-intensive infusion were generally perceived as preferable. These utilities may be useful in cost-utility models comparing the value of AML treatments.",,"['Matza, Louis S', 'Deger, Kristen A', 'Howell, Timothy A', 'Koetter, Kimberly', 'Yeager, Andrew M', 'Hogge, Donna', 'Fisher, Vicki', 'Louie, Arthur C', 'Chung, Karen C']","['Matza LS', 'Deger KA', 'Howell TA', 'Koetter K', 'Yeager AM', 'Hogge D', 'Fisher V', 'Louie AC', 'Chung KC']","['a Patient-Centered Research , Evidera , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'b Modeling and Simulation , Evidera , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'a Patient-Centered Research , Evidera , Bethesda , MD , USA.', 'c Rush University Cancer Center , Chicago , IL , USA.', 'd University of Arizona Cancer Center , Tucson , AZ , USA.', 'e Gordon and Leslie Diamond Health Care Centre , Vancouver , BC , Canada.', 'f Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc , Palo Alto , CA , USA.', 'f Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc , Palo Alto , CA , USA.', 'f Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc , Palo Alto , CA , USA.']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],20190329,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,"['0 (CPX-351)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/economics/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/economics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/economics/methods', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interviews as Topic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Economic', '*Patient Preference', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom']",['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'H51', 'I18', 'chemotherapy', 'consolidation', 'induction', 'time trade-off', 'utility']",2019/02/19 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/02/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/02/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2019.1584108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2019 Jun;22(6):567-576. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2019.1584108.

TKs are frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and hence are increasingly targeted. The management of AML has dramatically improved because of TKI-targeted treatment. AREAS COVERED: This review provides a biological background for TK inhibitors (TKIs) in AML and reviews their use in the clinic. TK expression and mutation in AML are explored with a focus on TKs associated with specific AML subsets and treatment outcomes. TKIs that specifically target FLT3, c-Kit, and Jak2 are discussed. TKI targeting of specific genes mutated in individual cases and general 'untargeted' use of these agents are highlighted. Lastly, the mechanisms TKI drug resistance in AML are explored EXPERT OPINION: The use of TKIs in the clinic is improving outcomes for many patients. An improved understanding of tyrosine kinase biology and the expanding use of TKIs are likely to dramatically improve outcomes in the coming decade.
