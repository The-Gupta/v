Seventy-five female patients with hematologic malignancies (mostly acute leukemia) and a history of pregnancy were randomized to receive either standard random single-donor platelet transfusions (mean leukocytes, 430 x 10(6) per transfusion) or leukocyte-depleted random single-donor platelet transfusions. Leukocyte depletion to less than 5 x 10(6) leukocytes per platelet transfusion (mean leukocytes, 2 x 10(6) per transfusion) was achieved by filtration. Of the 62 evaluable patients, refractoriness to random donor platelets occurred in 41% (14 of 34) of the patients in the standard group and in 29% (8 of 28) of the patients in the filtered group (P = .52); anti-HLA antibodies developed in 43% (9 of 21) of individuals in the standard group and 44% (11 of 25) of cases in the filtered group. The time toward refractoriness and development of anti-HLA antibodies was similar for both groups. We conclude that leukocyte depletion of random single-donor platelet products to less than 5 x 10(6) per transfusion does not reduce the incidence of refractoriness to random donor platelet transfusion because of boostering of anti-HLA antibodies.","['Department of Statistics, Dr Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full-length posttranslationally modified Rac2 was active, whereas only the 1-166 truncated form of Rap1a was functional in the cell-free system, and thus, clarification of the function of Rap1a and Rac2 in intact human phagocytes is needed to provide further insight into their roles as signal transducers from plasma membrane receptors. In the present studies, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce a series of mutations into human rap1a or rac2 in the mammalian expression vector pSR alpha neo. HL60 cells transfected with wild-type or mutated rac2 or rap1a cDNA constructs and control HL60 cells transfected with the pSR alpha neo vector containing no inserted cDNA were selected in G418-containing media, then subclones were isolated. Compared with the parent HL60 cells, each of the stable transfected cell lines differentiated similarly into neutrophil-like cells and expressed comparable levels of NADPH oxidase components p47-phox, p67-phox and gp91-phox. The differentiated vector control cell line produced O2. in response to receptor stimulation at rates that were not significantly different from parent HL60 cells. O2-. production by differentiated cell lines expressing mutated N17 Rap1a or N17 Rac2 dominant-negative proteins was inhibited, whereas O2-. production by the subline overexpressing wild-type Rap1a was increased by fourfold. O2-. production by the differentiated cell line expressing GTPase-defective V12 Rap1a was also significantly inhibited, a finding that is consistent with a requirement for cycling between guanosine diphosphate- and GTP-bound forms of Rap1a for continuous NADPH oxidase activation in intact neutrophils. A model is proposed in which Rac2 mediates assembly of the p47 and p67 oxidase components on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane via cytoskeletal reorganization, whereas Rap1a functions downstream as the final activation switch involving direct physical interaction with the transmembrane flavocytochrome component of the NADPH oxidase.","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121.']",['R01 AI21961/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The inversion results in two fusion genes: 5'-CBFB/MYH11-3' on 16p and 5'-MYH11/CBFB-3' on 16q. We have studied cells from 42 patients with inv(16) (38 patients) or t(16;16) (four patients) to define the frequency and characteristics of the deletion further. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes from cosmids, cosmid contigs, and yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), we found that six patients with inv(16) had a deletion of between 150 and 350 kb centromeric to the p-arm inversion breakpoint cluster region (p-ibc). This region was shown to contain the 5' portion of the myosin heavy chain (MYH11) gene. YACs containing the p-ibc, which had been useful as FISH probes in the diagnosis of inv(16), detected the inversion in deletion as well as nondeletion patient cells. Thus, the deleted region identified in patients is entirely contained within the human genomic content of the YACs. Southern blot experiments using probes flanking the p-ibc indicated that the deletion removes segments within 10 kb centromeric of the p-ibc. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers from the 5' region of CBFB and the 3' region of MYH11 (distal to the p-ibc) produced the 5'-CBFB/MYH11-3' chimeric transcript in inv(16)/del patients. These data confirm that the 5'-CBFB/MYH11-3' chimeric transcript, rather than the reciprocal 5'-MYH11/CBFB-3', is the critical product for chromosome 16-related leukemogenesis.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['CA34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The explanation for this prognostic significance is largely unknown. We have studied whether DNA ploidy was related to cellular resistance to 12 drugs, assessed with the methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assay, in samples of 74 children with common (CD10+ precursor B-cell) ALL. Sixteen patients had hyperdiploid ALL cells and 58 patients had nonhyperdiploid ALL cells. Hyperdiploid ALL cells were more sensitive to mercaptopurine (median, 9.0-fold; P = .000003), to thioguanine (1.4-fold; P = .023), to cytarabine (1.8-fold; P = .016), and to I-asparaginase (19.5-fold; P = .022) than were nonhyperdiploid ALL cells. In contrast, these two ploidy groups did not differ significantly in resistance to prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, vindesine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, and teniposide. The percentage of S-phase cells was higher (P = .05) in the hyperdiploid ALL samples (median, 8.5%) than in the nonhyperdiploid ALL samples (median, 5.7%). However, the percentage of cells in S-phase was not significantly related to in vitro drug resistance. We conclude that the favorable prognosis associated with DNA hyperdiploidy in childhood common ALL may be explained by a relative sensitivity of hyperdiploid common ALL cells to antimetabolites, especially to mercaptopurine and to I-asparaginase.","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, tal-1 mRNA is constitutively expressed in erythroid precursors and megakaryocytes. This report describes a direct immunocytochemical study of the distribution and localization of TAL-1 protein in normal human tissues and cell lines using four monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant TAL-1 proteins. One of these reagents recognizes a protein of 41 kD molecular weight in in vitro-translated TAL-1 proteins, two others recognize proteins of 39 and 41 kD molecular weight, and the fourth antibody also recognizes a TAL-1 protein of 22 kD in addition to the 39- and 41-kD proteins. These anti-TAL-1 antibodies label the nuclei of erythroid precursor cells and megakaryocytes in fetal liver and adult bone marrow. The punctate pattern of nuclear labeling suggests that TAL-1 may comprise part of a novel nuclear structure, similar to that recently found for the PML protein. The nuclei of T cell lines known to express mRNA encoding the full-length TAL-1 protein (eg, CCRF-CEM, RPMI 8402, and Jurkat) are also labeled. A study of normal human tissues (including thymus) showed labeling of smooth muscle, some tissue macrophages, and endothelial cells. TAL-1 protein is undetectable in other cell types. These reagents may play an important role in the diagnosis of T-ALL and could also be used in the context of lymphoma diagnosis on routinely fixed material.","['University Department of Cellular Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-nine patients were treated according to the LMB 84 protocol scheme; 14 according to the LMB 86 protocol, and 12 patients received the LMB 84 induction courses followed by the LMB 86 consolidation courses. Three patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) while in second complete remission (CR) and 3 others had refractory disease. There were some protocol violations caused by empirical medical decisions: local irradiation was performed in 4 patients, 2 patients received prophylactic radiation to the brain that was not specified in the protocol, 13 patients underwent BMT in first CR, and methotrexate doses were modified in 10 patients. Fifty-eight patients (89%) achieved a CR. There were four (6%) primary induction treatment failures, and three (4%) early treatment-related deaths. Eight patients relapsed between 2 and 30 months after CR (median, 4.7 months). Forty-seven patients are alive in CR (45 first CR, 2 second CR) with a median follow-up of 57 months (24 to 93 months). There were five toxicity-related deaths among patients in CR including four BMT-related deaths and five deaths caused by refractory relapses. One patient died in CR at 62 months of rectal cancer. The 3-year overall survival rate is 74% (SE = 5). According to the stages in the Murphy classification, the 3-year survival rates are stages I and II, 100%; stage III, 80% (SE = 7); and stage IV and ALL, 57% (SE = 8). Seven of 12 patients with initial CNS disease are alive with a median survival of 56 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We looked for homozygous deletion and point mutation of the p16 gene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), where 9p21 deletion or rearrangement are also nonrandom cytogenetic findings. Other hematologic malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and myeloma were also studied. Homozygous deletion of the p16 gene was seen in 9 of the 63 (14%) ALL analyzed, including 6/39 precursor B-ALL, 3/12 T-ALL, and 0/12 Burkitt's ALL. Three of the 7 ALL with 9p rearrangement (including 3 of the 5 patients where this rearrangement was clearly associated to 9p21 monosomy) had homozygous deletion compared to 5 of the 55 patients with normal 9p (the last patient with homozygous deletion was not successfully karyotyped). Single stranded conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 1 and 2 of the p16 gene was performed in 88 cases of ALL, including the 63 patients analyzed by Southern blot. Twenty-six of the cases had 9p rearrangement, associated to 9p21 monosomy in at least 12 cases. A missense point mutation, at codon 49 (nucleotide 164), was seen in only 1 of the 88 patients. No homozygous deletion and no point mutation of the p16 gene was seen in AML, MDS, CLL, and myeloma. Homozygous deletion of interferon alpha genes (situated close to p16 gene in 9p21) was seen in only 3 of the 9 ALL patients with p16 gene homozygous deletion, and none of the ALL without p16 gene homozygous deletion. Our findings suggest that homozygous deletion of the p16 gene is seen in about 15% of ALL cases, is not restricted to cases with cytogenetically detectable 9p deletion, and could have a pathogenetic role in this malignancy. On the other hand, p16 point mutations are very rare in ALL, and we found no p16 homozygous deletions or mutations in the other hematologic malignancies studied.","['U124 Inserm Institut de Recherches sur le Cancer, C.H.U.

These translocations fuse the MLL, a gene with sequence homology to the Drosophila trithorax, to genes from a number of other chromosomal loci. We have characterized two t(1;11)(q21;q23) translocations that fuse the MLL gene to a novel gene, AF1q on chromosomal band 1q21, in two infants with acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMMOL). In one of these patients, der(11) represents an inframe fusion of the N-terminal portion of MLL gene to the complete AF1q open reading frame, whereas der(1) does not give rise to an open reading frame. This observation suggests that the N-terminal portion of MLL gene is critical for leukemogenesis in translocations involving band 11q23. The predicted wild-type AF-1q product is a 9-kD protein with no similarity to any other protein in the data banks. The AF1q mRNA is highly expressed in the thymus but not in peripheral lymphoid tissues. In contrast to its restricted distribution in normal hematopoietic tissue, AF1q was expressed in all leukemic cell lines tested.","['Division of Immunology/Cancer Research and Medical Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,['GENBANK/U16954'],,,,,,,,,,,

Both the outgrowth of transformed B lymphocytes ex vivo (100% correlation) and the detection of EBV DNA by a PCR method (80% correlation) showed statistically significant association with the histopathological diagnosis of EBV-LPD. Because these abnormalities can be detected prior to the onset of clinical disease.

These data show that: (1) in high-grade NHLs mutations frequently occur outside the classic hot spot regions and (2) staining for p53 is not predictive of the status of the gene, i.e. whether or not a mutation is present.

Increased clearance of transfused platelets due to alloimmune destruction has been identified as one of the primary mechanisms contributing to this refractory state. We performed a double-blind randomized trial to determine whether the administration of anti-D to Rh-positive individuals could prevent the refractory state and improve post-transfusion platelet response. Rh-positive patients with acute leukaemia undergoing induction chemotherapy and requiring platelet transfusions were allocated to weekly intravenous anti-D (20 micrograms/kg) or placebo. Platelets and red cell concentrates were administered according to standardized transfusion guidelines. Outcome measures included platelet transfusion utilization, red cell utilization, platelet recovery 18-24 h post-infusion, and the percentage of patients refractory to platelet transfusion. There were 43 patients studied: 21 received anti-D and 22 saline placebo. The mean number of platelet concentrates required per day of observation was 0.59 (SD 0.22) in the anti-D group and 0.61 (SD 0.22) in the placebo group, P = 0.86. No difference was detected between groups in terms of platelet recovery post-infusion, refractoriness to platelet transfusion or frequency of infection (P = 0.97).

Fluid evaporation from wells, CO2 escape and contamination were prevented by hermetic sealing of the microcultures in wells of a 96-well microplate, thus enabling the cells to grow exponentially for 72 h under the conditions of the incubated microplate reader. For both OCI/AML-2 cells, which grow in suspension, and adherent J-774.1 cells, a linear correlation was demonstrated between the number of unstained cells seeded in a given microplate well and the optical density (OD) of that well. Therefore, the OD/time curve of the culture could be deemed to be its growth curve. By the use of the linear fit equation, the actual number of the cells in the wells was computable at any time point of the assay. In the chemosensitivity test, an inhibitory effect of ARA-C on the growth of the cells could be estimated by viewing of the growth curves plotted on the screen. The maximum kinetic rates (Vmax) of the curves in the control and the ARA-C-treated wells were compared, yielding a growth inhibition index (GII). Comparison of results of the kinetic chemosensitivity assay with those of a [3H]thymidine incorporation assay revealed that the novel assay is suitable for precise quantitation of the cell chemosensitivity, is more informative and has the added technical advantage of performance without recourse to radioactive or chemically hazardous substances.","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cloning capacity of AML cells was unrelated to the cell cycle characteristics of the leukaemia cell population in vivo or to the level of myc, myb, fms, or interleukin (IL)1 beta expression.

For this purpose, a combined 'expected utility' considering survival, relapse free survival, and secondary leukaemia was determined for different treatment strategies. Our analysis revealed that considerations of secondary leukaemia for initial therapy should include the a priori estimation of all possible events which may occur after initial treatment, e.g. the probabilities of recurrence and success of salvage therapy. In early and intermediate stage HD, for example, the minimal risk of leukaemia after successful radiotherapy (RT) must be weighed against the increased risk after treatment failure and subsequent salvage therapy. Thus, the difference of expected risk of leukaemia between RT and combined modality treatment (CMT) is within 4% for HD, stage II B and near to 0% in stage III A. In advanced stage HD, the addition of RT to chemotherapy has no adverse effect on the expected utility of initial treatment. These conclusions are only marginally affected by reported differences in rates of recurrence, salvage success, and secondary leukaemia. Subjective quality of life considerations, such as the latency period between treatment and leukaemia and patients' attitudes towards the occurrence of leukaemia, did not significantly affect expected utilities. In summary, our results strongly suggest that presently there is no sound basis for reducing the intensity of initial treatment in HD to avoid secondary leukaemia.","['Universitatklinik, Gottingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The IL-8 concentrations in the cells and medium after LPS stimulation increased time-dependently in the absence of UTI, but did not increase in the presence of UTI. On the other hand, UTI did not inhibit either the synthesis or the release of IL-8 induced by the calcium ionophore A23187.

For the purposes of exposure classification, telephone company jobs were initially divided into two classes: those with potential for working in an electric environment, referred to as linework jobs, and those not working in an electric environment, referred to as nonlinework jobs. Linework jobs were further divided into the following four categories: outside plant technicians (OPT), installation/maintenance/repair (IMR) technicians, central office technicians (COT), and cable splicing technicians (CST). These job groupings were based on similarity of work tasks and exposure environments. Emdex data-logging dosimeters were used to measure personal exposures to ELF magnetic fields for 204 telephone company workers. Three general classes of exposure indices were calculated for each exposure record: measures of central tendency, measures of peak or maximum exposure, and measures of exposure variability. CSTs had the highest full-shift mean and median exposure, 4.3 and 3.2 mG, respectively. CSTs also ranked the highest, with average peak, average 95th percentile, and average time above background equal to 99.2 mG, 11.1 mG, and 156 min, respectively. In addition, the results suggest the OPT and IMR technicians have exposures similar to nonlineworkers. Exposure classifications, therefore, which misclassify all lineworkers into one ""telephone lineworker"" job grouping are not appropriate and future studies should concentrate on cable splicing technicians.","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Johns Hopkins University, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mice of the two myc-k transgenic lines are predisposed to B-cell lymphomagenesis and were therefore considered to be more susceptible to Akv. For comparison, the same mouse strains were also infected with the exogenous Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV). Both MoMuLV and Akv increased the tumor incidence and shortened the tumor latency period in wild-type mice and in the transgenic mouse lines. The differences in pathogenicity, number of provirus integrations, and level of virus expression between MoMuLV and Akv indicate different mechanisms of lymphomagenesis: while MoMuLV induced tumors apparently by insertional mutagenesis involving common integration sites similar to previous reports, the enhancement of lymphomagenesis by Akv seems to be directed by other mechanisms.","['GSF-Institut fur Molekulare Virologie, Neuherberg, Oberschleissheim, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sheep (M230) was injected with the cloned BLV provirus 344 and became persistently infected with circulating lymphocytes reaching 345,000/mm3. After 11 months, this infected sheep developed leukemia-lymphoma. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes at the time of tumor development and the LTR and the env gene were amplified, using the polymerase chain reaction procedure, cloned, and sequenced. Twenty independent LTR and twenty env clones were analyzed. It appeared that the in vivo mutation rate in the env gene was 0.043% (eight mutations including seven transitions out of 18,300 bp). Five point mutations (all transitions) were identified in the LTR, corresponding to 0.041% modifications (four mutations out of 9740 bp). These mutation rate values (0.043 and 0.041) were close to those due to the Taq DNA polymerase errors (0.030%). Altogether, these data demonstrate the lack of genetic variation in the LTR and the env gene during this case of BLV-induced pathogenesis in vivo. They confirm that the defectiveness of some BLV proviruses in vivo, thus, is not a mandatory step in the leukemogenic process.","['Faculte des Sciences agronomiques, Gembloux, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus replication in infected animals can be suppressed by administration of antiviral antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, or by AZT treatment, which results in partial to complete protection from neurological disease. A highly neuropathogenic chimeric retrovirus, FrCasE, which contains the envelope gene of CasBrE, induces rapid neurodegeneration within only 16 days. Here we report that this fatal disease could be prevented if a nonneuropathogenic Friend murine leukemia virus was administered to mice prior to their infection with FrCasE. This double inoculation led to a substantial reduction of the replication level of FrCasE in spleen and CNS. Only live but not heat-inactivated nonneuropathogenic virus was able to protect from FrCasE-induced neurological disease. The extent of protection was influenced by the viral envelope gene and the kinetics of replication of the nonneuropathogenic virus. These observations in addition to the rapidity of the effect make it likely that competition for replication sites through the mechanism of viral interference is responsible for the protection. Resistance was demonstrable in vivo even when the ""protecting"" and ""challenge"" virus belonged to different in vitro interference groups. However, the protection was considerably weaker than that seen between viruses belonging to the same interference group.","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA has been shown to induce complete remission (CR) in 64% to 96% of patients with APL, and with rapid resolution of the coagulopathy, which is a major cause of early morbidity and mortality. Although CRs induced with ATRA alone are usually not sustained and intensive antileukemic consolidation therapy is required to prolong remission, these findings indicate that a new approach of differentiation therapy is effective in treating patients with APL and may potentially be effective in other malignancies. The presence of the PML/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RAR-alpha) fusion gene, produced as a result of the unique chromosomal translocation in APL, is a marker of sensitivity to ATRA. Aside from the complications of hyperleukocytosis and the retinoic acid syndrome, ATRA therapy is generally well tolerated. An international study (Intergroup 0129), headed by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, is currently under way to determine further the role of ATRA in the treatment of patients with APL.

Differentiation of the human myelogenous leukemia cell line HL-60 by RA led to the finding that cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) are terminally differentiated by RA. One mechanism for the activity of RA in a variety of cell types involves the RA nuclear receptors (RA receptors [RARs] and retinoid X receptors), which have specific high-affinity binding sites for RA and some of its metabolites. Other mechanisms may also be involved in RA-induced differentiation. Recent studies suggest that RA acylation (retinoylation) may be involved in the RA induction of differentiation in leukemia cells. Combinations of RA with cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating agents led to synergistically induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. The lower doses of RA needed in combination therapy are unlikely to lead to RA resistance, a major limitation of RA therapy in APL. In vitro studies suggest that combinations of RA with either PGE or the butyric acid (BA) prodrug tributyrin (TB) may be useful in differentiation therapy for APL and other malignancies.

A decrease in plasma concentrations over time may be attributed to either upregulation of metabolism or downregulation of absorption. The effect of intravenous ATRA was examined in Rhesus monkeys to help differentiate between these possibilities and to better establish the metabolism of ATRA. Findings were consistent with a capacity-limited (saturable) elimination process. A subsequent study with Rhesus monkeys demonstrated that this capacity-limited elimination process can be induced.

Nonetheless, that experience has revealed critical information that ultimately may be generalizable to other types of cancer. Among these lessons include the observation that in APL the t(15;17) translocation appears to dominate other cytogenetic lesions, such that therapy directed against that lesion corrects the leukemic process, irrespective of the presence of other abnormalities. In addition, the concept of induced cytodifferentiation as a practical and consistently successful method of cancer treatment has been validated. Although all-trans RA itself may not prove as useful in other diseases, it is not unreasonable to expect that other retinoids (or ligands of other nuclear receptors used alone or in combination) may be effective. Finally, although the expectation of cure in patients with advanced cancers may never be realized with these compounds, they have distinct activity as cancer chemopreventive drugs, and widespread clinical testing is ongoing. Perhaps more than any other therapy, this preventive indication affords the greatest opportunity to impact favorably on public health.","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']","['CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-00764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,186,,,,,,,,,

These fusion proteins consist of a virion structural protein moiety and an enzymatic moiety such as a nuclease. Such fusion proteins can severely inhibit transposition of yeast retrotransposon Ty1, an element whose transposition mechanistically resembles retroviral multiplication. We demonstrate that expression of a murine retrovirus capsid-staphylococcal nuclease fusion protein inhibits multiplication of the corresponding murine leukemia virus by 30- to 100-fold. Staphylococcal nuclease is apparently inactive intracellularly and hence nontoxic to the host cell, but it is active extracellularly because of its requirement for high concentrations of Ca2+ ions. Virions assembled in and shed from cells expressing the fusion protein contain very small amounts of intact viral RNA, as would be predicted for nuclease-mediated inhibition of viral multiplication.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205.']","['N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA16519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-AI35282/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC42740,,,,,,,,

Results presently available indicate that the leukaemia free survival for adults autografted in first remission of acute myelocytic leukaemia (AML) is in the range of 50%, with better results achieved when using marrow purged with a cyclosphosphamide derivate: mafosfamide. Results in adult patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) autografted in first remission are in the range of 40%. In second remission, results obtained for AML and ALL in adults are in the range of 35% and 20% respectively. In children, results are better. Because ABMT can be used up to 60 years of age and because the transplant related mortality associated with autografting is much lower than the one following allografting, ABMT is now considered as a first choice therapeutic option in the absence of an HLA identical related donor, and/or in older patients.

During the 3 weeks following transplantation, acute major hepatic vascularization is observed together with portal hypertension and weight gain, ascitis and oedema of the lower limbs due to non-thrombotic obstruction of the centrilobular hepatic veins. This report summarizes the observations presented at a French symposium of France Autogreffe and Groupe d'Etude de la Greffe de Moelle osseuse. Different pathogenic processes are implicated including endothelial mechanisms due to toxic factor related to graft preparations and immunosuppressor treatments (methotrexate, cyclosporin), physical factors related to irradiation, immunological factors related to the expression of class II antigens on endothelial cells and viral factors, in particular cytomegalovirus infection. The incidence of veno-occlusive disease varies greatly from one series to another. Two French groups reported 5 and 3 cases among 1991 and 253 autologous grafts respectively (1.2 and 2.3%) while the Seattle group observed 53% among 355 consecutive grafts, although the same clinical criteria were used. Histological criteria include fibrosis around a non-thrombotic occlusion of the centrilobular veins, cytolysis and congestion of the sinuses. Other methods for diagnosis include transjugular biopsy, the suprahepatic pressure and imaging techniques. Prophylactic continuous infusion of low-dose heparin has been associated with a lower incidence. Trials using anti-tumour necrosis drugs and prostaglandin E1 have also been undertaken and show possible effects towards decreasing prevalence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hotel-Dieu, Paris.""]",,,,48,,Maladie veino-occlusive du foie apres greffe de moelle osseuse.

The latter strains had characteristics of 'typical' multidrug resistance (MDR), including the over-expression of P-glycoprotein. Encouragingly, 8-Cl-cAMP affected almost equally the growth of the chemosensitive and chemoresistant variants of both cell lines. Its activity proved to be much more elevated on cells cultivated with fresh rather than heat-inactivated calf serum. In fact, the IC50 values for B16 and B16/DXR were about 4.7 microM in fresh serum and 215 microM in heat-inactivated serum; the IC50 values for FLC and FLC/DXR were about 12 microM in fresh serum and 70 microM in heat-inactivated serum. Furthermore, experiments with B16 showed that cotreatments with isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, or adenosine deaminase (ADA) greatly reduce the activity of 8-Cl-cAMP bringing it to comparable levels in fresh and heat-inactivated serum. These results indicate that the antiproliferative effects of 8-Cl-cAMP may be due principally to metabolites formed by the enzymic activities of the serum, most probably including 8-chloro-adenosine (8-Cl-adenosine), as suggested by other authors. Moreover, the dose-response curves and the IC50 values of the latter compound for the various cell lines were compatible with those observed for 8-Cl-cAMP in fresh serum. Finally, there was no evidence that 8-Cl-cAMP, either in the presence of fresh or heat-inactivated serum, or 8-Cl-adenosine may increase the sensitivity to DXR of the MDR variants of B16 melanoma and Friend leukaemia.","['Institute of Pharmacology, Palermo University Medical School, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human T-cell leukaemias such regulators belong to diverse protein families and may normally be expressed widely (for example, Ttg-1/rbtn1, Ttg-2/rbtn2), exclusively outside the haematopoietic system (for example, Hox11), or specifically in haematopoietic cells and other selected sites (for example, tal-1/SCL, lyl-1). Aberrant expression within T cells is though to interfere with programmes of normal maturation. The most frequently activated gene in acute T-cell leukaemias, tal-1 (also called SCL), encodes a candidate regulator of haematopoietic development, a basic-helix-loop-helix protein, related to critical myogenic and neurogenic factors. Here we show by targeted gene disruption in mice that tal-1 is essential for embryonic blood formation in vivo. With respect to embryonic erythropoiesis, tal-1 deficiency resembles loss of the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 or the LIM protein rbtn2. Profound reduction in myeloid cells cultured in vivo from tal-1 null yolk sacs suggests a broader defect manifest at the myelo-erythroid or multipotential progenitor cell level.","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, TNF-resistant monocytic cell lines could be sensitized to TNF cytotoxicity by DMSO treatment. Other highly polar molecules, known to be potent differentiation inducers, showed similar effects to those of DMSO. The potentiating effect of DMSO was related neither to an up-regulation of TNF receptor expression nor to an alteration in the rate of TNF internalization and degradation. We present evidence that the TNF activities are p55 TNF receptor-mediated and are not due to insertion of TNF into lipid bilayers, an effect that could be susceptible to DMSO, as this component has been described to modify cell membrane characteristics. DMSO-induced potentiation of TNF cytostasis/cytotoxicity was restricted to myeloid leukemia cell lines. In non-myeloid cells such as fibrosarcomas, myosarcomas, thymomas, or carcinomas, DMSO was found either not to alter or to inhibit TNF-induced cell death. The latter results are in good agreement with data reported by others who suggested that DMSO could act as a scavenger of TNF-induced toxic radical formation. The potential correlation in myeloid cells between DMSO-induced changes in the cells' differentiation status and DMSO-enhanced TNF-susceptibility is discussed.","['Interdisciplinary Research Center, Laboratory of Biochemistry, Katholieke Universiteit, Kortrijk, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Stored leukaemic cells from 10 children with previously defined myeloid positive ALL were examined. A range of commercially available anti-CD13 and anti-CD33 monoclonal antibodies, directly conjugated with phycoerythrin or fluorescein isothyocyanate, or both, was used. Positively reacting cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: There was a noticeable discordance between the different commercial sources of antibody and between the two fluorochromes in their ability to detect myeloid antigens, as well as variation in the intensity of staining. For CD13, one antibody reacted with eight cases and another with only four. Similarly, CD33 was detected in all 10 cases by one antibody and in only three by another. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of any consistent pattern of results suggests that various commercial antibodies against the same CD antigen might recognise different epitopes and that the number of molecules per cell might vary from case to case. These observations partly explain the variation in reported incidence and the failure to establish the clinical importance of myeloid positivity, and they highlight the importance of standardisation in multicentre studies in which immunophenotypic data are collected.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",,,['J Clin Pathol. 1995 Feb;48(2):186.

This gene has 22 exons and spans 28 kilobases. The existence of a second genetic locus and closely related pseudogenes was ruled out by Southern analysis. Mouse tissues express two related classes of messages encoded by this single locus: a trifunctional GARS-AIRS-GART mRNA and a monofunctional GARS mRNA. These transcripts used the same set of multiple transcriptional start sites, and both used the same first 10 exons. CCAAT and TATA elements were not found for this locus. Exon 11, which represented the last coding sequence of the GARS domain, was differentially utilized for the two messages. The trifunctional mRNA was generated by splicing exon 11 to exon 12, the first coding sequence for the AIRS domain with subsequent use of a polyadenylation signal at the end of exon 22. Genomic sequence corresponding to the 3'-UTR of the monofunctional GARS mRNA was contiguous with exon 11, so that the smaller message arose from the recognition of one of the multiple polyadenylation signals present within the intron between exons 11 and 12. Hence, polyadenylation of the primary transcript at a position corresponding to an intron of the genomic locus was responsible for the generation of the monofunctional GARS class of mRNAs. This utilization of an intronic polyadenylation site without alternative exon usage is comparable to the mechanism whereby both secreted and membrane-bound forms of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain are made from a single genetic locus.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['CA 27605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['GENBANK/U20874', 'GENBANK/U20875', 'GENBANK/U20876', 'GENBANK/U20877', 'GENBANK/U20878', 'GENBANK/U20879', 'GENBANK/U20880', 'GENBANK/U20881', 'GENBANK/U20882', 'GENBANK/U20883', 'GENBANK/U20884', 'GENBANK/U20885', 'GENBANK/U20886', 'GENBANK/U20887', 'GENBANK/U20888', 'GENBANK/U20889', 'GENBANK/U20890', 'GENBANK/U20891', 'GENBANK/U20892']",,,,,,,,,,,

The enzymatic activity was purified through a combination of zinc-chelate-Sepharose column chromatography, precipitation with Fractogel TSK-AF Red and gelatin-Sepharose, and subsequent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Microsequence analysis of the NH2-terminus of the purified 45-kd proteinase revealed the sequence Asp-Ile-Ser-Lys-Tyr-Thr-Thr-Thr-, which could not be found in other proteins when searched in several protein data bases.

The proteinase, which was inhibited by chemical inhibitors of metalloproteinases, such as phenanthrolene or EDTA, is able to degrade several matrix constituents, such as collagen type IV, fibronectin, gelatin, and proteoglycans. In contrast to all known MMPs, the proteolytic activity of the 45-kd enzyme was not abolished upon incubation with recombinant tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP) 1 or 2.

Binding of SSP to the stage selector element (SSE) in the proximal gamma-globin promoter is integral to the competitive silencing of a linked beta-promoter in embryonic/fetal stage erythroleukemia (K562) cells. We now report the biochemical purification of SSP from K562 cell nuclear extract and demonstrate that the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor CP2 is pivotal to, but not sufficient for, SSP binding activity. Although addition of anti-CP2 antiserum disrupts the formation of the SSP-SSE complex in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), recombinant CP2 fails to bind to the SSE. Binding of CP2 to the SSE requires a heterodimeric partner present in K562 cells. We have defined the molecular weight of the partner protein as 40-45 kDa in UV and protein cross-linking experiments. An element analogous to the human SSE has previously been demonstrated in the chicken beta A-gene-promoter. The effects of this element are dependent on the binding of the chicken stage selector protein, NF-E4. Comparative studies between human CP2 and chicken NF-E4 demonstrate homology between the protein complexes. SSP binds to the chicken SSE and formation of this complex is ablated by the addition of anti-CP2 antiserum or a monoclonal antibody to NF-E4.

The active elements of the LCR coincide with strong erythroid-specific DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HSs). We have used 5' HS4 as a model to study the formation of these HSs. Previously, we identified a 101 bp element that is required for the formation of this HS. This element binds six proteins in vitro. We now report a mutational analysis of the HS4 HS-forming element (HSFE). This analysis indicates that binding sites for the hematopoietic transcription factors NF-E2 and GATA-1 are required for the formation of the characteristic chromatin structure of the HS following stable transfection into murine erythroleukemia cells. Similarly arranged NF-E2 and GATA binding sites are present in the other HSs of the human LCR, as well as in the homologous mouse and goat sequences and the chicken beta-globin enhancer. A combination of DNase I and micrococcal nuclease sensitivity assays indicates that the characteristic erythroid-specific hypersensitivity of HS4 to DNase I is the result of tissue-specific alterations in both nucleosome positioning and tertiary DNA structure.","['Department of Medicine, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03756.']",,,,,PMC398057,,,,,,,,

MS-209 at 1-10 microM completely reversed resistance against vincristine (VCR) in vitro in multidrug-resistant variants of mouse leukemia P388 cells (VCR-resistant P388/VCR and Adriamycin (ADM)-resistant P388/ADM) and human leukemia K562 cells (VCR-resistant K562/VCR and ADM-resistant K562/ADM). MS-209 at 1-10 microM also completely reversed resistance against ADM in vitro in P388/VCR cells, K562/VCR cells, and K562/ADM cells. In ADM-resistant P388 (P388/ADM) cells, however, ADM resistance was only partially reversed at the MS-209 concentrations tested. MS-209 enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of VCR in P388/VCR-bearing mice. When MS-209 was given p.o. at 80 mg/kg twice a day (total dose, 160 mg/kg per day) with 100 micrograms/kg VCR, a treated/control (T/C) value of 155% was obtained. MS-209 also enhanced the chemotherapeutic effect of ADM in P388/ADM-bearing mice. The most prominent effects were obtained when MS-209 was given with 2 mg/kg ADM, yielding T/C values of 150%-194% for the combined treatment at an MS-209 dose of 200-450 mg/kg. MS-209 inhibited [3H]-azidopine photolabeling of P-glycoprotein efficiently. Furthermore, the accumulation of ADM in K562/ADM cells was increased more efficiently by MS-209 than by verapamil. These results indicate that MS-209, like verapamil, directly interacts with P-glycoprotein and inhibits the active efflux of antitumor agents, thus overcoming multidrug resistance in vitro and in vivo.","['Institute of Biological Science, Mitsui Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chiba, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following steps were included in the purification pathway: Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, anion-exchange chromatography, concanavalin A (ConA) affinity chromatography, and preparative gel electrophoresis. The immunogenic fraction isolated in each step was subjected to the next step along the purification pathway. The immunogenicity of the separated fractions was measured by a lymph-node proliferation assay, which is indicative of delayed-type hypersensitivity. The final 64-kDa isolated protein of blast cells induced in BALB/c mice an efficient lymph-node proliferation response, which was detected in the regional lymph node after challenge with the final isolated protein of LB3 cells and vice versa. In addition to their identical molecular mass, both proteins were eluted from an anion-exchange column with the same NaCl concentration (0.57 M) and both expressed affinity to the ConA-Sepharose column, suggesting that they are glycosylated.

We have investigated the possible importance of loss of different segments in 77 7q- patients studied with high-resolution banding. Thirty-six were examined in our laboratory and 41 were published cases.

Further, karyotypes with complex aberrations were less frequent (p = 0.012).

Ten patients had complex translocations of the Ph chromosome while the remaining three were Ph negative. FISH analysis revealed in all 13 patients the translocation of the ABL protooncogene into chromosome 22 at band q11. Moreover, in all complex translocations but one, FISH with a chromosome 22 painting probe demonstrated on one chromosome 9 at band q34 the presence of material from chromosome 22, in addition to signals on the third chromosome involved in complex changes. Therefore, in this study complex translocations appeared as secondary changes resulting from two consecutive translocations with a total of at least four breaks. The first translocation gave rise to the standard t(9;22)(q34;q11). The second one included a break distal to the original breakpoint at band 9q34 and another one on a third chromosome. Furthermore FISH using S1 and S15 probes, mapped at band 22q11.2 or 22q12, gave evidence that in complex translocations the secondary breakpoint on der(9) was in the translocated segment 22q11-qter between bands q11 and q12. FISH analysis also disclosed the presence of material from chromosome 22 on one chromosome 9 in the three patients with Ph negative CML, demonstrating that in these cases a retranslocation between chromosomes 9q+ and 22q- had occurred. Consequently, the four-break mechanism could also be invoked for the three Ph negative CML patients.","['Istituti di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Chieti, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

According to the authors' previous tumor marker kinetic study, methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil (MF) was found to yield either a cytolytic effect in an MF-sensitive tumor cell population or a cytostatic effect in an MF-resistant population. In the latter, the suppressive effect was transient and the biologic activity resumed in one week after MF administration. METHODS: Based on this marker kinetic study, an alternating chemotherapy program was designed to study its antitumor and side effects. Methotrexate (M) (200 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (F) (500 mg/m2) were administered intravenously on day 1 followed 24 hours later by leucovorin (L) (10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hours for 6 doses). Cyclophosphamide (C) 300 (mg/m2), doxorubicin (A) (50 mg/m2), and vincristine (V) (1 mg/m2) were given on day 8. The MFL/CAV was given every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with metastatic breast cancer were enrolled; 41 were eligible. There were 5 complete and 23 partial remissions, producing a total response rate of 68%. In 15 patients with liver metastases, the response rate was 73% and the median survival 13.7 months, results superior to those previously reported for this subgroup of patients. Side effects were manageable. CONCLUSIONS: This regimen, which can be given safely in an outpatient setting, yielded encouraging response and survival rates in patients with visceral-dominant disease with poor prognoses.","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis.']","['CA-12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with two pairs of nested AML1 and ETO primers, was used to amplify the AML1/ETO fusion transcript. The Kasumi-1 cell line was used as a positive control. RESULTS: RT-PCR has a sensitivity of 0.0001% (10(-6)), corresponding to detection of 0.5 picograms of leukemic RNA in the presence of 0.5 micrograms of normal RNA. Using this approach, patients with t(8;21) (three patients with de novo AML, one with therapy-related AML, and one patient with myelodysplasia) yielded the same 222 base pair PCR product, suggesting that the breakpoints occurred at the same AML1 and ETO introns as previously reported. Three patients were still PCR-positive when in complete remission after chemotherapy and two experienced relapse. However, in another three patients with t(8;21) who were in remission for 2 months, 2 years, and 3 1/2 years, respectively, PCR was negative. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR is a sensitive method of detection of t(8;21), and is useful in the monitoring of minimal residual leukemia. As the junction of AML1/ETO appears to be constant, RT-PCR may offer a quick and accurate diagnosis of t(8;21).","['University Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplantation of malignant cells, along with normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, may contribute to relapse of disease. Therefore, a growing strategy is to subject autologous marrow to some type of purging procedure to eliminate tumor cells selectively. Transplantation of purged marrow, however, often results in a delayed engraftment associated with (specific or nonspecific) loss of normal stem and progenitor cells during manipulations related to the purging process. A new and burgeoning field in the area of clinical bone marrow transplantation is the ex vivo production of stem and progenitor cells. Several advantages accrue to this strategy. First, this technology makes it possible to expand the stem and progenitor cell population of a small volume of bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood (MPB), thus lessening the initial tumor burden to be purged. Secondly, ex vivo marrow or MPB expansion may overcome the significant problem of delayed engraftment by rebuilding the numbers of normal stem and progenitor cells necessary for both early and durable engraftment. To accomplish these and other objectives, an automated and closed, clinical-scale bioreactor system, based on continuous perfusion technology, is being developed and will soon enter clinical trials.","['Aastrom Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI 48106.']",,,,40,,,,,,,,,

Using Jurkat T leukaemic cells which express high levels of Tn antigen due to deficient Tn galactosylation, we have established the Tn antigen-mediated gene transfer and demonstrate the considerable efficiency of this approach. We used poly(L-lysine) conjugates of the monoclonal antibody 1E3 directed against the Tn antigen to deliver the luciferase and beta-galactosidase reporter genes to Jurkat cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Addition of unconjugated 1E3 reduced transfection efficiency in a concentration-dependent manner and incubation with free GalNAc abolished DNA transfer completely, indicating that gene delivery is indeed mediated by the Tn antigen. Pre-treatment of Jurkat cells with Vibrio cholerae sialidase, which uncovers additional Tn antigens, resulted in an improvement of gene transfection. Both human and chicken adenovirus particles attached to the DNA/polylysine complex strongly augmented transgene expression. When the beta-galactosidase (lacZ) gene was delivered to Jurkat cells by Tn-mediated endocytosis, up to 60% of the cells were positive in the cytochemical stain using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) as a chromogenic substrate. The efficiency of the transferrin receptor-mediated DNA uptake into Jurkat cells was comparatively low, although these cells were shown to express considerable amounts of transferrin receptor. We show here that a mucin-type carbohydrate antigen mediates highly efficient DNA uptake by endocytosis into Jurkat T cells. This method represents a 50-fold improvement of Jurkat cell transfection efficiency over other physical gene transfer techniques. Specific gene delivery to primary cancer cells exhibiting Tn epitopes may especially be desirable in immunotherapy protocols.","['Institute of Physiology, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, when there is cytogenetic reappearance of the Philadelphia (Ph1) translocation [t(9;22)(q34;q11)] along with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, especially more than 2 years after BMT, progression to hematologic relapse and acceleration of CML usually occur. An exception to this rule may be our patient, who was a 29-year old white woman diagnosed with Ph1-positive CML by cytogenetics. She was initially treated with hydroxyurea. An allo-BMT was performed 4 months after the diagnosis, while the patient was still in the first chronic phase of her disease, her HLA-identical brother serving as bone marrow (BM) donor. The conditioning regimen for BMT consisted of cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, total body irradiation, splenic irradiation, and intrathecal methotrexate. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporin A and methotrexate. Her hospital course was unremarkable and without evidence of acute GVHD. Six months after transplantation, the patient had mild chronic GVHD and was treated with azathioprine and prednisone for 6 months. A year later, she recurred with mild chronic GVHD. She was treated with azathioprine alone for 5 months. Subsequently, she received cyclosporin A and prednisone for 8 months, with resolution of her symptoms. Serial BM cytogenetic studies showed normal male donor karyotypes 12 and 24 months after BMT. At 36, 42, and 50 months after BMT, reappearance of the Ph1 was noted along with some cells with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, including t(6;14)(p21;q32). The breakpoint involvement of 14q32, the heavy chain Ig locus, in the new clone may be indicative of B-lymphoid lineage-based evolution. The abnormal clones disappeared 56 months from BMT and remained absent through 69 months after BMT. The patient has remained in hematologic remission during her entire post-BMT course. Clinically, she continues to do well without immunosuppressants at presently 69 months after BMT. The reappearance of the Ph1 chromosome could be associated with the immunosuppressive therapy given for chronic GVHD. This case supports the concept that immunologic mechanisms may be important in the eradication of CML after allo-BMT, and even cytogenetic evidence of blast crisis CML may spontaneously remit after allo-BMT.","['Department of Internal Medicine, H.

Five years and 9 months later, the patient developed thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and anemia, but bone marrow biopsies at this time demonstrated only myelofibrosis, with no blast cell population present. A polymerase chain reaction assay of a peripheral blood sample recognized the mRNA fusion region for the MLL/AF4 rearrangement, i.e., the molecular equivalent of the translocation (4;11)(q21,q23). Four weeks later, a blast cell population with AML-M1 morphology according to the FAB classification appeared in the bone marrow, and translocation (4;11) was detected by cytogenetics.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One-hundred seventy-seven patients with histologically-confirmed HCL were registered in the HCL88-A trial between December 1987 and January 1992. Inclusion criteria included no previous treatment and age less than 66 years. All patients received total doses of 3 MU of alpha-IFN daily for 12 months except for those who achieved early CR and would stop treatment after 6 or 9 months. Patients could be treated with different alpha-IFNs. At the time of the present analysis, 166 patients (93.8%) were fully evaluable. RESULTS: Treatment of HCL patients with alpha-IFN at the onset of the disease resulted in 28 CR (16.9%), 103 PR (62.0%), and 27 Minor Remissions (MR) (16.3%). Patients treated with different alpha-IFNs achieved similar results: the overall response rate (CR + PR + MR) was 92.7%, 97.2%, and 95.3% for patients treated with r-alpha-2a, r-alpha 2b, and alpha-N1, respectively. The presence of a leukemic phase and a poor performance status were associated with a statistically significant lower response rate. Patients who were randomly assigned and underwent splenectomy after achieving a PR had a better but not significant 4-year progression-free survival than cases randomized for observation (53% vs. 22%, p = 0.116). Overall, 5 patients died after study entry, with an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 96% for the entire group of 166 patients. After a mean follow-up time of 38 months, only one second malignancy has been recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Initial therapy with alpha-IFN, regardless of the type of alpha-IFN used, induces satisfactory responses in the majority of patients with HCL, but in most instances discontinuation of treatment results in recurrence of disease. In most cases alpha-IFN improves the performance status of patients and favors a satisfactory bone marrow recovery and thus could still play a role in the initial management of the disease. Although splenectomy following alpha-IFN could prolong the progression free survival, its use should be restricted to selected cases.","['Oncologia Medica, Universita di Modena, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A patient with significant hypertension developed generalized convulsions; the rest were asymptomatic. Six patients were managed with antihypertensive drugs. Four patients with hypertension had renal enlargement on the initial ultrasound scan, which returned to normal when hematologic remission was achieved. One patient without hypertension had bilateral renal enlargement, but this persisted despite achieving remission. All patients with hypertension were normotensive at follow-up 2 to 18 months after induction chemotherapy. The presence of hypertension before therapy and its association with renal enlargement suggest that the leukemic process is an important etiologic factor. In all cases therapy aggravated or unmasked the elevation in blood pressure.

Manganese only stimulated the burst in cells induced to differentiated with retinoic acid and not in undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Incubation with manganese did not result in a greater number of differentiated cells. The maximum stimulation occurred at 0.2 mumol/L manganese. Stimulation of the oxidative burst required 96 h of incubation with manganese, since cells incubated with the same levels of manganese for the last 24 h of culture did not result in any stimulation. Magnesium, present in the incubation medium at physiological serum levels (820 mumol/L) also stimulated the oxidative burst, whereas iron (0.3 mumol/L), zinc (18 mumol/L), and copper (12 mumol/L) had no effect. To determine whether manganese and magnesium stimulated the burst differently, the initial rates of superoxide anion production was determined. The initial rate of the reaction proceeded rapidly in cells incubated with manganese, whereas there appeared to be a lag before magnesium-treated cells produced superoxide anion.

LIF was originally implicated in regulating the early development of the mouse embryo because it inhibited the differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells, pluripotential cells derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst. Subsequent studies on its role in vivo revealed, surprisingly, that it is essential for the growth rather than the differentiation of the blastocyst. In vivo, overtly normal blastocysts can be produced in a LIF-deficient environment that are capable of forming viable fertile adults. However, in the absence of LIF, they fail to implant and enter into a state resembling that exhibited by blastocysts undergoing delayed implantation, which is characterized by a cessation of cell proliferation. This failure to implant occurs because the principle sites of LIF production are the endometrial glands of the uterus. These synthesize and secrete LIF at implantation, with LIF synthesis essential for implantation. Preliminary evidence indicates that LIF synthesis is required both by the uterus for it to undergo decidualization and by the blastocyst for implantation.

A decisive breakthrough was the advent of hybridoma technology, making monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) available in limitless supply. To construct reagents with selectivity for certain tumor cells, MoAbs or Fab' fragments were chemically linked to ribosome-damaging toxins derived from plants or bacteria like ricin, abrin, saporin, Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE), and diphtheria toxin (DT) to form immunotoxins, which combined the selectivity of the carrier moiety with the potency of the toxin moiety. The first generation of these immunotoxins showed impressive results in vitro but in most cases disappointing antitumour effects in animals or humans. By contrast, the second generation of immunotoxins, consisting of either A chain immunotoxins with a greatly improved stability in vivo or so-called 'blocked' ricin immunotoxins, have been demonstrated to be extremely effective in several animal models. Preliminary results of the current clinical trials suggest a possible clinical use of immunotoxins in leukemia and lymphoma patients. Genetically engineered fusion toxins have become available, which consist of a growth factor or a cytokine fused to a toxin moiety. In this paper, we will review the features of the three groups of immunotoxins which are most frequently used, i.e., ricin A chain and similar immunotoxins, blocked ricin immunotoxins, and recombinant toxins constructed with Pseudomonas exotoxin or diphtheria toxin.","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik I, Cologne, Germany.']",,,,71,,,,,,,,,

Cell exposure to verapamil caused a profound decrease in the rate of PKC down-regulation and a slower initial rate of accumulation of mature erythroid cells, whereas addition of the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 produced opposite effects. The high susceptibility of PKC-delta to calpain degradation, at concentrations of Ca2+ much lower than those required for degradation of the other PKC isoforms, may be explained by the finding that this kinase isoform is predominantly associated with the cell membrane. The different cellular localizations, as well as the different susceptibilities to calpain digestion, further support the hypothesis that in MEL cells the various PKC isoforms play distinct biological functions that are critical for the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of the cell and for its commitment to terminal erythroid differentiation.","['Institute of Biochemistry, University of Genova, Italy.']",,,,,PMC1136461,,,,,,,,

The characteristics of this inhibition against these lentiviruses are similar to those previously described for the inhibition of HIV-1 in ATH8 cells [17]. Thus, the 28-mer homo-oligomer of cytidine [S-(dC)28] was at least as effective as three anti-sense sequences targeted to the LTR, gag, and env regions of CAEV. The effectiveness of homo-oligomers of equal length was in the order C >> A > T, and a random 28-copolymer with a composition of 2C:1G was as effective as S-(dC)28. Shorter oligonucleotides were less effective (28 > 14 > 5 mers) for all base compositions tested. While replication of a simian type D retrovirus was inhibited by S-(dC)28, this compound did not inhibit the cytopathogenicity of two type C retroviruses, amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and baboon endogenous virus, when they were tested in the same cell lines used to support the replication of lentiviruses. Southern blot analysis of the high molecular weight DNA of drug-treated CAEV-infected cells showed that S-(dC)28 was acting at or before the reverse transcription step. Our present data and the earlier finding that S-(dC)28 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of the MuLV reverse transcriptase [15] suggest that S-(dC)28 is acting very early in the replication cycle of these lentiviruses. Since MuLV reverse transcriptase is inhibited in vitro, but its replication is not blocked in permissive cells, our data suggest that the phosphorothioate oligonucleotides are preventing virus attachment.","['Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Departement des Sciences Biologiques, Canada.']",['R29-60639/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Arch Virol 1995;140(4):809'],,,,,,

Intracellular THP-DOX distribution and particulary its intranuclear concentration, with or without modulators, has been measured using confocal laser microspectrofluorometry. The kinetics of intranuclear accumulation of THP-DOX (1 microM in the medium), as a function of time, were rapid in K562S and K562R cells. Maximum accumulation of THP-DOX is reached in a few minutes (K562S, 400 microM; K562R, 40 microM). The addition of S9788, cyclosporin A and verapamil (5 microM) after one hour THP-DOX incubation, led to respectively 290, 250 and 114 microM. Uptake of THP-DOX was increased in K562R cells by a factor of 7 when S9788 was added. Results obtained on THP-DOX efflux from nuclei of K562S and K562R cells, after 3 hours of incubation without drug, showed a very short T1/2 (time corresponding to 50% decrease of intranuclear concentration of THP-DOX) in K562R cells (12 min) compared to that in K562S cells (150 min). The addition of S9788, cyclosporin A and verapamil (5 microM) led to a T1/2 of 90, 30 and 20 min respectively. The T1/2 of THP-DOX was increased in K562R cells by a factor of 7.5 when S9788 was added. We tried to correlate these results with those obtained in growth inhibition study. The IC50 (concentration which induces 50% growth inhibition) of THP-DOX, corresponding to one hour THP-DOX treatment and 3 days culture of K562S and K562R cells were respectively 230 and 7000 nM, and the RI (resistance index) value is 30. The addition of S9788, cyclosporin A and verapamil (5 microM), during the one hour treatment, led to an IC50 value of 350, 2000 and 5000 nM respectively. S9788 induced an IC50 value 20 times lower than without the modulator. Our study suggests that the higher activity of THP-DOX against K562R cells in the presence of S9788, compared to cyclosporin A and verapamil, is due to a higher intranuclear THP-DOX accumulation and to a strong decrease of drug efflux from K562R nuclei. This could be explained by a higher affinity of S9788 for membrane P-glycoprotein of K562R cells and/or an additional mechanism of action.","['Laboratoire de Spectroscopie Biomoleculaire, UFR de Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finding a way to circumvent this problem is now a major challenge in oncology. Multidrug resistant CEM/VLB100 cells accumulate 10 times less vinblastine (VLB) after 30 min than their sensitive counterparts (CEM cells). At a non-cytotoxic concentration (1 mM) of sodium orthovanadate (OVN), uptake by CEM/VLB100 cells was increased 4 times while no effect was observed on CEM cells. The action on VLB uptake of OVN and verapamil (VPL), an usual MDR modulator, was additive. In CEM/VLB100 cells, OVN did not alter efflux. Its cellular mechanism of action could involve a transitory stimulation of VLB influx (x3). OVN uptake in CEM and CEM/VLB100 cells was not significantly different and reached saturation after 30 s (180 pmol/10(6) CEM cells and 150 pmol/10(6) CEM/VLB100 cells). This OVN uptake was concentration dependent. IC50 of VLB and doxorubicin were decreased by approximately 43 and 62% after 1 hour's exposure to OVN and 48 hours of culture. Under these conditions, OVN was more efficient than OVN.","['GIBSA, Laboratoire de Biochimie, UFR de Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoids elicit specific biological responses by binding to and activating nuclear receptors. Information about the metabolism and storage of vitamin A and retinoids, their plasma transport and uptake and the retinoid dose efficient on target cell had to be established because retinoic acid (RA), the natural acidic derivative of vitamin A (retinol), is likely to be a key factor during specific phases of embryonic development and maintenance of normal differentiated phenotypes in adult, so vitamin A is involved in the normal morphological differentiation of the visual system. RA appears an important agent since it induces in vitro leukemic cells from acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) to differentiate into mature functional granulocytes which lose their self-renewal ability and die spontaneously. In vivo, APL patients treated with oral all-trans retinoic acid (all-trans RA) alone achieve complete remission in 80% of the cases. APL results from a malignant process that leads to the accumulation in the blood and in the bone marrow of myeloid precursor cells characterized by an abnormal behavior and a differentiation arrest. APL is characterized cytogenetically by a t(15;17) translocation which involves both the PML gene on chromosome 15 and the RARa gene on chromosome 17 and gives rise to the PML/RARa fusion protein. The high sensitivity of the promyelocytic blasts to all-trans RA should be related to the presence in APL blast of an abnormal protein, the PML/RAR alpha. The antineoplastic effects of retinoids suggest that these drugs could be used therapeutically for the chemoprevention of cancer.","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,67,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. PATIENTS: 274 patients with a diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia in early chronic phase who were treated with interferon-alpha-based programs between 1982 and 1990. INTERVENTION: Therapy with daily subcutaneous interferon-alpha given at 5 x 10(6) U/m2 body surface area (highest dose schedule allowed on studies) or the maximally tolerated lower-dose schedule. RESULTS: Overall, 219 (80%) patients achieved a complete hematologic response and 104 (38%) achieved a major cytogenetic response (< 35% Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells). Estimated median survival was 89 months. Several pretreatment factors were associated with failure to achieve a major cytogenetic response and with worse survival. The existing prognostic models were generally predictive of which patients were likely to achieve a major cytogenetic response (P < or = 0.01) and of survival outcomes (P < or = 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified bone marrow basophilia (P < 0.01) and splenomegaly (P < 0.01) as independent poor prognostic factors for survival. Achievement of a major cytogenetic response, entered as a time-dependent variable while accounting for the other independent factors, was associated with improved survival (P < 0.001). Comparison of survival (dated from 12 months into therapy) with cytogenetic response at 12 months showed that a cytogenetic response was associated with longer survival (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Achieving a cytogenetic response with interferon-alpha therapy in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia was independently associated with improved survival when tested as a time-dependent variable in a multivariate analysis, and this association was confirmed by landmark analysis at 12 months.","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",['CA19639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This study sought to answer two questions: (a) How wide is the range of cytological features and immunoreactivity of the cutaneous infiltrates and what danger is there of misinterpretation? (b) What are the possible causes of the wide spectrum of differentiation of the cells infiltrating the skin? Skin biopsy specimens from 16 patients with myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were investigated. The diagnosis was acute myelomonocytic leukemia (M4, according to the French-American-British/FAB system of classification of acute leukemias) in eight cases, acute monocytic leukemia (M5) in four cases, aleukemic leukemia cutis as a recurrence of M2 leukemia after treatment in one case, and myelodysplastic syndrome in three cases, including one case of myelodysplasia with an excess of bone marrow blasts (RAEB-T) and two cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, one of which presented as aleukemic leukemia cutis. Reactivity with the macrophage-associated antibodies anti-CD68, Ki-M1p, and anti-lysozyme was the most consistent. However, the naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase reaction and staining with DAKO-M1, Ki-My2p, anti-neutrophil elastase, and anti-CD34 were found to be of little value for identifying the cutaneous infiltrate as myelogenous. Some antibodies (e.g., anti-S100 protein and MB2) even produced staining in a few cases that could have led to a mistaken diagnosis of histiocytic neoplasm or malignant lymphoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Institute of Pathology, University of Tubingen, Germany.']",,,['Mod Pathol. 1995 Apr;8(3):340-1.

The consequence of both these chromosomal alterations is overexpression of scl in the leukaemic cells. Despite the strong inference of a role in human T-ALL, scl has not yet been demonstrated to be causally involved in neoplastic transformation. We attempted to do this by generating transgenic mice in which scl expression was directed to the T cell lineage using the CD2 enhancer and the strong SR alpha viral promoter (CD2-scl mice). Three transgenic lines, all of which expressed the scl transgene at a high level, were bred and analysed. No alterations in T cell development were seen in the mice. Unexpectedly CD2-scl mice did not develop tumours, nor did the transgene enhance tumourigenesis by Moloney murine leukaemia virus.

We have attempted to elucidate the molecular role of EKLF in erythrocyte-specific transcriptional activation. First, in vivo and in vitro analyses have been used to demonstrate that the level of activation by EKLF is dependent on the orientation and number of CACCC elements, that EKLF contains separable activation and DNA-binding domains, and that the EKLF proline-rich region is a potent activator in CV-1 cells when fused to a nonrelated DNA-binding module. Second, we have established a transient assay in murine erythroleukemia cells in which reproducible levels of a reporter can be induced when linked to a locus control region enhancer-beta-globin promoter and in which induction is abolished when the promoter CAC site is mutated to a GAL site. Third, we demonstrate that the EKLF transactivation region, when fused to the GAL DNA-binding domain, can restore inducibility to this mutated construct and that this inducibility exhibits activator-, promoter-, and cell-type specificity. These results demonstrate that EKLF provides a crucial transactivation function for globin expression and further reinforce the idea that EKLF is an important regulator of CACCC element-directed transcription in erythroid cells.","['Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029.']",['DK46865/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC231965,,,,,,,,

The resulting lineage is dependent on the inducing agent, with a number of compounds being competent to various degrees for inducing erythroid differentiation, while the tumor promoter tetradecanoyl phorbol acetate (TPA) induces a macrophage-like morphology with enhanced expression of proteins associated with megakaryocytes. Exogeneous expression of c-myb in transfected cell lines abrogated erythroid differentiation induced by cadaverine or cytosine arabinoside as assessed by hemoglobin production.

Transfection experiments and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) using site-specific mutations correlated a loss of function with deviations from the CRE consensus sequence. Results of EMSAs in the presence of antisera against CREB, delta CREB, and CREM were consistent with the binding of CREB-like proteins to the DE1 sequence. Stimulation of alpha A-crystallin promoter activity via 8-bromo-cAMP, forskolin, or human T-cell leukemia virus type I Tax1 in transfections and reduction of activity of this site in cell-free transcription tests by competition with the somatostatin CRE supported the idea that DE1 is a functional CRE.

Unlike the conventional retroviral vectors bearing the amphotropic envelope protein, the pseudotyped virus has the ability to withstand the shearing forces encountered during ultracentrifugation. This property of the pseudotyped virus enables the generation of high-titer retroviral vector stocks and has potential application for in vivo gene therapy studies. We have found as many as four copies of a pseudotyped vector to integrate into the genome of a single cell when a high multiplicity of infection was used to infect the cells. Multiple integration events were not observed with amphotropic retroviral vectors, probably because of their low virus titers. In addition, when retroviral vectors are pseudotyped with the VSV G protein, they acquire the host range of VSV and are able to infect nonmammalian cells derived from fish, Xenopus, mosquito, and Lepidoptera. Since techniques for efficient gene transfer in some of these nonmammalian systems are not currently available, retrovirus-mediated gene transfer described here should be useful for transgenic and other genetic studies in lower vertebrate species. The inability to establish a stable cell line expressing the VSV G protein, however, limits large-scale production of the pseudotyped retroviral vectors. Generation of stable packaging cell lines for the pseudotyped retroviral vectors is a major challenge for the future.","['Department of Pediatrics, City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010.']","['CA-58317/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-20034/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-01855/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,19,,,,,,,,,

From 1985 to 1990 1612 children, comprising more than 90% of eligible cases in the UK, were treated with intensive induction therapy, central nervous system directed therapy with cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate, and continuing treatment for 2 years. 1171 children were randomised to receive additional intensification therapy at 5 weeks, 20 weeks, both, or neither. At follow-up of at least 3 years disease-free survival for all children at 5 years was 62% (95% confidence interval [Cl] 60.0-64.4), a significant improvement over the 56% (53.0-59.6) found in the preceding MRC UKALL trial. The 5-year disease-free survival was 71% (65.5-76.1) for children randomised to two blocks of intensification therapy, this being significantly better than the 62% (56.6-68.0), 61% (55.7-67.1), and 57% (50.9-62.7) rates for the groups randomised to one intensification block at 5 weeks, one at 20 weeks, and no intensification, respectively. The benefits of intensification therapy were seen irrespective of clinical factors known to influence outcome such as age, sex, and initial leucocyte count. We conclude that the addition of two courses of intensification therapy has produced a 14% improvement in disease-free survival and an 11% improvement in overall survival for the randomised patients. This additional treatment is of benefit to all children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, even those traditionally deemed at lower risk of relapse.","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",,,['Lancet. 1995 Mar 11;345(8950):653.

Retinal neovascularizations, however, are rarely seen and only found in patients with the chronic disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on the clinical course of three patients with advanced stage of proliferative retinopathy in CML. In two patients, the diagnosis of CML was established after ocular involvement. Therapy was planned according to the principles, which have proven effective in other vasoproliferative retinopathies. Eyes with neovascular changes were only treated by panretinal scatter photocoagulation of the avascular zones. In the cases with complications like vitreous hemorrhage and traction retinal detachment, vitreoretinal surgery was performed. RESULTS: Using this therapeutic principles in 4 of 6 eyes a visual acuity > 0.7 could be preserved. In three eyes impending macular involvement by traction retinal detachment was prevented. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic approach, which is valid for proliferative retinopathies of various etiology is also beneficial for ocular complications in CML.","['Augenklinik, Medizinischen Universitat zu Lubeck.']",,,,,,Proliferative Retinopathie bei chronisch-myeloischer Leukamie.,,,,,,,

In one patient, the myeloid antigens, CD13 and CD33, were negative on FCM, but apparently positive in the cytoplasm by ICC, leading to a diagnosis of AML-M0. We examined MPO with anti-MPO monoclonal antibody in four patients by ICC, and could detect 3% or more MPO positive rates in all cases. These findings indicate that immunological studies for MPO and myeloid markers using ICC are very useful for the diagnosis of AML-M0. Two of 5 patients achieved CR, but they relapsed soon or after one year, respectively. The treatment outcomes suggest that the AML-M0 is an AML subtype with poor prognosis.","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only recently have genes encoding transport proteins in some of these systems been isolated. Two genes, mCAT-1 and mCAT-2, encode related multiple membrane-spanning proteins that share substantial amino acid sequence identity and virtually superimposable hydrophilicity profiles. mCAT-1 and mCAT-2 proteins expressed in Xenopus oocytes are functionally indistinguishable and similar to transport system y+, but have distinct tissue distribution patterns. mCAT-1 expression is nearly ubiquitous and produces a single protein, while mCAT-2 is highly tissue-specific, has two distinct protein isoforms encoded by a single gene and is expressed in different tissues using at least two widely separated promoters. All three proteins facilitate the ion-independent transport of arginine, lysine and ornithine. Both mCAT-1 and mCAT-2 proteins have low amino acid sequence similarity but strikingly similar hydrophilicity profiles with amino acid antiporters, uniporters and symporters of yeast, fungi and eubacteria. Current work will elucidate whether any of the mCAT proteins interact with members of a newly identified family of single membrane-spanning proteins, such as rBAT, 4F2 and NAA-Tr, which are thought to modulate or activate y+L and/or bo,+ transport systems.","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0961.']",['GM07752/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,51,,,,,,,,,

A cytofluorometric method for measuring cell-bound IgE on individual mast cells was therefore explored using peritoneal mast cells of Sprague-Dawley rats infected with the nematode N. brasiliensis and rat basophilic leukaemia cells (RBL-1) as experimental models. We systematically studied the effects of variables such as fixation, incubation time, temperature and concentrations of antibody on the fluorescence emission of the mast cells. Optimum conditions were selected for the quantitative measurement of IgE at the single-cell level using direct labelling with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgE(Fc). Polystyrene beads with a defined fluorophor content and a fluorescent uranyl glass were used to standardise the measurement procedure. A linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and IgE concentration was obtained by fluorescence measurements on RBL-1 cells incubated in rat IgE. In the case of rat peritoneal mast cells it was possible to saturate the IgE receptors by incubating the mast cells in rat IgE. By measuring the mast cells before and after IgE incubation, the relative content of IgE, the relative number of IgE receptors and the degree of receptor saturation could be estimated. In this way we measured the IgE content of peritoneal mast cells of Sprague-Dawley rats maintained under pathogen-free conditions. The distribution of IgE content in the mast-cell populations was extremely variable. Up to 30% of the mast cells in individual populations contained little or no IgE, but very few if any of the cells lacked IgE receptors. On average, 60-70% of the receptors available for binding were occupied by IgE in these normal rats.","['Department of Pathology, Sahlgrenska Hospital, University of Goteborg, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown that, within the thymus, a population of large, immature cells expresses CD21. EBV altered the activation responses of immature thymocytes in vitro. Triggering through CD2 is mitogenic for mature, but not immature, T cells. However, during infection by EBV, ligation of CD2 caused thymocytes to proliferate in the absence of exogenous cytokines. This function was a result of the interaction of EBV with its receptor, CD21, but was caused by infection rather than surface signaling, because neither specific mAb nor the P3HR-1 strain of virus mimicked the effect of B95-8. Immature thymocytes were infected by EBV, as determined by the internalization of the viral genome and its transcriptional activity. Consistent with the activity of B95-8, EBNA-2 transcripts were identified within infected thymocyte populations. In addition, components of the viral replicative pathway were expressed during infection of thymocytes. These components included transcription of BZLF-1, an early gene that characterizes EBV-infected B cells after disruption of latency. A second transcript was identified as encoding the recently characterized RAZ, which also is associated with replicative infection. The consequences of EBV infection of T cells at an early stage of differentiation may lead to failure of normal T cell repertoire development, autoimmunity, or malignancy.","['Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO 80206.']","['AI-29704/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-AI 29903/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Low concentrations (< 1 microgram/ml) of the anti-CD3 OKT3 mAb triggered large calcium signals but not detectable increase in D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisophate (IP3) production. CD3-CD4 coligation amplified the calcium signal twofold, compared with CD3 cross-linking alone, but this protocol also did not stimulate IP3 production. At higher OKT3 concentrations (> 2.5 micrograms/ml), IP3 production was detected but was not inhibited by activating PKC with phorbol ester. In contrast, PKC activation caused a marked inhibition (53 to 64%) of the CD3- or CD3-CD4-triggered calcium signals, but had only a small inhibitory effect (20 to 30%) on the release of intracellular Ca2+. PKC activation also inhibited by 47% calcium signals triggered by thapsigargin, an inhibition that was completely reversed by addition of the specific PKC inhibitor RO 31-8220 (1 microM). Addition of 1 microM RO 31-8220 caused a twofold stimulation of CD3-induced calcium signals. This effect was not mediated at the level of Ca2+ influx, because RO 31-8220 did not significantly increase thapsigargin-triggered calcium signals. However, RO 31-8220 did slightly increase the CD3-induced release of intracellular Ca2+, suggesting that amplification of Ca2+ influx may be secondary to increased release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Our results indicate that PKC regulates TCR-mediated changes in [Ca2+]i in HPB-ALL T cells by two distinct mechanisms. First, PKC activation causes a marked inhibition of Ca2+ influx by a mechanism independent of changes in IP3 production, possibly involving inhibition of ion channels. Second, PKC activity causes a small inhibition of intracellular Ca2+ release, most likely by promoting Ca2+ sequestration.","['Department of Immunology, Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the pathway of transport, the involvement of clathrin-coated vesicles was tested. This was accomplished by comparing the traffic of wild type low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and FH 683, a mutant receptor whose endocytosis from the cell surface in coated vesicles is reduced by 90-95%. Wild type LDLR traveled from the cell surface to the sialyltransferase compartment of the Golgi with a half-time of 2.5 h in K562 human leukemia cells expressing receptor from a transfected cDNA. In contrast, FH 683 LDLR recycled to the Golgi at 33% of the wild type rate, suggesting that wild type LDLR is largely transported to the Golgi by a pathway that involves clathrin-coated vesicles. Moreover, because clathrin-coated vesicles that bud from the plasma membrane are transported to endosomes, surface-to-Golgi transport probably involves an endosomal intermediate. Finally, because there was substantial transport of mutant LDLR to the Golgi even though its endocytosis in coated vesicles was greatly reduced, there may be a second pathway of surface-to-Golgi traffic.

This has been explained by either (1) the target interference model, or (2) the effector inhibition model. In both cases, MHC class I molecules are concerned but the precise mechanisms are still unclear. The erythroleukaemia K562 cell is known as a NK-sensitive target. This sensitivity has been explained mostly as being due to lack of MHC class I antigens on the K562 membrane. However, several recent studies have indicated that the expression of MHC class I antigens on the cell does not solely explain the protection against NK cells. To elucidate the mechanism of NK-cell-mediated killing, we investigated the killing profiles of the K562 cells by NK cells. Previous studies indicated that the NK-sensitive K562 cells can express some MHC class I antigens on their surface, and become protective against NK-cell killing after treatment with human interferon-gamma (hIFN-gamma). In the present study, we show that this resistance is not rendered by MHC class I expression, because addition of anti-MHC class I monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in the killing assay of hIFN-gamma-treated K562 cells, which express MHC class I antigens as the target, did not restore the sensitivity to NK cells. Moreover, we show that spontaneously occurring K562 clones which could not express MHC class I antigens even after hIFN-gamma treatment, could be protected after treatment with the cytokine. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the susceptibility of K562 cells to NK cell killing is due to some elements distinct from those related to MHC class I antigens.","['Japanese Red Cross, Central Blood Center, Tokyo.']",,,,,PMC1415012,,,,,,,,

We investigated 181 patients with malignant lymphomas and found that 19 out of 113 ATLLs were positive for HML-1. T-cell malignant lymphomas excluding ATLL also reacted with HML-1 (7/24), but all the B-cell lymphomas 0/33) and non-neoplastic lymph node and skin lesions (0/10) were negative for HML-1. In patients with ATLL and other T-cell malignant lymphomas, the positivity level of HML-1 was relatively higher in stomach (3/7) and tonsil (2/6) than that in lymph nodes (15/100) and skin (8/47). We observed one HML-1 positive ATLL patient with tumour formation in the skin and lymphadenopathy and marked infiltration of the large intestine but minimal involvement of other organs. Although HML-1 was frequently expressed in gastric infiltration of ATLL, the level of positivity was too low in lymph nodes to support the hypothesis that HTLV-1 infected intestinal T cells are the origin of ATLL cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Pathology, Kagoshima University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

UCRBP carries a highly charged N-terminal domain and four C2-H2-type zinc fingers at its C-terminal end. The present study reveals the following results: (i) The UCR site is present in the upstream and/or regulatory regions of numerous mammalian cellular and viral genes to which both recombinant and cellular UCRBP bind. UCR sites are also found in the regulatory regions of repetitive sequences including human LINE-1 elements and mouse intracisternal-A particle sequences. (ii) By immunological and UV cross-linking experiments, we found that two proteins, of approx. 68 kDa and an antigenically related protein of approx. 40 kDa, account for much of the UCR-binding activity in T-lymphocytes. (iii) There is evidence that UCRBP acts as a phosphoprotein. Eight consensus phosphorylation sites are found in the deduced amino-acid sequence of human UCRBP. The cellular UCR-binding activity was abolished by phosphatase treatment, and there is an incremental increase in apparent molecular mass between the cytoplasmic and nuclear forms of the protein, suggesting phosphorylation. (iv) Although UCRBP has been previously shown to act as a transcriptional repressor, we show here that UCRBP can also act as a positive transactivator of a reporter driven by UCR elements when used in co-transfection assays. This transactivation occurred in a dose-restricted manner and was absent at high concentrations of a UCRBP expression plasmid, indicating a complex mode of function.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Laboratory of Molecular Growth Regulation, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present evidence that members of the fibroblast growth factor family, (FGF1 or FGF2) act directly on the neural crest cells in vitro to stimulate proliferation in the presence of serum. These findings correlate with in situ hybridisation analysis, which shows FGF2 mRNA is expressed in cells both in the neural tube and within newly formed sensory ganglia (dorsal root ganglia, DRG) at embryonic day 10 in the mouse, when neural crest precursors are proliferating within the DRG. This data infers an autocrine/paracrine loop for FGF regulation of proliferation. Evidence supporting this notion is provided by the finding that part of the endogenous proliferative activity in the NC cultures is related to FGF. It was also found, in early neural crest cultures, that exogenous FGF completely inhibited neuronal differentiation, probably as a direct consequence of its mitogenic activity. In order to stimulate neuronal differentiation significantly, it was necessary to remove the FGF and replace it with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or related factors. Under these conditions, 50% of the cells differentiated into neurons, which developed a sensory neuron morphology and were immunoreactive for the sensory markers CGRP and substance P. These data support a model of neural crest development, whereby multipotential neural crest precursor cells are stimulated to divide by FGF and subsequent development into sensory neurons is regulated by LIF or other cytokines with a similar signalling mechanism.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peak increases in cytosolic calcium were reduced by two-thirds in cells suspended in Ca(2+)-free medium, suggesting that calcium entry significantly contributes to the increases in cytosolic calcium after NPY receptor stimulation. To establish if Ca2+ entry was a direct consequence of receptor stimulation or indirectly via depletion of Ca2+ stores, the latter were totally or partially depleted by treatment with cyclopiazonic acid or alpha-thrombin, respectively, in Ca(2+)-free medium. Partial depletion markedly diminished and full depletion suppressed the NPY-induced response in Ca(2+)-free medium. After full depletion, the recovery of the NPY-induced increase in cytosolic calcium was dependent on the length of [Ca2+]e reexposure, suggesting a direct entry of Ca2+ to the storage sites followed by release to the cytosol. After partial depletion, transient reexposure to [Ca2+]e did not by itself increase cytosolic calcium levels or refill the stores as NPY stimulation did not increase cytosolic calcium if [Ca2+]e was chelated prior to stimulation. However, if partially depleted cells were exposed to NPY in the presence of readded [Ca2+]3, the peak calcium response was similar to that of control cells, indicating that partially depleted calcium stores can be refilled from extracellular sources only if NPY receptors are stimulated. Analysis of the data suggests that in HEL cells the entry of calcium and mobilization from intracellular stores are in series processes and that entry is triggered by intracellular levels only under extreme depletion, while under physiological conditions calcium entry is coupled to receptor stimulation.","['Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology Section, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction treatment (3 x 10(6) U three times weekly for 12 months) was completed in 84 cases (90%). Peripheral hematological response was observed in 76 patients. Two patients had persistent splenomegaly, and response was observed in both cases after splenectomy. Five additional patients were responsive after 18-24 months of induction treatment and 1 was unresponsive. Of 28 patients on maintenance treatment (1 x 10(6) U 3 x per week), no patient relapsed after a median follow-up of 30 months. The toxicity level was acceptable and IFN resistance was not observed. On the other hand, of 56 patients without maintenance treatment, 37 relapsed at a median of 19 months. Thirty of 32 evaluable patients remained responsive to a second course of IFN. Of 19 patients without relapse, 11 had undergone splenectomy compared to 0/37 patients who relapsed (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the study shows the following, (1) IFN, provides excellent palliation without major toxic side effects; (2) long term maintenance was well tolerated and prevented peripheral haematological relapse; (3) lack of maintenance treatment was associated with peripheral haematological relapse requiring a second treatment; and (4) certain previously splenectomized patients may not require maintenance treatment. These long term results must be compared with the effectiveness and toxicity of new drugs, such as pentostatin and 2-chloro-deoxy-adenosine.","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologic, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients aged less than 65 years, diagnosed within 6 months, were included into the trial and treated with a-IFN (3 MU/daily) for 3 additional months after the achievement of CR or for a maximum of 12 months, regardless of the quality of the response. Patients in CR could undergo splenectomy while patients achieving PR after 12 months of treatment were randomized between splenectomy and maintenance therapy. By June, 1992, the trial closed, with 182 enrolled patients. Nine were subsequently determined to be not eligible while nine additional patients were lost at follow up. One hundred and sixty-nine patients were assessable for both response and survival. At the end of the induction therapy with a-IFN (mean time of treatment 16.9 months), 29 CR (17.7%), 100 PR (61.0%), 26 minor responses (MR) (15.8%) and 9 (5.5%) treatment failures occurred. At the last follow up (March, 1993), with a mean follow up of 39 months, 5 patients had died and the overall survival rate at 4 years was 96%. Twelve patients underwent splenectomy after CR. After a mean follow up of 8.6 months, 8 relapses occurred. Thirty-one out of 100 were randomized between splenectomy (16 cases) and maintenance therapy (15 cases). The low accrual was mostly due to the rejection of randomization by the patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-seven of the 61 patients completing the intended 12 or more months of initial IFN treatment were eventually considered IFN failures. Forty-three required re-treatment (41 received a second course of IFN and 2 received pentostatin). Four patients died without further therapy for HCL. The median time to interferon failure was 31.3 months. Fourteen patients are alive and have not required further treatment after completing their initial 12 or more months of interferon. Fifteen patients underwent a third course of interferon therapy at a median time after completion of a second course of IFN of 1.0 year. Eighteen patients were eventually treated with pentostatin and ten with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA). Thirteen patients developed a second malignancy; six of these patients developed a hematologic malignancy between 44.6 months and 99.1 months after initiation of interferon therapy.

The object of this study was to ascertain the treatment preference, reasons for selection, and ramifications of these new therapies on community-based oncologists. A questionnaire study was sent to 300 medical oncologists taken from the American Society of Clinical Oncology Membership Listings for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Questions ranging from demographic information of these physicians, choice of treatment for HCL reasons for their selections and the impact of these selections on the treatment of other diseases, as well as future research on HCL were asked. Seventy-eight percent of responding physicians considered 2-CDA the treatment of choice. Belief that this was the most effective treatment was their reasoning. Eighty percent felt that further research in HCL was still beneficial and needed. Perhaps some of this was based on the response that developments in the treatment of HCL had interfaced with the potential treatments of other diseases.","['Hematologic Research Foundation, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These included 70 men and 18 women with a median age of 51 years (range 25-83). Abdominal CT scans were performed at diagnosis in 29 patients and in 59 during the course of the disease. Abdominal lymphadenopathy was documented in 25 patients (28%) overall; the incidence of abdominal lymphadenopathy was higher in relapse (56%) than at diagnosis (17%). All patients with lymphadenopathy had bone marrow disease. There is no association with age or sex but lymphadenopathy tends to be more common in patients with long-standing disease (median duration of disease 6 years v one year in those without nodes) and in patients with bulky disease, particularly in the relapse group (splenomegaly/splenectomy in 95% vs 40%). The presence of abdominal nodes is also associated with relative resistance to treatment, with more treatment failures and fewer complete responses seen in this group. Most patients with lymphadenopathy had large, immature-looking hairy cells present in both the bone marrow and lymph nodes, when these were examined. Abdominal lymphadenopathy in HCL is more common than previously recognised, particularly in relapsed patients, and is always associated with active disease. The presence of large hairy cells and the relative resistance to treatment suggest that this phenomenon represents a form of transformation of the disease. Longer follow up is required to confirm this.","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics and Diagnostic Radiology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To help discriminate between these possibilities we have examined the configuration of the IGH locus by DNA blot in 38 cases of HCL. Deletion of at least one allele of C mu/C delta was seen in 14 cases (37%). Of 12 cases in which IgG and/or IgA were expressed, three exhibited biallelic deletion of C mu/C delta compatible with deletional class-switching whereas the remaining 9 cases retained both alleles of C mu/C delta. These data indicate that both DNA deletion and RNA-splicing mechanisms of class-switching may operate in HCL. In a further 17 cases, other unexpected abnormalities of the IGH locus mapping to the JH-C mu intron in one of two patterns were observed. First, discordance between JH and C mu in BamHI DNA digests was found in 12 cases. Similar patterns were observed in only 4/91 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 0/15 of B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. To preclude chromosomal translocations involving the JH-C mu intron, rearrangements of BCL1, BCL2, BCL3, and MYC were sought in 23 cases but none of the cases showed oncogene rearrangement to the intron. Second, abnormal-sized C mu fragments arising as a consequence of abnormalities of the JH-C mu intron were detected in HindIII, BgIII, and/or Xbal digests in 10/23 cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Haddow Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a good correlation between IL-1 beta or IL-2R levels and disease activity: improved clinical status or response to different therapies were associated with decreasing IL-1 beta or sIL-2R levels. In contrast, lack of response to therapy or disease progression was reflected in increases in both IL-1 beta and sIL-2R levels.

While typical hairy cells express both the alpha and the beta chains, variant HCL express the IL2 receptor beta chain on the surface membrane but not the alpha chain. Both typical and variant HCL have mRNA transcript of the p64 molecule (gamma chain). In B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines and normal B lymphocytes the expression of the IL2 receptor alpha and beta chains is very weak or negative. Furthermore, in B-CLL the IL2 receptor gamma chain shows a weaker expression compared to HCL. Both classic and variant HCL cases appear capable of proliferating in the presence of exogenous IL2, though the proliferative response of variant HCL appears lower than that of typical cases. Since in variant HCL the IL2 receptor alpha chain could not be induced by different stimuli, it appears that the CD25 antigen may not be essential in the process of IL2-promoted growth, while p75 and p64 play a primary role in IL2 activation. Taken together, it is suggested that the expression of IL2 receptors is up- or down-regulated during the process of B-cell lineage activation and differentiation.","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",,,,21,,,,,,,,,

IFN-alpha is a multifunctional cytokine able to regulate the growth, differentiation and recirculation of normal and malignant B lymphocytes. These activities have been extensively studied in hairy cells, but none of these properties has been shown to fully account for IFN-alpha responsiveness. Numerous data now support the idea that IFN-alpha exerts its therapeutic effect both indirectly, through stimulation of immunocompetent cells, and directly on the hairy cells. Our approach to investigate the mode action of IFN-alpha in HCL has been to identify abnormalities which occur in these tumor cells and then to ascertain whether these abnormalities can be rectified by IFN-alpha treatment. A high level of free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of hairy cells was identified. Increases in cytosolic Ca2+ are believed to be a pivotal signal in regulating cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell death. These high Ca2+ levels in hairy cells could be reduced upon treatment with IFN-alpha either in vitro or in vivo, probably acting by reducing Ca2+ influx into the leukemic cells. Moreover, the effect of IFN-alpha on [Ca2+]i seems to be correlated with alteration in the pattern of kinase/phosphatase activities and with down-regulation of CD20 phosphorylation, a B cell specific phosphoprotein involved in Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane.","['Unite 365 INSERM, Institut Curie, Paris, France.']",,,,21,,,,,,,,,

In particular, HCs are motile on Vitronectin (VN), and this motility is mediated by alpha v beta 3. HCs are immobile but actively spread on Fibronectin (FN) and this response is mediated by beta 1 integrins. M-CSF enhances the mobility (chemotaxis and chemokinesis) of HCs, and this response is partly mediated by alpha v beta 3.

The incidence of the growth stimulating T cell clones derived from peripheral blood is identical in patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and healthy controls. About 50% of the clones stimulate the growth of hairy cells, but not the growth of purified B-lymphocytes of healthy donors.

DCF has been shown to induce an higher and more durable response rate than IFN, with only moderate myelosuppression and relatively few side effects. In this paper, we report our experience with dCF in a series of 38 HCL patients who had progression of their disease after IFN therapy. Serum interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIl-2R) and Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF alpha) levels were also evaluated before, both during and after treatment in order to monitor clinical response. Two schedules of treatment were employed: 23 patients were treated with the EORTC protocol and the following 15 with the NCI regimen. The overall response rate was 94.7%; no significant differences in response rates were observed between the two schedules. In respect to toxicity, we recorded nausea and in two cases a cutaneous rash. Four patients experienced localized herpes zoster and one had a fungal pneumonia. Median overall survival after therapy is 38.5 months, 55 percent of patients enrolled in the EORTC schedule and 77% of those who received the NCI program are currently in CCR at 3 years. Serum IL-1 beta and sIL-2R levels significantly decreased after treatment, while no significant changes in serum TNF alpha levels were observed. In our study, dCF was confirmed as an effective agent in HCL, inducing an high response rate with only moderate side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Dept. of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The early controversies concerning the cellular origin of the hairy cell has been clarified and is now recognized that the hairy cell of HCL is of B-lymphocyte lineage. The position of the hairy cell within the spectrum of B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative-disorders indicates that the CLL-lymphocyte is in an early stage and the hairy cell of HCL in a later stage in mature B-cell development. The hairy cell represents an activated B-CLL lymphocyte. The comparison of the immunophenotyping patterns of HCL and the other lymphoproliferative disorders is being clarified. Monoclonal antibodies raised against hairy cells or with restricted specificity for hairy cells, as well as other biological markets such as IL-2 and TNF, are being used for monitoring response to treatment and detecting minimal residual disease. In the last decade, major advances have been made in the treatment of HCL with the advent of interferon and the nucleosides. Our goal today is to achieve a complete response of prolonged or permanent duration. For this reason: Splenectomy, has only a few indications at present. After 10 years of experience with the interferons it is recognized that interferon induces a few complete responses and all patients eventually relapse. Currently the nucleosides: dCF and 2-CdA are the first line of treatment of HCL. Both drugs have acceptable toxicity and induce complete remissions in the majority of patients. However, longer periods of observation are needed to establish the duration of response and to document if any patients will attain a cure by the nucleosides. In the continuation of the progress in achieving our goals, we definitely need: better parameters for the evaluation of complete response and detection of minimal residual disease: to search for the characteristics for prediction of response to therapy; long-term randomized studies between dCF and 2-CdA as an initial therapy, as well as randomized treatment of relapsed patients to determine the incidence of reinduction or cross-resistance. Meanwhile the work has to continue with the development of newer strategies and of new drugs, if our goal of cure of HCL patients is to be attained.",['Division of Hematology/Oncology Ohio State University Hospital Columbus 43210.'],,,,95,,,,,,,,,

In this review we assess the role of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in ALL. The heterogeneity of this disease makes the analysis of treatment results in ALL difficult to interpret. There is some evidence that ABMT may be useful in second complete remission (CR) and increasing interest in ABMT as a therapeutic option in first CR in adults. At the moment there is little evidence that such an approach will have an impact in childhood ALL. ABMT is considerably less toxic than allogeneic bone marrow transplantation and the major cause of 'treatment failure' is disease relapse. There has been considerable effort put into purging autologous bone marrow of malignant stem cells but whether purging is effective remains controversial and not proven. Newer studies involving cytokines post-ABMT to stimulate an artificial 'graft versus leukaemia' effect may prove of value.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",,,,40,,,,,,,,,

They also allowed adjustment of the distance between opposing electrode faces. The electrodes were constructed in a manner that allowed cells to be deposited, by vacuum, onto each face. Electrode faces were positioned at a predetermined distance from each other to mechanically force cell-cell contact between the deposited cells.

It was shown that chromatin in normal cell composition denatured in two stages. The first stage--thermolabile domain is characterized by the transition parameters: T1d = 72, delta T1d = 6.2 degrees C, Qd = 36.5 J/g DNA, the second stage--thermostable domain: T2d = 83, delta T2d = 9.0 degrees C, Qd = 58 J/g DNA. The intraperitoneal injection of mitoxantrone to healthy mice slightly changes the structural parameters of chromatin but promotes the significant redistribution of heat between peaks, i.e. the part of heterochromatin fraction passes to euchromatin. In the case of leukemia, chromatin denatures in three stages with the following transition parameters: the first, the most thermolabile domain with T0d = 56.0, delta T0d = 5.0 degrees C, Qd = 20 J/g DNA; the second--thermolabile domain with T1d = 72.0, delta T1d = 6.2 degrees C, Q1d = 16.5 J/g DNA; the third--thermostable domain with T2d = 83.0, delta T2d = 9.0 degrees C, Q2d = 58.0 J/g DNA. It is affirmed that the first stage is connected with melting of ""naked"" DNA regions in tumor chromatin composition. The injection of mitoxantrone to leukemic mice causes such changes in chromatin denaturation parameters that curve profile becomes similar to that of normal spleen tissue. We conclude that mitoxantrone causes transformation of spleen tumor cells into normal ones in vivo.",,,,,,,Mikrokalorimetricheskoe issledovanie vliianiia mitoksantrona na DNK khromatina in vivo.,,,,,,,

HL-60 is known to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway after treatment with 13-trans-retinoic acid (13-trans-RA), whereas treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) leads to development of mature macrophages. NB4 cells are derived from the bone marrow of an acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patient in relapse, have a translocated RA receptor-alpha, and are converted into nondividing granulocytes by 13-trans-RA treatment. When HL-60 or NB4 were cultured in the presence of 13-trans-RA, IL-1 beta mRNA and protein levels were increased. In the more mature THP-1 cells which are induced to macrophage-like cells by 13-trans-RA treatment, RA was unable to induce any IL-1 beta expression, implying that the effect of 13-trans-RA is associated with granulocytic differentiation. Moreover, PMA and 13-trans-RA had a strong synergistic effect in the induction of IL-1 beta gene expression. Nuclear run-off analysis indicated that the increased IL-1 beta gene expression was due to an enhanced rate of transcription. When the cells were transfected with an IL-1 beta-X-CAT reporter plasmid containing the -2982/-2748 promoter segment of the IL-1 beta gene conferring responsiveness to PMA, both NB4 and HL-60 cells responded with increased CAT activity when stimulated with 13-trans-RA alone. In contrast to PMA, 13-trans-RA was unable to increase AP-1 enhancer activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had clonal chromosomal trisomies or translocations at diagnosis, and were treated by bone marrow transplantation (BMT), chemotherapy (CT) or interferon-alpha therapy. Metaphase-FISH was performed during therapy-induced complete haematological remission (CR) (BMT and CT patients) using biotin-labelled whole chromosome paint probes. 28% of all patients in CR were shown by FISH to have abnormal metaphase cells, and 62% of this group suffered a clinical relapse. Of those with negative FISH results (72%), 12% relapsed. In three CML patients treated with BMT a small population of t(9;22)-positive cells was demonstrated. These cells disappeared during follow-up without causing a relapse. One ALL patient had abnormal cells a short time after start of therapy but was also later found FISH-negative. Furthermore, we demonstrated that metaphase-FISH is a suitable method for quantifying the proportion of abnormal cells in CML patients during interferon-alpha therapy.

The resulting drug-resistant sublines not only expressed P-glycoprotein and the MDR phenotype but were also cross-resistant to chlorambucil, methotrexate and cisplatinum, and had increased resistance to radiation. Development of resistance was associated with an aberrant differentiation phenotype with decreased expression of myeloid antigens and expression of glycophorin A, an antigen normally associated with erythroid differentiation. The ability of HL60 cells to terminally differentiate in response to all-trans-retinoic acid (vitamin A acid) was lost in the sublines. These results suggest that either a single novel mechanism is responsible for multiple drug resistance or the initial response to drug treatment is the co-induction of multiple mechanisms. These cells and the method by which they were generated therefore provide a clinically relevant model for the study of the initial events in the development of not only multidrug resistance but also the extended multiple drug resistance usually encountered in the treatment of leukaemia.","['Neurobiology Unit, University of Technology, Sydney, Gore Hill, N.S.W., Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

When compared to 42 pre-graft patients, a decreased CFU-GM production and a defect in stromal layer (SL) confluence were found after ABMT on day 90 but also on day 365. However, these abnormalities were observed only in patients with haematological diseases and no differences between pre-graft and post-graft results were found in patients with solid tumours. Among the patients with haematological diseases, on day 90 those with acute lymphoid leukaemias showed lower CFU-GM production whereas patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas developed more frequently subconfluent or confluent SL. Other factors studied such as sex, patient age, disease status, marrow purging and post-graft administration of growth factors did not appear to influence post-graft LTMC results. Multivariate analysis including all the patients has shown (a) that solid tumours were associated with higher CFU-GM production, and (b) that conditioning regimens with total body irradiation (TBI) or busulfan led more frequently to non-confluent SL. In conclusion, high-dose therapy followed by ABMT can induce a persistent impairment of the stem cell and stromal cell compartments, particularly in patients with haematological diseases conditioned with TBI, despite the absence of any alloimmune reaction and post-graft immunosuppressive therapy.","['Department of Medical Oncology and Blood Diseases, University Hospital of Tours, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it remains unknown whether leukaemic megakaryoblasts can produce IL-3 and whether IL-3 is involved in the pathological process of megakaryoblastic leukaemia. In this study, several human leukaemia cell lines with or without megakaryocytic features, the DAMI, MEG-01, HEL, K562, HL-60 and U937, were chosen as the models. It was first demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and indirect immunofluorescence assay that IL-3 was expressed in DAMI and MEG-01 cells, but not in other cell lines, although two erythroleukaemic cells, the HEL and K562, also possess some megakaryocytic features. Interestingly, the mRNA for IL-3 receptor was detected in nearly all the cell lines except K562 cells, suggesting that expression of IL-3 and its receptor may be dissociated in most of the cell lines and that co-expression of IL-3 and its receptor exists in megakaryoblastic cell lines, the DAMI and MEG-01. Of the cell lines which did not express IL-3 under unstimulated condition, only HEL cells were able to express IL-3 mRNA after treatment with PMA for 72 h. Furthermore, the proliferation of DAMI and MEG-01 cells could be enhanced in the presence of IL-3 and suppressed by the anti-IL-3 antibody and the IL-3 antisense oligodexyonucleotides (ODNs). These findings indicate that IL-3, as an autocrine growth factor, is involved in the growth of some megakaryocytic leukaemia cell lines.","['Institut des Vaisseaux et du Sang, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant flow cytometric assays measured daunorubicin accumulation and retention. Blasts from 16/46 patient samples had detectable P-95 and had reduced accumulation of daunorubicin compared with the negative marrows. Experiments with the P-95 positive MCF-7 multidrug-resistant subline demonstrated decreased daunorubicin accumulation and retention relative to the sensitive parent line. AML blast cells positive for P-95 also demonstrated greater overall in vitro survival in the presence of daunorubicin relative to the P-95-negative samples. The expression of P-95 did not correlate with failure to achieve an initial complete remission with daunorubicin and cytarabine induction chemotherapy.

ATLS may, however, occur even in the absence of bulk disease. We present two cases which, together with a review of previously reported cases, suggest that a cause of this rare phenomenon is primary renal lymphoma which subsequently develops into the leukaemic phase. This is supported by the observation that some bone marrow aspirates which are normal at the time of ATLS have shortly afterwards demonstrated lymphoblasts. Renal biopsy may not exclude primary lymphoma of the kidney.

Several cohort studies have suggested that workers exposed to styrene in the chemical industry have increased mortality from lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer. However, this finding has not been consistent and has not been reproduced in studies of reinforced plastics manufacturers, whose exposures to styrene are generally higher. The explanation for the observed associations may therefore be confounding by concomitant exposures to other chemicals such as benzene and butadiene, which are not used in the reinforced plastics industry. Despite their large size, the published studies of mortality and cancer incidence lack the statistical power to rule out an important hazard from long-term exposure to high (> 50 ppm) airborne concentrations of styrene. However, they indicate that any risk of cancer from lower levels of exposure is likely to be small.","['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit, Southampton General Hospital, U.K.']",,,,21,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism underlying membrane electropermeabilization is still largely unknown. Evidence is presented here that electroporation under conditions compatible with cell survival induces lipid hydroperoxide formation in the membranes of animal and plant cells. Exposure to electric fields also enhanced up to 5-fold the spontaneous emission of light from both cell types, which paralleled the amount of conjugated hydroperoxides detected in cell membranes. The emitted photons were mainly in the red edge of the spectrum, suggesting the involvement of singlet oxygen. The presence of antioxidants during electroporation did not reduce the formation of hydroperoxides nor the permeability but quenched the luminescence.","['Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale e Scienze Biochimiche, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A further internal amino acid sequence, determined following cleavage of human SASP with cyanogen bromide, was also identical to the corresponding sequence deduced for ADF. Samples of SASP were able to reductively depolymerize human immunoglobulin, a property shared with thioredoxin, a ubiquitous protein, almost identical to ADF, with an essential function in many thiol-dependent reducing reactions. Furthermore, SASP purified from rat C6 glioma cells had an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence to that deduced for rat liver thioredoxin, showing that they were both members of the same family of proteins. The use of membrane-impermeable thiol reagents indicated that SASP was predominantly a cell-surface protein, and was not normally secreted.

Of a range of nucleotides tested only ADP and ATP elevated intracellular levels of Ca2+, with ADP being the more potent agonist. Ca2+ mobilization by ATP was accompanied by increased inositol phosphate production and was blocked by the purinergic receptor antagonist, Reactive Blue 2, indicating that ATP was interacting with a P2y receptor. Intracellular Ca2+ release triggered by ADP was independent of both inositol phosphate production and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Expression of the transmembrane phosphotyrosine phosphatase, CD45, had no effect on ADP-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization.

The authors conducted an historical cohort mortality study of 138,905 men employed at five large electric power companies in the United States between 1950 and 1986 with at least 6 months of work experience. Exposure was estimated by linking individual work histories to data from 2,842 workshift magnetic field measurements. Mortality follow-up identified 20,733 deaths based on 2,656,436 person-years of experience. Death rates were analyzed in relation to magnetic field exposure history with Poisson regression. Total mortality and cancer mortality rose slightly with increasing magnetic field exposure. Leukemia mortality, however, was not associated with indices of magnetic field exposure except for work as an electrician. Brain cancer mortality was modestly elevated in relation to duration of work in exposed jobs and much more strongly associated with magnetic field exposure indices. Brain cancer risk increased by an estimated factor of 1.94 per microtesla-year of magnetic field exposure in the previous 2-10 years, with a mortality rate ratio of 2.6 in the highest exposure category. In contrast to other studies, these data do not support an association between occupational magnetic field exposure and leukemia but do suggest a link to brain cancer.","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599, USA.']",,,,,,,['Am J Epidemiol 1996 Jul 15;144(2):205'],,,,,,

In the chronic phase of the disease, IL-4 inhibited spontaneous colony formation by CMMoL cells in semi-solid culture. However, in the acute phase, IL-4 promoted colony formation. These effects of IL-4 were abolished completely by the addition of anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibodies. The spontaneous colony formation by CMMoL cells in both the chronic and acute phases was inhibited by the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies. On the other hand, neither anti-IL-6, anti-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), anti-IL-1 beta nor anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) antibodies inhibited IL-4-induced colony formation by CMMoL cells in the acute phase. IL-4 suppressed the production of IL-6 by CMMoL cells in both the chronic and acute phases.

Because macrophages play a key role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, it was of interest to study the effect of 2-CdA on cellular lipid metabolism. For this purpose we have used a macrophage cell line (P388) to perform incubation studies in the presence of acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL) and 2-CdA. The addition of 2-CdA, in concentrations ranging from 5-20 nM, induced a dose-dependent decrease in cellular cholesterol content and in the amount of extracellular [14C]oleic acid (OA) incorporated into the cholesteryl ester (CE) fraction. The effect was maximized at 20 nM 2-CdA with an 86% reduction in cholesterol esterification compared to controls (P < 0.008). To evaluate the mechanism of interaction of 2-CdA with cellular lipid metabolism, deoxycytidine (dCyt) and 3-methoxybenzamide (3-MOB), substances known to antagonize the effect of 2-CdA in different ways, were co-administered with 2-CdA. dCyt, a competitive inhibitor of dCyt kinase, which catalyzes phosphorylation to the active metabolite, antagonized the effects of 20 nM 2-CdA, producing significantly greater incorporation of extracellular [14C]OA into the CE fraction than in the presence of 2-CdA alone (P < 0.0086). Co-incubation with 2-CdA and the poly-ADP-ribose synthetase inhibitor 3-MOB, which is known to render cells resistant to 2-CdA toxicity by preventing cellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)- and adenosine triphosphase-depletion, also reversed the effect of 2-CdA on lipid accumulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of these molecules was also studied in nine of these patients following the APL cells' culture with and without all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). The fresh APL promyelocytes expressed CD45RA and CD15s on their surface, while CD11a, CD11b, CD15, and CD45R0 were constantly absent. In vitro treatment with ATRA consistently increased the expression of CD15, CD11b, and CD45R0 on leukemic promyelocytes; these changes were paralleled by a decrease of CD45RA display. The expression of sialylated antigen CD15s was fully independent from CD15 suggesting a differential enzymatic regulation within this selectin ligand system. ATRA was, however, incapable of promoting the up-regulation of CD11a in APL. As a result, asynchronous phenotype (CD11a-, CD11b+, CD15+, CD15s+/-, CD45RA-, CD45R0+) was generated that is normally undetectable on maturing myeloid cells. In order to provide a further control a case of acute agranulocytosis was also investigated, in which > 75% bone marrow cells were arrested at the promyelocyte stage; these bone marrow cells showed a surface phenotype identical to non-leukemic promyelocytes (CD11a+, CD11b+, CD15+, CD45R0+, CD45RA-) with a spontaneous ability to differentiate in vivo towards the more mature stages of myeloid differentiation. We therefore suggest that in fresh and ATRA-induced APL cells distinct, regular phenotypic changes are identifiable that are probably associated with t(15;17) and not seen in normal and activated bone marrow.","['Divisione di Oncologia Sperimentale C, Immunologia, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Napoli, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experience of the Italian Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Group (AIEOP) will be presented with respect to the following aspects: 1. Incidence of APL. The incidence of APL is generally considered to account for 3-9% of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in children and approximately 10-15% in adults. Recently a single Italian pediatric institution reported that APL constituted one third of observed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (AnLL) cases. Data from the AIEOP cooperative study group have confirmed that APL in Italy is more frequently observed in children as compared to other countries. Environmental and/or genetic factors should be considered to explain such differences. 2. Diagnosis of M3v. The clinical and biological features of the largest series of childhood M3v will be presented and the problems encountered in the proper separation of 'classic' M3 and M3v in children will be discussed. 3. Clinical Aspects. The clinical features of the APL patients enrolled in the AIEOP study groups since 1989, will be presented with emphasis on the recent experience with the use of all-trans retinoic acid. 4. Analysis of PML/RAR alpha Fusion Transcripts. An RT-PCR analysis of 32 pediatric APL cases from cryopreserved bone marrow samples has been performed. It is concluded that APL in children did not differ significantly from the adult form, with the exception of a higher incidence of PML bcr3 breakpoint.","['Clinica Pediatrica Universita di Milano, Ospedale S.

Paradoxically, a hypercoagulable clotting tendency may occur in these patients during the first month of ATRA treatment. Leucocyte activation (retinoic acid syndrome), often secondary to hyperleukocytosis, is prevented by early addition of chemotherapy when WBCs exceed defined limits, and is successfully treated by high dose corticosteroids.

However, it is associated with a rapid rise in WBC in some patients, with potentially fatal ATRA syndrome. Furthermore, most patients relapse with maintenance therapy using ATRA alone or low-dose chemotherapy. The French APL group thus designed a treatment approach with ATRA followed by intensive chemotherapy. The latter was administered after CR achievement with ATRA, or was rapidly added to ATRA in the case of rapid rise in leukocyte counts. This combined approach, in a pilot study and in a randomized trial, proved superior to intensive chemotherapy alone, by slightly increasing the CR rate but more importantly by reducing the relapse rate. The French group (and other European groups) are now testing in a new randomized trial the better timing of ATRA and chemotherapy administration (ATRA followed by chemotherapy or ATRA plus chemotherapy), and the role (after an intensive consolidation) of maintenance treatment with intermittent ATRA, continuous low-dose chemotherapy, or both.","['Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Lille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate effects of change in nonspecific patient care factors over time we evaluated outcome in two temporal groups (1982-1986, 1986-1991), corresponding to two groups of treatment protocols encompassing all new de novo AML patients entered on acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) protocols during those years. Surprisingly, APL patients in the 1982-1986 group (n = 45) had much better treatment outcome (complete remission (CR) rate 71%, median overall survival (OS) 106 months, median disease-free survival (DFS) > 105 months) than the later group (n = 96) (CR rate 47%, median OS 13 months, median DFS 28 months) (p = 0.0063, 0.0015, and 0.0001 respectively). All APL patients but two in the 1982-1986 time period were treated on SWOG protocol 8124, which included induction with total daunorubicin (DNR) 210 mg/m2 i.v./course, consolidation with two courses with identical dosage of DNR, and intensification at 4 months including another course of identical dosage DNR. We analyzed factors affecting treatment outcome for all patients with APL treated from 1982 to 1991. In multivariate analysis, higher DNR induction dose was significantly associated with CR rate, OS, and DFS (p < 0.001, < 0.0001, and < 0.0001, respectively). Cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) dose and inclusion of other agents did not correlate significantly with outcome. Because these studies were not randomized for DNR dosage, other factors contributing to outcome cannot be completely excluded, although none were found. Most deaths occurred within 3 months of initiation of therapy on 8124; there were no relapses with higher DNR dosage after 3 years. This excellent outcome should be considered in evaluating newer modalities of therapy such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) for APL. If the high CR induction rate and minimal early deaths with ATRA therapy can be combined successfully with this chemotherapy, most patients with APL may be curable.","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]","['CA-12213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Newly diagnosed patients received cytotoxic chemotherapy for consolidation, and previously treated patients received extended all-trans RA therapy, or a radionuclide-conjugated monoclonal antibody as post-remission treatment. Unlike studies in Europe, full-dose chemotherapy was not given during induction for patients who developed leukocytosis. Overall, 43 of 49 newly diagnosed patients (88%) and 25 of 30 previously treated patients (83%) achieved complete remission. We did not encounter de novo resistance to all-trans RA in any patient who was positive for PML/RAR-alpha rearrangements by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. Ten patients died during induction from intracranial or pulmonary hemorrhage (six patients) or the 'retinoic acid syndrome' (four patients). The use of leukapheresis or low-dose chemotherapy (hydroxyurea or cytosine arabinoside) for drug-induced leukocytosis did not decrease early mortality. Compared to historical controls, early mortality was not affected by treatment with all-trans RA; however, both relapse-free and overall survival were significantly increased. Maintenance therapy with all-trans RA was associated with short remission duration, and relapses while taking the drug were universally associated with resistance to further retinoid treatment. We conclude that the use of all-trans RA for remission induction, with or without full-dose chemotherapy, has significantly increased the survival of patients with APL. While early mortality has not yet been reduced, the avoidance of full-dose chemotherapy during induction has significantly reduced early morbidity. The major outstanding clinical issue is the development of strategies that maximize safety in high-risk patients for whom intracranial hemorrhage remains the major cause of death.","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']","['CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

APL may be recognized by different cytological pictures: (i) Hypergranular APL, the most typical form, showing promyelocytes with cytoplasm packed with purple granules. Most of the primary granules may be incorporated into Auer rods, sometimes stacked in bundles of faggots. (ii) Microgranular APL, characterized by fine dust-like granulation in the cytoplasm; some promyelocytes may even appear agranular by light microscopy. Most of the cells show bilobed or folded nuclei, a picture which may simulate that of acute myelomonocytic leukemia. (iii) Hyperbasophilic form, characterized by cells with high N/C ratio, and strongly basophilic cytoplasm with either sparse or no granules. Conspicuous cytoplasmatic budding is usually present, recalling the feature of micromegakaryocytes. Strong positivity for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B and chloroacetate esterase represents the typical cytochemical pattern of M3; usually a weaker reactivity may be observed in M3v. However, sometimes a degree of cytochemical heterogeneity of APL cells may be observed, as suggested by cases displaying a strong sodium fluoride-sensitive nonspecific esterase reaction. Recently a distinct entity associated with basophilic differentiation has been described. Differential diagnosis of this form with M2-baso subtype and with cases of MDS or AML with basophilia (M2, M4 with t(6;9) translocation) may be obtained by the use of cytochemistry, cytogenetic investigations, and electron microscopy.","['Institute of Hematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,44,,,,,,,,,

The hemorrhagic complications have been attributed to a combination of intravascular thrombin generation, excessive fibrinolysis and/or proteolytic activities released from blast cells. Before the era of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the incidence of early fatal bleeding in recent series has ranged from 8 to 46%, and no anti-hemorrhagic treatment clearly appeared superior in abating this complication. This uncertainty is due to remain because of the lack of prospective studies. The increasing awareness of the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of APL and the larger availability of supportive therapy has largely contributed to lessen the incidence of fatal bleeding, which can be reliably estimated around 10% in major centers. Groups pioneering the use of ATRA have reported a rapid improvement of the coagulopathy of APL, usually starting 48 h from the beginning of the treatment. However, the hemostatic changes during ATRA have been monitored only in a few patients and recent results suggest that hyperfibrinolysis/proteolysis is rapidly corrected by ATRA, whereas thrombin generation may persist longer. Moreover, although significantly less frequent, fatal bleeding may occur during ATRA and thrombotic events have also been reported so that hemostatic death rate is also approximately 10% in patients treated with ATRA. The combination of chemotherapy plus ATRA administration during induction has been suggested as a useful means of controlling hyperleukocytosis, and this could contribute in abating this unacceptably high rate of early death. On the other side, chemotherapy can dramatically exacerbate clotting abnormalities leading to catastrophic clinical outcomes. Thus, more detailed studies of the coagulopathy of APL and its changes during treatment with ATRA, or ATRA combined with chemotherapy, are required in order to offer the most appropriate treatment to these patients still at risk of severe bleeding and thrombotic complications.","['Department of Hematology and Hemophilia, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.']",,,,65,,,,,,,,,

This agent is a novel and very promising therapy for this disease characterized cytogenetically by a translocation t(15;17)(q21;q22) involving the alpha retinoic acid receptor on chromosome 17 and the PML gene on chromosome 15. Clinical trials have demonstrated that ATRA followed by or combined with conventional chemotherapy may be more beneficial than chemotherapy for inducing complete remission. Unfortunately, ATRA as a single agent, does not appear able to maintain patients in remission (median 5 months), and when relapse occurs resistance to a second induction of ATRA therapy is observed in almost all cases. Recently our laboratory investigated whether specific features of the AML3 cells at relapse could explain the in vivo resistance observed. We have demonstrated that AML3 patients' cells (from four patients) at relapse show high levels of CRABP, a cytosolic retinoic acid binding protein and this protein was not detected prior to ATRA therapy. Relapse-AML3 cells (n = 12) showed reduced differentiation induction when compared with 'virgin'-AML3 cells. Results from this study suggest that CRABP could modulate ATRA cellular concentrations reaching the nucleus. This induced ATRA hypercatabolytic state should be monitored during consolidation therapy and at relapse by evaluating CRABP and RA metabolite levels, in order to detect ATRA resistance in patients with AML3.","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,34,,,,,,,,,

K. Yoshimura, K. Diem, H. Chen, and J. Tupper, J. Virol. 67:2298-2304, 1993). We determined that the MLPal site regulates transcription specifically in T cells and affects the lymphomagenicity of the MCF isolate 13 murine leukemia virus with a single enhancer repeat in its LTR. In this report, we present evidence that two different proteins, a T-cell-specific protein and a ubiquitous protein, bind the MLPal site in a sequence-specific manner. By mutational analysis, we determined that the T-cell-specific and the ubiquitous proteins require different nucleotides in the MLPal sequence for DNA binding. By competitive electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that the T-cell-specific protein that binds MLPal is identical or similar to a protein from nonactivable T cells that interacts with the binding site of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). Unlike the NFAT-binding site, however, the MLPal site does not bind proteins that are inducible by T-cell activation. We observed that the MLPal sequence is conserved in the LTRs of other mammalian retroviruses that cause T-cell diseases.

Thus, mice homozygous for the resistance allele of the Fv-2 gene are unaffected by gp55 but are susceptible to mutant glycoproteins that have partial deletions in their ecotropic domains. These and other results have suggested that proteins coded for by polymorphic Fv-2 alleles might directly or indirectly interact with EpoR and that changes in gp55 can overcome this defense. A new viral mutant with an exceptionally large deletion in its ecotropic domain is now also shown to overcome Fv-2rr resistance. In all cases, the glycoproteins that activate EpoR are processed to cell surfaces as disulfide-bonded dimers. To initiate analysis of nonmurine resistances, we expressed human EpoR and mouse EpoR in the interleukin 3-dependent mouse cell line BaF3 and compared the abilities of Friend virus-encoded glycoproteins to convert these cells to growth factor independence. Human EpoR was activated in these cells by erythropoietin but was resistant to gp55. However, human EpoR was efficiently activated in these cells by the same viral mutants that overcome Fv-2rr resistance in mice. By construction and analysis of human-mouse EpoR chimeras, we obtained evidence that the cytosolic domain of human EpoR contributes to its resistance to gp55 and that this resistance is mediated by accessory cellular factors. Aspects of host resistance in both murine and nonmurine species are targeted specifically against the ecotropic domain of gp55.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098.']","['CA47944/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA5419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC188652,,,,,,,,

To delineate the minimal receptor-binding domains, we examined the capacity of soluble envelope fragments to compete with the entry of virus particles. Amphotropic, ecotropic, polytropic, and xenotropic truncated SUs were produced by inserting stop codons in the env gene of the 4070A, Friend, MCF247 and NZB MuLVs, respectively.

Reduction of cell susceptibility to infection in the presence of SU was used as a measure of receptor occupancy.

Of interest, P55gag was produced in cells infected by a viral protease deletion mutant and by a recombinant murine sarcoma virus known to lack the protease gene. Surprisingly, our structural and immunological studies indicated that P55gag also lacks carboxy-terminal residues of CAp30. During the course of studying P55gag, we detected a new viral protein within purified virus particles that contained NCp10 tryptic peptide sequences and a CAp30 tryptic peptide lacking in P55gag.

The precise site of cleavage within Pr65gag that produces P55gag and NCRP is unknown but lies upstream of the CAp30-NCp10 junction within the carboxy-terminal domain of CAp30.

Intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation of neonatal mice with Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV greatly enhanced its leukemogenicity compared with subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation. We previously also suggested that the leukemogenicity defect of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV when inoculated s.c. may result from the inability of this virus to form env gene recombinant (mink cell focus-inducing [MCF]) virus. In this study, virus present in end-stage tumors and in preleukemic animals inoculated i.p. by Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV was characterized. In contrast to s.c. inoculation, all tumors from i.p.-inoculated mice contained high levels of recombinant MCF virus. Furthermore, Southern blot analyses demonstrated that the majority of the tumors contained altered Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV long terminal repeats. The U3 regions from several tumors with altered long terminal repeats were cloned by PCR amplification. Sequence analyses indicated that the M-MuLV 75-bp tandem repeat in the enhancer region was triplicated. This amplification was also previously observed in mice infected s.c. with a pseudotypic mixture of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV and Mo+PyF101 MCF virus. The enhancer triplication was an early event, and it occurred within 2 weeks postinfection. Recombinant MCF viruses were not detected by Southern blot analyses until 4 weeks postinfection. Thus, the M-MuLV enhancer triplication event was initially important for efficient propagation of ecotropic Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV. The increased leukemogenicity following i.p. inoculation could be explained if the triplication enhances Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV replication in the bone marrow and bone marrow infection is required for recombinant MCF virus formation.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California, Irvine 92717.']","['CA09334/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-AI07319/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC188674,,,,,,,,

This domain contains six cysteines that are highly conserved between different members of the LDLR protein superfamily, and these residues are presumed to participate in intrachain disulfide bonds. To assess the importance of each cysteine in the ALSV-A receptor, individual or multiple cysteines were mutated to alanines and the altered receptors were tested for the ability to confer susceptibility to viral infection. Receptors bearing single mutations allowed subgroup A viral entry, albeit at less than wild-type levels. Receptors containing two or three substitutions were completely inactive if one of the changed residues was Cys-35 or Cys-50. Of the altered receptors tested, the only exception to this rule was a functional receptor which lacked both Cys-35 and Cys-50, an activity that was dependent on the presence of other cysteines in this protein. Most interestingly, a receptor containing both Cys-35 and Cys-50 but lacking the other four cysteines was completely functional. These results demonstrate the importance of Cys-35 and Cys-50 for viral entry mediated by the ALSV-A receptor and show that in the presence of these two residues, all of the other cysteines in this protein can be removed without loss of this function.","['Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco 94141-9100.']",['1R29CA62000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC188671,,,,,,,,

Fusion events were observed when other human cells, including erythrocytes, were substituted for HeLa cells in the hybrids. Experiments with erythrocyte ghosts showed that the factors allowing Env/CD4-mediated fusion are located in the plasma membrane.

In this system we evaluated the effects of ionizing radiation on the signal transduction processes involved in the activation of the respiratory burst/NADPH oxidase. HL-60 cells were X-irradiated with up to 1 Gy and induced towards granulocytic differentiation by treatment with 1.25% DMSO on day 0. The expression of the formyl peptide receptor (FPR), the development of responsiveness of the cells to its ligand (f-MLP) and to 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were measured up to day 7 postinduction/irradiation. Using flow cytometry, fluorescinated formyl-hexapeptide or unlabelled f-MLP as ligands and dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR 123) as an indicator of RB activity, respectively, the acquisition of functional responsiveness to both stimuli was determined. Immature FPR were identified at day 2 after induction which responded to the agonist from day 3 on. F-MLP receptor-mediated RB oxidase activation was completely radioresistant to 1 Gy, while protein kinase C (PKC)-stimulated triggering of the enzyme via PMA was inhibited by about 50% by 0.5 and 1.0 Gy. We conclude that different signal transduction pathways as triggered by f-MLP and PMA respectively exhibit differences in radiosensitivity, with PKC subspecies and downstream responses being possible sites of radiation damage.","['Institute of Radiobiology, Federal Armed Forces Medical Academy, Munich, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the strain relatedness of Candida albicans isolated from three patients with leukemia (A, B, and C) and their bedside parents using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) by SmaI digestion, and the Southern hybridization patterns of the RFLPs by the C. albicans-specific probe RPS1. SmaI digestion and Southern hybridization by RPS1 showed identical or similar patterns among Candida isolates in patients A and his mother, although their karyotypes were different. Isolates from patients B and both parents showed identical electrophoretic karyotypes, SmaI digestion patterns, and hybridization patterns. Since electrophoretic karyotypes are more variable than RFLPs and their hybridization patterns, the identity of the last two suggests a close relatedness between strains. Our results also suggest that transmission of yeast strains may have occurred between patient A and his mother and between patient B and her parents. Isolates from patient C and her mother are thought to have originated from different strains, since different patterns were obtained in electrophoretic karyotypes, SmaI digestion patterns, and Southern hybridization patterns.","['Laboratory of Medical Mycology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,PMC263977,,,,,,,,

This enzyme is now shown to be inhibited by palmitoyl trifluoromethyl ketone (PACOCF3), arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF3), and a bromoenol lactone (BEL). Both PACOCF3 and AACOCF3 were found to inhibit the macrophage PLA2 in a concentration-dependent manner. PACOCF3 was found to be approximately 4-fold more potent than AACOCF3, with IC50 values of 3.8 microM (0.0075 mol fraction) and 15 microM (0.028 mol fraction), respectively. Reaction progress curves in the presence of either inhibitor were found to be linear, and the PACOCF3.PLA2 complex rapidly dissociated upon dilution. BEL was also found to inhibit the macrophage PLA2 in a concentration-dependent manner, with half-maximal inhibition observed at 60 nM after a 5-min preincubation at 40 degrees C. Inhibition was not reversed after extensive dilution of the enzyme into assay buffer. Treatment of the PLA2 with BEL resulted in a linear, time-dependent inactivation of activity, and the rate of this inactivation was diminished in the presence of PACOCF3. In addition, PLA2 treated with [3H]BEL resulted in the covalent labeling of a major band at M(r) 80,000. Inactivation of the PLA2 by 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) prior to treatment with [3H]BEL resulted in the near complete lack of labeling consistent with covalent irreversible suicide inhibition of the enzyme. The labeling of a M(r) 80,000 band rather than a M(r) 40,000 band upon treatment with [3H]BEL distinguishes the macrophage Ca(2+)-independent PLA2 from a previously identified myocardial Ca(2+)-independent PLA2 and provides strong evidence that the M(r) 80,000 protein is the catalytic subunit.","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Revelle College and School of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0601.']","['GM-20501/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-51606/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD-26171/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we sought to define the binding characteristics of CNTF to cultured sympathetic neurons and cell lines of neuronal origin. We report that 125I-CNTF binds to cultured sympathetic neurons, MAH, PC12, and EW-1 cells via high and low affinity receptors that can be distinguished on the basis of their dissociation constants (KD1 approximately 10(-12) M and KD2 approximately 10(-9) M). Competition experiments showed that the IC50 for rat and human CNTF were, respectively, 65 pM and 5 nM for sympathetic neurons and 75 pM and 1.2 nM for EW-1 cells. Interestingly, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) did not compete for CNTF binding even at 100 nM concentration. The binding of 125I-CNTF to sympathetic neurons involved all three components of the CNTF receptor complex, namely CNTFR alpha, LIFR, and gp130, as shown by cross-linking experiments. CNTF and LIF treatments down-regulated CNTF binding to sympathetic neurons and EW-1 cells, suggesting that heterologous ligands can regulate CNTF receptor levels, which may in turn modulate the efficacy of CNTF in vitro and in vivo.","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York 10591.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important competing risk for the appearance of soft tissue tumors appeared to be the occurrence of skeletal malignancy, and at the highest injected activity (104 kBq kg-1), kidney and liver failure brought about the death of both of the two dogs in this group. Thyroid and liver were the only soft tissues that exhibited greater concentrations of 241Am than the skeleton. Liver tumors were associated with 241Am exposure (p < 0.001), but the thyroid tumor rate was not increased significantly in the irradiated animals (p > 0.10) as compared with the occurrence in controls. There was a greater relative occurrence of all vaginal tumors in control animals than in dogs given 241Am, a situation also found for all tumors of the pancreas, skin, testis, and mammary glands and for malignant ovarian tumors.

All these MDR cell sub-lines were obtained by drug selection and were compared with their sensitive counterparts and with the hamster LR73-R cell line obtained by transfection of mouse mdrl cDNA. All MDR cell sub-lines obtained by drug selection displayed decreased DNA Feulgen stainability as compared with their respective sensitive parental cell line, a phenomenon not observed in the transfected LR73-R cells. Nuclear texture analysis on G0/G1-selected cell nuclei revealed 2 types of textural phenotype. The first phenotype was characterized by chromatin decondensation with small but compact chromatin clumps, and was observed in drug-selected P-gp-mediated MDR cells (CEM-VLB, HL60-Vinc, K562-Dox) and in the non-P-gp-mediated MDR HL60/AR cell line. The second phenotype was characterized by a condensed and homogeneous chromatin pattern, and was observed in the at-MDR CEM-VMI cell line. LR73-R cells transfected with mdrl cDNA did not display any significant changes in textural phenotype as compared with sensitive LR73 cells, suggesting that P-gp over-expression alone cannot account for the cytological modifications observed in MDR cells. These data suggest that multidrug resistance could be associated with specific nuclear morphological changes which appeared to be a consequence of alterations occurring during selection by cytotoxic drugs rather than of P-gp over-expression.","['GIBSA, Department of Biology, Institut Jean-Godinot, Reims, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are, however, a few instances where a role in early pregnancy has been established. First, preimplantation conceptuses of ruminant ungulate species, such as cattle, sheep and goat, secrete a unique Type I interferon (IFN-tau). By mechanisms that are still unclear, IFN-tau prevents the destruction of the corpus luteum and hence ensures the continued production of progesterone which is essential for continuation of pregnancy. Most like the IFN-tau prevent lutcolysis by modulating the output of a luteolytic hormone, prostaglandin F2 alpha, from the uterus. Depsite this involvement in pregnancy, the IFN-tau possess similar antiproliferative and antiviral activities to other Type I IFN, 1 lambda e.g. IFN-alpha. There are 4-5 genes for IFN-tau in sheep and cattle whose promotor regions are highly conserved and distinct from those of other Type I IFN. These genens are not virally inducible and are expressed only in the trophectoderm (outer epithelium of the developing placenta) from the time of blastocyst hatching to implantation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a multi-functional cytokine which is expressed by uterine endometrium of pregnant mice around day 4 of pregnancy. Female mice lacking a functional LIF gene are fertile but their blastocysts fail to implant, strongly implicating the cytokine in maternal control of implantation. Colony stimulating factors (CSF) are a family of proteins (GM-CSF, CSF-1, G-CSF, and IL-3) that stimulate the cellular proliferation and induction of terminal differentiation of hemopoietic progenitor cells. CSF-1 is expressed in the uterine endometrium of the mouse and human during early pregnancy and its receptor, fms, is present on trophoblast. The osteopetrotic mouse, which represents a natural ""knockout"" of the CSF-1 gene, exhibits a low rate of fetal implantation and poor fetal viability. It seems likely that CSF-1 expression by the uterus influences growth and differentiation of the placenta. Although different species may utilize different strategies for ensuring developmental and endocrinological coordination between the embryo and the mother, these three examples illustrate that cytokines are likely to be major participants as autocrine factors that direct the events of early pregnancy and not simply as modulators of the maternal immune system.","['Department of Animal Sciences, University of Missouri-Columbia 65211.']",['HD 21896/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,92,,,,,,,,,

The human ISPK-1 cDNA was cloned from T-cell leukemia and placental cDNA libraries and mapped to the short arm of the human X chromosome. Single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis identified a total of six variations in the coding regions of the PP1 genes: two in PP1 alpha at codons 90 and 255; one in PP1 beta at codon 67; and three in PP1 gamma at codons 11,269, and 273, respectively.

But the survival times showed a considerable range in each FAB-subgroup with 0-154 months in RA or 0-52 months in CMMOL. To forecast life expectancy more precisely, a scoring system was developed using nine histopathological parameters, among which the three most important ones were determined: quantity of myeloblasts, myelofibrosis and ALIP's. The scoring system allows a determination of three risk groups with significantly different survival times. It is valid also for patients without increase of myeloblasts (< 5% myeloblasts in the bone marrow) and identifies high-risk MDS patients in this group. By this proposed scoring system, a prognostic approval in primary MDS can be achieved applying histopathology without regarding further methods herewith presenting a system which could be considered independently from hematologic, cytological or laboratory data.","['Pathologisches Institut, Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, we have investigated the role of T lymphocytes in this disease by cloning pre-treatment HCL T lymphocytes and testing their influence on the in vitro growth of BFU-E from autologous post-treatment and normal donors T-lymphocyte depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC-T). Altogether, 24 CD4+/CD8- and 17 CD4-/CD8+ T-lymphocyte clones from 3 different HCL patients were tested. All were found to enhance the growth of BFU-E, the degree of enhancement being independent of the length of IFN treatment at the time of the post-treatment sampling. Likewise, no difference in the extent of enhancement was seen between CD4+/CD8- and CD4-/CD8+ clones, or whether the clones were tested for modulation of BFU-E from PBMNC-T of autologous or allogeneic origin. Finally, no differences could be observed between different patients in the extent of clonal enhancement. These findings, which are in line with our previous ones in normal donors, indicate that the T-lymphocyte function with regard to regulation of the erythropoiesis is normal in HCL, arguing against a T-lymphocyte mediated suppression of the erythropoiesis in HCL.","['Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several studies have indicated that MOLT-4 human lymphoblastoid cells exposed to various agents, including VP16, display some apoptotic characteristics in the absence of either internucleosomal ladders or production of apoptotic bodies. The present study records that, in the presence of aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA), internucleosomal ladders were detected in DNA isolated from VP16-treated MOLT-4 cells; a paradoxical result in view of inhibition by ATA of nuclease activity in cell free preparations. The activity of ATA in mediating genomic fragmentation was dose- and time-dependent. Moreover, addition of ATA to VP16-treated MOLT-4 cells also resulted in production of apoptotic bodies, this effect being quantified by morphological examination and flow cytometry. Detection of ladders and apoptotic bodies after addition of ATA was not attributable to increased toxicity in cells exposed to the combined treatment relative to VP16 alone. A similar response, that is the appearance of both internucleosomal fragmentation and apoptotic bodies, occurred after exposure of MOLT-4 cells to the mitotic inhibitor podophyllotoxin. The consistent association between internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA and formation of apoptotic bodies exhibited during death of MOLT-4 cells, insofar as both characteristics are either present or absent following different agents, suggests interdependence.","[""Childrens Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, Sydney, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The putative receptor for the zymogen exhibits low affinity for the ligand (dissociation constant of 0.38 microM and a high binding capacity (40,000 sites per cell). Plasminogen also binds in a cooperative fashion to type I collagen with an affinity which is higher than that displayed by cells. Collagen-bound plasminogen can be activated by cells preincubated with plasminogen in a manner that cells develop the capacity to adhere to type I collagen. The activation of collagen-bound plasminogen by cellular urokinase-like plasminogen activator (u-PA) was 60% more efficient than the activation of the soluble (not bound) form of plasminogen. These results suggest that in the invasive phenomena, WEHI cells operate as carriers of plasminogen from plasma to tissue. In addition, collagen can serve as a reservoir of zymogen in the extracellular matrix milieu through direct binding to plasminogen and at the same time allow more efficient plasminogen activation.","['Instituto de Nutricion y Tecnologia de los Alimentos (INTA), Universidad de Chile, Santiago.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell lines have been used extensively in these studies to define erythroid adhesion events. In this study, we compared the adhesion to both fibronectin and macrophages of MEL cells and primary fetal liver erythroblasts. The avidity of MEL cells for purified mouse fibronectin was greater than that of the primary cells. In addition, we have shown that MEL cells carry ligands/counter-receptors for sialoadhesin (Sn) and the erythroblast receptor (EbR), two hemagglutinins expressed by hematopoietic stromal macrophages. These two macrophage-binding activities were independent of erythroid fibronectin-binding activity. Proteolysis of MEL cell surface receptors was necessary to reveal these activities, with this process providing a means for using MEL cells as ligand cells in studies of macrophage hemagglutinins. While erythroid adhesion to fibronectin and components of the extracellular matrix may be of importance in early erythropoiesis, hemagglutinin-expressing stromal macrophages provide the appropriate microenvironmental niche for the terminal stages of erythropoiesis preceding the release of enucleated cells into the circulation.","['Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusion protein exhibits an elevated tyrosine kinase activity as compared to normal ABL. Using a temperature sensitive mutant of p210 BCR-ABL (ts-p210) we find that the primary effect of BCR-ABL expression in an IL-3 dependent cell line is to prolong survival following growth factor withdrawal; only a small proportion of cells remain viable and rapidly evolve to complete growth factor independence. During passage in the presence of IL-3 at the temperature permissive for kinase activity, ts-p210 expressing cultures become dominated by completely growth factor independent cells within 10-30 days. There is also a significant difference between BCR-ABL and IL-3 mediated signalling with respect to the MAP kinase pathway; in contrast to IL-3 stimulation or v-ABL expression, BCR-ABL does not signal ERK 2 (MAP 2 kinase) activation, underlining the apparent inability of BCR-ABL to deliver an immediate proliferative signal in Ba/F3 cells. Our data suggest that growth factor independence does not simply reflect the convergence of BCR-ABL and IL-3 mediated signalling pathways and its development, at least in Ba/F3 cells, requires prolonged exposure to BCR-ABL kinase activity. We suggest that the myeloid expansion characteristic of CML may result from the prolongation of survival of myeloid progenitor cells under conditions of limiting growth factor rather than their uncontrolled proliferation.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",,,,,PMC395564,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively evaluated 157 instances of bronchoscopy carried out on 142 immunocompromised patients, with both BAL and TBB performed in every case. Immunosuppressant conditions were HIV infection (79), hematologic malignancies (36), and antirejection therapy in renal transplant recipients (27). Transbronchial biopsy provided a diagnostic yield significantly higher than that obtained by BAL in all categories investigated; diagnostic rates were 77.3% for TBB and 47.6% for BAL (p < 0.001) in patients with HIV infection, 55 and 20% (p < 0.001) in patients with hematologic malignancies, and 57.5 and 27.2% (p < 0.001) in renal transplant recipients. Looking at the whole series, the diagnostic rates of TBB and BAL were 67.5 and 36.3%, respectively (p < 0.001), with a total additional yield of 33% provided by TBB, while in only 2% of cases BAL gave rise to diagnostic information not achieved by TBB.

During the follow-up period 36 patients died, death of 33 patients being related to the underlying disease. A strong positive correlation (P < 0.01) was found between the length of survival of the patients and the initial CP values.

The sigma-1-like nature of [3H](+)-pentazocine-binding sites was confirmed by competition studies which revealed high affinity for haloperidol and enantioselectivity for (+)-pentazocine over (-)-pentazocine. Interestingly, human MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma showed little or no specific binding of [3H](+)-pentazocine, suggesting the absence of sigma-1 receptors in this cell line. All cell lines examined expressed a high density of sigma-2 receptors with Kd values for [3H]DTG ranging from 20 to 101 nM and Bmax values of 491 to 7324 fmol/mg protein. Competition studies indicated possible heterogeneity of sigma-2 receptors. While sites labeled by [3H]DTG in all cell lines tested exhibited affinity for haloperidol and preference for (-)-pentazocine over the (+)-enantiomer, human cell lines generally showed 4- to 7-fold lower affinity for haloperidol and approximately 10-fold lower affinity for (-)-pentazocine compared with the rodent cell lines. The high density of sigma-1 and sigma 2-binding sites in these cell lines suggests important cellular functions in cancer, as well as potential diagnostic utility for tumor-imaging agents which target sigma sites. These cell lines may be useful as model systems in which to study the functions of sigma sites in normal tissues, as well as their possible role in tumor biology.","['Unit on Receptor Biochemistry and Pharmacology, National Institute of Diabetes Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The beneficial effect of endocrine therapy is, however, hampered by the occurrence of resistant clones evolving under selective GC pressure. To delineate molecular mechanisms of GC resistance, we PCR amplified, cloned, and sequenced GC receptor (GR) transcripts and gene segments from a GC-resistant subclone of the human acute leukemic cell line CCRF-CEM, termed CEM-R6. Our analyses revealed that one GR gene allele harbored a point mutation (L753F) previously shown to compromise GR functions in other CCRF-CEM derivatives. On the second allele, we identified an A to G point mutation in the 3'-splice junction of intron G. As a consequence, a cryptic splice site 8 base pairs downstream within exon 8 is recognized, which leads to an 8-base deletion in the GR mRNA, resulting in reading frame shift and 2 consecutive in-frame preterminal stop codons. Translation of this mutant mRNA would produce a truncated GR protein missing 93 amino acids of the ligand-binding domain and expressing 9 altered residues at its new COOH terminus. In concert with the L753F mutation on the other allele, this molecular defect explains the GC-resistant phenotype and provides further evidence for mutational GR gene inactivation as a mechanism for human leukemic cells to escape GC-induced apoptosis.","['Department of Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity transiently increases within 30 min after camptothecin treatment. This increase is followed by a rapid inactivation of the cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase that is associated with Cdc2 tyrosine phosphorylation without any change in Cdc2 or cyclin B1 protein levels. The DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin abrogates camptothecin-induced changes in cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity, indicating that DNA replication-induced DNA damage is essential for both Cdc2 alterations and apoptosis activation. Apoptosis and the initial cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activation were amplified using synchronized S-phase cells, and cyclin A/cdk2 kinase did not change under these conditions. The same transient activation and subsequent inactivation of cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase were observed after DNA damage by etoposide or bis-(2-chloroethyl)methylamine hydrochloride. These observations suggest that DNA damage promotes the transient and unscheduled stimulation of cyclin B1/Cdc2 kinase activity in HL60 cells prior to apoptosis.","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, the only previous epidemiologic study investigating cancer risk among patients splenectomized because of trauma reported no increased cancer risk. In contrast, several investigations have suggested that splenectomy in patients with Hodgkin's disease increases the risk for secondary leukemia independent of treatment. METHODS: To evaluate the cancer risk of patients who underwent splenectomy after traumatic rupture of the spleen, 1103 patients were identified between 1977 and 1989 through Danish hospital discharge records. Another 5212 splenectomized patients also were identified to perform additional analyses for assessing cancer risk subsequent to splenectomy for nontraumatic indications including benign and malignant conditions. Cancer occurrence was determined by performing a linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. For comparison, expected numbers of cases of cancer were calculated from national cancer incidence rates. RESULTS: The number of cancer cases observed among posttraumatic splenectomized patients matched the expected number (relative risk = 1.0; n = 20; 95% confidence interval = 0.6-1.6) in an average follow-up of 6.8 years. Additional analyses identified possible excesses of a number of site-specific neoplasms among certain subgroups of patients undergoing splenectomy for nontraumatic reasons, but the numbers in the subgroup analyses were small. CONCLUSIONS: No increased risk for cancer was observed among patients who underwent splenectomy because of trauma. However, an increased risk for some specific cancer sites was found in patients who underwent splenectomy for nontraumatic reasons, although the effect of treatments for underlying disease and lifestyle habits such as cigarette smoking could not be ruled out in explaining these excess risks.","['Division for Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['N01-CP-85639-04/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A high incidence of leukemic transformation was found among patients with PV or ET treated with an alkylating agent, carboquone (CQ). The study was conducted to assess the causal relationship between CQ and leukemic transformation of PV and ET. METHOD: Twenty-seven patients with PV and 29 with ET diagnosed from January 1975 to August 1993 and whose clinical course could be followed comprised the members of this retrospective study. The patients were examined for the treatment administered, hematologic data, vascular complications, malignancies including leukemia, and eventual outcome. RESULTS: Eighteen patients with PV and 16 with ET were treated with CQ. The follow-up was 51-209 months for patients with PV and 28-176 months for those with ET. Three patients with PV (17% of those treated with CQ) and 5 with ET (31% of those treated with CQ) had subsequent transformation to acute leukemia. The median period until transformation of patients with PV was 94 months, whereas the median follow-up of patients without transformation was 146 months (P < 0.01). The median total days of CQ administration and the median total dose of CQ were 2022 days and 1226 mg, respectively, for the patients with transformation and 1051 days (P < 0.05) and 435 mg (P < 0.01), respectively, for those without transformation. Likewise, the median follow-ups for patients with ET with or without transformation were 130 and 90 months, respectively; the difference was insignificant. The median total days of CQ administration and the median total dose of CQ were 2075 days and 1019 mg, respectively, for patients with transformation and 571 days (P < 0.05) and 231 mg (P < 0.01), respectively, for those without transformation. These observations suggest that CQ may be involved in the leukemic transformation of PV and ET. The subtypes of leukemia transformed from PV corresponded to M2 in two patients and to M4 in one. All five patients with ET were found to have megakaryoblastic features at transformation, and three were diagnosed as having leukemic subtype M7. Chromosomal abnormalities were found in all five patients (two PV and three ET) examined after leukemic transformation, showing multiple and complex abnormalities in four. CONCLUSION: Showing that both the total days of CQ administration and the total dose of CQ were larger for patients with PV or ET whose disease subsequently transformed to leukemia, with this study, a possible causal role of CQ in leukemic transformation of PV and ET is suggested.","['Division of Hematology, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital, Yokohama, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Seventeen patients had early chronic phase CML, 3 had late chronic phase, 2 had accelerated phase, and 1 had blastic phase. The median age was 44 years (range, 14-71 years), median platelet count was 402 x 10(9)/l, and median leukocyte count was 86 x 10(9)/l.

We classified the patients into four types on the basis of their clinicopathological features (HTLV-I associated lymphadenitis, incipient ATLL, ATLL with complete HTLV-I provirus, and ATLL with defective HTLV-I provirus.

For detection of doxorubicin (DOX) resistance and reversal of this resistance by PTX, the incorporation of nucleic acid precursor was measured after addition of DOX and PTX, respectively. The effect of PTX on the induction of DNA strand breaks by DOX was also examined. Increased fragmentation of DNA was illustrated in P388/DOX leukemia cells exposed to the combination of DOX and PTX. The most prominent feature of the multidrug-resistant cell is the reduced accumulation of the drug intracellularly. P388/DOX cells showed less accumulation of DOX in the cell as compared to that of the parental cell line. Further studies demonstrated that PTX significantly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of DOX in both the cell lines.

Apart from its antihypertensive property, reserpine also possesses transquillising and vasodepressor action, hence it is employed as supportive therapy in the treatment of cardiac disorders. Doxorubicin is a potent anticancer agent, the use of which is limited by its cumulative dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. Epirubicin is a derivative of doxorubicin having more favourable therapeutic index than doxorubicin and possessing less hematologic and cardiac toxicity at comparable doses. The data presented in this paper show the effect of reserpine as a chemosensitizer, when used in combination with epirubicin on P388 murine leukemia cells sensitive (P388/S) and resistant to doxorubicin (P388/DOX) cells. Inhibition of 3H-TdR incorporation into DNA was used as an index of the cytotoxic effects of drug when used alone or in combination. The combination of reserpine (1 microM) and epirubicin (1.7, 8.6 and 17.2 microM) indicated a significant enhancement in the DNA biosynthesis inhibition in P388/S and P388/DOX cell lines. The most prominent feature of the multidrug-resistant cell is the reduced accumulation of the drug intracellularly. P388/DOX cells showed less accumulation of epirubicin in the cell as compared to that of the parental cell line. Further studies demonstrated that reserpine significantly enhanced the intracellular accumulation of epirubicin in both the cell lines. The nature of DNA damage caused by the combination of reserpine and epirubicin was irreversible when studied in P388/DOX cell line. The combination of reserpine (5mg/kg) and epirubicin (1mg/kg) significantly potentiated the antitumor activity of epirubicin in P388/DOX tumor bearing mice. These studies suggest that reserpine can be used as an adjuvant in the cancer chemotherapy to potentiate the antiproliferative activity of anticancer drugs.","['Chemotherapy Division, Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our initial studies involved using normal donor tissue (i.e., normal blood donors for ALL and cadaver renal transplant donors for normal pancreatic tissue) and cultured malignant cell lines. It occurred to us that normal pancreatic tissue from the same patient source as that of the malignant tissue might subtract out normal sequences more readily and enrich clones unique to pancreatic adenocarcinoma because of patient/donor identity. Using such a method meant that the amounts of tissue for overcoming this obstacle. We constructed independent UNI-ZAP-XR cDNA libraries (normal and malignant) and used them to amplify either the normal or malignant cDNA prior to subtractive hybridization. We then obtained rescued single stranded cDNA from the malignant ZAP library. The RNA which was not hybridized was isolated. The process was repeated and a double subtraction was effected. The residual non-hybridized RNA was used as a template for first and second strand synthesis. After the EcoRI adaptors were ligated to the double stranded cDNA it was cloned into Lambda ZAP II arms to form a double subtracted malignant cDNA library. A subtracted probe was prepared from the double subtracted cDNA library. Single stranded cDNA was rescued, double stranded plasmid was made, the plasmid DNA was digested with EcoRI, the digested DNA was run on a 1% SeaPlaque gel, and the insert cDNA was recovered using Ultra-Free MC and Ultra-Free Probind filters. The subtracted malignant cDNA library was probed with the subtracted probe and with normal cDNA (obtained from the normal ZAP library) and those plaques which were positive per the subtracted probe and negative per the normal cDNA were isolated; their cDNA inserts are being further characterized.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been reported that, along with its differentiation activity, ATRA causes apoptosis in the acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. In this study we attempted to test whether ATRA is also able to induce apoptosis in fresh leukemic cells from M3-ANLL patients. Our results indicated that although morphological differentiation was detectable in 9/9 M3-ANLL samples after in vitro exposure to ATRA 10(-6) M, the percentage of apoptotic cells in the treated samples did not significantly differ from that obtained in controls (13.1% vs 9.4% respectively, after 8 days exposure).

Quantitative abnormalities of T-cells have been previously reported in B-CLL, although the relationship between such abnormalities and the incidence of infection still remains to be established. We therefore enumerated lymphocyte subpopulations in 22 patients with B-CLL grouped according to the number of infective episodes in the previous three years. No significant differences were found between the patient groups and the mean number of T-cells subsets (helper, suppressor, suppressor-inducer and suppressor effector) or NK cells, but patients with frequent infections were found to have significantly higher CD5+ B-cell counts. Thus, we confirm that T-cell subpopulations are numerically altered in patients with B-CLL, but found that such changes are not predictive of susceptibility to infection.

Dysregulation of cellular gene transcription by viral proteins is an emerging paradigm for molecular pathogenesis of disease. A recent example is the parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) gene, which has been implicated in the hypercalcemia of ATL, and is transactivated by the HTLV-1 tax and HTLV-11 tax proteins. PTHrP is expressed at high levels in leukemia cells derived from ATL patients, as well as in asymptomatic HTLV-1 positive carriers. This article reviews the interaction of the HTLV-1 transcriptional regulator tax with the PTHrP promoter. Tax mediates its effects on PTHrP via cellular transcription factors AP-2 and AP-1, and transactivation via an AP-2 motif represents a novel interaction of tax with a cellular transcription factor.","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90048.']",,,,52,,,,,,,,,

The breakpoints in this translocation have been characterized at the molecular level, and the genes involved are AML1 on chromosome 21 and ETO (eight twenty one) on chromosome 8. AML1 has homology to the alpha subunit of the murine polyoma enhancer binding protein, pebp2, and to the segmentation gene, runt, of Drosophila melanogaster. ETO, also called MTG8 (myeloid translocation gene on 8) has no overall homology to known proteins, but it contains two DNA-binding zinc finger motifs and several regions that are proline- and serine-rich. Both AML1 and ETO are thought to be transcription factors because the motifs they contain are found in other transcription factors. Both genes are transcribed from telomere to centromere, and cytogenetic analysis of variant translocations has shown that the critical junction always conserved is on the derivative 8 chromosome. The rearrangement between the two chromosomes results in a fusion gene that contains the 5' region of AML1 including that homologous to runt fused to almost all of ETO. The fusion transcript from the der(8) chromosome is consistently detected in patients with the t(8;21). The translocation can be detected at the molecular level with selected genomic DNA probes from chromosome 21 and from chromosome 8 near the breakpoint in 80-100% of the t(8;21) patients at diagnosis and in relapse, and with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in all of the patients at diagnosis and in long-term remission.

In this study, antisense c-myc ODN cellular uptake in elevated extracellular calcium was increased up to 48-fold in the four cell lines examined. The role of calcium in ODN cellular uptake was examined using a 21-base ODN complementary to the c-myc proto-oncogene and the Rauscher cells. Cells were pretreated with uptake inhibitors in either 1.8 (physiologic) or 5.4 mM calcium prior to addition of (32P) labelled ODN. In physiologic calcium conditions, ODN cellular uptake was partially dependent on cellular energy and a trypsin-sensitive surface protein. In contrast, in the presence of elevated (5.4 mM) extracellular calcium, trypsinization and metabolic inhibition had a reduced and no effect, respectively, on uptake. Endocytosis and lysosomotropic inhibitors did not decrease uptake in either calcium concentrations. Therefore, the mechanism of ODN uptake may depend on the level of extracellular calcium. Furthermore, surface binding accounted for approximately 60% of total uptake in both physiologic and elevated calcium concentrations, suggesting that the increased uptake was not due exclusively to increased surface binding. Thus, the predominant mechanism of ODN uptake may depend on the extracellular calcium concentration.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, University of California, San Francisco 94143.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these treatments have been limited to young patients due to the increased risks of regimen-related toxicities and mortality with age. Several investigators have recently published the upper age limit for autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) in AML because of encouraging results. The results of ABMT for AML were studied in 111 patients > or = 50 years of age intensified in first remission. Median age at transplant was 53 years (range, 50 to 63 years). Fifty patients were conditioned with total body irradiation and 61 with polychemotherapy: 23 with busulfancyclophosphamide, 11 with the University College Hospital (UCH; London, UK) regimen, 6 with BAVC, and 21 with various other treatments. Marrow was purged in only 11 cases. Results were compared with 786 ABMTs performed for AML in patients between 16 and 49 years of age (median, 35 years). For AML in first remission, the probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 4 years was 34% +/- 5% for patients aged 50 years or more and 43% +/- 2% for patients less than 50 years of age (P = .004), with a survival probability of 35% +/- 6% and 48% +/- 2%, respectively (P = .004). The probability of relapse was not significantly different between the two groups (52% +/- 7% v 50% +/- 2%), but transplant-related mortality was significantly higher in the older age group (28% +/- 5% v 14% +/- 2%; P < .0001) and mainly due to infectious complications. In a multivariate analysis, age less than 50 years was a favorable risk factor for LFS, treatment-related mortality (TRM), and survival but not for relapse incidence. These data suggest that ABMT should be considered in older AML patients.","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some PT-LPDs regress after a reduction in immunosuppression, while others progress in spite of aggressive therapy. Previously defined morphologic categories do not correlate with clonality, and neither morphology nor clonality has reliably predicted the clinical behavior of PT-LPDs. We investigated 28 PT-LPD lesions occurring in 22 patients for activating alterations involving the bcl-1, bcl-2, c-myc, and H-, K- and N-ras proto-oncogenes and for mutations involving the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We correlated the results of these studies with the morphology of the lesions, their clonality based on Ig heavy and light chain gene rearrangement analysis, and the presence and clonality of EBV infection. We found that the PT-LPDs are divisible into three distinct categories as follows: (1) plasmacytic hyperplasia: most commonly arise in the oropharynx or lymph nodes, are nearly always polyclonal, usually contain multiple EBV infection events or only a minor cell population infected by a single form of EBV, and lack oncogene and tumor suppressor gene alterations; (2) polymorphic B-cell hyperplasia and polymorphic B-cell lymphoma: may arise in lymph nodes or various extranodal sites, are nearly always monoclonal, usually contain a single form of EBV, and lack oncogene and tumor suppressor gene alterations; and (3) immunoblastic lymphoma or multiple myeloma: present with widely disseminated disease, are monoclonal, contain a single form of EBV, and contain alterations of one or more oncogene or tumor suppressor genes (N-ras gene codon 61 point mutation, p53 gene mutation, or c-myc gene rearrangement). The PT-LPDs are divisible into three categories exhibiting distinct morphologic and molecular genetic characteristics. Alterations involving the N-ras and c-myc proto-oncogenes and the p53 tumor suppressor gene may play an important role in the development and/or progression of the PT-LPDs.","['Department of Pathology, New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, NY 10021.']",['EY06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with normal BCPs, we found increased hsp27 expressions (M2 isoform) (by a factor 5 to 9 of mean level) in c-ALL as well as in non-c-ALL (nonleukemic) precursors. Though increased phosphorylation of hsp27 (M3 isoform) was observed in BCPs from c-ALL patients at relapse (by a factor 3 of mean level compared with normal BCPs and precursors from c-ALL at diagnosis), which might represent a differential enzymatic activity, this was not distinguishable from that of non-c-ALL patients. Therefore, our studies suggest constitutive differences of hsp27 isoforms between pediatric leukemic BCPs and their relatively low-expressing, immunophenotypically normal bone marrow counterparts. In light of the occasional and possibly transient increase of hsp27 expression during nonleukemic BCP differentiation and the possible role of hsp27 in signal transduction to microfilaments, these differences might be of considerable biologic interest and of importance in future studies of regulated normal or dysregulated leukemic hematopoietic cellular differentiation.","['University Department of Medicine and Hematology, Aarhus Amtssygehus, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blasts were assayed for dihydrofolate reductase and MTX transport by flow cytometry using the fluorescent methotrexate analog, PT430 (Rosowsky et al, J Biol Chem 257:14162, 1982). In contrast to tissue culture cells, patient blasts were often heterogeneous for dihydrofolate reductase content. Of the 19 specimens at initial diagnosis, 7 exhibited dual blast populations, characterized by threefold to 10-fold differences in relative dihydrofolate reductase; the dihydrofolate reductase-overproducing populations comprised 12% to 68% of the total blasts for these specimens. Remission duration intervals for patients exhibiting dual blast populations were notably shorter than for patients expressing a single blast population with lower dihydrofolate reductase ( < or = 9 months v > or = 15 months, respectively), a difference that was statistically significant (P = .045). There was no apparent correlation between expression of increased dihydrofolate reductase at diagnosis and known patient and disease prognostic features (immunophenotype, age, sex, and white blood count). For the relapsed patients, 4 of 10 exhibited dual lymphoblast populations with elevated dihydrofolate reductase. The majority of the patient lymphoblast specimens were entirely competent for MTX transport and, likewise, expressed immunoreactive reduced folate carriers by indirect immunofluorescence staining with specific antiserum to the transporter. Three patients (2 at relapse and 1 at diagnosis) exhibited heterogeneous expression of imparied MTX transport (14% to 73% of blasts). In only 1 of these patients did the majority of the lymphoblasts (73%) show impaired MTX transport and for this specimen, immunoreactive carrier proteins were virtually undetectable. These results suggest that heterogeneous expression of elevated dihydrofolate reductase and impaired MTX transport are important modes of resistance in childhood ALL patients undergoing chemotherapy with MTX and that these parameters may serve as predictive indices of clinical response to MTX.","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Michigan Cancer Foundation, Detroit 48201.']","['R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although conventional cytogenetic methods are useful for diagnosing this disease, difficulties are experienced in detecting residual disease among those patients who have achieved remission. In this study, we used the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method to attempt to detect residual leukemic cells in 10 APL patients in clinical remission. The duration of remission ranged from 2 to 93 months at the time of study. Multiple bone marrow samples were analyzed by FISH in most patients. In 6 patients, no cell with t(15;17) was found. These patients remain in complete remission at present (approximately 25 to 33 months since first studied by FISH). In 4 patients, low frequencies of cells with t(15;17) were observed in at least one bone marrow sample examined. All of these patients relapsed within 1 to 14 months. No cell with t(15;17) was identified by the conventional G-banding method in any sample. The FISH results correlated well with that of a two-round nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay that was performed on the same samples. Thus, our study suggests that FISH is potentially a useful tool for detecting residual APL cells and for identifying patients at high risk of relapse.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']","['CA 43585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have determined the pattern of p55c-fgr protein expression in normal human hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues at the single-cell level using immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent techniques. We show that p55c-fgr expression is developmentally regulated with high-level expression first evident at the myelocyte stage of myeloid differentiation. In addition, we show that p55c-fgr is expressed in circulating B lymphocytes isolated from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients but is not expressed in normal circulating B lymphocytes. Surprisingly, p55c-fgr is also expressed in a subpopulation of normal B lymphocytes, the mantle zone B lymphocytes. This demonstration that p55c-fgr is expressed in a normal B-lymphocyte subpopulation suggests that its expression in certain B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders may be an indirect consequence of, rather than a primary cause of, the neoplastic transformation process.","['Department of Medicine, Jewish Hospital at Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO 63110.']",['K08 HL02709/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the compelling epidemiological association of SCL/tal expression with T-ALL, no specific transforming function has been attributable to the protein product. However, investigators have recently demonstrated that forced overexpression of SCL/tal can block monocytic differentiation of M1 murine myeloid leukemia cells. Thus, inappropriate expression of wild-type SCL/tal protein may in part account for the maturation arrest phenotype observed in T-ALL cells. In this study, ectopic expression of the SCL/tal gene blocked the differentiation of C2C12 muscle precursor cells. Characterization of the mechanism of differentiation blockade showed that the SCL/tal protein repressed transcriptional activation by the myogenic bHLH factor MyoD. Protein interaction analysis showed that SCL/tal and MyoD compete for common partners (E bHLH proteins) but do not directly bind one other. A model is thus proposed in which ectopic SCL/tal protein, by its ability to titrate out E proteins, prevents the formation of bHLH complexes that drive cellular differentiation: the ""Id-like"" mechanism.","['Institute of Pathology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106-4943.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the utilization of common receptor subunits may explain in part overlapping biologic functions, mechanisms by which unique actions are mediated remain obscure. We examined growth factor-induced macrophage differentiation in M1 leukemia cells that simultaneously display receptors for interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and Oncostatin-M (OSM). Differentiation induced by all three factors was associated with decreased expression of transcription factors myb and SCL, increased expression of macrophage markers, and suppression of proliferation. Cell lines were established in which SCL expression was enforced. In the absence of growth factors, cells were indistinguishable from parental cells. However, LIF (or OSM)-induced macrophage differentiation was perturbed; there was failure to undergo morphologic differentiation, disturbed expression of lysozyme and Mac1 alpha, and failure to suppress proliferation. Surprisingly the perturbation of macrophage differentiation did not apply to induced expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptors. This dissociation of elements normally coordinated in a macrophage differentiation program applied at a clonal level. There was no disturbance of IL-6-induced macrophage differentiation. These data directly implicate SCL in components of the macrophage differentiation program (suggesting that LIF receptor/gp130 heterodimers utilize an SCL-inhibitable pathway while gp130 homodimers do not) and demonstrate differential-regulation of components of the mature macrophage phenotype.","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['CA 22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now characterized further the process of HPR-induced cell death. We report that inhibitors of RNA transcription and of protein synthesis, activators of protein kinase C (PKC), inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, Zn++, and the antioxidants acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, and deferoxamine suppressed HPR-induced apoptosis. HL60 cells induced toward monocytic differentiation by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin-D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], but not those induced toward the granulocytic differentiation by ATRA, showed reduced responses to HPR. The transport of HPR by cells with different sensitivity to the retinoid, however, was similar, even after treatment with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which induces unresponsiveness to HPR. The expression of the apoptosis-related genes bcl-2, p53, and c-myc was examined to determine their role in HPR-triggered cell death. The levels of bcl-2 mRNA were markedly diminished by 24 hours of HPR treatment in all cell lines except in the relatively HPR-insensitive line K422. However, probably because of its long half-life, bcl-2 protein levels were either unchanged or only slightly decreased. Downregulation of p53 mRNA was also observed within 24 hours of HPR exposure in NB4 but not K422 cells, but no changes in the amount of p53 protein were found. Suppression of c-myc transcription was observed in all cells except K422. The protective role of bcl-2 on cell death by HPR was investigated in HL60 as well as 697 pre-B leukemia and Jurkat T-acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) cells constitutively expressing high levels of bcl-2 proteins due to gene transfer manipulation. Compared with control cells, the onset of apoptosis in these cells with deregulated bcl-2 production was delayed by at least 24 hours. These findings establish that cell death by HPR requires RNA transcription and protein synthesis and is regulated by the activation of PKC. Although changes in bcl-2, p53, and c-myc expression are found in cells treated with HPR, the time-course of these events suggests that HPR-triggered apoptosis is not directly controlled by these genes. Finally, while ectopic overexpression of bcl-2 does not protect cells from death by HPR, it markedly delays its onset.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Istituto Nazionale Tumori, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']","['CA-47956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic abnormalities provide important prognostic information in CLL and may show its molecular heterogeneity. A search for oncogene abnormalities continues, although no consistent defects have been identified. New agents such as fludarabine produce high complete remission rates and have generated interest in earlier treatment as a first step in a potential cure. Fludarabine also makes autologous bone marrow transplant feasible as a consolidation therapy. Immunologic abnormalities and minimal residual disease persist in most patients in remission. Combining fludarabine with other active agents and devising effective postremission strategies may change the natural history of CLL.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",,,,177,,,,,,,,,

It is concluded that in bovine leukosis infected herds the performance of the AGID test is extremely impaired by the use of the tie-in housing system, as well as by a combined effect of tying in and parturition. Therefore, during the leukosis eradication and qualification of herds kept in a tie-in system, ELISA is the method that can be used, instead of AGID, with satisfactory efficacy even for the testing of sera.","['Central Veterinary Institute, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus we describe clinical signs of AML M3 that could be divided into three main groups: bleeding, infections and anemia. In patients with bleeding or anemia or with infections repeating within a short period or with an infection and concurrent signs of bleeding or anemia the complete blood cell count should be examined immediately. If blood cell count abnormalities are found the patient should be sent immediately to hematology unit for further examination and treatment. Early diagnosis enables to start ""differentiation therapy"" with all-trans retinoic acid that could be administered as monotherapy only in patients with leukocytes below 5 x 10(9)/l.

IL-2 inhibits the GVHD-inducing activity of donor CD4+ cells without inhibiting their graft-vs.-leukemia effects. Since CD4+ T-lymphocytes produce a variety of cytokines, some of which have recently been implicated in the pathogenesis of GVHD, we have studied the possible effect of IL-2 administration on serum levels of various cytokines. Acute GVHD was induced in lethally irradiated B10 mice by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with MHC-mismatched allogeneic (A/J) BMC and splenocytes. TCD B10 (host-type) BMC were coadministered to maximize the protective effect of IL-2. Serum cytokine levels were compared in recipients of these inocula with or without a protective course of IL-2 treatment. A marked increase in serum IFN-gamma levels was noted on days 3 through 5 post-BMT in GVHD mice compared with syngeneic BMT control recipients. This GVHD-induced rise in serum IFN-gamma was markedly inhibited in IL-2-protected mice. Murine IL-2 levels were only slightly increased in sera of GVHD mice, and were not influenced by treatment with human recombinant IL-2. Serum levels of the monokines TNF-alpha and IL-1 alpha showed variable early elevations in GVHD mice with or without IL-2 treatment, and were not different from levels observed in syngeneic controls. Serum levels of IFN-gamma, IL-1 alpha, and TNF-alpha all declined markedly by day 7 to 8 post-BMT, when GVHD mortality begins. Administration of neutralizing anti-IFN-gamma mAb did not attenuate and tended to accelerate GVHD mortality, and administration of exogenous IFN-gamma did not overcome the protective effect of IL-2 against GVHD. Together, our results indicate that GVHD is associated with high serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines in the first week post-BMT, but that these levels decline by the time when GVHD mortality begins. IL-2 specifically inhibits the GVHD-associated production of IFN-gamma, but this inhibition in itself does not explain and may even mitigate the protective effect of IL-2 against early GVHD mortality. However, the demonstration that IL-2 markedly inhibits the production of a GVHD-associated cytokine raises the possibility that alterations in the production of as yet undefined cytokines may be responsible for IL-2-induced GVHD protection.","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston 02129.']",['R01AI31158/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It accounts for a 5-10% case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Patients age is usually over the fifth decade, the disease is 4.1 more common in males. More than 80% are B-lymphocytic derived cells showing a post-thymic phenotype. Median survival of B-PLL patients is 3 years, while only 7 months in T-PLL. Standard therapy of CLL with alkylating agents and prednisone have been not much effective in the treatment of PLL with a response rate of about 20%. Up to date no ideal treatment is available for PLL. A realistic goal is probably to achieve a clinical course transformation, from aggressive to mild, thus changing from short to long term prognosis. For this purpose the initial therapeutic approach cannot be limited to a single agent only. Splenic irradiation, intensive anthracyclines-based regimens, leukapheresis combine together represent the best therapeutic choice. Alkylating agents with or without prednisone may play a role in keeping indolent clinical course.

The data of Southern blot analysis showed that 47% of the mutants induced by 2 Gy in the cells without low-dose preexposure were of the deletion or rearranged mutations type. In contrast, in the low-dose radioadapted cells the proportion of this type of 2-Gy-induced mutations decreased to 28%. This is close to the control level (22%) of spontaneous mutations.

Study participants (N = 42) received allogeneic BMT for either acute or chronic leukemia. Analyses using Cox proportional hazards regression indicated that quality of bone marrow graft match was the only disease, treatment, or demographic variable significantly associated with post-BMT survival (p = .05).

The major sources of synthesis of CNTF are Schwann cells and astrocytes, but it remains unclear how much CNTF is released from these glial cells and by what mechanism. In vitro, CNTF supports the survival of all classes of peripheral nervous system neurons plus many CNS neurons, induces neurite outgrowth, promotes a cholinergic phenotype in sympathetic neurons and arrests division of neuronal precursor cells.

By employing a murine cDNA probe, we have isolated a gene encoding human TPO from a human genomic library. The TPO locus spans over 6 kb and has a structure similar to that of the erythropoietin gene (EPO). Southern blot analysis of human genomic DNA reveals a hybridization pattern consistent with a single gene locus. The locus was mapped by in situ hybridization of metaphase chromosome preparations to chromosome 3q26-27, a site where a number of chromosomal abnormalities associated with thrombocythemia in cases of acute myeloid leukemia have been mapped. A human TPO cDNA was isolated by PCR from kidney mRNA.

To perturb this lineage in transgenic mice, the tsA58 mutation of the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen was targeted to megakaryocytes using the platelet factor 4 promoter. Ten of 17 transgenic lines generated exhibited low platelet levels, each line displaying a distinct, heritable level of thrombocytopenia. Within a line, the degree of the platelet reduction correlated directly with transgene zygosity. The platelet level could be further reduced by the inactivation of one copy of the endogenous retinoblastoma gene. Western blot analysis detected large tumor antigen protein in the most severely affected lines; less affected lines were below the level of detection. Platelets and megakaryocytes from thrombocytopenic mice exhibited morphological abnormalities. Mice with either normal or reduced platelet levels developed megakaryocytic malignancies with a mean age of onset of about 8 months. There was no correlation between severity of thrombocytopenia and onset of malignancy.

Induction of these genes is mediated, at least in part, through Tax-dependent posttranslational activation of NF-kappa B, typically heterodimers of p50 (NF-kappa B1) and p65 (RelA). The preexisting NF-kappa B proteins are retained in the cytoplasm of cells by association with inhibitory ankyrin-motif-containing I kappa B proteins, primarily I kappa B-alpha but also including the precursor proteins p105 (NF-kappa B1) and p100 (NF-kappa B2). Here we demonstrate the existence of a previously undescribed multimeric cytoplasmic complex in which NF-kappa B dimers are associated with the p100 inhibitor in a manner dependent on the precursor protein's ankyrin domain. We also demonstrate an antagonistic effect of the Tax protein on the cytoplasmic sequestration function of p100; this in turn leads to nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B dimers liberated from multimeric complexes. Tax may exert these effects through the physical association with p100. Tax also relieves the p100-mediated inhibition of DNA binding by p50-p65 heterodimers in vitro.

Stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia cells by antigen or by photolytic uncaging of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate induced transient increases in nuclear and cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations.

However efficient utilization of these methods is often hampered by the paucity of leukemic cells during clinical remission, the variability of cell cycle length and tissue culture conditions. Therefore the detection of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia by cytogenetic methods requires a preselection of material to be examined. In this preliminary report analyzable metaphases could be obtained in cultured cells from a colony assay for malignant peripheral B cell progenitors, whereas in marrow samples direct or 24 hours G-banding technique had failed to reveal metaphases in common Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia patients during complete remission. It is believed that in common Acute lymphoblastic Leukemia patients this B cell colony assay permits the clonal expansion of residual circulating cells linked to malignant clone that are not detectable by classic hematologic and cytologic methods. In addition, this culture procedure substantially improves the sensibility of cytogenetic approach to the study of minimal residual disease in acute lymphoblastic leukemia during complete remission.","['Instituto Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Pisa.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Friend leukemia cells (FLC) resistant to high concentrations of doxorubicin (DOX-RFLC3) or daunorubicin (DNR-RFLC3) (1771 and 1543 fold resistance respectively) express less than 10 fold resistance to aclarubicin (ACR). In these cells, the intracellular accumulation of ACR is similar in sensitive and resistant cells. Resistance to ACR was not observed in either DOX-RFLC1 or DNR1 with a lower level of resistance (27 fold). Increased expression of a 170,000-dalton surface antigen (gp-170) was found to be correlated with the level of resistance. However, when the selective agent in ACR, despite the low level of resistance (2.8 fold) both high expression of gp 170 and resistance to DOX (77 fold) or DNR (62 fold) are observed. It is assumed therefore that induction of multidrug resistance phenotype can be achieved by compounds which do not display cross resistance with DOX or DNR. Reduced levels or absence of cross-resistance can be related to the electrical charge of the compound. This assumption is supported by further studies on DOX-sensitive or -resistant human K562 cells exposed to another non-positively charged anthracycline, KRN 8602. In the continuous presence of drug, K562/DOX were less resistant to KRN 8602 (2.9 fold) than to DOX (31 fold). After short time exposure followed by growth in drug-free medium, absence of cross-resistance to KRN 8602 has been observed in K562/DOX. Furthermore, accumulation experiments showed that high intracellular drug concentrations were rapidly achieved (within 15 min) in both DOX-sensitive and -resistant cells. In cells exposed to DOX, DNA single-strand break (DNA-SSBs) frequencies were related to time and drug concentration while those produced by KRN 8602 or ACR were maximal after short time incubation. DNA-SSBs produced by these anthracyclines are not repaired when cells are incubated in drug free medium. In DOX resistant cells, DNA-SSBs produced by DOX were repaired whereas those produced by ACR or KRN 8602 were not. It is suggested, therefore, that absence of cross resistance to various anthracyclines is related to differences in the chemical electrical charge, which may influence drug accumulation and DNA repair in resistant cells.","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, ICIG, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: After induction treatment with daunorubicin and cytarabine, patients who had a complete remission received a first course of intensive consolidation chemotherapy, combining intermediate-dose cytarabine and amsacrine. Patients with an HLA-identical sibling were assigned to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation; the others were randomly assigned to undergo autologous bone marrow transplantation (with unpurged bone marrow) or a second course of intensive chemotherapy, combining high-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin. Comparisons were made on the basis of the intention to treat. RESULTS: A total of 623 patients had a complete remission; 168 were assigned to undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, and 254 were randomly assigned to one of the other two groups. Of these patients, 343 completed the treatment assignment: 144 in the allogeneic-transplantation group, 95 in the autologous-transplantation group, and 104 in the intensive-chemotherapy group. The relapse rate was highest in the intensive-chemotherapy group and lowest in the allogeneic-transplantation group, whereas the mortality rate was highest after allogeneic transplantation and lowest after intensive chemotherapy. The projected rate of disease-free survival at four years was 55 percent for allogeneic transplantation, 48 percent for autologous transplantation, and 30 percent for intensive chemotherapy. However, the overall survival after complete remission was similar in the three groups, since more patients who relapsed after a second course of intensive chemotherapy had a response to subsequent autologous bone marrow transplantation. Other differences were also observed, especially with regard to hematopoietic recovery (it occurred later after autologous transplantation) and the duration of hospitalization (it was longer with bone marrow transplantation). CONCLUSIONS: Autologous as well as allogeneic bone marrow transplantation results in better disease-free survival than intensive consolidation chemotherapy with high-dose cytarabine and daunorubicin. Transplantation soon after a relapse or during a second complete remission might also be appropriate.","['Department of Hematology, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.']",,,"['N Engl J Med. 1995 Jun 22;332(25):1718; author reply 1718-9.

Binding of IL-1 to its receptor is associated with phosphorylation of various cellular target proteins, most of which are unidentified. The kinases responsible for target protein phosphorylation after IL-1 stimulation are also still not completely understood. We report here that IL-1 induced activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in primary monocytes and in the human monocytic leukemia cell line U-937. Activation of MAP kinase was followed by activation of MAP kinase-activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2, a serine/threonine kinase, leading to subsequent phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein [27-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp27)]. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 triggered by IL-1 was both dose and time dependent. IL-1 failed to phosphorylate Hsp27 when cells had been previously deactivated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as genistein. In those cells, however, Hsp27 phosphorylation could be reconstituted when activated immunoprecipitated MAP kinase or purified MAPKAP kinase 2 was added. Phosphorylation of Hsp27 could also be inhibited when NaF, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor, was omitted. Taken together, our findings indicate that IL-1-induced intracellular signaling pathways converge in the activation of MAP kinase and MAPKAP kinase 2 and the subsequent phosphorylation of Hsp27.","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the best known mechanisms is linked to the genic amplification or the overproduction of a membrane glycoprotein, GP170, that is the product of the gene MDR1. The existence of drugs (calcium blockers, cyclosporine, tamoxifen, reserpine, quinidine) able to bind themselves to gp170 and to paralyze its activity in vitro is well known. We studied 20 pediatric patients (median age 9 years) affected by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma, in advanced stage of disease. We employed in all cases the association of cytostatics with verapamil (50-70 mg/m2 i.v.) and cyclosporine (5-8 mg/kg i.v.) with different infusion schedules. In leukemias we administered vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), and daunomycin (40 mg/m2), in solid tumors VP16 (150 mg/m2) and adriamycin (60 mg/m2). Seventy-two therapeutic courses were performed: 39 in ALL, 16 in osteosarcoma, 16 in neuroblastoma and 1 in medulloblastoma. On the whole 5 complete remissions were achieved in ALL patients and 1 in an osteosarcoma patient. We did not observe a significant myelosuppression during treatment, therefore few infectious complications occurred; furthermore electrocardiographic changes have been mild and promptly resolved after temporary discontinuation of verapamil infusion. Our data suggest a synergy of verapamil and cyclosporine in the inhibition of multidrug resistance induced by gp170, without the occurrence of heavy toxicity. The results obtained in ALL patients are encouraging., especially in view of a possible subsequent bone marrow transplantation, while in solid tumors they are not as satisfying.","['Divisione di Pediatria Oncologica, Universita degli Studi di Torino.']",,,,,,Impiego della ciclosporina e del verapamile in associazione a chemioterapici nel trattamento di pazienti pediatrici con neoplasia in fase avanzata.

Retinoids represent a potentially useful class of drugs in chemoprevention. Preclinical data and clinical experience suggests that different retinoids may have different spectra of antitumour activity and synergistic interactions between retinoids and cytokines have also been reported. 13-cis retinoic acid has shown some promising activity in preventing the onset of second primary tumours in head and neck cancer and fenretinide is being tested in the prevention of second primary breast cancers. An understanding of the role of the different retinoid receptors could lead to the design of compounds with a better therapeutic index. Despite these early indications that retinoids could be useful in this area, the development of such drugs is far from easy. Appropriate study designs for screening differentiating agents in the clinic, and the relevance of preclinical models of chemoprevention are challenges to be addressed. Unresolved issues include optimal patient selection, long clinical trial times, optimal dose, schedule and treatment duration. The use of biological surrogate markers for longer time-dependent trial endpoints could significantly contribute to more rapid development. Ongoing clinical studies, particularly in tobacco-related diseases, will better define the role of retinoids in this clinical setting. Clinicians should be encouraged to enter patients into large well organized clinical studies.","['Roche International Clinical Research Centre, Lingolsheim, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A fixed dose of 45 mg/m2/day was proposed for the treatment of patients (3), according to the results obtained by retinoic acid derivatives in skin diseases. We report that 25 mg (4), and even 15 mg/m2/day are still effective dosages. Absence of drug resistance, rapid correction of fibrinogenopenia and the absence of hypoplasia are the apparent major advantages and consequently high frequency of early mortality generally reported during chemotherapy is expected to be reduced. In fact the same risk of early death (10%) is recorded in all available data (5), due to coagulation disorders and to a leukocyte activation syndrome. Management of these side-effects is based on the prevention and treatment of the irreversible state as soon as first symptoms appear. Actually the major advantage of ATRA treatment in addition to chemotherapy is the decrease of relapse rate (6), the increase of event-free survival, and thus the increase of survival.","['Service des Maladies du Sang, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The family of compounds known as the retinoids have shown particular promise in this area. Current interest is directed towards established retinoids such as ATRA and 13-CRA. Newer synthetic retinoids such as fenretinide, the arotinoid Ro 40-8757, and 9-cis retinoic acid have been entering clinical trials. Ro 40-8757 is a particularly interesting new arotinoid with properties quite distinct from the other retinoids. It has different binding proteins and appears to regulate different genes than the classical retinoids such as ATRA or 13-CRA. Furthermore, it appears active against a different spectrum of malignancies. It also appears to have a relatively favourable side-effect profile. In addition to its anti-proliferative effects, this arotinoid may play a role in protection of bone marrow function after use of cytotoxic drugs. Development of Ro 40-8757 was halted before the compound had entered phase II testing due to lack of resources. Future developmental programmes for retinoids should move rapidly to explore the potential of interesting combinations identified in preclinical models. Retinoids should be considered primarily as drugs which modulate and enhance the effects of other active anticancer agents. Their development should not be prevented because they are unlikely to be active as single agents against common solid tumours.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,38,,,,,,,,,

These observations have led to clinical trials in which 13-cis-retinoic acid (13cRA) 1 mg/kg/day was combined with interferon alpha-2a (IFN alpha) 3 or 6 x 10(6) U/day. The first two such trials produced exciting results: 50% response rate in patients with previously untreated stages IB-IVA cervix cancer and 68% in patients with advanced squamous cell skin cancer. These data led to a number of additional trials of the combination, but the high response rates seen in the initial cervix and skin trials have not been duplicated in the other squamous tumors tested (head and neck, lung, pretreated cervix). In addition, trials in two nonsquamous histologies were negative (lung and melanoma). However, the regimen was not always studied in an optimal population of previously untreated patients and the negative results in pretreated cervix patients point to the relevance of this consideration. Nevertheless, the observation that the combination of 13cRA and IFN alpha (both of which bind to specific receptors and change gene expression) is able to induce regression in advanced tumors, must be regarded as highly important. Key questions to be addressed include an understanding of the biologic mechanism of specific tumor sensitivity (why some squamous tumors and not others?), and mechanisms of resistance in sensitive tumor types (e.g. cervix). Such data may lead to trials targeted to tumor types with defined biologic features having a high liklihood of clinical benefit. In the meantime, studies integrating this combination with other active treatment modalities such as radiation is warranted in cervix and skin carcinomas.","[""NCIC Clinical Trials Group, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",,,,26,,,,,,,,,

We have made substantial progress from our trials 10 years ago. The chemopreventive strategies utilized in our clinical trials involve the use of retinoids and carotenoids as chemopreventive agents. The choice of these agents was based upon their important anticarcinogenic and differentiation properties. It is important to understand how retinoids interact with cells to carry out their modulating activities, and we hope to increase our understanding through molecular analysis of retinoid receptors. In the case of aerodigestive epithelial tissues at risk, normal, non-keratinizing epithelial cells often express inappropriate squamous differentiation. Retinoids are thought to suppress premalignant lesions by suppressing these inappropriate squamous differentiation pathways. The role of retinoids in suppressing squamous differentiation markers and reversing premalignant lesions will be elucidated from this retinoid project. The development of a fundamental understanding of tumorigenesis in the aerodigestive tract can lead to novel preventive approaches. A relative degree of risk for cancer development in individuals depends on several components, including the extent of carcinogenic exposure, inherent sensitivity of the individual to carcinogens, the individual's nutritional status, etc. Individuals with a genetic component of increased carcinogen sensitivity appear to be at increased risk for developing primary and secondary tumors. Our chemoprevention research program is designed to develop innovative strategies for aerodigestive tract epithelial cancer prevention. The strength of our program is to bridge the gap between fundamental and cellular molecular studies in clinical chemoprevention trials.

Since Kaposi's sarcoma is regulated by steroid hormones both in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesized that retinoids may have anti-tumor effects in AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma. Thus, 27 patients with mucocutaneous, non-visceral AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (tRA). Poor tolerance was observed at the initial starting dose of 150 mg/m2, and thus subsequent patients were treated using a weekly dose escalation, starting with 45 mg/m2 (given daily, in subdivided doses), to the target dose of 150 mg/m2 (given daily in three subdivided doses). Nearly half (46%) of the patients had extensive mucocutaneous disease with over 25 lesions. No patient had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy. Ten patients had CD4 lymphocytes of 200/mm3 or greater (strata I); and 17 had under 200/mm3 CD4 lymphocytes (strata II). The median of the average daily tRA dose administered was 150 mg (90 mg/m2; there was no significant difference in the dose tolerance between the two strata). Adverse effects consisted of transient mild to moderate headaches in 65% of patients, mild to moderate skin dryness and cheilitis in 61%, and nausea and vomiting in 31%. Hematologic toxicities included hypertriglyceridemia in 62%, anemia in 23%, and neutropenia in 23%. Partial response to therapy was observed in 4/24 (17%) evaluable patients, occurring after 12, 20, 24, and 28 weeks of therapy, and lasting 4-24 weeks. Three responders had baseline CD4 lymphocyte counts < 200/mm3. Three additional patients experienced reduction in measured indicator lesions of greater than 25% but less than 50%, and seven patients experienced disease stabilization of 16 weeks or greater. In evaluable patients, the median time to disease progression was 22 weeks and the overall median survival in all patients was 27.3 months. No significant changes in CD4 lymphocyte counts, p24 antigen, and beta 2 microglobulin were observed over time. However, a statistically significant increase was observed in soluble IL-2 receptor levels while on tRA (p = 0.037). We conclude that tRA has activity in patients with mucocutaneous AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma with acceptable toxicity. tRA has immunological effects without upregulation of HIV parameters. Additional studies in combinations or with more active retinoids are warranted.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.']","['R01 CA51621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL48499/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognosis for children with advanced stage neuroblastoma, the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood, has remained poor despite significant increases in the intensity of multi-modality therapy. Observations that neuroblastoma has the potential in vivo to differentiate into the more mature neuronal phenotype of a ganglioneuroma or to spontaneously regress, combined with the ability of ATRA to induce differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines in vitro, suggests that neuroblastoma may be a prime candidate for a retinoid-based approach to differentiation therapy. We previously performed a standard pediatric phase I trial of ATRA and defined the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in children to be 60 mg/m2/day, significantly lower than the MTD in adult patients. Pharmacokinetic results revealed that the plasma half-life of ATRA was short (45 min) relative to 13-cis-RA (12-24 h), and that plasma drug exposure decreased significantly by day 28 of daily drug administration. Preclinical studies using an i.v. formulation of ATRA in a Rhesus monkey pharmacokinetic model then demonstrated that ATRA is eliminated by a capacity-limited (saturable) process. This elimination process was rapidly induced within the first week of daily i.v. ATRA administration, and suggested that an intermittent schedule of drug administration might allow for down-regulation of the elimination process. These pre-clinical studies formed the basis for investigating whether an intermittent schedule of ATRA administration would allow for repeated periods of relatively higher plasma drug concentrations. Preliminary results of two clinical trials using intermittent schedules of administration suggest that this approach may result in significantly higher plasma drug exposure over time. Plans to study the role of intermittent schedules of ATRA administration in pediatric phase II trials in patients with neuroblastoma are underway.","['Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RA is much more rapidly cleared from plasma following oral administration; their respective half-lives are < 1 h and 13 h. There is extensive accumulation of the 4-oxo-cRA in plasma following repeated doses of cRA, while 4-oxo-RA is only a minor metabolite in plasma following RA administration. The extent of isomerization in vivo differs for the two retinoids. In contrast to cRA, where up to a 1:3 ratio of RA to cRA is observed in patient plasma following drug administration, cRA concentrations in excess of 10 ng/ml are rarely observed in plasma of patients receiving exogenous RA. RA administration produces autoinduction of its own oxidative catabolism; this effect does not occur with cRA. These pharmacokinetic differences have been observed in leukemia and solid tumor patients. Detailed analysis of the results of the population studied suggest that both constitutive and RA-induced hypercatabolism of RA occurs. Both of these hypercatabolic states can be modulated by concurrent administration of ketoconazole, an inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 and lipoxygenase-mediated oxidations.","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

All nuclear receptors have several well-characterized structural domains, including a conserved DNA-binding domain, and a ligand binding domain at the carboxyl terminus of the receptor. The RAR and RXR classes of nuclear retinoic acid receptors are each composed of alpha, beta and gamma subtypes with more than one isoform for each receptor subtype. Data from many investigators suggest there are RAR- and RXR-dependent gene pathways, and that the individual receptor subtypes may control distinct gene expression patterns. In addition, RXR has been found to heterodimerize with other nuclear receptors to form active transcriptional complexes, which influence the activity of a variety of gene pathways important in growth and differentiation. As a result, retinoids have been useful clinical agents in Dermatology and Oncology. However, upon prolonged exposure to retinoic acid, resistance to retinoids has often been encountered both in the clinical setting and in long-term cell culture (HL60R and RAC65 cells). In the latter case, retinoid resistance has been associated with a mutation in the RAR gene which transcribes a RAR receptor truncated at the C-terminal end. These mutated RAR receptors exhibit a reduced affinity for retinoic acid while retaining the ability to bind to a retinoic acid response element on DNA. As a result, these mutant receptors exhibit dominant-negative activity by binding to the DNA without activating transcription and by competing with other receptors for sites on the response element. In fact, dominant-negative activity may be very important in the development of many neoplastic diseases, including acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), where a t(15;17) chromosomal translocation fuses the PML gene to the RAR gene, to produce a PML-RAR fusion protein in large excess in the cell. However, retinoid resistance in the patient is most probably the result of pharmacokinetic problems, whereby, with continuous retinoid treatment, the plasma levels of retinoic acid gradually decrease to below that required to maintain differentiation of leukemic cells in vivo. A major challenge for drug discovery is to design a drug which circumvents these pharmacokinetic problems either by designing novel drug delivery systems or by employing retinoids which do not bind to CRABP, such as 9-c-RA.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Department of Toxicology and Pathology, Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ 07110.']",,,,114,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, Ig kappa producing B-cells usually retain Ig lambda genes in germline configuration, whereas the Ig kappa genes are generally deleted on one or both alleles in most Ig lambda producing B-cells. The deletion processes in the Ig kappa locus are mediated via rearrangement of the kappa deleting element (Kde), which is located approximately 24 kb downstream of the constant (C) kappa gene segment. Kde rearrangements can delete the C kappa region (including the Ig kappa enhancer) or the complete joining (J) kappa-C kappa region via rearrangements to a heptamer recombination signal sequence in the J kappa-C kappa intron (intron RSS), or via rearrangement to a variable (V) kappa gene segment, respectively. To improve the Southern blot detection of clonal Ig kappa gene rearrangements and deletions in B-lineage malignancies, we developed a new set of optimal J kappa, C kappa, and Kde probes, and made a detailed restriction map of the J kappa, C kappa, and Kde region. Extensive Southern blot studies revealed that rearrangements in the J kappa gene region are optimally detectable by use of a J kappa probe in combination with at least two appropriate restriction enzymes, i.e. BamHI, BglII, EcoRI, HindIII, and/or SacI. J kappa gene rearrangements are also detectable with the C kappa probe in BglII and BamHI digests, if no deletion of the C kappa region has occurred. The two different types of Kde-mediated J kappa and/or C kappa gene deletions are easily detectable with the Kde probe in BglII, HindIII and/or EcoRI digests. This is in contrast to the inaccurate information obtained with the J kappa and C kappa probes, because these probes can detect deletions only in the form of decreased densities of J kappa and/or C kappa germline bands in the absence of rearranged bands. Our detailed analysis of 217 B-lineage leukemias revealed that 62% (69/111) of precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias had rearranged and/or deleted Ig kappa genes. All 53 Ig lambda+ chronic B-cell leukemias contained Ig kappa gene deletions; in 75% this concerned biallelic J kappa and/or C kappa gene deletions. Virtually all Ig kappa gene deletions appeared to be mediated via Kde rearrangements, while only 1.5% of the Ig kappa gene deletions were mediated via an alternative deletion mechanism which involved the J kappa region.","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Dijkzigt/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was a single, large (about 2 microns in diameter), round or ovoid body, darker than the nucleus and reddish-violet in May-Grunwald-Giemsa stain. The examination with transmission electron microscope demonstrated that such inclusions were made up of giant parallel tube arrays (PTAs). The absolute lymphocyte count was normal, but there was an expansion of CD3+, CD4-, CD8+, CD11b, TCR alpha beta lymphocytes. The lymphocytes bearing the inclusion were CD3+ and CD8+. DNA studies suggested an expansion of T-cell population with clonal rearrangement of TCR beta and TCR gamma. This case can be classified as an asymptomatic disorder of large granular lymphocytes, with unusual morphology. Giant PTAs should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of lymphocyte cytoplasmic inclusions.","['Hematology Laboratory Department, Postgraduate School of Hematology, Farras Valenti, University of Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore studied the effects of verapamil on B-CLL cells in vitro. In 13 samples we observed that verapamil strongly inhibited in vitro proliferation of pokeweed mitogen (PWM) stimulated and unstimulated cells. Using a cytotoxic bioassay, we found that verapamil markedly inhibited the spontaneous and PMW-induced release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) by B-CLL cells.

In one experiment, lethally irradiated Friend leukemia virus (FLV)-sensitive C3H/He (C3H; Fv-2s, Fv-4s, Rfv-1s, Rfv-2s Rfv-3s) mice were transplanted with (i) bone marrow cells from FLV-resistant BALB/c-Fv-4Wr (C4W; Fv-2s, Fv-4r, Rfv-1s, Rfv-2s, Rfv-3s) mice (C4W --> C3H) or (ii) a mixture of bone marrow cells from C4W and C3H mice (C4W + C3H --> C3H). They were then inoculated with FLV 3-4 months later and leukemia development was examined. The results indicated that C4W --> C3H chimeras were completely resistant to FLV-induced leukemogenesis and that C4W + C3H --> C3H mixed chimeras that contained as low as 30% C4W-derived cells, or as high as 70% C3H-derived cells, did not develop leukemias. In another experiment, bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 (B6; Fv-2r, Fv-4s, Rfv-1r, Rfv-2r, Rfv-3r) or C4W donors were grated to FLV-sensitive DBA/2 mice (DBA; Fv-2s, Fv-4s, Rfv-1s, Rfv-2s, Rfv-3s) that had been infected with FLV 6 days earlier (DBA-FLV). The results indicated that most, if not all, FLV-infected DBA mice which received bone marrow transplantation from B6 donors developed B6-derived leukemias, although the survival time of these mice was dramatically prolonged as compared to that of untreated DBA-FLV mice. In contrast, bone marrow transplantation from Fv-4r-bearing C4W donors successfully rescued FLV-infected DBA mice from leukemic deaths. Thus, the bone marrow transplantation therapy against retroviral infection of hemopoietic cells was shown to be feasible, provided that donor cells carry a resistant allele that functions via receptor blockade as in the case of Fv-4r, but less effective when the roles of the resistant alleles partially interfered with the virus replication, leukemic transformation and/or cycling of target cells as suggested for Fv-2r gene action, or to resist virus infection by immunological means as are known for Rfv-1r, Rfv-2r and Rfv-3r genes which are also carried by B6-strain mice. Implication of these findings on the somatic gene therapy against retrovirus infection diseases in man are discussed.","['Division of Physiology and Pathology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common 11q23 abnormality was t(9;11), significantly more common in secondary (9/12) than in de novo (6/26) leukemias (p = 0.003). There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics between de novo and secondary groups involving 11q23. Five of 12 patients (42%) with secondary and 20/26 (77%) with de novo disease achieved complete remission (p = 0.05).

In normal hematopoiesis, CEA gene family members (CGMs) have only been reported on cells of myeloid and monocytic origin. In the present study, we analyzed 62 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) and seven surface immunoglobulin positive (sig+) B-cell lines for the expression of the CEA family members CEA, NCA-50/90, NCA-95, NCA-160, CGM1 and CGM7. We demonstrated that members of the CEA family were present in 76% of childhood ALLs of B- and T-cell origin. In ALLs of B-cell origin, 82% of the samples expressed at least one CEA subgroup member: 38% NCA-50/90 (CD66c), 31% NCA-160 (CD66a), and 13% both. Six of seven B-cell lines solely expressed NCA-160. In seven ALL of T-cell origin, sole NCA-160 expression was present in 29% of the cases. CEA and CGM1 were not expressed in childhood ALLs or in the sIg+ B-cell lines. In 15 ALLs and seven B-cell lines which could be analyzed for CGM7 expression, the antigen was not detected. NCA-95 was not expressed in 91% of the B-lineage ALLs, in T-lineage ALLs and in the B-cell lines. However, five B-lineage ALLs showed conflicting data on the binding patterns of two, on leukocytes specifically NCA-95 recognizing antibodies suggesting either expression of unknown forms of NCA-95 or NCA-50/90 or of a yet unknown member of the CEA family in these ALL cells. The expression of CEA subgroup members in childhood ALL cells might have prognostic impacts, as an inverse correlation exists between NCA expression on leukemic blasts and the risk factor white blood count at diagnosis.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Heinrich Heine-University Medical Center, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed 113 adult ALL cases for expression of MY-associated antigens (MAA). ALL was diagnosed by standard morphology, cytochemistry, and immunophenotype in central review. MY+ ALL was diagnosed when > or = 20% of lymphoblasts co-expressed CD13 and/or CD33. Overall incidence of MY+ was 31/113 (27%). MAA expression was not significantly correlated with WBC, blast count, hemoglobin, or hematocrit. MY+ cases were more likely to express B-associated antigens, especially CALLA, and to be FAB L2, Ph+, or to have the BCR-ABL translocation by PCR, but these differences were not statistically significant. All patients were induced with a L10M regimen, and 67 (59%) achieved CR: 43/66 (65%) of B MY neg; 14/29 (48%) of B MY+; 10/16 (63%) T MY neg; and 0/2 T MY+. In age-adjusted analyses CR rate did not differ significantly between MY+ and MY neg patients or between B- and T-cell patients. Of the 113 patients, 84 have died and the remaining 29 patients have been followed for a median of 49 months. In proportional hazards regression analyses adjusting for age and WBC, heterogeneity of survival among the four groups was statistically significant (p = 0.021), largely due to MY status. The mortality rate was 85% greater for MY+ patients compared to MY neg patients (two-tailed p = 0.013). By contrast, survival did not vary significantly between B- and T-cell patients. The data indicate that MAA expression is useful for predicting overall survival of adult patients with ALL treated in a L10M protocol. As a predictive factor MAA expression is comparable to the WBC and superior to the more standard stratification by B- or T-cell markers for this group of patients.","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7880.']",['CA 32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether this expression is inappropriate requires information on the normal cellular counterparts. There is no agreement in the literature on the levels of expression of c-myc mRNA and protein in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and there are no reports on the differential expression in different lymphocyte populations. The aim of this study was to assess the state of c-myc expression in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes at the single cell level by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Two monoclonal antibodies against c-myc and specific peptide inhibition controls were tested in mononuclear cells from nine healthy volunteers and the HL60 cell line. The expression of c-myc in B- and T-lymphocyte subsets was studied by two-colour immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. Using calibrated reference standards, we quantified the c-myc protein and results were referred as molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome. Almost all lymphocytes express c-myc by both techniques. Two patterns of nuclear staining (weak and strong) were found by immunocytochemistry and this was confirmed by two peaks of fluorescence intensity by flow cytometry. Double immunostaining showed that the stronger pattern of c-myc staining corresponds to B lymphocytes and the weak one to T cells. Quantification confirmed these results which demonstrated a statistically significant difference in the expression of c-myc in these two lymphocyte populations (p < 0.005). Our results demonstrate for the first time that normal circulating B cells express higher levels of c-myc protein than T lymphocytes.","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hairy cells typically home in the spleen, and become circulating only late in the disease. As it is assumed that the T-cell abnormalities are caused by specific interactions with the hairy cells, we studied the immunophenotype in 17 cases (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45R0, TCR gamma delta) and cytokine gene expression in four cases (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, GM-CSF and the receptors of IL-1 and IL-2, using the cDNA-PCR technique) of purified T-cell fractions from hairy-cell spleens. By Northern blot analysis, mRNA for IFN-gamma, GM-CSF, IL-10 and TNF-alpha was measured in purified T cells and hairy cells from three HCL spleens. The results of the immunophenotype and cDNA-PCR data were compared with ten normal spleens. Compared to blood, splenic T cells showed a reversed CD4/CD8 ratio, a normal percentage of memory T cells, and an increase in CD3+TCR gamma delta + cells. Without specific induction spontaneous cytokine gene expression of IL-2, IL-4, IFN-gamma, and GM-CSF was seen in the purified T-cell fractions without signals in the purified hairy-cell fractions. mRNA expression of IFN-gamma and GM-CSF in the T cells, and of IL-10 and TNF-alpha in the hairy cells was confirmed by the Northern blot technique. From these data we suggest that splenic T cells in HCL should not be considered as residual or recirculating T cells, but rather as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown that hydrocortisone (HC) protects AML blast stem cells from the lethal effects of cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) while retinoic acid (ATRA) increases ara-C sensitivity; further mechanisms of regulation of ara-C sensitivity might include increase or decrease in repair of sublethal damage. Anthracycline dose-response curves are characterized by an initial shoulder, followed by exponential decrease in survival with increasing dose. The shoulder portion of such curves may indicate the accumulation of sublethal damage. We used two assays to look for evidence of regulation of anthracycline sensitivity by HC or ATRA; the clonogenic assay for blast stem cells detects drug effects on this crucial population, but only after several days on incubation, during which time repair might occur. Measurements of nicks in DNA show damage in the bulk population of cells, but these can be detected very soon after exposure to drug. Both methods showed the HC protected cells in two continuous cell lines (OCI/AML-2 and OCI/AML-5) while ATRA made the cells more sensitive. Blast cells freshly-obtained from six AML patients were also tested. Both assays showed HC protection and ATRA sensitization in three populations. The clonogenic assay detected both effects in cells from a fourth patient; the nicked DNA assay confirmed both effects in a fifth patient, where the results of the clonogenic assay did not reach statistical significance. Neither ATRA nor HC influenced the sensitivity of blasts from a sixth patient; but these cells were highly resistant to drug. Kinetic studies showed that damage persisted longer after treatment with anthracyclines than with ara-C. OCI/AML-2 cells treated with HC before drug accumulated fewer cells with nicked DNA after daunorubicin (DNR). Cells exposed to ATRA after DNR showed increased toxicity in kinetic experiments. We conclude that sensitivity to anthracyclines may be regulated by ligands for steroid receptors. Furthermore, since growth factors do not regulate anthracyclines' sensitivity, different mechanisms may be operative for the action of ligands for cell surface receptors. Finally, we suggest that retinoic acid might be considered for inclusion in standard anthracycline/ara-C regimens for the treatment of AML.","['Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrated that an augmented cell death occurred with TF-1 cells when pre-incubated for 24 h with IL-3 followed by treatment with VP-16 (10 micrograms/ml) for 1 h. The increased cell death could not be ascribed to an increased number of apoptotic cells as measured with the acridine orange method. However, the IL-3 treatment coincided with an upregulation of DNA topoisomerase II alpha (Topo II alpha) at mRNA and protein level after 24 h, which was preceded by an upregulation of c-myc mRNA. In contrast, Topo II beta did not demonstrate an upregulation at mRNA level in response to IL-3 stimulation. In addition, it was shown that cells treated with IL-3 followed by VP-16 demonstrated a higher number of cleavable DNA complexes which was not due to an increased uptake of VP-16, since cellular concentrations of VP-16 in the presence of IL-3 or medium were 16.8 +/- 7.8 ng/10(6) cells and 19.8 +/- 7.8 ng/10(6) cells (mean +/- SD, n = 3), respectively.

The addition of labeled nucleotides can then be identified by fluorescence by their reaction with streptavidin. We have used this method to examine damage to the DNA of OCI/AML-2 cells caused by cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) and the effects of hydrocortisone and retinoic acid on this damage (regulated drug sensitivity). Concurrent measurements of clonogenic cells were used to allow a comparison of damage as shown by labeled nicks in DNA with loss of colony-forming capacity. Both methods gave comparable ara-C dose-response curves, for cells incubated with the drug for 24 h. Both methods showed that exposure of OCI/AML-2 cells to hydrocortisone before ara-C greatly reduced the toxicity of the drug; and that retinoic acid given after ara-C increased both its lethal effects on colony formation and the extent of DNA damage as assessed by labeled nicks. Clonogenic assays required for colony formation are not readily adapted to the study of development and repair of damage. The labeled nick assay is suitable for such kinetic studies. OCI/AML-2 cells were exposed in suspension to either hydrocortisone before ara-C or retinoic acid after ara-C. At 24 h intervals thereafter, cells were harvested, assayed by both methods, and recultured after dilution to the original cell concentration. In cultures exposed only to ara-C (controls), the number of cells with labeled nicks increased during the first 24 h and cells with damaged DNA could be detected for 48-72 h, depending on the ara-C dose in spite of the dilution at each passage. OCI/AML-2 cells exposed to hydrocortisone before drug showed fewer nick-labeled cells than controls at the first observation and damaged cells rapidly disappeared from the population with increasing time. For cells treated with retinoic acid after ara-C, the nick-labeled cell population was greater than controls and remained greater throughout subsequent observations. We propose that in the control cultures, sublethal damage either became lethal with time and was seen as increased numbers of cells with damaged DNA, or alternatively, sublethal damage was repaired. From this point of view we consider that hydrocortisone promotes repair of sublethal damage while retinoic acid inhibits repair.","['Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML/MDS occurred in 3/1374 CLL patients seen at a single institution between 1972 and 1992. The median follow-up exceeded 7 years and 72% of these patients had received prior alkylating agent therapy. The expected number of AML/MDS developing in a general population of the same size was 1.2 as calculated from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data (observed-to-expected ratio = 2.49; 95% confidence interval = 0.9-7.3; p = 0.12). Although, not included in the incidence calculation, four patients with CLL were referred at the time of development of AML/MDS. CLL and AML/MDS were diagnosed concurrently in two patients. Three of the patients had received no prior alkylating agents. The median survival was 17 months in patients who had received no prior treatment, and 5 months in those who had received prior chemotherapy. Our results suggest that patients with CLL in whom AML/MDS develops have similar prognoses to other patients with AML/MDS. Furthermore, this analysis does not provide evidence for a heightened risk of AML/MDS in CLL patients, despite treatment with known leukemogenic agents.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased risk for a first relapse in the central nervous system (CNS) was detected in a subgroup of childhood ALL patients with common ALL or pre-B ALL phenotype and chromosomal aberrations of the short arm of chromosome 12. In this paper we report clinical, cytogenetic, immunologic, morphologic and cytochemical data on these eight childhood ALL patients with aberrations of the short arm of chromosome 12 and of an additional four cases that were diagnosed and treated between November 1, 1990 and February 1, 1992. We found that three out of six common ALL, two out of three pre-B ALL and one out of three T-ALL patients with 12p chromosomal rearrangements developed a first relapse in the CNS. On the contrary, the frequency of CNS relapse in our childhood ALL patients without 12p aberrations was 10%. Furthermore, morphologic and cytochemical analysis of the bone marrow smears of these 12 patients with aberrations of the short arm of chromosome 12 revealed that the nine cases with pre-B or common ALL phenotype had typical morphologic characteristics that are unusual for newly diagnosed childhood ALL. Typical for this subtype is the presence of large polymorphic blast cells without nucleoli. The nuclei are irregularly shaped showing folds and clefts and a stripy pattern. The nucleus and cytoplasm are often abundantly vacuolated. The cytoplasm has a foamy light-blue appearance.","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital/Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ATL cells were not found in the peripheral blood, anti-HTLV-1 antibody was found to be positive. Natural killer cell activity was lower than normal control and other tests of humoral and cell-mediated immunity were normal. Histological examination of the specimens obtained from the thymoma revealed lymphocytic predominance without atypical cells such as ATL cells, but with integration of HTLV-1 proviral DNA.

Both female and male workers in several occupational categories had notably increased risks for all hematopoietic and lymphoproliferative (HLP) malignant and nonmalignant disorders combined and for total leukemia. Variation in risk for HLP disorders by occupational category was observed in both genders, with highest risks for male and female chemical manufacturing workers, female nonproduction employees, and male printers. However, the numbers of leukemia and other HLP malignancies in each category were small. The findings suggest that both female and male benzene-exposed workers in several occupational categories experience excess leukemia and other HLP disorders with relatively minor gender differences.

Percutaneous intracisternal injection of an anti-idiotype monoclonal antibody (M6) ricin immunotoxin was shown to be moderately effective in prolonging the survival of tumor bearing animals supporting the use of immunotoxins for the treatment of central nervous system neoplasia (Zovickian J and Youle R.J. J. Neurosurg 68: 767, 1988). This report describes a method that significantly improves the survival of immunotoxin treated Strain 2 guinea pigs in a syngeneic animal model of leptomeningeal neoplasia. Strain 2 guinea pigs, implanted with subarachnoid catheters, received three courses of treatment with an (M6)-intract ricin immunotoxin following intracisternal inoculation of L2C leukemia tumor cells. Animals were treated with three to four micrograms of immunotoxin in three divided doses. This was found to be less toxic and more effective than single bolus administration of immunotoxin. These results demonstrate that a permanent indwelling catheter in this animal model facilitates multiple dose delivery of immunotoxin therapy allowing the assessment of various treatment schedules and the achievement of enhanced therapeutic effect. Furthermore, these results support the continued evaluation of immunotoxins for the treatment of central nervous system neoplasia.","['Surgical Neurology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test Ras function in a model that more closely resembles clinical diseases involving Bcr-Abl, double gene retroviruses expressing Bcr-Abl paired with the Gap C terminus or dominant negative Ras were introduced into naive mouse bone marrow cells. Transformation by Bcr-Abl was completely blocked in both situations. Coexpression of normal c-H-Ras accelerated the transforming activity of Bcr-Abl. These findings show that Ras activation is essential for the leukemogenic activity of Abl oncogenes in two distinct model systems. The results genetically define a connection between the Bcr-Abl cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase and Ras and add to the accumulating evidence that deregulation of Ras is a central event in the genesis of a number of molecularly distinct forms of human myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, University of California at Los Angeles 90024.']","['CA-01551/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53867/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC2191855,,,,,,,,

A and B chains of PDGF are transcribed in atherosclerotic plaques but details of the mechanism of the expression of either chains in vivo are not understood. It has been suggested that differentiated macrophages, which are the major origin of foam cells, but not monocytes hardly secrete PDGF in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 1) tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), a macrophage derived cytokine which promote the differentiation from monocytes to macrophages, and 2) interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), a T cell derived macrophage activating factor, on the production and mRNA expression of PDGF A and B chains in a human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. THP-1 cells were cultured in the presence of one of the experimental cytokines with or without the addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). PMA is known to induce the differentiation of monocytes (including THP-1 cells) to macrophages within a period of 24 hours. Thus the treatment of THP-1 cells with a cytokine and/or PMA in vitro was expected to mimic the effect of the cytokine during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages in vivo. Unstimulated THP-1 cells expressed no detectable amount of PDGF A or B mRNA. The treatment of THP-1 cells with PMA resulted in the strong expression of both PDGF A and B mRNAs. Stimulated with TNF-alpha (50 U/ml) on day 0, THP-1 cells expressed PDGF A mRNA significantly from 1 up to 3 days after the treatment, whereas the expression of PDGF B and mRNA was only weakly detected on day 2. The maximum signal of PDGF A mRNA was ten times stronger than that of PDGF B mRNA. Within the same period, relatively small number of TNF-alpha treated THP-1 cells had differentiated to macrophages as detected by the reduction of nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT) (35% of total cells) and by the counting of adherent cells (35% of total cells). THP-1 cells simultaneously treated with TNF-alpha and PMA strongly expressed PDGF A and B gene. Most remarkably, the expression of PDGF B mRNA was greatly enhanced with compared to the treatment with PMA alone. In addition, TNF-alpha augmented the secretion of PDGF proteins in PMA stimulated THP-1 cells. In contrast, INF gamma per se had no effect on PDGF gene expression, NBT reducing activity and cell adherence in unstimulated THP-1 cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nippon Medical School First Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CGM2 cDNA was amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) from the colon adenocarcinoma cell line, LS174T. A defective exon is missing from this cDNA clone, leading to a novel domain organization for the human CEA family with two immunoglobulin-like domains. The derived C-terminal domain predicts that the CGM2 protein is membrane-bound through a glycosyl phosphatidylinositol anchor. RT/PCR analyses identified CGM2 transcripts in mucinous ovarian and colonic adenocarcinomas as well as in adjacent colonic tissue, but not in other tumors including leukocytes from six chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Thus, unlike several other family members, CGM2 is not expressed in granulocytes but reveals a more CEA-like expression pattern. Northern blot analyses identified a 2.5-kilobase CGM2 mRNA that is strongly down-regulated in colonic adenocarcinomas compared with adjacent colonic mucosa, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor function. In addition, a 3.2-kilobase transcript was observed in a number of colon tumors that is not detectable in normal colonic tissue. This mRNA species could represent a tumor-specific CGM2 splice variant.","['Institute of Immunobiology, University of Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,"['GENBANK/L31791', 'GENBANK/L31792']",,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic value of BM histologic patterns on survival and disease progression probability was investigated in 335 B-CLL patients. RESULTS: Actuarial survival probability estimated by univariate analysis proved to be significantly influenced by stage (p < 0.0001), BM histology (p = 0.01), and by the following parameters: anemia (p = 0.0005), splenomegaly (p < 0.001), CLL-related symptoms (p < 0.01), thrombocytopenia (p < 0.01), number of involved nodal areas (p = 0.01) and peripheral lymphocyte count over 30 x 10(9)/L (p < 0.05). In this series we did not detect a discriminating prognostic effect for BM histology within the individual stages. Cox multivariate regression analysis failed to demonstrate a significant value for BM histology, while stage and anemia emerged as the best prognostic variables. Actuarial DP free probability in 294 untreated patients with A and B stages was significantly related to stage (p < 0.00001) and to BM pattern (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the clear correlation between the D pattern of BM involvement and advanced and early progressive disease, we were unable to demonstrate an independent prognostic value for BM histology. These findings suggest that stage emerged as the best predictive factor of survival probability in our B-CLL patients.","['University La Sapienza of Rome, Human Biopathology Dept., Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the efficiency of P-gp in pumping out the drugs is 2.5 times less for OH-Dox than for Dox. This shows that in order to be pumped out by P-gp a molecule does not necessarily have to have a basic center. The mean influx coefficient for the drug is 5 times higher for OH-Dox than for Dox.

Here, we show that high levels of LIF were constitutively produced by cultures of synovium pieces. Low levels of LIF were produced spontaneously by isolated synoviocytes, but interleukin (IL)-1 beta caused a fourfold enhancement of this secretion. The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-4 reduced the production of LIF by synovium pieces by 75%, as observed earlier with IL-6, IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. IL-4 had a direct effect since it inhibited LIF production by unstimulated and IL-1 beta- or TNF-alpha-stimulated synoviocytes. Conversely, IL-4 enhanced the production of IL-6, which shares with LIF biological activities and receptor components. The inhibitory effect of IL-4 was dose dependent and was reversed using a blocking anti-IL-4 receptor antibody. Similar inhibitory action of IL-4 on LIF production was observed on synovium pieces from patients with osteoarthritis and on normal synoviocytes. IL-10, another anti-inflammatory cytokine acting on monocytes, had no effect on LIF production by either synovium pieces or isolated synoviocytes. Thus, the production of LIF by synovium tissue was inhibited by IL-4 through both a direct effect on synoviocytes and an indirect effect by inhibition of the production of LIF-inducing cytokines.","['Schering-Plough Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Productively rearranged VH 4-21 genes were cloned into pRTM1, a human IgM expression vector. This allowed us to generate IgM kappa-expressing transfectomas by co-transfecting each of these constructs with pSVG-V kappa 3, an Ig kappa light-chain expression vector that has a variable region encoded Humkv325, a conserved V kappa gene that is frequently expressed early B cell ontogeny. We find that all transfectomas expressing IgM kappa encoded by VH 4-21 make IgM autoantibodies reactive with i, a linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine determinant present on neonatal red blood cells and a B cell-restricted isoform of the CD45 surface molecule. In contrast, a transfectoma expressing pSVG-V kappa 3 and pRTM1 containing a rearranged VH4-59 (V71-4) gene isolated from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia B cell population, designated WIL, produced IgM kappa antibodies that had no detectable anti-i binding activity. However, transfectomas expressing VH 4-21 fused onto the Ig heavy-chain third complementarity determining region (CDR3) of WIL are found to make anti-B cell autoantibodies with anti-i activity. These studies indicate that VH 4-21 genes rearranged in human fetal B cell ontogeny can encode anti-B cell autoantibodies with a binding specificity that does not require in vivo somatic selection.","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0663.']",['AG04100-10/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['GENBANK/U24683', 'GENBANK/U24684', 'GENBANK/U24685', 'GENBANK/U24686', 'GENBANK/U24687', 'GENBANK/U24688', 'GENBANK/U24689', 'GENBANK/U24690', 'GENBANK/U24691']",,,,,,,,,,,

Then the cells were reincubated in a fresh medium without drug for additional 48-144h and their differentiation markers such as NBT reduction, morphological changes and cytokinetic characteristics were studied. The results demonstrated that once exposed continuously to 1.0 mumol/L RA for at least 48h, the HL-60 cells would proceed to terminal differentiation: about 60-90 percent of the cells became NBT positive, 40-80 percent of cells exhibited decreased nucleus/cytoplasm ratio and marked reduction in the number of nucleoli and displayed matured granulocytic morphology. Cytokinetic studies demonstrated 48-85 percent of cells arrested in G1 phase, which is typical for differentiated cells.

The combination of 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and cytosine arabinoside (ara-C) may exhibit synergism similar to that observed for fludarabine and ara-C and may diminish the potential for development of resistance since the two drugs are activated by separate enzymatic pathways. To determine the efficacy of the combination against human leukemia cells, we investigated the time-concentration relationships of the drugs given alone or in combination to the resultant cytotoxicity. To determine whether the combination leads to enhanced activity of deoxycytidine kinase (dCk), the rate-limiting enzyme in ara-C activation, we characterized the cellular dCk in CCRF/CEM/0, CCRF/CEM/ara-C/7A, and CCRF/CEM/ara-C/3A monoclonal cells before and after treatment with 6-MP. CCRF/CEM/0 (wild type), CCRF/CEM/ara-C/7A (approximately 50% ara-C-resistant as determined by ara-C sensitivity assay and dCk characterization), and CCRF/CEM/ara-C/3A (approximately 90% resistant to ara-C) human leukemia cells were incubated with various concentrations of 6-MP and ara-C given alone or in combination. Cell survival, inhibition of DNA synthetic capacity (DSC), ara-CTP anabolism, and dCk enzymatic characteristics were studied. Incubation of CEM/0 cells with 6-MP for 24 h, followed by ara-C for 48 h, increased cell-growth inhibition by approximately 0.5-1 log10, corresponding to 5- to 10-fold synergism, as compared with ara-C alone after identical drug incubation in all cell lines. Simultaneous administration showed no synergism, whereas reversal of the sequence produced an antagonistic effect. The ara-CTP levels were 2- to 3.5-fold and 3- to 5-fold higher in CEM/0 and CEM/ara-C/7A cells, respectively, in cells exposed to 6-MP followed by ara-C than in those exposed to ara-C alone at the same concentrations. Furthermore, a progressive increase in ara-CTP levels was noted in CEM/0 cells exposed to increasing concentrations of 6-MP followed by 10 or 20 microM ara-C. A significant decrease in DSC was observed upon treatment of wild-type and ara-C-resistant cells with 6-MP and ara-C. The combination of 6-MP and ara-C exhibits significant sequence-specific synergism in both wild-type and partially ara-C-resistant leukemia cell lines. The combination also exerts collateral sensitivity in the ara-C-resistant cell lines. 6-MP pretreatment may play a role in enhancing ara-C activation, thus producing drug synergism in sensitive and resistant leukemia cell lines.","['Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently described 2 patients with a new AML type--poorly differentiated near-tetraploid AML L0. The occurrence of very large blasts in a heterogeneous blast population seemed to be a morphological sign of this new type of AML. RESULTS: The same morphologic characteristics were observed by us when we studied blasts of another 80-year-old patient with a near-tetraploid karyotype. However, 34% of blasts were positive for myeloperoxidase and they exhibited in 24-33% surface myelomonocytic markers CD11b, CD13, CD15 and CD14. The illness was classified as acute myelomonoblastic leukemia M4 without significant dysplastic changes in erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. The growth of granulocyte-macrophage bone marrow progenitors CFU-GM was low. The patient refused cytotoxic chemotherapy and expired 3 months later on supportive treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of very large blasts is a typical sign in cases of near-tetraploid AML. Precise classification of leukemia type is essential for successful therapy.","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha.']",,,,,,Nemocna s temer tetraploidni akutni myeloidni leukemii M4.,,,,,,,

The human glioblastoma cell line U-87 MG could be successfully engrafted in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency using the i.p., intracerebral, and s.c. routes. The latter model was elected to evaluate therapy based on its high reproducibility. Tumor growth in mice engrafted s.c. was proportionally associated with splenomegaly and leukocytosis. Multiple transfers of lethally irradiated (non-proliferating) TALL-104 cells at the tumor site resulted in about 50-70% inhibition of tumor growth as compared to untreated mice, with concomitant reduction of splenomegaly and leukocytosis. The antitumor effects were inversely proportional to the size of the tumor at initiation of therapy, 90-100% inhibition occurring in severe combined immunodeficiency mice treated from the day of U-87 MG challenge. Neither splenomegaly nor leukocytosis developed in animals in which tumor growth was completely blocked. Stimulation of TALL-104 cells with either interleukin 2 or interleukin 12 prior to irradiation and adoptive transfer increased the antitumor efficacy of the killer cells to about the same extent.

To the authors' knowledge, there have been no previous reports of anaphylactoid reactions from basophilic degranulation in children with this condition. METHODS: This report describes the clinicopathologic profile and complications of a patient with de novo ABL. RESULTS: Immediately after the first induction dose of intravenous vincristine, the patient developed an anaphylactoid reaction and disseminated intravascular coagulation with massive pulmonary hemorrhage. A normal serum tryptase level suggested that this life-threatening event was secondary to tumor lysis (basophilic degranulation), rather than to a mast-cell mediated anaphylactic reaction to vincristine. This interpretation is supported by the coagulation studies, which suggested release of heparin from the blast granules. CONCLUSIONS: Although de novo ABL is rare, it should be considered when cytoplasmic basophilic granules are seen in the leukemic cells of patients with what otherwise appears to be undifferentiated leukemia, and the pertinent diagnostic procedures should be undertaken. During the treatment of ABL, potential complications related to basophilic degranulation should be anticipated, and antihistamine prophylaxis may be of value.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas 75235-9063.']",,,,20,,,,,,,,,

The consequences of the secondary malignancies are serious, with more than 90% of the patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas associated with EBV infection and more than 75% of the patients with solid tumors dying despite treatment. Secondary leukemia developing in donor T-s is rare, but was fatal in all cases. EBV infection plays a major role in leading to the non-Hodgkin lymphomas in a setting of immune dysregulation from ATG or anti-T-cell monoclonal antibody treatment of acute GVHD. Other factors are also important for development of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and include T-cell depletion of donor marrow and HLA-mismatching between donor and recipient, known to lead to dysregulation of T-lymphocyte function. These factors set up an environment of proliferative stimuli which cannot be controlled by the recovering immune system, setting the stage for a secondary cancer. The role of irradiation is becoming more prominent in association with solid tumors, particularly in aplastic anemia patients conditioned with irradiation. The final event of tumor expression is most likely the result of a cascade of events, perhaps initiated with the conditioning regimen or with stimuli to proliferation, which, after later signals, leads to malignant transformation. For lymphoproliferative disorders, the time of latency is shorter than for solid tumors, suggesting a different molecular mechanism. The incidence of oncogene expression or mutation in tumor suppressor genes in these solid tumor patients has not been investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']","['CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31787/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,62,,,,,,,,,

While the thermal sensitivity of CFU-L from a murine leukemia cell line (WEHI 3-B) was not statistically significant when compared to that of CFU-L from HL-60 (D0 values 17.0 versus 22.8 min), the vertical difference between the parallel regression lines suggested an approximately three-fold greater survival for human CFU-L. Although carefully controlled hyperthermia is an easy purging technique, the relevance of murine data to human clinical practice must be considered critically.","['National Institute of Haematology, Blood Transfusion and Immunology, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary translation product of the viral envelope gene (env), representing a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular M(r) of 55,000 (gp55), was isolated from cell lysates by immunoaffinity chromatography and purified by preparative SDS/PAGE. Radiolabelled oligosaccharides, released from tryptic glycopeptides by treatment with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, were characterized chromatographically, by enzymic digestion and by acetolysis. The results revealed that F-SFFVA gp55 obtained from this source carried predominantly oligomannose type sugar chains with five to nine mannoses. As a characteristic feature, glycans with seven to nine mannoses contained, in part, an additional glucose residue. Although the amount of glucosylated species found was higher in F-SFFVA gp55 (about 25% of total endo-H-sensitive oligosaccharides) than in gp55 of the corresponding polycythaemia-inducing variant (F-SFFVP, 16.3%), the overall glycosylation pattern of the F-SFFVA env product closely resembled that of F-SFFVP gp55 [Strube et al. (1988) J Biol Chem 263:3762-71]. Hence, our results demonstrate that the different intracellular processing and transport of the primary F-SFFVA env product cannot be attributed to aberrant trimming of its oligomannose type glycans.","['Biochemisches Institut am Klinikum der Universitat, Giessen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Probably the most sought challenge, which over the years has been met by consistent disillusion, has been immunotherapy. With little doubt the goal of stimulating the immune system of the host in the hope of controlling or eradicating residual disease following more conventional ablative regimens, remains conceptually a highly desirable approach. During the last few years an innovative strategy, based on the in vitro demonstration that IL2 is capable of inducing a previously unrecognized cytotoxic function directed against primary tumours and named LAK, has been applied with some success in solid tumour patients. Here, we shall review the pre-clinical data which indicate that IL2-based immunotherapy may be employed also in the management of patients with acute leukaemia. Clinical data which support a possible in vivo antileukaemic effect of IL2 are presented. The clinicohaematological modifications, as well as the biological modulations induced in the patients following the administration of IL2 are also discussed. In view of the recent demonstration that the IL2 gene can be successfully transduced into human neoplastic cells, we finally discuss the rationale of gene transfer approaches in an attempt to overcome some of the limitations associated with the administration of high doses of exogenous IL2.","['Dipartimento di Scienze, Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",,,,62,,,,,,,,,

Over this period results have improved and indications for treatment have become more clearly defined. Over 60% of adults and over 70% of children with poor risk ALL in first remission, and 30-40% of patients in second remissions can be expected to achieve long term leukaemia-free survival. Factors implicated in the cure of ALL by BMT are the myeloablative preparative regimen, a graft-versus-leukaemia effect, and post transplant chemotherapy. Improved results of chemotherapy have changed the perceived indications for BMT in ALL and have led to controversy over the best treatment approach. However there is good evidence to show that BMT offers a better chance of leukaemia free survival in certain very poor risk categories. These include Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL, remission induction failures, and children in second remission who relapse after adequate chemotherapy. Particular issues in the use of BMT in ALL are the prevention and management of extramedullary leukaemia, the treatment of relapse following BMT, and the prevention and monitoring of late effects. In the future the use of unrelated donors, and a continuing fall in transplant related morbidity and mortality will extend the use of BMT in poor risk ALL.","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, NHLBI, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,,,97,,,,,,,,,

Common threads which run throughout the literature in this area of clinical research are the importance of young age with increased vulnerability to long-term treatment induced sequelae and the relatively large contribution of radiation as compared with chemotherapy in the pathogenesis of adverse sequelae. Previous retrospective studies of long-term childhood ALL survivors focused on neuropsychologic changes and anatomic changes in the CNS after cranial irradiation. More recent retrospective studies have made the following new observations: (i) the high frequency of significant short adult stature in those less than 6 years of age at diagnosis who received 24 Gy cranial irradiation; (ii) actuarial risk of 2.5% of developing a second malignancy with approximately one-half of secondary malignancies occurring in the CNS in children 5 years of age or less who received cranial irradiation; (iii) the association of secondary ANLL with epipodophyllo-toxin use, and (iv) delayed cardiac toxicity despite anthracycline dosage reduction. Current therapy regimens, especially in high-risk patients, are both more successful and more intensive than those used in the past. While it will be another decade before many of the long-term sequelae begin to emerge, one can anticipate, based on current experience, some of the problems that will occur.","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,51,,,,,,,,,

In all, 87 patients were enrolled, 22 (eight CNS positive) in study ALL-BFM-81, 24 (seven CNS positive) in study ALL-BFM-83, and 41 (none CNS positive) in study ALL-BFM-86. The estimated 5-year duration of EFS was 40% in study ALL-BFM-81, 50% in study ALL-BFM-83, and 78% in study ALL-BFM-86 (minimal follow-up 36 months). Nineteen of 24 relapses occurred while on therapy or shortly thereafter. In study ALL-BFM-81, the CNS was the most frequent site of failure. In ALL-BFM-83 there were no isolated CNS relapses but more BM relapses occurred. In ALL-BFM-86 localized manifestations were the predominant site of failure, no isolated BM relapses occurred, and only one CNS relapse was diagnosed. No single parameter exerted a consistent influence on outcome with one exception. The presence of residual disease after the first two courses was correlated with an increased risk of therapy failure. Our conclusions from the three studies are listed below. An intensive, short-pulse therapy delivered within a 4 month period is highly effective in the treatment of B-ALL. Prolonged therapy duration is of no value. In addition to fractionated cyclophosphamide-ifosfamide, a 24-h infusion of HD-MTX5 g/m2 in conjunction with an i.t. therapy is a very important component for prevention of both systemic and CNS relapses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Medical School Hannover, Department of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology, Germany.']",,,,40,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission rates up to 95% can now be achieved in children and 70-85% in adults; disease free survival rates are 70 and 30% respectively. To improve results further high dose treatment has been included, particularly to overcome drug resistance and to reach cytostatic levels in the sanctuary sites, such as the central nervous system. High dose cytarabine in combination with other cytostatic drugs, preferentially anthracyclines, seems to be of benefit for high risk adult ALL patients. High dose methotrexate, mostly explored in childhood ALL, is now also included in a variety of combinations in the treatment of adult ALL, but its effectiveness remains to be established. Substantial progress has been achieved in adult T-ALL and B-ALL with survival rates of 40-50%. The optimal form and duration of maintenance therapy in adult ALL is not yet clear but general omission of maintenance leaves patients with an inferior outcome. Which subgroups of adult ALL require maintenance and in what form still requires investigation. In recent adult ALL trials with intensive chemotherapy similar prognostic factors for disease free survival have emerged. Of adverse influence are delayed time to reach CR (more than 4/5 weeks), a high initial white blood cell count, higher age (above 50 or 60 years), and probably the immunological subtypes pre-T-ALL, pre-B-ALL, My(+)-ALL; of very adverse influence in elderly patients is the karyotype t(9;22) or the corresponding BCR/ABL gene rearrangement. High risk adult ALL patients with one or more of these adverse factors are candidates for allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in first remission. Whether all adult ALL patients are candidates for BMT in first CR is currently being explored in large prospective randomized trials.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Frankfurt, Germany.']",,,,91,,,,,,,,,

Beginning in the 1970s, series of well-designed protocols have produced valuable information that has permitted the development of curative therapy for more than two-thirds of patients. This success emphasizes the importance of controlled, carefully analysed therapeutic studies, which pay dividends for many years by providing a sound basis for future developments. Experienced biostatisticians should be involved early in the development of clinical trials to ensure that research questions can be reliably answered in terms of the size and composition of the patient sample and in terms of accrual time. Despite extensive pre-planning, a protocol may require early termination due to unexpected results that compromise the integrity of the initial design (Rivera et al, 1985). Thus, periodic treatment assessment of the trial is crucial to a successful outcome. Extended follow-up of patients is a requirement in every leukaemia study since relapses may occur many years after diagnosis, especially if patients have a lower risk of treatment failure (Rivera et al, 1979). The quality of long-term survival must also be well documented because all protocols include toxic therapy (Ochs and Mulhern 1988). Every physician treating children with ALL would like to select therapy that is both effective and well tolerated. Unfortunately, this is not always possible when patients have high-risk features. Secondary AML, deaths in remission and fatal organ toxicity (Steinherz, 1991c) are equally devastating complications of current chemotherapy for ALL, and no single protocol can be recommended over any other. Patients with ALL may be equally well served by any of several different protocols. The practice of administering 6MP + MTX alone and usually orally as continuation treatment has been virtually abandoned. Today, most children receive intensified chemotherapy in one schedule or another, including good-risk patients on POG protocols who, although treated largely with antimetabolite-based programmes, receive high-dose chemotherapy during the initial 6 months of treatment. In view of the more favourable results attained with reinduction therapy in recent CCG studies, these investigators also recommend such an approach for children with better-risk ALL. We fully agree. Regrettably, with the success of current regimens for higher-risk ALL, it has not been possible to exclude all toxic agents that may induce serious late complications.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,93,,,,,,,,,

The nucleocytoplasmic ratio is high with just a small cytoplasmic rim in many cases. The cytoplasm tends to be moderately basophilic. Usually, though not in each instance, it is agranular and free of vacuoles. The chromatin is more condensed than in AML and the nucleoli tend to be indistinct. The FAB classification of haematological malignancies separates ALL into three categories: ALL L1, L2, and L3. However, just the identification of the L3 variant is of major importance. The L3 cells are medium sized to large and are characterized by intensely basophilic and moderately abundant cytoplasm with prominent cytoplasmic vacuolation in the bone marrow but not necessarily in the peripheral blood. According to our experience there is a high but not universal correlation of the L3 phenotype as defined by morphology with the immunologically defined B-ALL with surface expression of immunoglobulins. Until recently, acute leukaemias proving negative for all cytochemical tests especially for the PAS reaction and for the focal type of acid phosphatase, were termed 'acute undifferentiated leukaemia' (AUL). However, this morphological/cytochemical diagnosis may be confused with the immunological diagnosis of unclassifiable leukaemia. Since almost any of these cases can be recognized as ALL or AML by immunology, the term AUL should be reserved for cases which can be classified neither by morphology/cytochemistry nor by immunology. The morphological and cytochemical distinction of ALL from poorly differentiated AML remains a problem, especially if the FAB criteria for distinguishing ALL from AML by cytochemistry (3% of the blasts positive for peroxidase) are applied rigidly. A small but significant percentage of poorly differentiated leukaemias have less than 3% of the blasts positive for peroxidase and the myeloid nature of the leukaemia can be identified by cytochemistry. The absence of blasts being positive for peroxidase is no reliable indicator for the lymphatic nature of a leukaemia, even if the PAS reaction is typical for ALL. The morphological diagnosis of ALL needs confirmation by immunology in each instance.","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat Kiel, Germany.']",,,,34,,,,,,,,,

However, relapse and eventual treatment failure occur in many cases receiving identical treatment, presumably as a result of failure to eradicate MRD. While for many years marrow morphology has been the standard by which leukaemic remission has been assessed, more sensitive techniques have been developed for detection of MRD including immunophenotypic analysis, and as discussed in this chapter, methods which detect leukemia-associated clonal genetic changes at the karyotypic and genomic levels. Table 10 lists the applicability and sensitivity of various markers used in MRD analysis in ALL. It is apparent that of the karyotypic and molecular approaches described, only PCR-based strategies for detection of either leukaemia-specific translocations or clonal Ag receptor rearrangements are reliably applicable to a high proportion of both B- and T-ALL at sufficiently high sensitivity. Initial clinical studies of patients undergoing therapy for ALL using a variety of PCR-based methods suggest that in some cases a persistent or increasing level of residual disease may be predictive for clinical relapse, although a number of technical factors and the phenomena of oligo-clonality and clonal evolution may limit the usefulness of this analysis in a few instances. From current available data it appears that in order to define the potential predictive value of PCR detection of MRD a large number of patients will need to be prospectively assessed over several years at multiple time points during and after therapy, preferably using more than one semi-quantitative PCR approach. In addition to reliable prediction of clinical relapse allowing appropriate individual treatment modification, progress in the molecular detection of MRD in ALL is also likely to be of benefit in the assessment of the efficacy of autograft purging and the evaluation of new therapeutic strategies such as the use of biological response modifiers to eliminate a low tumour burden.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital Medical School, Hampstead, London, UK.']",,,,247,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: English-language literature published between 1953 and 1993 was analyzed; pertinent literature was reviewed. STUDY SELECTION: Emphasis was placed on pharmacologic studies and clinical trials involving busulfan therapy both in myeloproliferative disorders and in conditioning regimens for autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. DATA EXTRACTION: Data from both pediatric and adult studies were evaluated; emphasis was placed on the relationship between plasma concentrations of busulfan and its efficacy and toxicity. DATA SYNTHESIS: Busulfan has been used widely at conventional dosages (1-12 mg/d) for the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Busulfan at high doses (usually 16 mg/kg) given with other cytotoxic drugs (especially cyclophosphamide) is a common preparative regimen in patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for acute or chronic leukemia and other nonmalignant disorders (e.g., hemoglobinopathies, inborn error of immune system, congenital metabolic disorders). Pharmacokinetics of high-dose busulfan are age-dependent. Busulfan systemic exposure and, thus, tissue and tumor exposure are lower in children than with adults. Relationships between toxicity (principally neutropenia, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, incidence of seizures) and drug exposure were found for busulfan. CONCLUSIONS: Busulfan is a useful, sufficiently safe drug in the treatment of patients with CML. At higher dosages, busulfan is a fundamental part of myeloablative therapies for patients undergoing BMT. As the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of busulfan is further understood, there is great potential for improving treatment outcome. An assessment of maximal tolerated exposure determined by therapeutic drug monitoring may decrease the incidence and lethality of regimen-related toxicities.","['Department of Pharmacology, Istitato di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Policlinico S.

The median survival of the 146 patients who did not undergo bone marrow transplantation was 5.6 years, with 49% +/- 4% surviving more than 6 years. The most important predictor of survival was positive response to ATG (P < 0.001), which was observed in 48% of patients. Among pretreatment variables, disease severity was the best predictor of survival. Patients with moderate AA (MAA) had significantly better survival than those with severe (SAA) or very severe (VSAA) disease (P = 0.04). The 6-year actuarial survival rates of the three groups were 71% +/- 9%, 48% +/- 7% and 38% +/- 7%, respectively. Cox regression analysis found disease severity to be the only pretreatment variable significantly associated with survival (P = .02). Patient age, sex, disease etiology, concurrent treatment with androgens, or duration of ATG therapy were not associated with differences in survival or response to ATG. Late clonal hematologic complications (ie, myelodysplasia, acute myelogenous leukemia) were observed in 5 of the 77 patients followed for more than 2 years after ATG treatment. In addition, one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and three solid tumors occurred in the ATG-treated patients. The survival of 56 ATG-treated patients with SAA or VSAA between the ages of 16 and 43 did not differ significantly from that of 55 adult AA patients who underwent bone marrow transplant (BMT) during the same time period (P = 0.6). However, 6-year survival rates improved from 43% for patients transplanted before 1984, to 72% for those who underwent BMT between 1984 and 1989.

Morphologic evidence of maturation arrest, karyotypic abnormalities, and progression to blast crisis are infrequent events. Viral infections and other reactive processes can initially mimic the clinical course of JCML, creating diagnostic problems. Because of the rarity of JCML and technical limitations, formal clonality studies have not been reported previously. Nine female JCML patients were identified by clinical criteria, characteristic 'spontaneous' in vitro cell growth, and negative cultures and titers for various viral agents. Peripheral blood and bone marrow samples were obtained at the time of diagnosis for cell separation and RNA and DNA isolation. To assess clonality, X-chromosome inactivation patterns were evaluated using three different, recently developed polymerase chain reaction-based clonality assays. All nine female JCML patients showed evidence for monoclonal origin of mononuclear cells at the time of diagnosis. Cell separation studies further traced the monoclonal origin back to at least the most primitive myeloid progenitor cell. Reversion to a polyclonal state was demonstrated after bone marrow transplant and also in one patient following treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid. This demonstration of clonality in JCML delineates it from the reactive processes and provides a basis for molecular genetic strategies to identify causally associated mutations.","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.""]","['CA-13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-56072/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the potential pathogenetic significance of this abnormality, we more precisely mapped the breakpoint within exon 8 and studied the expression of the translocated gene by S1 nuclease mapping of EpoR transcripts and chemical crosslinking of labeled erythropoietin (Epo) to TF-1 cell surface receptors. Transcripts from the abnormal gene were found to be highly expressed in relation to normal EpoR transcripts in TF-1 cells. The breakpoint predicted by S1 mapping of abnormal EpoR transcripts agreed closely with that determined by Southern analysis. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-Epo to TF-1 cells showed an abnormal, low-molecular-weight cross-linked species directly recognized by anti-EpoR antibodies and present in considerable excess over the normal EpoR. Karyotype analysis showed that each of 10 TF-1 cell metaphases had, in addition to multiple other alterations, one chromosome 19 with additional chromosomal material translocated onto the short arm at 19p13.3, the location of the EpoR gene. We conclude that the structurally abnormal EpoR gene in TF-1 cells is highly expressed and produces an abnormal protein. We speculate that the chromosomal material brought into the EpoR locus by translocation is responsible for the high level of expression. We hypothesize that this translocation participated in the evolution of the erythroleukemia from which TF-1 cells were derived.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH.']","['CA15083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44134/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to identify the variable (V), joining (J), and diversity (D) region TCR beta-chain genes expressed by CD3+ LGL leukemic cells in an attempt to gain insights into the etiology of this disorder. Twelve patients with LGL leukemia were studied, including seven with both LGL leukemia and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA is also a disease of unknown etiology that occurs frequently in patients with LGL leukemia. Clonally expanded T cells that express specific TCR V beta genes have been identified in fluid and tissue specimens from the joints of patients with RA. In this study, V beta expression was determined by PCR using a panel of 22 unique V beta primers to amplify cDNA prepared from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). A dominant V beta gene product was readily apparent in all patients. To confirm that the dominant V beta gene originated from a clonal expansion, DNA fragments corresponding to the dominant V beta genes were subcloned into plasmids and independently isolated recombinants were sequenced. V-D-J region sequences that occurred repeatedly indicated clonality. The V beta and J beta genes expressed by the leukemic cells showed a pattern of distribution that followed the frequency with which these genes are represented in the peripheral blood. The residues corresponding to the third complementarity-determining region of the TCR beta chain were different in all cases. A specific pattern of VDJ usage was not identified for those patients with both LGL leukemia and RA; however, utilization of V beta-6 by LGL clones (N = 3) was observed only in the setting of RA. These data suggest that leukemic CD3+ LGL cells have been clonally transformed in a random fashion with respect to the TCR beta chain.","['Department of Medicine, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland.']","['CA 46903/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 54552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is, as yet, no explanation for the discrepancy between the protein recognized by specific antibodies against mouse EpoR and the unexpectedly larger species that can be cross-linked to labeled Epo. It is unclear whether the product of an unidentified gene is included in the EpoR complex. In the present study, we directly compared the cross-linking patterns for human EpoR that were endogenously expressed in three types of Epo-responsive cell, and that was artificially expressed in nonhematopoietic cells after transfection with cDNA for human EpoR. We observed that 85-kD and 105-kD proteins formed ligand-receptor complexes in all the human Epo-responsive cells and, furthermore, that the formation of a complex derived from the 70-kD protein was dependent on the level of expression of the cloned EpoR mRNA in these cells. By contrast, a prominent cross-linked band derived from the 70-kD protein and a weaker band derived from the 80- to 85-kD protein, but no band derived from the 105-kD protein, could be shown in the case of nonhematopoietic cells transfected with the human EpoR cDNA. These observations suggest that the cloned cDNA for human EpoR alone does not allow generation of the complete EpoR in nonhematopoietic cells and that the 105-kD Epo-binding protein may represent the product of an as yet unidentified gene that is expressed in hematopoietic cells.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,['Blood. 1995 May 1;85(9):2641.

In both cases, periodogram analyses, by two methods, confirm the presence of several oscillations having periods in the range 20-100 min which tend to occur in (pseudo) periodic bursts. Insulin has been found to enhance these oscillations in a manner comparable with its effect on rhythmic variations in cell morphology.

Using anti-MAT antibodies, a 60 kDa form of MAT, referred to as rho was identified in peak I. Although rho represented the major MAT protein in crude erythrocyte extracts, the enzyme was very labile and accounted for only 6% of the total MAT activity. Peak II enzyme was stable, and consisted of the previously described catalytic alpha (53 kDa) subunit and the beta subunit (38 kDa), both of which are found in activated human lymphocytes and leukemic cells of lymphoid origin. Mature normal and polycythemic erythrocytes contained predominantly rho as the major MAT protein, while nucleated erythrocytes and reticulocytes contained predominantly the lambda (68 kDa), the major form found in resting human lymphocytes. Human erythroleukemic cells (HEL 92.1.7) contained the alpha, alpha' and beta subunits of MAT, and in this regard was indistinguishable from MAT found in activated lymphocytes and leukemic cells of lymphoid origin (Jurkat). Since rho was generated during the incubation of extracts from resting lymphocytes, which contain predominantly lambda, in the absence of protease inhibitors; the rho form of MAT appears to be derived from the lambda form by proteolytic cleavage.

In M3, M4 and M5 cells a very high LZ content was observed whereas the serum LZ activity was high in M4 and M5 and normal in M3. The intragranular LZ content was especially high in M5 and in most granules of M4 cells. The immunogold reaction (IGR) for LZ was also performed in cells previously reacted for myeloperoxidase (MPO). In M2 the granules showed definite positive MPO reactivity and low LZ density (granulocytic pattern), whereas in M5 we found high granular LZ content and weak or almost negative MPO activity (monocytic pattern). In M4 we found 'granulocytic' and 'monocytic' type of granules in the same cell. The IGR for LZ performed in post-embedded M5 cells which were previously subjected to phagocytosis of latex particles, showed granules that had moved toward the phagosome, releasing LZ without degranulation. The above findings and those showing normal serum LZ in M3 despite their high cellular LZ content, definitely indicate that only leukaemic M4 and M5 cells secrete LZ into their environment, explaining the high serum LZ observed in those leukaemias.","['Department of Medicine B, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, plasma cytokine levels of leucocytopenic patients with evolving sepsis have not been studied. We have prospectively measured plasma cytokines during chemotherapy-induced leucocytopenia (< 1 x 10(9)/l) in 50 patients with AML. Cytokine levels in patients with severe sepsis (n = 5) or septic shock (n = 8) were compared to those measured in 13 matched patients with uncomplicated febrile infections.

Peak concentrations measured within 48 h after onset of fever were related to fatal outcome. IL-1 beta was detected in less than 5% of all samples.

Bone marrow cells were obtained from four patients with advanced myeloma, where the marrow was heavily infiltrated with myelomatous plasma cells. Myeloma cells were isolated by immunomagnetic separation, using the high-affinity B-B4 monoclonal antibody. Following separation, cells were transduced with the LN retroviral vector, which carries the gene for neomycin phosphotransferase, by incubation in cell-free supernatant with or without a growth-factor combination of IL-3, IL-6 and SCF. After infection, the cells were cultured for 9 d in RPMI-1640 and 10% FCS, either in the presence or absence of the neomycin analogue G418. Transduction efficiency was 1.5-3.8%, when compared to the number of cells at initiation of the culture, and 5.0-50.0% when compared to the number of surviving infected cells cultured without G418. The gene transfer rate was similar whether or not growth factors were present during the retroviral infection. These preclinical data provide evidence that retroviral-mediated gene transfer into human myeloma cells is feasible, and form part of the basis for current clinical studies of gene marking of bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cells before autologous stem cell transplantation in multiple myeloma.","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of 12 patients with B-CLL examined expressed the t(14,18) translocation; however, all these, and seven other patients, expressed significant levels of bcl-2 protein. In vitro, IFN-alpha (500 U/ml over 18 h) increased bcl-2 expression on CLL cells (to 200 +/- 23% of control MCF, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, n = 10, P < 0.001). All of eight patients who received IFN-alpha (3 megaunits subcutaneously three times a week) demonstrated an increase in bcl-2 expression on circulating malignant cells. CLL cells undergo apoptotic cell death when cultured in vitro (35.6 +/- 10.3% DNA fragmentation after 18 h, n = 10). In the presence of IFN-alpha, however, DNA fragmentation was reduced to 6.6 +/- 5.8% (n = 10, P < 0.001). IFN-alpha also protected CLL cells against apoptosis induced by hydrocortisone and gamma irradiation (reducing DNA fragmentation from 63.9 +/- 12.6% to 10.8 +/- 4.5% and from 80 +/- 2.9% to 5.4 +/- 1.6%, respectively, P < 0.001 for both). The protective effect of IFN-alpha was dose dependent, and maintained for up to 24 h. Our data demonstrate that bcl-2 expression and apoptosis of CLL cells can be influenced by cytokines.

Within each adhesion system. ATRA was able to differentially regulate distinct molecules. Furthermore, it was able to exert effects specific for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) blast cells, as well as to induce a series of non-cytotype-restricted phenotypic changes. An impressive feature of ATRA induction was a simultaneous increase in the expression of CD15, CDw65 and CD11b on leukaemic promyelocytes. The sialylated antigen CD15s, however, showed results independent from the other two carbohydrates (CD15 and CDw65), suggesting a differential enzymatic regulation within the selectin ligands system. In spite of the well-recognized expression of CD11a throughout all stages of normal myeloid differentiation, APL blast cells were found to virtually lack LFA-1 expression. Moreover, ATRA was unable to promote an up-regulation of this antigen in APL, while inducing a frequent down-modulation in non-APL cases constitutively expressing this antigen. In APL cases ATRA generated an asynchronous phenotype (CD15+, CDw65+, CD11b+, CD11a-), undetectable on normally maturing myeloid cells, but consistent with the concept that incomplete differentiation, in terms of surface molecule expression, can be sufficient to obtain therapeutic results.","['Divisione di Oncologia Sperimentale C, Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori di Napoli, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pretreatment characteristics, response to VAD therapy, and overall outcome were analysed in patients 60 years or older, and compared to younger patients. Fifty-two patients (19%) were 60 years or older. Compared with younger patients, elderly patients with ALL had a significantly worse performance status at presentation (P < 0.001); higher incidences of FAB L2 morphology (P = 0.03), thrombocytopenia (P < 0.01), hypoalbuminaemia (P < 0.001) and renal dysfunction (P = 0.03); and trends for worse anaemia (P = 0.06) and a higher rate of myeloid markers positivity (P = 0.06). With VAD induction therapy, elderly patients had a lower CR rate than younger patients following two induction courses (CR rate 58% v 82%; P < 0.01), and overall (CR rates 65% v 90%; P < 0.01). The response rate to VAD chemotherapy, however, appeared superior to the 30-35% CR rates reported from other series in elderly ALL patients. The lower CR rate was due to both higher induction mortality (P = 0.02) and more resistant disease (P < 0.01). The long-term CR rate was 20% in elderly patients achieving CR, but the overall survival was poor (< 10% at 3 years). There were strong associations between older age and other poor prognostic features. However, multivariate analyses identified older age to be an independent poor prognostic factor for response to chemotherapy. In summary, elderly patients with ALL have an appreciable CR rate with the VAD regimens. Patients achieving CR may have durable remissions. The myelosuppression-associated mortality in both remission induction and maintenance may be reduced with the addition of growth factors in both treatment phases, and by using standard maintenance therapy without consolidation-intensification phases.","['Department of Hematology, M.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples and medical records were collected from 290 Ghanaian patients with suspected AIDS in 1990 and 1992. Seroprevalence of HIV-1, HIV-2 and human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV-1) were investigated by the particle agglutination method, indirect immunofluorescence assay, the monoepitope enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. RESULTS: The specimens were classified into five serologic categories: 78 were HIV-1-positive (26.9%), 25 were HIV-2-positive (8.6%), 17 dual-positive (5.9%), 16 indeterminate (5.5%) and 154 seronegative (53.1%). No significant difference was found between the clinical symptoms of patients with HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection. Of the patients, 14 (4.8%) were HTLV-1-seropositive, of whom 11 were also HIV-positive, indicating a significant correlation between the two groups of viral infections (P < 0.01). However, there was no evidence of an increase in severity of symptoms in cases of dual infection with HTLV-1 and HIV. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-1 infection is now dominant in Ghana in contrast to our previous survey in 1986 which showed the dominance of HIV-2. The change in seroprevalence suggests that an HIV-1 epidemic has been developing in recent years in this country, where HIV-2 was originally endemic. A relatively high prevalence of dual-reactive specimens implies the existence of highly cross-reactive strains of HIV or frequent coinfection with HIV-1 and HIV-2 in the region. The large number of seronegative patients with clinically diagnosed AIDS raises the question of the inadequacy of AIDS definitions based on clinical manifestations only.","['Research Center for Immunodeficiency Virus, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,"['PIP: 098541', 'POP: 00233121']",,,['PIP'],"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Africa', 'Africa South Of The Sahara', 'Biology', 'Developing Countries', 'Diseases', 'English Speaking Africa', 'Examinations And Diagnoses', 'Ghana', '*Hematological Effects', 'Hemic System', '*Hiv Infections', '*Laboratory Examinations And Diagnoses', 'Measurement', 'Physiology', '*Prevalence', '*Research Report', '*Viral Diseases', 'Western Africa']",['PIP: TJ: AIDS.']

The plaque-like or nodular lesions were solitary in 10 and multiple in eight patients. Immunohistochemistry showed well-defined B- and T-cell areas. Sheets of monotypic plasma cells occurred either interfollicularly or adjacent to the sclerotic stroma, with expression of IgG/kappa in 14 and IgG/lambda in six cases. In one patient with multiple lesions, one sample contained polyclonal plasma cells, whereas the other specimen showed light chain restriction. In another patient, disease recurred with a polytypic cutaneous plasma cell infiltrate. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements in eight of 13 cases, which was confirmed by Southern blot analysis in three samples. Clonal T-cell receptor chain gene rearrangements were not detected. Disease progression to overt malignant lymphoma did not occur within the follow-up period of up to 12 years, but recurrent disease was seen in three patients.

Tumor samples were obtained from patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6 cases) or non-Hodgkin's malignant lymphoma (4 cases). Lymph nodes (n = 9), spleen (n = 3), and blood (n = 5) were analyzed. JSB-1 MoAb detected P-gp in 4 of 12 cases (33.3%) on either frozen sections or ModAMEX processed sections, and in 6 of 17 cases (35.3%) on frozen cytospin preparations. The sensitivity of JSB-1 was significantly improved when fresh cytospin preparations were used with an incidence of P-gp positive samples as high as 70.6% (P < .05). C219 MoAb was unreactive with lymphoid cells whatever the technique used, whereas this antibody stained stromal cells. MRK 16 MoAb was equally reactive to JSB-1 on fresh cytospin preparations, but unreactive when the other preparations were used. The specificity of JSB1 MoAb was confirmed by both Western blot analysis and Rhodamine 123 efflux assay. The authors used JSB-1 MoAb on fresh cytospin smears prepared from 28 CLL patients. Overall incidence of P-gp positive cases was 39.2%. Univariate analysis showed that P-gp expression was correlated with prior therapy, refractoriness to treatment, Rai stratification, and time of tissue storage after diagnosis. The authors recommend the use of JSB-1 on fresh cytospin preparations for the immunocytochemical detection of P-gp in chronic lymphoid disorders.","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 myeloid precursor cells and CD34-positive normal stem cells also were analyzed. In the normal cells, staining was confined to monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and myeloid precursors. No labelling was seen of normal or activated lymphoid cells. Purified CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitors were uPAR negative, but expressed uPAR during differentiation in short-term liquid culture stimulated in vitro by recombinant interleukin (IL)-1, IL-3, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and stem cell factor. Enhanced uPAR expression was also seen in HL-60 cells after induction of differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide or 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. In lymphomas and leukemias, the staining pattern was similar to that seen in the normal cells with labelling of monocytic and myeloid that seen in the normal cells with labelling of monocytic and myeloid malignancies, but not of the neoplastic cells in B-cell or T-cell lymphomas or Hodgkin's disease. In conclusion, uPAR is a differentiation marker for myeloid and monocytic cells, and may act to facilitate migration of these cells in normal and pathologic conditions by cell-associated plasminogen activation. Whether expression of uPAR in myeloid and monocytic malignancies relates to their growth and behavior will be an important topic for investigations in the future.","['Department of Hematology, Herlev Hospital, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The data also revealed a time-course response in the differentiation induction. Moreover, the U937 cell growth was significantly inhibited by the treatment of PMA and IFN-gamma. These results suggest that PMA and IFN-gamma coupled the regulation of U937 cell growth and differentiation. It was found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was expressed by the stimulated U937 cells. The specific monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha diminished the effects of PMA and IFN-gamma on the growth and differentiation of U937 cells.

The observation that clonogenic growth of malignant cells can be induced in vitro has led to the development of therapeutic concepts that aim to increase the sensitivity of cells to cytostatic and cytotoxic agents by priming them with GM-CSF. In in vitro experiments, preincubating leukemic cells with recombinant cytokines including GM-CSF led to a consistent, dose-dependent increase in the cytotoxicity of cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). This effect has since been observed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) although its mechanism is not yet entirely clear. It seems that GM-CSF increases the relative number of cells in the S phase of the cell cycle and enhances the activity of DNA polymerases, enzymes that are essential to nucleotide incorporation into DNA. Based on these experimental results, numerous clinical trials have investigated the role of GM-CSF in priming leukemic blasts before chemotherapy. These studies will allow us to determine whether our in vitro observations of increased cytotoxicity translate into higher remission rates and durations, and will help us to identify the patient subgroups most likely to benefit from this therapeutic approach.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",,,,29,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a historical cohort study. The observed numbers of newly diagnosed cases of lymphohematopoietic malignancies in the study population were compared with expected numbers based on the national rates. The study took place in the Danish reinforced plastic industry, in which high exposure levels of styrene occur frequently in an environment free of most other suspected carcinogens. Altogether 36,525 male employees of 386 companies producing reinforced plastics and 14,254 nonstyrene exposed employees of similar industries were studied. RESULTS: An insignificantly increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.22 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.88-1.65] was found for leukemia among all employees of the reinforced plastics industry. Workers employed in the 1960s (the period with the highest recorded styrene levels) or in companies with the highest exposure probability showed increased SIR values of 1.54 (95% CI 1.04-2.19) and 1.38 (95% CI 0.75-2.32), respectively. Both estimates increased when a 10-year latency period was considered. CONCLUSIONS: An increased risk of leukemia was shown for workers in the early phase of the reinforced plastics industry in Denmark. If this association is not due to chance or confounding, the most likely cause is styrene exposure.","['Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure to styrene was reconstructed through job histories and environmental and biological monitoring data. Cause-specific national death rates were used as the reference. Poisson regression was applied for internal comparisons. RESULTS: Among the exposed workers, no excess was observed for mortality from all neoplasms. Mortality from neoplasms of the lymphatic and hematopoietic tissues increased with time since first exposure and average level of exposure to styrene, but was not consistently associated with duration of exposure or with cumulative exposure.

The effector cells in these experiments were human promyelocytic leukemia cells HL60 induced to differentiate into macrophages. Very similar results were obtained with the murine squamous carcinoma SCCVII cells treated with PDT and subsequently admixed with mouse peritoneal macrophages. This effect increased with PDT dose and reached its maximum (i.e. complete or nearly complete release of the radioactive label) with the photodynamic treatment that was lethal to 40-50% of cells. In contrast, the PDT treatment of normal mouse kidney cells resulted in only a very limited enhancement of their cytolysis by mouse peritoneal macrophages. The exposure of A549 cells to X-ray irradiation had not affected the macrophage-mediated killing of these cells. The PDT survival curves of A549 cells cultured either alone or with the effector cells showed that the presence of macrophages even at very low effector: target cells ratios enhanced the PDT response of tumor cells. The enhancement ratio of 3.6 (at S = 0.01) was achieved with the effector: target cell ratio 2.5:1, which was the highest ratio tested with this assay. It is suggested that macrophages may recognize potentially repairable damage induced by PDT in tumor cells (presumably lipid fragments exposed in damaged cellular membranes), which helps them to identify the affected cells as their targets.","['Cancer Imaging, B.C.

Flow cytometric analyses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells indicated that the BLV+PL animals had more B lymphocytes, with a concomitant decrease in CD2 positive cells when compared with the BLV- group.

In this work we report that another motif of the 21bp repeats is also required for the Tax activation. Gel retardation--with the wild type or mutant 21bp repeats--revealed that cellular factors from HeLa cells were specifically bound to the center (CRE-like element) and the 3' region of the repeats, which contains a CAGCTG consensus AP-4 binding site. In vivo analysis using the synthetic 21bp repeats indicated that beyond the consensus CRE-like motif, the AP-4 site is also essential for Tax activation. To determine the role of AP-4 in BLV Tax trans activation, we used the AP-4 cDNA in antisense transient assays. In the in vivo experiments the antisense AP-4 RNA resulted in strongly decreased Tax activation. On the basis of these results we conclude that AP-4 is a good candidate of cellular factors involved in BLV Tax trans activation.","['Institute of Biochemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged.']",,,,,PMC523750,,,,,,,,

Many studies have used mouse leukemia L1210/0 as a reference wild-type cell line, and cisplatin-resistant subclones have been derived from it. Increased DNA excision repair capacity is thought to play a key role in the acquired cisplatin resistance, and this has influenced development of drugs for clinical trials. We report here that the L1210/0 line is in fact severely deficient in nucleotide excision repair of damaged DNA in vivo and in vitro. L1210/0 cell extracts could be complemented by extracts from repair-defective human xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or rodent excision repair cross-complementing (ERCC) mutant cells, except for XPG/ERCC5 mutants. Purified XPG protein could restore repair proficiency to L1210/0 extracts. Expression of mouse XPG mRNA was similar in all L1210 lines studied, suggesting a point mutation or small alteration of XPG in L1210/0 cells. The DNA repair capacity of a cisplatin-resistant subline, L1210/DDP10, is similar to that of type culture collection L1210 cells and to those of other normal mammalian cell lines. Nucleotide excision repair of DNA is thus clearly important in the intrinsic cellular defense against cisplatin. However, in contrast to what is generally believed, enhancement of DNA repair above the normal level in these rodent cells does not appear to be a mechanism of acquired resistance to the drug.","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, Clare Hall Laboratories, South Mimms, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom.']",,,,,PMC231955,,,,,,,,

To prevent or control this complication, we prepared EBV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines from donor leucocytes and infused them into ten allograft recipients. Three of the patients had shown signs of EBV reactivation, with or without overt lymphoproliferation, and the others received CTL infusions as prophylaxis. No patient developed any complication that could be attributed to the CTL infusions. In the three patients with EBV reactivation, EBV DNA concentrations (measured by semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR]), which had increased 1000-fold or more, returned to the control range within 3-4 weeks of immunotherapy. The most striking consequence was the resolution of immunoblastic lymphoma in a 17-year-old patient who received four CTL infusions (two 1 x 10(7)/m2 and two 5 x 10(7)/m2). Because the CTL had been genetically marked before infusion, we were able to show by PCR analysis that they persisted for 10 weeks after administration.

METHODS: A total of 814 females of child-bearing age were studied. The fertility of 627 females who received 131I therapy was compared to 187 untreated females. Birth histories of the children born from these women were registered. The carcinogenic effect was evaluated by comparing the incidence of tumors in 730 patients treated with 131I with an internal control group, as well as with local population incidence. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the fertility rate, birth weight and prematurity between the two groups. Only one case of a ventricular septal defect was observed in a child born to a women treated with 131I. The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of second tumors was 1.19 (95% CI: 0.76-1.77) in patients treated with 131I. An elevated SIR was registered for salivary gland tumors and melanoma. No case of leukemia was registered. CONCLUSION: The risk of long-term effects of 131I treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma is quite low.

The frequency and importance of secondary malignant disease will be reviewed. METHODS: The international literature was screened for reports concerning secondary solid cancers or leukemias in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy for malignant germ cell tumors. RESULTS: Patients with testicular germ cell tumors appear to have a twofold significantly increased risk (range, 0.7 to 3.4) for the development of secondary neoplasia. Apart from contralateral testicular cancers, which are not treatment-related, a largely elevated inherited risk for secondary cancers in patients with germ cell tumors seems unlikely. Radiotherapy is associated with a two- to threefold increased risk for secondary solid tumors (range, 1.3 to 7.5). A three- to sevenfold increased risk seems to exist for the development of solid tumors arising in the previous irradiation ports, such as stomach, pancreatic, bladder, and renal cell cancer, and sarcomas. To date, no significantly elevated risk for secondary solid tumors was observed after chemotherapy, even including regimens with alkylating agents, eg, cisplatin and ifosfamide. However, the risk associated with chemotherapy needs to be reexamined when the median follow-up of studies will exceed more than 10 years. An increased relative risk for secondary leukemias after chemotherapy (range, 1.3 to 3.4) has been reported in three of eight studies with more than 300 patients. Four large studies indicate a significantly elevated risk (range, 15 to 25) for the use of conventional-dose etoposide (< 2 g/m2 cumulative dose); however, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of less than 0.5% of all patients, this risk seems small. Concerning high-dose etoposide regimens (> 2 g/m2), further studies are necessary. CONCLUSION: Treatment for testicular cancer is associated with a small, but clearly identifiable, risk for secondary solid tumors that can be attributed to radiotherapy, and for secondary leukemia mainly associated with the use of chemotherapy. The frequency of secondary neoplasia observed is rather low, and in the light of the high cure rate, the risk for the individual patient appears negligible and should not alter current treatment strategies for metastatic testicular cancer.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hannover University Medical School, Germany.']",,,,58,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Adult inpatients about to undergo BMT for lymphoma, leukemia, or solid tumors were enrolled onto a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial that compared CIP (750 mg orally twice per day) with TMS (160 mg trimethoprim and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole orally twice per day). Subjects were stratified before randomization according to tumor and BMT type. Prophylaxis was begun within 96 hours of initiation of the BMT preparative regimen and continued until the onset of fever, signs or symptoms of infection, serious adverse effects, or recovery of the absolute granulocyte count (AGC) to > or = to 400/microL. RESULTS: Seventy-five CIP recipients and 71 TMS recipients were assessable for efficacy. No difference was noted between the two groups in occurrence of fever during neutropenia, time to onset of first fever, or overall infection rates. Ten bacteremias occurred in CIP recipients versus six in TMS recipients (P = .43). Ten episodes of Clostridium difficile enterocolitis occurred in TMS recipients versus no episodes in CIP recipients (P = .001). Four infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, including one bacteremia, occurred in TMS recipients versus none in CIP recipients (P = .06). No differences were noted in the incidence of rash or organ toxicity. TMS recipients had longer durations of granulocytopenia at AGC levels < or = to 500/microL and < or = to 100/microL than did CIP recipients (P = .08 for both comparisons). Mean peak and trough serum levels of CIP decreased significantly between weeks 1 and 2 of prophylaxis. CONCLUSION: CIP and TMS were equally safe and effective in the prevention of bacterial infections in BMT patients when the overall infection rate was used as the principal end point. TMS prophylaxis was associated with a higher incidence of C difficile enterocolitis and infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, as well as a trend toward prolongation of granulocytopenia.","['Laboratory of Infectious Diseases, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']","['AI129530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13849/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, methotrexate distribution to the ventricles is limited and highly variable following intralumbar dosing, and cytotoxic concentrations of methotrexate are not always achieved or sustained in the ventricular CSF. We used a nonhuman primate model to determine the effect of body position on the caudal distribution of an intralumbar dose of methotrexate. METHODS: Methotrexate (1.0 mg) was administered by intralumbar injection to four animals, which were then immediately placed either in an upright sitting position or in a prone position for 1 hour, then upright. Each animal served as its own control and was studied in each position on at least one occasion. RESULTS: The mean peak ventricular methotrexate concentration was 0.12 mumol/L (range, 0.091 to 0.20) in animals that were immediately placed upright, compared with 2.81 mumol/L (range, 0.21 to 8.9) in animals that remained prone for 1 hour. The mean area under the concentration-versus-time curves (AUC) was 0.51 mumol/L.h (range, 0.26 to 1.1) in the upright animals and 12.0 mumol/L.h (range, 0.9 to 35.4) in the prone animals.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report the results of the regimen of mitoxantrone on days 1 to 3, etoposide on days 8 to 10, and cytarabine on days 1 to 3 and 8 to 10 (EMA) in 133 patients, with a median follow-up of 40 months. RESULTS: Sixty percent of patients, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 51% to 68%, achieved complete remission (CR), including 44% (CI, 32% to 57%) of refractory patients and 76% (CI, 64% to 86%) of late first-relapse patients (P = .0002). Twenty-nine percent of patients did not respond to therapy, and 11% died from toxicity. Median duration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia was 31 days and 29 days, respectively. Severe nonhematologic toxicity included sepsis in 54% of patients and mucositis in 23%. Postinduction therapy included a second course of EMA in 27 patients, maintenance in 10, autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in 12, and allogeneic BMT in 13. Median survival of patients who did not have transplantation performed is 7 months, with 11% (CI, 4% to 18%) survival at 5 years. Median disease-free survival (DFS) is 8 months with 20% (CI, 8% to 32%) DFS at 5 years. Twenty-eight percent (CI, 15% to 44%) of nontransplanted patients who achieved CR had an inversion of CR duration. Previous refractoriness was the main factor associated with poor prognosis for CR achievement, DFS, and survival. CONCLUSION: These results confirm initial reports on TSC and show that approximately 20% of patients with first relapse after therapy can enjoy prolonged DFS using chemotherapy only.","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",,,['J Clin Oncol. 1995 Jan;13(1):1-4.

While the GPB gene produces one transcript, the GPA gene produces three or four transcripts of different sizes. To understand the mechanisms of production of the different transcripts and erythroid-specific expression, we characterized the transcripts and the transcriptional regulatory regions of the glycophorin A gene. The transcriptional start site was determined by primer extension and S1 nuclease protection analysis, and it was found that all of the transcripts start at one major site. The nucleotide sequence of the newly isolated longest GPA cDNA revealed several polyadenylation signal sequences. To determine which polyadenylation signals are utilized, cDNA clones encoding GPA were isolated from a cDNA library of human erythroleukemia cell line K562 and the 3'-regions of the cDNAs were specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. These results showed that five different polyadenylation signals of the GPA gene are utilized and the size and abundance of the transcripts are consistent with those detected by Northern blot analysis of K562 mRNAs. The 5'-flanking sequence was found to contain several binding motifs for the transcription factors, which were also found in other erythroid-specific genes. These motifs include the binding sites for the GATA-1 and NF-E2 erythroid-specific transcription factors, in addition to Sp1 transcription factor. The 5'-sequence from -750 to +36 relative to the transcriptional start site could confer only a low basal transcriptional activity in K562 cells and Friend erythroleukemia cells. This activity was significantly increased after Friend erythroleukemia cells were differentiated by dimethylsulfoxide. These results suggest that the 5' region regulates the glycophorin gene expression in erythroid-specific fashion.","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, CA 92037.']",['R01 CA33000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['GENBANK/L31860', 'GENBANK/L31861', 'GENBANK/L31862', 'GENBANK/L31863']",,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: This was a space-time cluster analysis. The large number of cases enabled division of the data into two sets, one for hypothesis generation and the other for hypothesis testing. SETTING: England, Scotland, and Wales. SUBJECTS: A national collection of 22,360 children aged 0-15 years with fatal cancers and leukaemias in the period 1953 to 1980. MAIN RESULTS: There was significant clustering among the leukaemias and lymphomas on date and place of birth (particularly among cases born within 1 km and up to 5 months apart), and on date and place of diagnosis (particularly among cases diagnosed from 3 to 5 km apart and up to 9 months apart). There was no clustering among the solid cancers. These findings were confirmed in two separate analyses of two separate sets of data. CONCLUSIONS: The birth clustering was significant among pairs diagnosed at differing ages, and diagnosis clustering was significant among pairs born at different times, and it was concluded that the two types of clustering must be regarded as separate and statistically independent phenomena. Both the birth and the diagnosis clusters comprised many independent pairs of cases, with no large multiple case clusters. This suggests the involvement of multiple time-space localised exposures to hazards with short and constant latent intervals; probably an infectious agent or an environmental toxin. Given the separate nature of the two types of clustering, exposure to more than one hazard may be involved.","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, The Medical School, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston.']",,,,,PMC1060101,,,,,,,,

This activation of MAPKs coincides with the formation of superoxide anion, which occurs through the activation of a multiple-component NADPH oxidase pathway. MAPKs have thus been suggested to be involved in signal transduction leading to the oxidative burst. To investigate whether MAPK activation plays a central role in the oxidative burst, we evaluated the effect of cAMP on MAPK activation induced by fMLP and PMA. cAMP inhibits many PMN functional responses, including the oxidative burst, and has recently been shown to reduce growth factor- and PMA-induced MAPK activities in a variety of cells. We found that in differentiated, neutrophil-like HL-60 cells, while cAMP reduced PMA-induced MAPK activation, it had no effect on fMLP-induced MAPK activation. Despite the presence of unchanged levels of activated MAPKs, the fMLP-induced oxidative burst was substantially diminished by cAMP. By contrast, O2-production induced by PMA remained the same even though MAPK activation was inhibited. In PMNs, although the levels of O2-induced by either 10 ng/ml or 100 ng/ml PMA were similar, only 100 ng/ml could stimulate MAPK activation, suggesting that the oxidative burst could occur in the absence of detectable activation of MAPKs.

In this study, the intracellular location of cPLA2 was determined using immunofluorescence microscopy and immuno-gold electron microscopy. In nonstimulated cells, cPLA2 is distributed throughout the cytosol and is excluded from the nucleoplasm. Following cell activation with calcium ionophore, most of the cPLA2 translocates to the nuclear envelope, and the enzyme remains there during the entire period that ionophore is present. With IgE/antigen stimulation for 5 min, approximately 20-30% of the cPLA2 translocates to the nuclear envelope, and after 30 min of stimulation, most of the enzyme returns to the cytosol. Measurement of intracellular calcium using the dye Fura-2/AM shows that the level of calcium rises immediately after antigen is added, remains high for about 30 s, and then declines back to resting levels. Activation with calcium ionophore produces a 10-fold larger release of arachidonate than does stimulation with IgE/antigen. Thus, the results suggest that the extent of membrane binding of cPLA2 correlates with the release of arachidonate and that the site of arachidonate liberation is the nuclear envelope where many of the enzymes that oxygenate this fatty acid are located.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']","['P01 HL034303/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI17758/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM562/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL50040/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['J Biol Chem 1995 Sep 1;270(35):20870'],,,,,,

METHOD: Data from a population-based case-control study of childhood cancer in Shanghai, including 82 lymphoma cases and 159 acute leukaemia cases and their age- and sex-matched community controls, were analysed. RESULTS: After adjustment for potentially confounding variables, a slight, although non-significant, reduction in risk of lymphoma was observed among children who were breastfed as infants versus those who were not (odds ratio [OR] = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.3-1.7). The reduction was somewhat greater for children who had been breastfed longer and appeared to pertain primarily to Hodgkin's disease and to cases diagnosed before the age of 6 years. As expected, there was no reduction in risk of acute leukaemia associated with breastfeeding. CONCLUSIONS: Although providing neither strong support for nor refuting the study hypothesis, these data suggest that if breastfeeding does reduce the risk of lymphoma, its protective effect among Chinese children is likely modest in magnitude and concentrated in certain subgroups defined by length of breastfeeding, age at diagnosis and histological subtype of cancer.","[""Department of Epidemiology, Shanghai Cancer Institute, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Middle East, North Africa and South America, 60-80% of Burkitt's lymphomas harbour EBV. These epidemiological differences suggest that either the endemicity of EBV or socio-economic conditions, or both, may influence the pathogenetic role of EBV in Burkitt's lymphoma. Since only meagre data are available on Asians, this study was performed to address this issue by studying cases from Hong Kong, where EBV seroconversion occurs in the first few years of life but the socio-economic conditions approach those of Western countries. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNAs (EBERs) was performed on paraffin sections of 18 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma. Labelling of the neoplastic cells was detected in five cases (27.7%). In contrast, among 54 cases of B-cell lymphomas of various subtypes studied for comparison, signals for EBER were detected in only one case each of T-cell-rich large B-cell lymphoma, anaplastic large cell lymphoma and Reed-Sternberg-like cells occurring in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma. The strong labelling with oligo-dT probe (which hybridized with the polyadenylated ends of mRNA) in all cases suggested that the negative results were genuine and not due to poor preservation of RNA in the tissues. Thus, among B-cell neoplasms occurring in Chinese, Burkitt's lymphoma shows a statistically stronger association (P < 0.01) with EBV than with other types of B-cell lymphoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such hepatosinusoidal neoplasms were found to demonstrate hepatomegaly but not lymphadenopathy, and all were diagnosed by a liver biopsy. Sixteen adult patients diagnosed with hepatosinusoidal leukaemia/lymphoma (six NK-cell leukaemia/lymphomas [NKLLs], five instances of MH, three T-cell malignant lymphomas [T-MLs], and two adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphomas [ATLLs] were examined for EBV by in situ hybridization, then were studied immunohistochemically and subjected to a DNA analysis. Among our five patients with MH, neoplastic cells showed T-cells, but no histiocytic markers, and they were considered to have either a T-cell or NK-cell lineage. All NKLLs, MHs and T-MLs, except for ATLLs accompanied by reactive hemophagocytic histiocytes, varied in number in each case. In situ hybridization revealed the presence of EBV in the nuclei of atypical cells in all of the six lymphoid neoplasms of NK-cell lineage. Each case of MH and each T-ML which represented EBV demonstrated no definite T-cell or histiocytic markers. Patients with ATLL did not reveal EBV. In all patients with hemophagocytosis, EBV was present in the nuclei of the neoplastic lymphocytes, but not in the hemophagocytic cells. Finally, the 16 cases were reclassified into eight cases with EBV-containing NKLLs, six T-MLs, and two ATLLs. In addition, no true histiocytic neoplasms were observed. The mechanism of hemophagocytosis may be therefore the production of lymphokines (macrophage-activating factors) by neoplastic lymphocytes. EBV-associated hepatosinusoidal leukaemia/lymphoma may thus contain a lymphoid neoplasm of NK-cell lineage, which made it difficult to be distinguished from the previously designated malignant histiocytosis.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the ability of TPO to activate the JAK/STAT pathway in megakaryocytic cell lines. We used either the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)- and/or erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent UT7 cell line in which the murine TPO receptor (mumpl) had been transfected (mumpl-UT7 transfectants) or the MO7E and DAMI cells which express endogenous human TPO receptors. We demonstrated that TPO activates the kinase JAK2 and a STAT5-like transcriptional factor but not STAT1, STAT2, STAT3 or STAT4, in a very rapid and transient manner. In order to better ascertain the specificity of the activation of STAT5-related factor by TPO, we investigated the effect of other cytokines/growth factors. Both GM-CSF and EPO activated the STAT5-like factor. In contrast, neither interferon (IFN)-gamma nor the mitogenic stem cell factor (SCF) activated STAT5, although IFN-gamma did activate STAT1 in those cells. The hematopoietic DNA binding activity related to STAT5 was identified as a p97 tyrosine-phosphorylated protein band which exhibited identical gel mobility to the mammary STAT5. Because v-mpl, a truncated form of the TPO receptor c-mpl, was shown to be oncogenic, we tested the activity of v-mpl on STAT5 and found STAT5 constitutively activated in two different v-mpl-expressing cells, the transiently transfected Cos7 cells and the stable v-mpl-UT7 transfectants. Overall, our data indicate that STAT5 is widely expressed in hematopoietic cells and activated by a number of cytokines, including TPO, GM-CSF and EPO, but not by IFN-gamma or SCF.","['U363 INSERM, ICGM, Hopital Cochin, Paris, France.']",,,,,PMC398403,,,,,,,,

Paraformaldehyde-fixed nuclei were protein digested with trypsin and hybridized simultaneously with a biotin- and DIG labeled chromosome specific centromere probe. A number of probes were tested in the suspension hybridizations. The method yielded fluorescent hybridization signals that allow discrimination between Y chromosome positive and negative nuclei when analyzed by flow cytometry. The method is especially suited for analysis of bone marrow cells derived from patients who have received a sex-mismatched allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Male leukemia cells with a trisomy for chromosome 8 were mixed with normal female cells and simultaneously hybridized in suspension with a DIG labeled probe specific for chromosome 8 and the biotin labeled Y chromosome probe. Y chromosome positive or negative nuclei were sorted onto microscope slides and subsequently classified as being leukemic or not by fluorescence microscopy, on the basis of the presence of a trisomy for chromosome 8. A 120-fold enrichment could be achieved when 300 Y positive nuclei were sorted from a mixture originally containing 0.5% leukemia cells. Given the specificity of the flow cytometry and FISH procedure, the combination of the two methods can reach a lower detection level of 1 per 250,000.","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immune control of tumours in immunosuppressed patients (immunoblastic lymphomas) can be exercised through a range of epitopes from cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) covering the full spectrum of latent EBV gene products. A subunit vaccine based on an EBV CTL epitope from one of the latent genes is about to undergo human trial. The options for immune control of Burkitt's lymphoma are more restricted. Antigen expression is limited to a single nuclear antigen, EBNA1, and Burkitt's lymphoma cells are unable to process EBV latent antigens, presumably because of a transcriptional defect in TAP1 and TAP2 genes. In contrast with earlier suggestions that EBNA1 is not a target for CTL, there is a class II-restricted epitope within EBNA1. EBV-infected B cells are unable to process this epitope endogenously. The most promising strategy for developing a vaccine against these tumours is to use a single subunit vaccine that incorporates multiple CTL epitopes from several human pathogens.","['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Bancroft Centre, Brisbane, Australia.']","['2R01 CA-30264/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57952-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,13,,,,,,,,,

(1980). Exp. Cell. Res., 126: 494-498). Among four HL-60 cell lines tested in this medium (serum-free medium), however, a cell line, HL-60/Biken ceased to proliferate after two days culture and most of the cells died within a week. Addition of purified serum lipoprotein (LDL or HDL) to the serum-free medium almost completely restored the proliferating activity of the cells. Total lipids extracted from the lipoproteins could replace the lipoproteins in promoting cell proliferation. Among various lipid components of the lipoproteins, only cholesterol showed a high stimulatory effect on cell proliferation, whereas other lipids tested were ineffective, except for sphingomyelin, cerebroside, and phosphatidic acid which showed limited stimulatory effects. As for the intermediates of cholesterol biosynthesis, desmosterol was also effective, whereas lanosterol was rather inhibitory. Chromatographic analyses of the lipids synthesized by HL-60/Biken cells and wild type cells (HL-60/RCB) cultured in serum-free medium, clearly demonstrated that, in HL-60/Biken cells, cholesterol synthesis was almost completely blocked and lanosterol was accumulated 10-fold that in wild type HL-60/RCB cells. All of these results indicate that HL-60/Biken is a variant cell line defective in cholesterol synthesis in the process synthesizing desmosterol from lanosterol.

The promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60(TB), was the most sensitive with irreversible total growth inhibition after 12 h of exposure to 1.5 microM drug. Antiproliferative effects of AG17 in HL-60(TB) cells were temporally related to disruption of mitochondrial function, which occurred within 1 h after drug exposure as demonstrated by a significantly decreased mass of ATP in drug-treated cells, loss of the fluorescent mitochondrial membrane potential probe rhodamine 123, and ultrastructural examination of mitochondria using fluorescence and electron microscopy. Specific decreases of total or tyrosine-phosphorylated substrate at concentrations of the drug not affecting ATP levels were not detected. These data raise the possibility that AG17 may act in part by altering mitochondrial function and/or structure, and that impairment of mitochondrial function may be exploitable as a potentially useful mechanism to modulate tumor cell proliferation. This study also emphasizes the importance of evaluating carefully the effects of potential protein kinase antagonists, since these structures have effects in intact cells in addition to what might be expected from in vitro enzyme assays.","['PRI/DymCorp, Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21701, USA.']",,,,,,,['Cancer Res 1995 Aug 15;55(16):3684'],,,,,,

Phase II studies have revealed encouraging activity against colon cancer, and Phase III studies are nearing completion. An associated structure-activity investigation has led to the development of ZD9331, a potent thymidylate synthase inhibitor which exploits the reduced folate carrier for cell entry, but which is independent of polyglutamation for its thymidylate synthase-inhibitory activity.

The improvement of banding techniques has made it possible to rather precisely identify deletion, translocation, inversions, and other structural chromosome abnormalities. Specific recurring chromosome abnormalities associated with distinctive morphologic features are thus increasingly recognized in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. For example, uneven geographic distribution of nonrandom specific chromosome aberrations has been reported. We herein report the results of chromosome studies on 30 Chinese patients with de novo acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. METHODS: Cytogenetic studies were performed at Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, from 1988 to 1993, on unselected samples of 30 patients with de novo acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Chromosome analysis was performed by short-term culture techniques on bone marrow material obtained from patients at diagnosis. Metaphase chromosomes were banded by the conventional trypsin-Giemsa banding technique and then karyotyped according to the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN). Classification of leukemia was based on the criteria of the French-American-British cooperative group. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients with adequate specimens, 17 (56%) demonstrated clonal chromosome abnormalities. Six patients were found to have structural rearrangements and seven patients have a numerical change as the sole abnormality. Four patients showed both structural and numerical anomalies. t(8;21) was found in 1 of the 8 M2 type ANLL patients and two of them had monosomy 21. Four of the 6 patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; M3 subtype) showed t(15;17). Two patients with M4 type leukemia and abnormal bone marrow eosinophils showed inv(16)(p13q22). One patient with M4 type leukemia demonstrated the loss of chromosome #7 and none showed the loss or deletion of chromosome #5. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a consistent finding of t(15;17) in APL; however, a low incidence of t(8;21), -5/5q- and -7/7q- in our patients demonstrated the possible difference in the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in ANLL between the oriental peoples and the whites.","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study represents a unique linkage of a consultant haematology team, reviewing all abnormal blood counts, to an organization providing ambulatory health care to 350,000 patients. The objective was to establish the underlying clinical disorders responsible for all abnormal FBCs during a 2-month period, and to estimate the impact of the haematology team on the diagnostic work-up and management of newly identified problems. 572 (2.55%) of the 22,454 FBCs were abnormal. Of these, 357 showed microcytosis, caused by iron deficiency (58%), thalassaemia minor (35%), inflammation (6%) or chronic renal failure (1%). The most common causes of normocytic anaemia (25 patients) were disseminated malignancy and acute blood loss; of macrocytosis (27 patients), chronic liver disease and cancer; of erythrocytosis (16 patients), chronic hypoxia; of thrombocytopaenia (48 patients), chronic liver disease and ITP; of thrombocytosis (47 patients), iron deficiency and inflammation; of leukopaenia or pancytopaenia (20 patients), cirrhosis and disseminated malignancy; and of leukocytosis (26 patients), chronic leukaemias in the elderly and infection in children. Major new haematological abnormalities were encountered in 0.24% of all blood counts, representing about one new diagnosis per day. Routine blood counts do contribute to the health care of a population. Screening for haematological disease through a central clinical laboratory covering a large high-risk ambulatory population offers a cost-effective way of searching for serious clinical problems, alerting the primary physicians of their existence, and offering advice in continued evaluation and problem management.","['Department of Medicine, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This is a small area study of cancer incidence, 1974-84 and of mortality, 1981-91 based on the national postcoded data held by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit and with population and socioeconomic data from the 1981 census. The study is centred on BP Chemicals Ltd, Baglan Bay, Port Talbot, West Glamorgan, South Wales and includes a general population sample of 115,721 people (1981 census) living within 7.5 km of the plant. Cancer incidence and mortality for all cancers, leukaemias, and cancer of the larynx were examined within 7.5 km and 3 km of the plant, and tests for decline in risk of these cancers with distance from the plant were carried out. Mortality from several other cancers possibly associated with the petrochemical industry was also studied. RESULTS: There were 5417 incident cancer cases and 2458 cancer deaths within 7.5 km of the plant during the periods of study. There was an 8% excess incidence of all cancers within 7.5 km, and a 24% excess of cancer of the larynx, consistent with a general excess of these cancers in West Glamorgan, but no apparent decline in incidence with distance from the plant, nor excess mortality. There was also no evidence of decline in leukaemia incidence or mortality with distance, at all ages or in children. Among the other causes included in the mortality study, there was an excess of multiple myeloma within 7.5 km, especially among women, and a significant decline in mortality from non-Hodgkin's lymphomas although there was no excess overall within 7.5 km. CONCLUSIONS: The apparent excess incidence of all cancers and cancer of the larynx within 7.5 km of the BP Chemical Ltd works was consistent with an excess more generally in West Glamorgan, possibly related, at least to some extent, to cancer registration in Wales. There was no excess mortality from these cancers. The results for multiple myeloma and especially non-Hodgkin's lymphomas may have been chance findings in view of the multiple tests of significance carried out in the study. A study of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers near oil refineries in Great Britain is to be undertaken that will help put the findings of the present study in wider context.","['Department of Public Health and Policy, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.']",,,,,PMC1128198,,,,,,,,

Seven drugs with different intracellular targets were selected for this combination study. Tumor implantation and drug treatment were both i.p., and the time interval between the administration of EDSM and the cytostatic agent was varied. Our results show that in the B16 tumor model EDSM is not able to potentiate any of these drugs, whereas antagonism is seen in combination with doxo-rubicin (DX). In the L1210 tumor model, however, no loss of activity is seen for this specific combination. The effect of the combination of cytosar (Ara-C), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or vincristine (VCR) with EDSM in the L1210 model is strongly time interval dependent. Loss of 5-FU antitumor activity is seen when EDSM is given 3 or 24 h after 5-FU; however, no effect is observed when EDSM is given 6 h after 5-FU. Enhancement of the 5-FU activity is not noticed. The VCR activity is potentiated when EDSM is given at least 6 h after VCR administration, which increases the antitumor response from 32 to > 60 days and the percentage survivors from 33 to 83% (p = 0.04).

Accompanying this decrease is the onset of apoptosis as determined by flow cytometric analysis of DNA degradation. By 8 to 18 hours of deprivation approximately 70% to 80% of the cells have entered apoptosis. Downregulation of protein kinase (PK) by a 24-hour incubation in 100 nmol/L 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in the presence of IL-3 dramatically reduced bcl-2 mRNA levels, and induced apoptosis in the presence of IL-3. We have also found that even in the presence of IL-3, two inhibitors of PKC, light-activated calphostin and H-7, substantially reduced the levels of bcl-2 mRNA between 8 and 24 hours as measured by a semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay method; however, the cyclic nucleotide-dependent PK inhibitor HA 1004, that is a structural analog of H-7 but a poor inhibitor of PKC, did not reduce bcl-2 levels in the presence of IL-3. This decrease in bcl-2 mRNA was accompanied by a decline in bcl-2 protein levels by 8 to 24 hours after addition of light-activated calphostin. In addition to interfering with the maintenance of bcl-2 mRNA levels, inhibition of PKC with H-7 inhibited the induction of bcl-2 mRNA in factor-deprived TF-1 cells restimulated with IL-3. The cyclic nucleotide-dependent PK inhibitor HA 1004 did not inhibit IL-3-induced bcl-2 mRNA. Studies with actinomycin D showed that transcription plays a major role in maintaining bcl-2 levels in TF-1 cells, and it is therefore likely that IL-3 plays a role in maintaining bcl-2 transcription through activation of PKC in these cells.","['Holland Laboratory for Biomedical Science, American Red Cross, Rockville, MD 20855, USA.']",['CA53609/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cases, both TEL alleles are affected, resulting in loss of wild-type TEL function in the leukemic cells. In addition, 5% of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) have 12p12-p13 deletions, suggesting that a tumor suppressor gene resides on 12p. These observations led us to consider whether TEL loss of function may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALL. In this report we show that the TEL gene maps between the polymorphic markers D12S89 and D12S98, and we use these flanking markers to screen paired diagnosis and remission samples from 81 children with ALL for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the TEL gene locus. Fifteen percent of informative patients showed TEL LOH which was not evident on cytogenetic analysis. Detailed examination of patients with LOH at this locus showed that the critically deleted region included two candidate tumor suppressor genes: TEL and KIP1, the gene encoding the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. These studies show that LOH at the TEL locus is a frequent finding in childhood ALL.","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]","['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 57261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01HG00965/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 81 aphereses were performed, mostly in the recovery phase of chemotherapy, with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, using a CS-3000 cell separator and regular procedure no. 3. Blood was withdrawn at a mean rate of 30 mL/min (range, 17 to 46 mL/min) through a temporary radial arterial catheter (20 to 24 guage) and returned through a larger catheter in a peripheral vein. Morbidity related to PBSC harvest was low and all aphereses were completed within 3 hours. The volume of blood per kilogram processed for each apheresis ranged from 85 to 615 mL (median, 270 mL). The median number of colony-forming units--granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and CD34+ cells collected were, respectively, 34 x 10(4)/kg and 15 x 10(6)/kg per apheresis and 126 x 10(4)/kg and 31 x 10(6)/kg per patient. Thirty-three patients (87%) required only a single apheresis to collect the minimum requirement of 10 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg, including 28 patients (74%) from whom 30 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg was obtained in a single apheresis. Twenty-three of the patients subsequently underwent autografts with PBSC.

Characteristic of JCML are the progressive appearance of high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF), reflecting a true reversion to a fetal type of erythropoiesis, and the presence of colony-forming cells able to grow in vitro spontaneously in the absence of growth factors. To better understand the relationship between the erythroid abnormalities and the leukemic process, we analyzed the expression pattern of specific genes related to erythroid differentiation--GATA-1, EPOR, alpha-globin, beta-globin, and gamma-globin genes--in JCML peripheral blood (PB) cells and in vitro-derived colonies. Northern blot analysis of PB cells from five JCML patients indicated levels of GATA-1 transcripts much higher than those usually found in other types of leukemic cells, and S1 nuclease protection assay detected significantly increased expression of gamma-globin mRNA. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of single granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (CFU-GM) colonies, obtained in vitro in the absence of added growth factors from four JCML patients, detected GATA-1, EPOR, and globin (alpha and gamma) transcripts in most of the colonies tested, in contrast with control CFU-GM from normal bone marrow, which were positive only for GATA-1. Single JCML colonies were tested for the presence of two different transcripts; whereas alpha- and gamma-globin genes appeared mostly coexpressed, beta-globin mRNA was detected only in a minority of the gamma-globin-positive colonies, indicating that the leukemic pattern of hemoglobin synthesis is mainly fetal. In addition, the leukemic cells occurring during blast crisis of one of our patients displayed the typical features of a stem cell leukemia (CD34+, CD19-, CD2-, myeloperoxidase-). In this sorted CD34+ population, we detected the presence of a marker chromosome, der(12)t(3;12), previously identified in bone marrow cells at diagnosis and an expression pattern superimposable to that of the JCML colonies, consistently displaying a high gamma-globin:beta-globin mRNA ratio. The expression of erythroid markers within populations of leukemic cells, both in vivo and in vitro, supports the hypothesis that abnormal JCML erythroid cells may originate from the same mutated progenitor that sustains the growth of the leukemic cells.","['Department of Genetica e di Biologia dei Microganismi, Universita di Milano, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Images of femoral marrow were obtained using a T1-weighted spin-echo (SE) method and a short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) technique. In patients with MDS, the change in MRI pattern from a fatty or nodular pattern to a uniform pattern correlated with disease progression. Evolution to acute leukemia in MDS patients was associated with a higher signal intensity on STIR images (lower signal intensity on T1-weighted SE images) and an extended area of involvement. The femoral marrow in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed increased signal and varied patterns (scattered to uniform) on STIR images. However, the faint pattern (grade 4a) was characteristic of M2 AML. In patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase, increased leukemic mass was represented by replacement of the femoral marrow with a region of abnormal signal intensity. The extent of involved areas in these CML patients correlated with the spleen size.

We analyzed p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes in 178 cases of primary leukemias including 81 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), seven of hairy cell leukemia (HCL), seven of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 43 of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 27 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 13 of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) by Southern blot analyses. The ALL cases showed a relatively high frequency of homozygous deletions (22%, 6 of 27) at the p16INK4A gene locus. Interestingly, of the six cases with p16INK4A homozygous deletions, only three showed homozygous deletions at the p15INK4B gene. In 81 CLL patients, we detected one homozygous and five heterozygous deletions at both the p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes and two heterozygous deletions at the p16INK4A gene alone. Deletion of these two genes in AML cases is relatively low (9%). We did not detect deletions in any of the MDS, HCL, and CML cases examined. Sequence analyses of p16INK4A gene of six CLL cases with heterozygous deletion at this locus showed a 27-bp deletion at the splice acceptor site of intron 1 in one case and changes in the coding sequence in three other cases. The data presented in this report showed that (1) p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes are preferentially deleted homozygously in ALL and heterozygously in CLL cases with frequent mutation in the second allele, and (2) p16INK4A gene appears to be more frequently deleted than p15INK4B gene.","['Division of Laboratory Medicine and Medicine, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['HL-02229/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As DNA replication and cytokinesis are tightly regulated in somatic cells by cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases, we sought to determine the pattern of cyclin gene expression in cells that undergo megakaryocytic differentiation and polyploidization. The Dami megakaryocytic cell line differentiates and increases ploidy in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) stimulation in vitro. We used Northern blotting to analyze mRNA levels of cyclins A, B, C, D1, and E in PMA-induced Dami cells and found that cyclin D1 mRNA levels increased dramatically (18-fold). Similar increases in cyclin D1 mRNA were obtained for other cell lines (HEL and K562) with megakaryocytic properties, but not in HeLa cells. The increase in cyclin D1 was confirmed by Western immunoblotting of PMA-treated Dami cells. This finding suggested that cyclin D1 might participate in megakaryocyte differentiation by promoting endomitosis and/or inhibiting cell division. To address these possibilities, we constructed two stable Zn+2-inducible, cyclin D1-overexpressing Dami cell lines. Cyclin D1 expression alone was not sufficient to induce polyploidy, but in conjunction with PMA-induced differentiation, polyploidization was slightly enhanced. However, unlike other cell systems, cyclin D1 overexpression caused cessation of cell growth. Although the mechanism by which cyclin D1 may affect megakaryocyte differentiation is not clear, these data demonstrate that cyclin D1 is upregulated in differentiating megakaryocytic cells and may contribute to differentiation by arresting cell proliferation.","['Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']","['CA51497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL51457/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the BCL-6 protein, two antibodies that recognized distinct domains of this protein were raised in rabbits. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting of lysates of BCL-6-expressing cells using both antibodies showed a broad 92- to 98-kD band. Dephosphorylation of BCL-6 protein reduced the size of this band to 87 kD, suggesting that BCL-6 may be expressed in a phosphorylated form. Immunostaining with both antibodies showed that BCL-6 protein was localized in the nuclei of most of the germinal center B cells and a small number of marginal zone B cells. Furthermore, BCL-6 protein was expressed in follicular, Burkitt's, and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. These results suggest that the BCL-6 protein, expressed in B cells of the germinal centers which are important in the maturation of immune responses, may play some physiological role(s) in the germinal center B cells.","['Department of Pathology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleosomal DNA fragments as a ladder in agarose gel were present in BM aspirates of four patients who showed high ISEL and were absent in two who had no ISEL staining in biopsy samples, but only when DNA was extracted after a 4-hour in vitro incubation in complete medium. Therefore, laddering data confirmed the ISEL findings that the majority of hematopoietic cells in MDS are in early stages of PCD.

We investigated the effect of the removal of cell membrane sialic acid on the fusion activity of influenza virus (A/PR/8/34 strain) toward human T lymphocytic leukemia (CEM) cells at low pH. Fusion was monitored by fluorescence dequenching of octadecylrhodamine incorporated in the virus membrane. Removal of sialic acid by neuraminidase resulted in a drastic reduction in both viral binding and fusion. The association of the virus with neuraminidase-treated cells was enhanced at pH 5, compared to that at neutral pH, probably due to the unfolding of the hemagglutinin and the resulting increase in viral surface hydrophobicity, but the fusion capacity of the virus was reduced significantly.

In response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), parental U937 cells displayed growth arrest and differentiated into a monocyte/macrophage-like cell line, while PKC-zeta cells underwent death. The ability of GF109203X to inhibit TPA-induced death of PKC-zeta cells suggested that activation of a conventional isoform was necessary to induce apoptosis. While exhibiting unique morphological changes, parameters indicative of a further degree of differentiation were not observed in TPA-treated PKC-zeta cells. TPA-induced down-regulation of PKC activity was similar in both cells. While modest quantitative differences in individual isoform down-regulation existed, intracellular localization of isoforms prior to activation differed significantly between U937 and PKC-zeta cells. Expression of gadd45 was induced by TPA in PKC-zeta but not parental cells and occurred as a primary response to TPA and prior to the onset of cell death. These data suggest that the decision of a cell to undergo death or differentiation in response to phorbol esters may, in part, be modulated by alterations within the PKC signal transduction pathway.","['Department of Medicine, East Carolina University School of Medicine Greenville, North Carolina 27858-4354, USA.']",['CA43023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have selected human U-937 cells for clones resistant to the cytotoxic agents doxorubicin (U-A20) and vincristine (U-V20). The results demonstrate that P-glycoprotein-positive U-A20 and U-V20 cells exhibit resistance to inducers of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Although parental U-937 cells responded to ionizing radiation with the DNA laddering characteristic of physiological cell death, the drug-resistant lines were insensitive to this effect. The U-A20 and U-V20 clones were also resistant to endonucleolytic DNA cleavage associated with exposure to tumor necrosis factor or ceramide. Previous work has demonstrated that physiological cell death is inhibited by overexpression of the Bcl-2 protein. However, analysis of Bcl-2 revealed similar levels in the parental and drug-resistant cells. In contrast, we show that U-A20 and U-V20 cells overexpress the Bcl-2-related protein, Bcl-xL. Moreover, studies with a U-937 cell line transfected with a Bcl-XL expression vector confirm resistance to ionizing radiation-induced DNA fragmentation and cell killing. These findings suggest that, unlike Bcl-2, Bcl-XL may be constitutively overexpressed as a result of selection for cytotoxic drug resistance and that Bcl-XL participates in an acquired form of multimodality resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and radiation.","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['CA55241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytologic diagnosis in these seven patients with t(11;14) was typical CLL in two cases presenting with < 10% large lymphocytes (LL) and prolymphocytes (PL) and atypical CLL in five cases in which LL and PL comprised between 10% and 55%. The diagnosis was supported by histologic findings on bone marrow biopsy (five cases) or splenectomy specimens (two cases). A progressive increase of peripheral LL and PL was observed, resulting in a switch of FAB diagnosis over a 6-60-month period from typical CLL into atypical CLL in two cases and from atypical CLL into prolymphocytic leukaemia in five cases. Immunophenotyping showed a mature B-cell phenotype with CD19, CD22, CD24 positivity and CD10 negativity in all patients. A bright-staining pattern for surface immunoglobulins (SIg) was detected in 6/7 cases, CD5 positivity in 6/7 cases, and CD23 positivity in 1/7 cases. The FMC-7 monoclonal antibody was positive in > 40% cells in 5/6 cases. Chromosome changes in addition to t(11;14) were seen in five cases; in two cases unbalanced translocations involving the 3q21 chromosome region, resulting in partial trisomy for the long arm of chromosome 3, were detected early in the course of the disease. Karyotype evolution that was associated with disease progression occurred in 3/6 assessable patients. Comparison of these findings with similar data from 65 B-CLL patients without t(11:14) showed that atypical morphology, switch of FAB diagnosis during the course of the disease, and karyotype evolution were more frequently seen in cases with t(11;14) (5/7 v 15/65 cases, P = 0.015, 7/7 v 7/65 cases, P < 0.0001, and 3/6 v 5/45 assessable cases, P = 0.04, respectively).

However, the immunosuppressive and nephrotoxic effects of CSA may limit its clinical use. PSC 833, a new cyclosporin D derivative, exerts a higher MDR reversal activity but lacks toxic or immunosuppressive effects. The drug-resistant sublines K/DAU100, K/DAU200, K/DAU300, K/DAU400, K/DAU500 and K/DAU600 have been derived from the drug-sensitive parental cell line, K562 cl.6 and CEM/VLB100 is a drug-resistant derivative of CCRF-CEM. We report a comparison of the effects of PSC 833 and CSA on daunorubicin (DAU) transport kinetics and chemosensitivity in these cell lines. Both CEM/VBL100 and K562 cl.6 DAU-resistant cells displayed high levels of P-glycoprotein (PGP), decreased DAU accumulation and increased DAU efflux when compared to their parental cells. PSC 833 was 1.6-, 3.4-, 4.9- and 4.6-fold more effective than CSA in reversing DAU resistance in higher resistance CEM/VLB100, K/DAU400, K/DAU500 and K/DAU600 cells respectively. DAU transport kinetics showed that PSC 833 was more effective than CSA in increasing cellular DAU accumulation and decreasing DAU efflux in higher resistant leukaemia subclones. PSC 833 could restore DAU retention at lower doses and was more active than CSA in all the resistant cells. A 89-100% restoration of intracellular DAU retention were gained by PSC 833 at 1.0 microM in K562 cl.6 DAU-resistant sublines, whereas a 73-100% restoration of DAU retention was obtained by CSA only at 30.0 microM in the same resistant sublines. PSC 833 at 3.0 microM is sufficient to restore full DAU retention in all resistant cells. CSA, however, even at 30.0 microM, cannot confer full restoration of DAU retention in higher resistance K562 cl.6/DAU sublines. By measuring MDR modulator-mediated short-term inhibition of PGP function, PSC 833 was found to be at least 10-30 times more active than CSA. As no effect on DAU retention and sensitivity has been found in sensitive parental cells with PSC 833, it is suggested that PSC 833 may act by blocking the effluxing function of PGP in the resistant leukaemia cells.","['Department of Haematology, London Hospital Medical College.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based upon the clinical observation that patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) respond favourably to anthracyclines, we hypothesized that APL cells may have low levels of MDR1 expression. We therefore investigated MDR1 expression in 10 patients with APL and compared results with those obtained in 18 patients with other subtypes of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Prior to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction with MDR1 specific primers, leukaemic cells were purified by fluorescence activated cell sorting to exclude normal haemopoietic cells, in particular lymphocytes, from the MDR1 analysis. In sorted APL cells, MDR1 expression was detected in only two of 10 patients, which was significantly different from findings in other AML subtypes (MDR1 expression in 14/18 patients; P < 0.01). When unsorted specimens from APL patients were studied, five of six cases were MDR1 positive, whereas sorted APL cells were shown to express MDR1 mRNA in only one of these cases. MDR1 mRNA levels expressed as MDR1/beta-2 microglobulin ratios were significantly lower in APL (0.24 +/- 0.2, mean +/- SD) than in AML (0.75 +/- 0.48; P < 0.01). We conclude that low or absent expression of MDR1 in APL cells may contribute to the efficacy of anthracyclines in the treatment of APL.","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']","['CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular facet of this translocation is represented by the formation of a new hybrid gene, the AML1-ETO, which is regularly transcribed in a chimaeric mRNA and translated into a new fusion protein believed to have a key role in the pathogenesis of this type of leukaemia. We looked for the presence of AML1-ETO transcripts, by RT-PCR, in 49 unselected patients affected by AML-M2 diagnosed at various Italian Institutions. A hybrid transcript was detected in 11 cases (23%). Minimal residual disease status was investigated in three patients in continuous complete remission (CCR) after a median follow-up of 44 months; at least one sample from each subject was found positive for the AML1-ETO transcript suggesting a long-term persistence of t(8;21) leukaemic cells. In two female patients in CCR a 'clonality' analysis was performed on peripheral blood DNA by exploiting the X chromosome inactivation pattern of the human androgen-receptor gene (HUMARA); in both cases the results were consistent with the presence of a polyclonal haemopoiesis. Our data confirm that the persistence of residual cells expressing the AML1-ETO transcripts is a frequent occurrence even in patients with long-term remission; on the other hand, clonality assays indicate that in t(8;21) leukaemias long-term remission haemopoiesis is sustained by a polyclonal bone marrow reconstitution.","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche ed Oncologia Umana, CNR-CIOS, Ospedale S.

As the monocytic lineage is prominent in JCML, it is suggested that the transforming event happens in a unique stem cell with intermediate differentiation towards the myelomonocytic as well as the B-lymphatic lineage.

The seven remaining patients did not have M-bcr/abl rearrangement and are described as BCR-. BCR- patients were younger, had lower white blood cell counts (WBC) and lower basophilia. Four BCR- and four BCR+ patients underwent blastic transformation (BT). Response to therapy was fairly similar in both populations.

This study further confirms the existence of true CML cases without Ph chromosome or M-bcr/abl rearrangement and shows that this entity differs only slightly from classic form Ph+ CML. The Ph-BCR- subgroup raises two problems. First, the differential diagnosis with atypical CML or CMML, based on morphological data, and secondly, the therapeutic follow-up in the absence of a specific marker. In contrast, the residual disease of Ph-BCR- patients can be monitored by PCR. More advanced molecular and biochemical techniques will be required to understand which molecular mechanisms underlie Ph-BCR- CML, resulting in phenotypes sometimes indistinguishable from Ph+ CML.","['Haematology Department, Centre Anti-Cancereux de Marseille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there was no correlation of trisomy 11 with any specific FAB subgroup [M2 (n = 7), M1 (n = 5), M4/5 (n = 2), M3 (n = 1)] less mature forms predominated. Immunologically, the leukaemic blasts showed a strikingly consistent stem cell phenotype with expression of HLA-DR, CD34 and the myeloid antigens (CD15, CD33 and/or CD13). In addition, two cases expressed the B-cell associated antigen CD19. The presence of trilineage dysplasia, suggesting the presence of an underlying myelodysplasia (MDS), was observed at presentation in five cases; in another case MDS was evident at relapse only. Unexpectedly, MLL gene rearrangements were observed in two of four cases characterized by trisomy 11 as the sole karyotypic abnormality; however, MLL aberrations were not identified in three cases with trisomy 11 accompanied by other karyotypic anomalies. The majority of patients in each subgroup (i.e. those with and without additional cytogenetic abnormalities) achieved a short first complete remission (CR) (mean 8 months) and failed to obtain a second CR. Only one patient in each trisomy 11 subgroup is in a continuous CR for > 34 months. These findings suggest that trisomy 11 leukaemia is characterized by a stem/progenitor cell immunophenotype with poor response to standard chemotherapeutic regimens and an unfavourable prognosis.","['Department of Cytogenetics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']","['CA-30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-46368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Six months after the last administration, in May 1991, she was admitted because of decreasing thrombocyte count and appearance of blasts in the peripheral blood. On admission, laboratory findings were as follows: WBC 700/microliters with 5% of blasts, RBC 331 x 10(4)/microliters, and PLT 17.9 x 10(4)/microliters. Bone marrow aspiration revealed hypocellular marrow with 39% blasts. About 5% of the blasts were positive for myeloperoxidase by electron microscopy analysis. Leukemic cells were positive for CD 7, 13, 33 and 34, negative for other lymphoid lineage markers, and demonstrated no rearrangement of TCR-beta, gamma and IgH genes. Although she was treated with low-dose cytosine arabinoside, no response was observed. Subdural hematoma and sequential pneumonia developed and the patient died eight months after leukemic transformation.

CASE REPORT: The patient presented with erythroderma and foliate lymphocyte leukaemia. Skin biopsy showed an epidermotropic lymphoma. Tumoural cells expressed a mature T-cell phenotype CD4+/CD25+. High anti-HTLV-I titers and the evidence of monoclonal integration of HTLV-I provirus within circulating lymphoid cells led to the confirmation of HTLV-I as the causal agent in tumour cell transformation. HIV-2 serology was positive. DISCUSSION: Sub-Saharan Africa is a vast reservoir of HTLV-I virus with at least 5 million infected persons. Cases of adult-T cell Leukaemia/Lymphoma in Africans are exceptional. Lack of sufficient knowledge of the disease could partially explain this discrepancy. The main differential diagnosis in dermatology is primary T-cell lymphomas of the skin, particularly mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome.","['Institut Marchoux, Bamako, Republique du Mali.']",,,,,,Leucemie/lymphome T de l'adulte associee au HTLV-I chez un Africain seropositif pour le VIH 2.,,,,,,,

He was diagnosed as having idiopathic GHD and given hGH from December 1991. The examination of his peripheral blood showed mild pancytopenia 2 months before the start of the hGH therapy. Since January 1992, paleness of the skin, general fatigue and fervescence progressed gradually. In February 1992, because of the occurrence of acute leukemia, administration of hGH was discontinued. Judging from the results of surface marker analysis of the blast cells, the patient was diagnosed as having AMKL. He was treated with chemotherapy for acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia from March 1992. A complete remission was obtained after 4 weeks of treatment. The chemotherapy was completed in July 1993. He remains in complete remission 26 months after diagnosis. This case suggests the importance of hematological examination and, when there is any abnormality which is not caused by GHD, such as pancytopenia, more detailed medical examinations (for example bone marrow examination) are necessary.","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we partially sequenced the 12-LOX cDNA after reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification of 12-LOX mRNA from cultured 3LL cells. Comparison with platelet and leukocyte 12-LOX indicates that 3LL 12-LOX is identical with the platelet-type enzyme at least within the sequenced region. Further, we investigated the intracellular distribution of both 12-LOX enzyme protein and its activity which are prerequisites for understanding 12-LOX regulation. 12-LOX activity was monitored via the production of 12-hyroxyeicosatetraenoic acid from 3LL cells and their subcellular fractions using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. 12-LOX protein was measured by direct slot blot and by Western Blotting. In 3LL cells, both 12-LOX activity and 12-LOX protein were predominantly localized in the cytosol. This 12-LOX activity was optimal at 37 degrees C. However at 24 degrees C and 10 degrees C, it showed 87% and 61% of this activity, respectively, thus differing distinctly from 12-LOX in platelets or rat basophilic leukemia cells. Incubation of 3LL cell homogenates with 0-100 microM free Ca2+ and subsequent separate analyses of cytosol and membrane fractions indicated that, as in platelets, an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ caused a loss of cytosolic 12-LOX activity. However, no significant Ca(2+)-induced increase in membrane-associated 12-LOX activity was observed under these conditions in 3LL cells. In contrast, at the 12-LOX protein level we observed a Ca(2+)-dependent loss in the cytosol and a concomitant increase in the membrane fraction. Thus, we suggest that 12-LOX in 3LL cells undergoes rapid translocation from cytosol to membrane in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner, but is no longer active or becomes inactivated at the membrane site.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['CA 29997-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['GENBANK/S77511'],,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of E2A-Pbx1 induces fibroblast transformation and myeloid and T-cell leukemia in mice and arrests differentiation of granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor-dependent myeloblasts in cultured marrow. Recently, the Drosophila melanogaster protein Exd, which is highly related to Pbx1, was shown to bind DNA cooperatively with the Drosophila homeodomain proteins Ubx and Abd-A. Here, we demonstrate that the normal Pbx1 homeodomain protein, as well as its oncogenic derivative, E2A-Pbx1, binds the DNA sequence ATCAATCAA cooperatively with the murine Hox-A5, Hox-B7, Hox-B8, and Hox-C8 homeodomain proteins, which are themselves known oncoproteins, as well as with the Hox-D4 homeodomain protein. Cooperative binding to ATCAATCAA required the homeodomain-dependent DNA-binding activities of both Pbx1 and the Hox partner. In cotransfection assays, Hox-B8 suppressed transactivation by E2A-Pbx1. These results suggest that (i) Pbx1 may participate in the normal regulation of Hox target gene transcription in vivo and therein contribute to aspects of anterior-posterior patterning and structural development in vertebrates, (ii) that E2A-Pbx1 could abrogate normal differentiation by altering the transcriptional regulation of Hox target genes in conjunction with Hox proteins, and (iii) that the oncogenic mechanism of certain Hox proteins may require their physical interaction with Pbx1 as a cooperating, DNA-binding partner.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['CA56876-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC230617,,,,,,,,

Using receptor-selective synthetic retinoids and HL-60 cell sublines with different retinoid responsiveness, we have investigated the contribution that each class of receptors makes to the processes of cellular differentiation and death.

It has been proposed that potent and selective 5-LO inhibitors will be effective therapy in diseases in which the peptidoleukotrienes and leukotriene B4 have been implicated, such as asthma and arthritis. The novel compound (S)-N-hydroxy-N-(2,3-dihydro-6-phenylmethoxy-3-benzyofuranyl )urea (SB 202235) was evaluated as a selective inhibitor of 5-LO in a cell-free system as well as in various cellular assays. In addition, the potential therapeutic value of SB 202235 was assessed in preclinical models of allergic asthma. The activity of the 5-LO enzyme isolated from rat basophilic leukemia-1 cells was inhibited by SB 202235 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.9 microM. Consistent with its ability to inhibit 5-LO, SB 202235 inhibited the production of leukotriene B4 by human monocytes and in human whole blood (IC50 values of 1.5 microM and 1.1 microM, respectively). The selectivity of SB 202235 was confirmed by its lack of effect against several other enzymes and receptors. SB 202235 potently and effectively inhibited the contraction produced by a single concentration of ovalbumin in guinea pig trachea (IC50 = 20 microM) and of anti-IgE in human bronchus (IC50 = 2 microM). SB 202235 (3-30 microM) also inhibited the contraction of guinea pig trachea in response to increasing concentration of ovalbumin.

P388-tumour-bearing CDF mice were injected intravenously with C-SNAFL-1. Glucose was administered simultaneously to lower the tumour pH. Under our experimental conditions, tissue autofluorescence was found to be negligible. Two emission peaks were observed. The wavelength of the first one was pH insensitive (545 nm). The second one was pH sensitive: a shift of the emission peak as a function of pH was observed from 587 nm for pH 7.25 to 605 nm for pH 6.3. A calibration curve linking emission intensity ratios (I545/I635) to in vivo pH is provided. Results clearly indicate differences between tumorous (ratio 0.55 +/- 0.08, pH 6.3 +/- 0.1) and normal (ratio 1.39 +/- 0.04, pH 7.25 +/- 0.1) tissues.

The approach allows a thorough and sensitive determination of the number of clonal leukemic IgH rearrangements and their precise V gene usage. This strategy may be applied in the detection of minimal residual disease, in surveillance after induction of disease-free states, and in analyzing the effectiveness of purging autologous bone marrow of malignant clones. An initial primary polymerase chain reaction (PCR), directed by an IgH-J generic primer and a complement of family-specific IgH-V primers, defined the major B cell IgH-V gene usage. Use of an IgH-J generic primer supplanted the use of a constant region primer anchor and thus eliminated the need to target mRNA by the traditional RNA reverse transcription-PCR amplification method. Monoclonality of rearranged VDJ bands was further substantiated by high-resolution denaturant gel electrophoretic analysis. The predominant amplified bands were subcloned and sequenced. By sequencing through VDJ juxtaposed regions, that is, the third complementarity-determining region, clonotype-specific primers were developed and used in a secondary clonotype primer-directed PCR (CPD-PCR) to detect, with extreme sensitivity and specificity, a unique B cell clone. Analysis of the products of the CPD-PCR permitted the detection of a single malignant cell among 1 million polyclonal cells and superseded the constraints of prior studies that have provided a limited evaluation of family variable gene repertoire usage. Leukemic clonal rearrangements were detected in 100% of the eight cases of pediatric and two cases of adult B-ALL studied. Two or more clonal IgH-VDJ amplified sequences were observed in 50% of the B-ALL bone marrows analyzed. In two cases, clonotype-specific oligodeoxynucleotide primers, derived from B-ALL VDJ sequences, directed the secondary CPD-PCR, and disease activity was monitored after chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Department of Neurology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",,"['GENBANK/S78091', 'GENBANK/S78095', 'GENBANK/S78096']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, we have observed that submucosal fat deposition can occur in a short period of time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four patients were evaluated in whom serial CT examinations showed intramural fat deposition occurring within six months of a normal study. Confirmation of fatty deposition was made by Hounsfield unit measurement in all patients and by pathologic examination of bowel specimens in two patients. RESULTS: All four patients received cytoreductive chemotherapy for treatment of lymphoma or leukemia prior to the development of fat deposition. In all patients, serial CT examination documented the occurrence of fat-attenuation bowel wall thickening that developed in a short time period (12, 36, 67, and 186 days). Three of the four cases were initially misinterpreted as wall thickening from other causes (intussusception or colitis). Pathologic examination of bowel in the two patients with the shortest time intervals confirmed the presence of mature fat confined to the submucosa. CONCLUSION: These cases demonstrate that submucosal fat deposition in bowel wall is not limited to inflammatory bowel disease and other longstanding, chronic diseases; fatty infiltration can occur in a relatively short period of time, and is particularly likely to occur after cytoreductive therapy.","['Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University Medical Center, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown to exert a variety of actions on a diverse range of cell types, including neuronal, bone, and hemopoietic cells (Hilton, 1992, Trends Biochem. Sci., 17:72-76). In many of these cell types, studies have indicated the presence of specific receptors for LIF (Godard et al., 1982, J. Biol. Chem., 267: 3214-3222; Hilton et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:5971-5975; Hilton and Nicola, 1992, J. Biol. Chem., 267:10238-10247.). The mechanism by which these receptors act is believed to involve tyrosine phosphorylation and the signal transducing receptor component gp130. We have previously shown that LIF is capable of inducing both human and murine myoblasts to proliferate in culture (Austin et al., 1992, J. Neurol. Sci., 112:185-191). We now report that LIF binds specifically to receptors on the surface of myoblasts, with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 400 pM and the number of receptors per cell varies with cell density. Binding competition studies showed that LIF binding to these receptor sites was not competed for by a number of other growth factors which stimulate myoblast proliferation including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF alpha), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6). There was a time and concentration-dependent down-regulation of receptor numbers following preincubation of myoblasts with LIF. The processing of these receptors subsequent to binding, involves as a first step, internalization and degradation by the myoblast. LIF appeared to stimulate myoblast proliferation rather than cell survival.","['Department of Biochemistry, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells in various phases of the cell cycle were separated by the counterflow centrifugal elutriation and the susceptibility to apoptosis was measured by the morphological examination and by DNA fragmentation assay. Undifferentiated HL-60 cells in S phase showed a significantly higher susceptibility to apoptosis than those in G0/G1 or G2/M phase either in the absence or presence of apoptosis-inducing reagents such as A23187, actinomycin D (Act D), and cycloheximide (CHX). In contrast, PDBu-treated HL-60 cells preferentially underwent apoptosis in G0/G1 phase. When untreated HL-60 cells enriched for G0/G1 phase were recultured in a complete medium, the percentage of apoptotic cells increased after 6-12 h in correlation with the increase in S-phase cells. When the same experiment was performed with PBDu-treated cells, spontaneous increase of apoptotic cells was observed while almost all cells remained in G0/G1 phase. Northern blot analysis revealed that undifferentiated cells expressed the same amounts of bcl-2 mRNA in each cell cycle phase, whereas G0/G1-predominant reduction of bcl-2 mRNA was noted in PDBu-treated cells. There was no difference in the amounts of CD11b mRNA between G0/G1 fraction and S+G2/M fraction of differentiated HL-60 cells. BCL-2 overexpression could almost completely abrogate the G0/G1-predominant induction of apoptosis in differentiated HL-60 cells. These results suggest that G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and down-regulation of bcl-2 mRNA in G0/G1 phase might be associated with apoptosis in differentiated HL-60 cells whereas the weakness of chromatin structure in S phase might be related to apoptosis in undifferentiated HL-60 cells.","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of cyclopiazonic acid to fura-2-loaded RBL cells evoked a biphasic increase in free ionized intracellular calcium. Release of stored calcium accounted for the first phase of this response. The second phase was determined to be calcium entering through an influx pathway activated by cyclopiazonic acid. The influx pathway was selective for calcium, but was somewhat permeable to manganese. However, in a Ca(2+)-free solution containing EGTA, sodium ions permeated freely.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Two patients received radiotherapy during pregnancy for malignant brain tumors. Case 1 was treated with opposed lateral blocked 10 x 15 cm fields and case 2 with 6 x 6 cm bicoronal wedged arcs, using 6 MV photons. Fetal dose was measured clinically and confirmed with phantom measurements using thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs). Further phantom measurements quantitated the components of scattered dose. RESULTS: For case 1, both clinical and phantom measurements estimated fetal dose to be 0.09% of the tumor dose, corresponding to a total fetal dose of 0.06 Gy for a tumor dose of 68.0 Gy. Phantom measurements estimated that internal scatter contributed 20% of the fetal dose, leakage 20%, collimator scatter 33%, and block scatter 27%. For case 2, clinical and phantom measurements estimated fetal dose to be 0.04% of the tumor dose, corresponding to a total fetal dose of 0.03 Gy for a tumor dose of 78.0 Gy. Leakage contributed 74% of the fetal dose, internal scatter 13%, collimator scatter 9%, and wedge scatter 4%. CONCLUSIONS: When indicated, brain tumors may be irradiated to high dose during pregnancy resulting in fetal exposure < 0.10 Gy, conferring an increased but acceptable risk of leukemia in the child, but no other deleterious effects to the fetus after the fourth week of gestation. For our particular field arrangements and linear accelerators, internal scatter contributed a small component of fetal dose compared to leakage and scatter from the collimators and blocks, and 18 MV photons resulted in a higher estimated fetal dose than 6 MV photons due to increased leakage and collimator scatter. These findings are not universal, but clinical and phantom TLD measurements estimate fetal dose accurately for energies < 10 MV and should be taken for each pregnant patient considered for treatment to confirm and document acceptable dose.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California, San Francisco 94143, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Four hundred and ninety-two adults who underwent bone marrow transplantation in Seattle were followed for 2 to 18 (median, 6) years. Before transplantation, patients received a preparative regimen of chemotherapy plus total body irradiation (TBI) (n = 407) or chemotherapy alone, without TBI (n = 85). TBI was administered in a single dose of 10 Gy (n = 74) or in fractionated doses totaling 12-15.75 Gy (n = 333). The risk of cataracts was determined for groups of patients with respect to the type of preparative regimen received and other pretransplant and posttransplant variables. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-nine patients (32%) developed cataracts between 0.5 to 11 (median, 2.3) years after transplantation. The probability of cataracts at 11 years after transplantation was 85%, 50%, 34%, and 19% for patients receiving 10 Gy of single-dose TBI, > 12 Gy fractionated TBI, 12 Gy fractionated TBI, and no TBI, respectively (p < 0.0001). Among those developing cataracts, the severity was greater in patients after single-dose TBI (59% probability of surgical extraction) than after > 12 Gy fractionated TBI, 12 Gy fractionated TBI, or no TBI (33%, 22% and 23%, respectively). Patients given corticosteroids after transplant had a higher probability of cataracts (45%) than those without steroids (38%) (p < 0.0001). In a proportional hazards regression model, the variables that were correlated with an increased probability of cataracts were single-dose TBI (relative risk (RR) = 2.46) and steroid therapy (RR = 2.34), while a decreased probability of cataracts was correlated with a nonTBI preparative regimen (RR = 0.41). The yearly hazard of developing cataracts in recipients of single-dose TBI was highest during the third year after transplantation, while in recipients of fractionated TBI, the hazard was distributed among years one through seven. The probability of cataracts in all groups reached a plateau at 7 years after transplantation, after which the development of cataracts was extremely unlikely. CONCLUSION: TBI is the major risk factor for developing cataracts after BMT. Single-dose TBI results in the highest risk of cataracts. However, the risk of cataracts in recipients of fractionated-TBI is significantly higher than in patients who receive no TBI. In addition to TBI, steroid therapy is an independent risk factor for cataracts after BMT.","['Long-Term Follow-Up Program: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.']","['CA09515/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For most cancer sites, the risk model is one in which age-specific, relative risk coefficients are obtained by taking a geometric mean of the coefficients derived from the atomic bomb survivor data using two different methods for transporting risks from the Japanese to the U.S. population. The risk models are applied to estimate organ-specific risks per unit dose for a stationary population with mortality rates governed by 1980 U.S. vital statistics. With the exception of breast cancer, low-LET radiogenic cancer risk estimates are reduced by a factor of 2 at low doses and dose rates compared to acute high dose exposure conditions. For low dose (or dose rate) conditions, the risk of inducing a premature cancer death from uniform, whole body, low-LET irradiation is calculated to be 5.1 x 10(-2) Gy-1. Neglecting nonfatal skin cancers, the corresponding incidence risk is 7.6 x 10(-2) Gy-1. High-LET (alpha particle) risks are presumed to increase linearly with dose and to be independent of dose rate. High-LET risks are estimated to be 20 times the low-LET risks estimated under low dose rate conditions, except for leukemia and breast cancer where RBEs of 1 and 10 are adopted, respectively.","['Office of Radiation and Indoor Air (6602J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC 20460, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies done in Western populations indicate that 25-50% of patients with leukemia and lymphoma have specific or nonspecific cutaneous signs. In dark-skinned patients, reports of such mucocutaneous manifestations are scarce. The lesions in these patients may easily be missed, if not specifically looked for. METHOD: Eighty-six indigenous Kenyan children with a confirmed diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma were specifically examined for any mucocutaneous manifestations at presentation, during their treatment, and during subsequent follow-up. Whenever possible, an attempt was made to determine the causes of these lesions. All patients were given standard therapy for the primary hematologic disorder. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients had mucocutaneous symptomatology at presentation: 17.4% had skin infiltration by the malignant cells. During therapy an even larger number developed nonspecific skin manifestations. Most of these were the result of myelosuppression, immunosuppression, or direct cytotoxic effects on tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Mucocutaneous manifestations in black children with leukemia and lymphoma are very common.","['Department of Pathology/Hematology, Nairobi Hospital, Kenya.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After cutaneous melanoma, 972 2nd cancers occurred. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer was significantly raised in each sex. Risk of all non-skin cancers was not raised for all ages but was significantly increased for patients with the primary melanoma incident at ages under 50 years (standardised incidence ratio [SIR], i.e., ratio of observed to expected cancer incidence, multiplied by 100 = 117; 95% confidence interval [CI] 101-134). There were significantly increased risks of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in males and both sexes combined, brain and nervous system cancers in females and both sexes combined and oropharyngeal cancer in both sexes combined. Risk of pancreatic cancer was not raised, suggesting that cutaneous melanoma patients generally do not share the diathesis for this malignancy which has been observed in certain families with atypical naevi and melanoma. There was no relation of 2nd primary cancer risks to duration since the first primary and no indication of any appreciable treatment-related risk. After ocular melanoma, 216 2nd cancers occurred. There was a significantly increased risk of 2nd cancer overall in males but not females and a significantly increased risk of liver cancer in each sex.

We present 2 such patients, and provide evidence to support the presence of separate clones in these coexisting neoplasms. In the first case, MM became evident 14 months after the diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In past reports, most occurrences of this association, when investigated, have been regarded to be biclonal disease processes; however, with few exceptions, most were documented by immunologic studies alone. To establish the clonality in our case of CLL with MM, we examined both immunophenotypic data obtained by standard two-color flow cytometric analysis, and patterns of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, using standard Southern analysis and hybridization with 32P-labelled JH and JK probes. This provided evidence for the presence in this patient of two separate monoclonal populations of B cells, manifested as light chain restrictions and gene rearrangements which differed in blood (CLL) and bone marrow (MM) samples. In the second case, MM presented simultaneously with bone marrow lymphocytosis and abnormal peripheral lymphocytes. Clonality studies on blood were not done. Bone marrow B-cell gene rearrangement studies, however, revealed the presence of three bands in the JK blot of significantly different intensities, suggestive of two monoclonal populations. A monoclonal population of small cells with surface B markers and surface IgM was demonstrated by flow cytometry, while a second population of larger cells with intracytoplasmic IgG matching the patient's serum monoclonal protein was detected by immunofluorescence microscopy. The results in these 2 cases expand previous findings of the rare association of MM with a second B-cell neoplasm, and demonstrate the usefulness of molecular diagnostic investigation.","['W.A.

The patients were divided into separate groups on the basis of previous therapy (i.e. analysis performed at diagnosis, during and after chemotherapy) and clinical features of the disease (i.e. disease stage, pattern of bone marrow infiltration, peripheral blood lymphocytosis). The mean CFU-GM colony count of the patients was 30 times higher than that of the controls (206.4 +/- 197.8 (SD) CFU-GM per 5 x 10(5) cells plated versus 6.5 +/- 3.6). There was no statistical difference in the numbers of circulating CFU-GM between the patients studied at diagnosis (257 +/- 215.4 CFU-GM/5 x 10(5) cells) and those studied during (117.6 +/- 169.2 CFU-GM/5 x 10(5) cells) or after chemotherapy (207.5 +/- 105.9 CFU-GM/5 x 10(5) cells), although a trend towards a higher recovery of myeloid progenitors was observed as a function of time elapsing from the last treatment. In addition, we found no significant difference in the in vitro CFU-GM growth of patients grouped according to their disease stage, pattern of bone marrow infiltration and degree of peripheral blood lymphocytosis. In conclusion, our data indicate that intensification with peripheral blood stem cell support may be feasible in CLL, since progenitor cells of myeloid-monocytic series are markedly increased in the peripheral blood of these patients. Moreover, it is possible to extend this kind of therapy to patients who have undergone previous extensive chemotherapy and who might have persisting bone marrow infiltration.","['Second Propedeutic Clinic of Internal Medicine, Aristotelian University of Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,,['Eur J Haematol. 1996 Aug;57(2):180-1.

A monoclonal light chain expression was demonstrated in nine out of eleven B cell lymphomas. The three T-cell lymphomas all expressed pan T markers (CD 3) and two the T-helper antigen (CD 4). One patient had meningeal involvement of a true histiocytic lymphoma which was identified by its large atypical cells which were positive for alpha-1-anti-trypsin and muramidase. In four patients with a primary diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, CSF involvement was confirmed by the demonstration of blasts with CD 10 (cALLA) or light chain restriction. Epithelial or melanocytic markers were demonstrated on the tumor cells in CSF from the remaining four patients. In 29 CSF specimens a diagnosis of reactive lymphocytosis was made using cytomorphology which mostly was characterized by macrophages mixed with small mature lymphoid cells. Immunologic evaluation showed that these mature cells were CD 10 negative T-cells and only few specimens contained polyclonal B-cells.

Thirteen patients had received multiple transfusions before BMT. Patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg for 4 d, +/- total body irradiation 300-500 cGy as a single fraction; 1 patient received total nodal irradiation (750 cGy) plus antithymocyte globulin. Sixteen patients received bone marrow from human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical siblings, 3 from haplo-identical parents, and 2 from unrelated volunteer donors; graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was variable. Three patients failed to fully engraft following BMT; 2 achieved successful engraftment following a second BMT. Six of 20 evaluable patients (30%) developed grade II-IV acute GVHD, of whom 3 died; 3 patients developed limited and 5 patients (31%) developed extensive chronic GVHD, of whom 1 died. Fourteen patients (67%) are alive and well following BMT with a median follow-up of 6 y (range 2.1-11 y). Survival was superior in patients receiving sibling-donor BMT (75%) compared with those receiving parent- or unrelated-donor BMT (40%).

The relationship between malignant cell aneuploidy and prognosis is known in many types of neoplasms in adults and in children. In some situations, demonstration of an aneuploid clone verifies presence of malignant cells. Aneuploidy is rare in benign diseases. This report summarizes our first experiences with cytometric DNA analysis and shows the method's abilities to other potential users. METHODS AND RESULTS: We investigated DNA contents in blood and bone marrow (BM) specimens of 25 children with leukemia, in 41 unfixed solid tumors after biopsy and in 24 specimens of paraffin embedded neuroblastoma tissue. We also investigated 5 specimens of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with medulloblastoma, 18 specimens of CSF from patients with leukemia or lymphoma, 4 pleural exudates suspected from malignancies, and 45 specimens of possibly infiltrated BM from primary solid tumors. As the purpose of this study was to test the method on a relatively small number of specimens, we did not perform statistical analysis of our data. As reported previously, aneuploidy was frequent in CALLA + acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in types of neuroblastoma with favorable prognosis (lower clinical stages and less than 2 years of age). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that DNA ploidy may be tested by flow cytometry in an easy and fast way.

Patients with metabolic or bacterial causes of polyarthritis were excluded. We found 17 cases of HTLV-1-positive polyarthritis (6.7% of the total of polyarthritis patients followed in our department); there were 14 females and three males, and all the patients were West-Indian blacks. Mean age at diagnosis was 50 years. Five patients also had tropical spastic paraparesis. The polyarthritis was the inaugural manifestation of T-cell leukemia in one patient. Four patients had received blood transfusions. Fever, myalgia, and/or skin lesions were present at onset of the polyarthritis in seven cases. All 17 patients had peripheral, bilateral, symmetric polyarthritis; the most commonly involved sites were the hands (17/17) and knees (14/17). Three patients had rheumatoid factor and five had antinuclear antibody. Ten patients met at least four American Rheumatism Association criteria for rheumatoid arthritis; they accounted for 6.7% (10/150) of all polyarthritis patients managed in the same hospital department during the same period. We compared these ten patients with 20 HTLV-1-negative rheumatoid arthritis patients matched on gender, ethnic origin, and disease duration. There were no significant differences between the two groups for any of the parameters studied.","['Department of Medicine and Rheumatology, Teaching Hospital, Fort-de-France, Martinique.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition we determined the positivity for alpha 4 and alpha 5 integrin molecules in those cells using specific monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. CML patients (N = 3) presented mean values of alpha 4 and alpha 5 higher (alpha 4: 60 +/- 20%; alpha 5: 70 +/- 41%) than AML (N = 10) blast cells (alpha 4: 25 +/- 23%; alpha 5: 18 +/- 16%). Northern analysis revealed an almost four-fold higher expression of TGF-beta mRNA in K562 (derived from a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia) compared to the myeloblastic cell line HL60. The highest TGF-beta mRNA levels were seen in the U937 lineage. CML leukemic cells (N = 3) showed high TGF-beta mRNA levels comparable to the levels expressed by K562 which was paralleled by high beta 1 integrin mRNA. AML blast cells presented a variable degree of expression of TGF-beta mRNA when compared to HL60. One patient with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB subtype M7), usually associated with myelofibrosis, presented the highest TGF-beta mRNA levels. We conclude that studying TGF-beta 1 and its mechanisms of action will help in understanding fibrosis in leukemic patients, and perhaps to design treatments for such conditions.","['Departamento de Radiologia, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, SP, Brasil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In three forms of SCN, i.e., congenital neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome and related syndromes), idiopathic neutropenia (both childhood and adult), and cyclic neutropenia, it is now established that long-term treatment with the hematopoietic growth factor, recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rHuG-CSF or Filgrastim), can elevate blood neutrophil counts to the normal range in most patients, with a concomitant reduction in infection-related events including fever, oral ulcerations, antibiotic use and symptoms of inflammation. Treatment with this growth factor causes an increase in the number and maturity of marrow cells of the neutrophilic series; other cell lines are largely unaffected. Marrow stimulation and expansion are reflected by the occurrence of bone pain early in therapy, as well as some increase in spleen size in most cases. Adverse effects of therapy are infrequent in both children and adults, and long-term treatment with daily or every-other-day s.c. injections of rHuG-CSF are well accepted. Because of the risk that some patients with chronic neutropenia may have or develop myelodysplasia and/or leukemia, careful pretreatment evaluations (blood, bone marrow and cytogenetics) and long-term observations are extremely important. An international registry for patients with SCN has been established to maintain records and further investigate these conditions.","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",,,,31,,,,,,,,,

This complex functions as a receptor for fibrinogen and other ligands and is involved in platelet aggregation. The receptor complex is expressed at high levels during final megakaryocyte differentiation. Further, while GPIIIa is expressed in other tissues as part of the vitronectin receptor, GPIIb is only expressed on maturing megakaryocytes and the platelets derived from them. Thus studies of the GPIIb gene may serve as a model of gene regulation during this process. Over the past several years, the genes for both GPIIb and IIIa have been cloned and analyzed. The GPIIb gene contains 30 exons over 18 kilobases (kb). The transcriptional start site has been determined and there does not appear to be a TATA-box immediately upstream of this site. Studies have been done to define regulatory elements upstream of the transcriptional start site. Most of these studies focused on the human promoter and on studies using megakaryocytic cell lines. These studies have defined several important tissue-specific promoter elements including a GATA454 site (454 basepairs upstream of the transcriptional start site that involves a GATA-binding consensus sequence), a GATA54 site and an Ets35 site (that involves an Ets-binding consensus sequence). Expression studies with megakaryocytic cell lines suggest that each of these sites effects expression approximately threefold. Further, an Ets510 site was also described that had a similar effect. While these studies were underway, we pursued studies of the rat 5'-flanking region using a rat primary marrow expression system. Qualitatively, our data support the human data; however, quantitatively, we found significant differences from the human studies done in cell lines. We found that the major tissue-specific promoter element was the GATA454 site. Mutations altering this site result in an approximately fiftyfold drop in expression. In comparison, eliminating the Ets510 site by truncation or point mutation had only a twofold effect on expression. Mutations at the Ets35 site did effect expression at a high level, decreasing expression approximately fifteenfold, while mutations at the GATA54 site effected expression by approximately ninefold. In addition, using 50 bp deletions, we have preliminarily defined two domains from -450 to -351 bp and -150 to -101 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site that effected expression. The former appears to contain a positive regulatory element, while the latter appears to be a silencer element.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA.']",['HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,62,,,,,,,,,

Without the use of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) in this program, the mortality rate varies from 5 to 17%, and infectious complications arise in more than 50%. These findings limit the widespread use of such forms of therapy. The use of high-dose ara-C (HIDAC) alone or in combination with other drugs is the most common regimen studied, however neither other drug combinations nor the addition of supporting CSFs have been extensively explored. For this reason we studied the effect of high-dose cyclosphosphamide-etoposide (CECY) plus recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage (rHuGM)-CSF with the intention of decreasing morbimortality and prolonging disease-free survival (DFS). Since 1992 we have included 51 complete remission patients with AAL in the CECY plus rHuGM-CSF protocol. The maximal myelosuppression occurred in a mean of 6.4 days, and the mean days required for absolute neutrophil count recovery was 13 days and for platelets 21 days (p < 0.0001). No toxic deaths occurred and only two serious infectious complications were seen. After two years of follow-up, 50% of de novo acute myelogenous leukemia patients had relapsed at 13 months, and 50% of de novo adult acute lymphocytic leukemia patients had relapsed at 15 months. In a recent update, we have not seen a significant difference when compared to historic groups. The CECY protocol does not appear to be superior in prolonging DFS compared to HIDAC as a post-remission strategy for newly diagnosed AAL. The main difference was the absence of toxic deaths and minimal serious infectious complications in the CECY protocol. Therefore, we suggest that the use of rHuGM-CSF in post-remission programs should be included in future studies.","['Departament of Hemato-Oncology, Instituto Nacional de la Nutricion, Salvador Zubiran, Mexico City, Mexico.']",,,,64,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been documented that alterations of the p53 gene in leukemic cells are frequently detected during the blast crisis of CML. The MC3 cells contained the altered p53 gene.

Among them 3 patients with NHL, one with angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy/lymphoma and 7 with CLL developed cutaneous vasculitic changes during the course of their disease (incidence of 9.5%). All patients had advanced stage disease. Lymphomas were of B-cell origin and either low or intermediate grade. The median time between the diagnosis of NHL or CLL and the appearance of skin manifestations was 18 months. Recurrent vasculitic changes involving exclusively the skin, was characterized by a (maculo)papular rash, most commonly found in the upper and lower extremities. Pruritus of varying intensity was present in 82% of the patients. In the biopsy, all had perivascular and/or vessel wall lymphocytic infiltration of the dermis with occasional red cell extravasation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that these infiltrates were mainly composed of T-lymphocytes.

However, it has two major drawbacks (1) a rapid rise in WBC in some patients, with potentially fatal ATRA syndrome (2) rapid relapse with maintenance therapy using ATRA alone or low dose chemotherapy. The French APL group therefore designed a treatment approach with ATRA followed by intensive chemotherapy. The latter was administered after CR achievement with ATRA, or was rapidly added to ATRA in case of rapid rise in leukocyte counts. This combined approach, in a pilot study and in a randomized trial, proved superior to intensive chemotherapy alone, by slightly increasing the CR rate but more importantly by reducing the relapse rate. These results were confirmed by the Chinese, Japanese and New York groups. Our group (and other European groups) are now testing in a new randomized trial the better timing of ATRA and chemotherapy administration (ATRA followed by chemotherapy or ATRA plus chemotherapy) and the role (after an intensive consolidation) of maintenance treatment with intermittent ATRA, continuous low dose chemotherapy or both.",,,,,33,,,,,,,,,

This brief article reviews our studies on the expression of adhesion molecules on leukemic cells isolated from patients with adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-infected T cell line cells and on their adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Fresh ATL cells expressed lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), but the expression of very late antigen-4 (VLA-4) and sialyl-Lewis(x) (SLex) was variable. Sialyl Lewis(a) (SLea) was not detected. Cell adhesion assays using HUVEC and adhesion-blocking antibodies revealed the consistent E-selectin-mediated adhesion and variable VLA-4-mediated adhesion of ATL cells to HUVEC. The studies on HTLV-I-infected T cell lines confirmed the above data. These results, together with the detection of E-selectin expression on the endothelium of the skin infiltrated with ATL cells, indicate that E-selectin-mediated adhesion is the major pathway for the adherence of ATL cells to endothelial cells. The possible role of such adhesion in the formation of skin lesions and other clinical manifestations of ATL which result from the infiltration of leukemic cells is discussed.","['Research Center for Immunodeficiency Virus, Kyoto University, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This conclusion is based on the observation that relapse after high dose chemotherapy supported by a stem cell transplant from a twin donor is 3-4 times higher than after transplant from an allogeneic donor. This anti-leukemic mechanism of transplanted donor cells has been termed graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, and efforts are being directed toward utilizing such an immune-mechanism after autologous transplantation. Since interleukin-2 (IL-2) can induce remissions in selected patients with advanced leukemia, it has become a candidate cytokine to be used in attempts to introduce GVL after autologous stem cell transplantation. Here we review the available clinical data with IL-2 and critically evaluate whether IL-2 has a place as adjunct treatment to prevent relapse after autologous transplantation for acute leukemia.","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of British Columbia, Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Center, Canada.']",,,,88,,,,,,,,,

In the case of neoplastic B cells, there is apparent deviation in the use of V-genes from that expected on a random basis, both for VH and for VL. Also, the preferred V-genes, and their patterns of mutation, differ among the various categories of B-cell tumor possibly reflecting the distinct origins and clonal histories on the individual tumor cells. This review focuses on a single VH gene, VH4-21, which is a member of the VH4 family, and which appears selectively to encode immunoglobulins with autoantibody activity, particularly anti-red cell antibodies. The pattern of usage of this VH gene by B-cell tumors demonstrates clear asymmetry among different tumor types. Also, the mutations detected in this relatively non-polymorphic gene indicate that antigen, possibly autoantigen, may influence the behavior of the tumor cell.","['Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals, U.K.']",,,,32,,,,,,,,,

Because ultraviolet light is known to cause skin cancers, the association between non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and skin cancer was studied. DESIGN: Secondary occurrence of either malignant melanoma or squamous cell skin cancer in cohorts of patients with a first diagnosis of either non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, and vice versa, were studied. Expected numbers of subsequent cancers were calculated by sex, age, and period specific national incidence rates multiplied by the person years under observation in the cohorts. SETTING: Denmark (1943-89) and Sweden (1958-89). SUBJECTS: Four population based cohorts identified in the nationwide cancer registries (34,641 people with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 17,400 with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, 34,989 with malignant melanoma, 25,980 with squamous cell skin cancer). A total of 562,085 person years were accrued for the analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The ratios of observed to expected cancers (the standardised incidence ratio) served as a measure of the relative risk. RESULTS: The relative risk for developing squamous cell skin cancer was 5.5 (95% confidence interval 4.6 to 6.6) among patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 8.6 (7.2 to 10.3) among patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The relative risks remained high over more than 15 years of follow up. Relative risks for malignant melanoma were 2.4 (1.8 to 3.2) for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 3.1 (2.1 to 4.4) for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. After squamous cell skin cancer had been diagnosed there was a twofold excess risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. By contrast, in each of the cohorts the general cancer risks excluding skin and lymphoproliferative malignancies were close to the expected. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and skin cancer are strongly associated; this supports the hypothesis that the secular increase in exposure to ultraviolet light may have contributed to the increasing incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in recent decades.","['Department of Cancer Epidemiology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,"['BMJ. 1995 Sep 16;311(7007):749; author reply 750-1.

Two different hPPAR gamma transcripts were expressed in hematopoietic cells: a 1.85-kb transcript, which corresponds to the full-length mRNA (PPAR gamma 1), and a 0.65-kb transcript (PPAR gamma 2), which cannot encode all of the nuclear receptor functional domains. Normal neutrophils and peripheral blood lymphocytes, as well as circulating leukemic cells from patients with AML, ALL, and CML, express only PPAR gamma 2 on Northern blot analysis. In contrast, only the PPAR gamma 1 transcript was detected in a variety of human leukemia cell lines and in cultured normal primary bone marrow stromal cells. Both transcripts were detected in various fetal and adult nonhematopoietic tissues. We mapped the location of the hPPAR gamma gene to human chromosome 3p25 by somatic cell hybridization and linkage analysis. PPARs have been shown to be activated by peroxisome proliferating agents, long-chain fatty acids and arachidonic acid. Human PPAR gamma, although homologous to the PPAR gamma s of other species, has unique sequence and amino acid differences. Identification of hPPAR gamma will allow further understanding of its role in human cellular leukotriene, prostaglandin, and peroxide degradative or synthetic pathways, as well as its role in lipid metabolism and regulation of adipocyte differentiation.","['UCLA School of Medicine, Department of Medicine 90024, USA.']","['R01 DK43025/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-GM 08243-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL007237/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32 HL07237-17/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008243/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",['GENBANK/L40904'],,,PMC6134382,,,,,,,,

The efficiency of translation of rp mRNAs correlates with the expression of the gene encoding the cap binding protein, eIF-4E, as indicated by the fact that the abundance of the corresponding mRNA and protein also fluctuates in a growth-dependent manner. To examine the hypothesis that eIF-4E plays a role in regulation of the translation efficiency of rp mRNAs, we utilized an NIH 3T3-derived eIF-4E-overexpressing cell line. These cells overproduce eIF-4E to the extent that even under conditions of growth arrest, the abundance of the respective protein in its active (phosphorylated) form is higher than that found in exponentially growing NIH 3T3 cells. Nevertheless, this surplus amount of eIF-4E does not prevent the translational repression of rp mRNAs when the growth of these cells is arrested by blocking DNA synthesis with aphidicolin or hydroxyurea. In complementary experiments we used an in vitro translation system to compare the competitive potential of mRNAs, containing the translational cis-regulatory element (5' terminal oligopyrimidne tract) and mRNAs lacking such a motif, for the cap binding protein. Our results demonstrate that both types of mRNAs, regardless of their translational response to growth arrest, exhibit similar sensitivity to the cap analogue m7G(5')ppp(5')G. It appears, therefore, that the presence of the regulatory sequence at the 5' terminus of rp mRNAs does not lessen its competitive potential for the cap binding protein and that the growth-dependent decrease in the activity of eIF-4E does not play a key role in the repression of translation of rp mRNAs.","['Department of Developmental Biochemistry, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,,,,PMC6134383,,,,,,,,

The I50 of the 12-HETE isomer was 6 microM whereas prostaglandin F2 alpha was ineffective. In order to examine the mechanistic basis underlying the inhibitory action of 15-HETE, association assays of [3H]-15-HETE with RBL-1 subcellular fractions were carried out. The presence of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS enhanced specific [3H]-15-HETE binding in the membrane fractions three-fold and specific 15-HETE binding was distributed among the nuclear (32%)-, granule (19%)-, plasma membrane (35%)-, and cytosol (14%)-enriched fractions. Studies using combined granule and plasma membrane enriched-, CHAPS treated-fractions showed that [3H]-15-HETE binding was time-dependent, specific and reversible, sensitive to pertussis toxin treatment, and indicated a single class of binding sites with a Kd = 460 +/- 160 nM and Bmax = 5.0 +/- 1.1 nM. Competition experiments showed that the order of 15-HETE or analogs in inhibiting the binding of [3H]-15-HETE was: 15(S)-HETE > or = 12-(S)-HETE = 5-(S)-HETE > 15-(R)-HETE > arachidonic acid. Prostaglandin F2 alpha and lipoxin B4 were ineffective as competitors. The similar profiles of the binding assays and inhibition of the 5-lipoxygenase suggest that 15-HETE binding sites may mediate this inhibitory action of 15-HETE.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, D.C., USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal evolution of gene rearrangements is a major pitfall of this strategy. Using high-resolution PCR-based analyses (including denaturing gel electrophoresis and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP)) we have compared Ig/TCR gene rearrangements at presentation and relapse in a series of ALLs. These methods allow an unambigous comparison of rearrangements taking into account junctional size and nucleotide sequence information and allow a precise assessment of the clonal evolution. V gamma-J gamma and V delta 1-J delta 1 rearrangements were analysed in 12 T-ALLs. VH-JH, V gamma-J gamma, V delta 2-D delta 3 and, in selected cases, DH-JH rearrangements were studied in 14 B-lineage ALLs. Clonal evolution, regarding major rearrangements, occurs for at least one of these loci in 2/12 T-ALLs and in 5/14 B-lineage ALLs. Clonal evolution is more marked for minor rearrangements than for major ones. As shown using SSCP analysis, rearrangements observed at relapse are sometimes found in minor clones at presentation which are therefore selected in vivo by a proliferative advantage. These data, as well as those from the available literature, suggest the use of at least two patient-specific probes to detect MRD in ALLs. A general strategy including selected Ig/TCR rearrangements and chromosomal abnormalities as PCR targets is proposed.","['Laboratory of Molecular Haematology, St Louis Hospital, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that more than 50% of both normal and CML CD34+ cells express the p53 protein. However, haemopoietic cells at different phases of the cell cycle express p53 with different conformations, suggesting that the function of p53 may be closely regulated during the cell cycle. In order to elucidate the mechanism by which p53 suppresses cell proliferation, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting p53 expression on cell cycle and cell kinetics of chronic phase CML (n = 12) and normal (n = 7) bone marrow light-density cells and purified CD34+ progenitors by using an 18-mer modified antisense oligonucleotide which targets the region covering the six base pairs immediately before the first codon and the first four coding codons of p53. We found that the number of cells positive for the cell cycle-specific nuclear antigen Ki67 and for the BrdU monoclonal antibody (McAb) was significantly increased after p53 antisense olignucleotide treatment. At the same time, p53 protein expression was completely abrogated in both light-density and CD34+ cells. In addition, DNA analysis by flow cytometry demonstrated that the number of cells in quiescent phases of the cell cycle (G0-G1) was significantly decreased after exposure of light-density cells to p53 antisense oligomers, whereas the number of cells in S or G2-M phases was increased. Furthermore, the longer the incubation time the higher the increase in cell proliferation. Treatment of CML, cells with p53 antisense oligomers also resulted in significantly increased numbers of CFU-GM colonies. Our data suggest that p53 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and its action is mediated through changes in cell cycle kinetics, mainly before the S phase. We can further speculate that the loss of p53 function, at the time of blastic crisis of CML, may play a role, in combination with other genetic changes (p210 BCR/ABL, Rb gene abnormality, others to be defined), in inducing disturbances in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.","['Institute of Haematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The examinations were performed using a rectilinear whole-body scanner and the distribution of the two tracers was assessed visually and quantitatively in anatomical bone marrow segments, the spleen and liver. Qualitative comparison showed concordance in the bone marrow distribution of the two tracers in 83% of the segments. Discrepancies were found in six patients with hypoplastic or aplastic marrow. The spleen was visualized in all cases with the 99mTc-Moab, including nine patients without splenic haemopoiesis (i.e. without spleen uptake of 52Fe). The uptake of the two tracers, quantified in bone marrow segments and the spleen, correlated well (P < 0.001), but not in the liver (NS). The correlation between the uptake values for each patient was excellent, except in cases of aplastic bone marrow. In conclusion, bone marrow scanning using a 99mTc labelled anti-granulocyte monoclonal antibody enables functional evaluation of the distribution of haemopoiesis. Limitations include the evaluation of bone marrow aplasia and identification of splenic haemopoiesis, for which 52Fe remains the tracer of choice.","['Centre of Nuclear Medicine, University of Louvain Medical School, Brussels, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To compare the pharmacokinetics of IDA between elderly and young patients, we assayed daily the serum level of the drug and of its metabolite (idarubicinol, IDAol) in a group of eight elderly patients who received a dose of 8 mg/m2 (group A) and in a group of nine younger AML patients treated with 12 mg/m2 (group B). The apparent terminal half-life of IDAol was significantly longer in the elderly than in the younger patients (mean half-life 59.7 h versus 41.4 h, P < 0.05). The values of the area under the serum concentration curve of IDAol indicated that the two patient groups received a very similar exposure to the drug despite the different doses. In conclusion, this protocol, based on attenuated doses of IDA, compares well with the results obtained previously in similar age-matched patient series.","['Division of Haematology, University of Florence, Italy.']",,,,36,,,,,,,,,

Several investigators have suggested that the stimulating cytokines are produced by the malignant B cells themselves, indicating an autocrine growth regulation. In this paper we demonstrate that T-lymphocyte clones produce soluble mediators which stimulate the growth of malignant B lymphocytes. The incidence of the growth-stimulating T-cell clones derived from peripheral blood is identical in patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and healthy controls. About 50% of the clones stimulate the growth of hairy cells, but not the growth of purified B lymphocytes of healthy donors. The stimulating activity of a single clone varies when tested on different hairy cells. Interferon alpha (IFN alpha), but not antibodies against tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) or interleukin-2 (IL-2), completely inhibit the growth-stimulating activity. Our results indicate that a paracrine growth regulation has to be considered in addition to the postulated autocrine loop in the growth regulation of malignant B cells.","['Department of Medicine III (Haematology and Oncology), University of Ulm, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hemizygous expression of the wild-type p53 allele was observed in two samples showing the loss of one p53 allele, and affected p53 expression was associated with p53 allelic loss rather than the clinical phase of CML. In four patients with CML showing p53 inactivation, we performed a detailed sequential analysis of p53 allelic loss, p53 mutation and expression from the onset of the disease to the patients' death. Consequently, we demonstrated that the loss of a wild-type p53 allele preceded mutation of the remaining allele, and that cells hemizygous for the wild-type p53 allele dominated those with both wild-type alleles, then were replaced by cells with complete p53 inactivation. These observations indicate that not only complete p53 inactivation but also hemizygous expression of the wild-type p53 allele may confer a selective growth advantage, and that the former is implicated in a more malignant phase than the latter. Alternatively, the inactivation of another undefined anti-oncogene on chromosome 17p may allow selective growth before the p53 mutation occurs.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakpoints were dispersed throughout the major breakpoint cluster region without any clustering or hot spots. In three cases Alu sequences were found at or near the breakpoint on the ABL side of the translocation but no other obvious sequence homologies were found either in BCR or ABL. The translocation event was characterized further in three other patients by amplifying the reciprocal ABL-BCR junction on the 9q+ chromosome and also normal ABL around breakpoints. In two of these patients a few nucleotides of BCR and ABL were either duplicated or deleted on translocation, suggesting that staggered cuts had been made in the DNA strand prior to recombination. In the third patient 50 bp of ABL was deleted and 159 bp of M-BCR including exon b3 was duplicated, indicating either that the single-stranded cuts may span a larger distance than previously thought or that another mechanism, perhaps involving gene conversion, may be involved in this instance.","['LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",,"['GENBANK/U19397', 'GENBANK/U19398', 'GENBANK/U19399', 'GENBANK/U19400', 'GENBANK/U19401', 'GENBANK/U19402', 'GENBANK/U19403', 'GENBANK/U19404', 'GENBANK/U19405', 'GENBANK/U19406', 'GENBANK/U19407', 'GENBANK/U19408', 'GENBANK/U19409', 'GENBANK/U19410']",,,,,,,,,,,

S-TK levels were monitored by means of a radioenzyme assay in 90 patients affected by MDS (22 refractory anaemia, RA; 17 RA with ring sideroblasts, RARS; 21 RA with blast excess, RAEB; 15 RAEB in transformation, RAEB-T; 15 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, CMMoL). Mean s-TK levels (U/microliter) measured at diagnosis were 11.9 +/- 12.6 for RA, 11.4 +/- 13.6 for RARS, 19.9 +/- 28.4 for RAEB, 39.6 +/- 34.3 for RAEB-T and 77.7 +/- 69.7 for CMMoL (normal values < 5 U/microliter). With the only exception of a weak relationship with lactate dehydrogenase, no correlation was found between initial s-TK values and other clinical or laboratory parameters, such as age, haemoglobin, white blood cell or platelet count, percentage of bone marrow blasts. MDS patients with s-TK > 38 U/microliters, a cut-off level selected by means of ROC statistical analysis, showed a significantly shorter survival than those with s-TK < 38 U/microliter (8.2 v 37.4 months, respectively; P < 0.0001). In particular, transformation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) occurred in 17/21 (81%) of patients with s-TK > 38 U/microliters and 9/69 (13%) of those with lower levels at diagnosis (P < 0.0001), independently of FAB subtype. High s-TK levels were also useful to predict evolution in AML during the course of the disease in patients with normal initial values. Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of s-TK on both overall survival and risk of acute transformation. We conclude that s-TK may be an important prognostic factor in MDS, strongly correlated with development of AML.","['Division of Haematology, IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, S.

In ATL patients, statistical analysis disclosed a close correlation between TK level and the leucocyte count (P < 0.01), and absolute number of abnormal lymphocytes (P < 0.01). However, no correlation was observed between serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level and these items. Concerning the therapeutic response, a statistical difference was present in TK between complete remission and no response (P < 0.05), but not in LDH. We also investigated a significant inverse correlation between TK level as well as LDH level and the length of survival after the initial diagnosis (P < 0.01). In AML patients a close correlation of TK level with the count of leucocytes (P < 0.01), percentage of blasts in the blood (P < 0.05), therapeutic response (P < 0.01) and the length of survival after the initial diagnosis (P < 0.05) was present.

The most prominent heterogeneity of immune system gene rearrangements was observed in the group of B-precursor ALL. The results from our study suggest that the heterogeneity of immune system gene rearrangement reflects clonal diversity in approximately one-third of patients with B-precursor ALL at presentation and in most patients in relapse. The observed association of clonal diversity with high white blood cell count, pre-B immunophenotype and age under 1 year in B-precursor ALL may have clinical significance. There was a significantly shorter disease-free survival in the group of B-precursor ALL patients with clonal diversity compared with those without clonal diversity. Clonal diversity may, therefore, be a mechanism of disease progression common to different types of aggressive B-precursor ALL.","['Department of Cancer Studies, University of Birmingham, U.K.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty donors with the most reactive indeterminate WB were selected for follow-up studies. Four of these 20 donors admitted to retroviral risk factors and, interestingly, 12 (60%) had exposure to dairy cattle and drank unpasteurized milk.

This alkaloid consists of a planar pentacyclic chromophore which was investigated for its DNA-binding and cytotoxic properties. Spectroscopic measurements provided evidence that the drug intercalates into DNA. DNase I footprinting assays indicated that the binding of ascididemin to GC-rich sequences is favoured over binding to AT-rich and mixed sequences. Chemical probes were used to detect ligand-induced structural changes in DNA. The alkaloid induces a hyper-reactivity of the DNA towards potassium permanganate, but not towards diethylpyrocarbonate, just as is the case with ethidium bromide; it has little effect on the catalytic activities of topoisomerases I and II. Ascididemin exhibits marked cytotoxicity towards human leukaemic cells in vitro and appears to be practically equally toxic for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant cell lines.

However, the very limited water solubility of this phenol has complicated drug formation. Hence, derivatives of the combretastatin A-4 (1a) 3'-phenol group were prepared for evaluation as possible water-soluble prodrugs. As observed for combretastatin A-4, the sodium salt (1b), potassium salt (1c) and hemisuccinic acid ester (1e) derivatives of phenol 1a were essentially insoluble in water. Indeed, these substances regenerated combretastatin A-4 upon reaction with water. A series of other simple derivatives (1d, 1f-j) proved unsatisfactory in terms of water solubility or stability, or both. The most soluble derivatives evaluated included the ammonium (1l), potassium (1m) and sodium (1n) phosphate salts, where the latter two proved most stable and suitable. Both the potassium (1m) and sodium (1n) phosphate derivatives of combretastatin A-4 were also found to exhibit the requisite biological properties necessary for a useful prodrug.

As a consequence, the importance of FeLV infection for the development of certain lesions in cats is to be seen under new aspects for some diagnoses. The relative risk for development of anemia, e.g., is only slightly increased in FeLV-positive animals whereas the relative risk for focal myocardial necrosis and coccidiosis is elevated tremendously in these cats. The relative risk for some lesions and diagnoses is much higher in FeLV-negative cats than in FeLV-positive animals.

The results attained with FLU in 6 cases of refractory CLL are reported. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The efficacy and toxicity of FLU was evaluated in 6 patients (median age 63 years) between March 1993 and March 1994. Five patients were in stage III-IV and one in stage II of the Rai's system, and they were refractory to the usual treatment. The dosis used here was 30 mg/sq m/day, for 5 days every 4 weeks, up to a total of 6 therapeutic courses. The response was assessed after 3 and 6 courses. Anti-infectious prophylaxis was made with co-trimoxazole, monthly benzathine penicillin G and isoniazid in Mantoux-positive patients. The response criteria were those given by the NIC Working Group for CLL. RESULTS: The patients received 2 to 6 courses. None of them attained complete remission: 1 had nodular remission, 2 had partial remission, 2 responded partially although not reaching criteria for partial remission (1 died of pancytopenia), and 1 had disease progression and died after the second course. Fast and important reduction of the lymphocyte count as well as the CD4 lymphocytes was present in all cases. Bone-marrow infiltration decreased strikingly in 2 cases and the platelet count improved in 3 cases and worsened in 2 others. The following toxicity was recorded: 2 patients had nausea, 5 had neutropenia (below 500 x 10(9)/L in 3 instances) and 4 had thrombocytopenia (lower than 40 x 10(9)/L in one case). In 26 therapeutic courses there were 10 febrile episodes (1 for pneumonia, 1 for gastroenteritis and 8 without any septic foci); 1 patient developed pulmonary tuberculosis after completing the treatment and one patient died of posttransfusion graft versus host disease after splenectomy once she had completes six courses. CONCLUSION: This experience confirms the efficacy of FLU in the treatment of refractory B-CLL patients and is in agreement with previous reports as no response is initiated after the 3rd course. The lymphocyte count decreases quickly and strikingly. Depletion of CD4 lymphocytes along with neutropenia and hypogammaglobulinaemia make these patients highly sensitive to all types of infection, chiefly by opportunistic germs, so adequate anti-infectious prophylaxis is of great importance.

Other neoplasms were not confirmed to be causally related to HQ among the reported bioassays. In the male F344 rat, HQ administered alone was not DNA reactive. HQ produced enhanced proliferation of renal tubular epithelium, presumably through toxicity involving glutathione conjugate formation. In the kidney, bone marrow, and other tissues, HQ may induce toxicity by redox cycling and lipid peroxidation. In bone marrow, HQ may produce microtubulin dysfunction, which is a plausible explanation for positive cytogenetic tests, the only consistently positive genotoxicity effect reported for HQ. Although HQ is a metabolic product of benzene, several lines of evidence suggest that the effects of HQ exposure are significantly different from those of benzene. Based upon the plausible mechanisms by which HQ may produce kidney tumors in male rats, we have concluded that occupational exposure levels of HQ are not predicted to be a cancer risk for humans.","['Environmental Health and Safety Program, American Health Foundation, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA.']",,,,118,,,,,,,,,

Loss of Fas/Apo-1 receptor leads in (lpr,lpr) mice to a nonmalignant accumulation of abnormal T-cells very probably due to the lack of induction of apoptosis in peripheral T-cells. It has been reported that soluble forms of Fas/Apo-1 receptor that may interfere with apoptotic signaling occur in patients suffering from various forms of lymphoid neoplasms. Therefore, we wished to investigate whether the loss of proper homeostatic regulation through Fas/Apo-1 receptor mediated apoptosis could influence the process of lymphomagenesis. To this end, we performed two experiments (i) we infected (lpr,lpr) animals with Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMuLV) that causes T-cell lymphoma in mice and (ii) we crossed (lpr,lpr) animals with E mu L-myc transgenic mice that are prone to develop T- and B-cell lymphoma due to deregulated expression of the L-myc transgene by the immunoglobulin enhancer E mu. We find that infection with MoMuLV did not accelerate the formation of lymphoid neoplasms in (lpr,lpr) mice when compared to infected normal animals. However, E mu L-myc/(lpr,lpr) animals that constitutively express the L-myc transgene in the lymphoid lineage clearly show accelerated formation of T- and B-cell lymphoma when compared to normal E mu L-myc transgenics. These data demonstrate that in cooperation with particular oncogenes impairment of Fas/Apo-1 receptor function can indeed affect and modulate the process of tumor formation.","['Institut fur Molekularbiologie und Tumorforschung (IMT), Philipps Universitat Marburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML/RAR alpha is expressed in APL cells with the non-rearranged alleles, PML and RAR alpha. Clinical remissions induced by all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) treatment of APL patients are linked to expression of PML/RAR apha, a transcription factor with reported dominant negative functions. The roles of PML and RAR alpha in the RA response of APL have not yet been fully explored. This study examines these roles by individually transfecting RAR alpha and PML into NB4 APL cells. NB4 is the sole APL cell line containing the t(15;17). RA treatment represses NB4 cell growth and induces a myeloid phentoype. Full length cDNAs for RAR alpha and PML were individually cloned into a CMV-driven expression vector containing the neomycin resistance gene. Surprisingly, none of the obtained stable transfectants expressed exogenous RAR alpha or PML mRNAs even when reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection assays were used. All clones expressed the neomycin resistance gene and were similar to parental NB4 cells in their growth and differentiation properties. An explanation explored for this lack of gene expression was that increased levels of RAR alpha or PML might suppress APL cell growth. To examine this possibility, transfection experiments were repeated using an episomal vector-based expression system containing an SV40 driven RAR alpha or PML cDNA and the hygromycin B resistance gene. A new selection strategy augmented expression of the desired cDNAs. A control episomal vector lacked a cDNA insert. Following electroporation and selection, exogenous RAR alpha expression was obtained. Compared to controls, the growth of these transfectants was markedly inhibited before and after RA-treatment and these cells more prominently induced myeloid maturation markers. In contrast, exogenous PML expression was transient since these transfectants did not appear to propagate in culture. These findings indicate: (1) a growth disadvantage for NB4 cells having increased expression of RAR alpha or PML and (2) increased RAR alpha expression augmented RA-mediated maturation of NB4 cells. This implicates a role for RAR alpha or PML in regulating the growth or differentiation of APL cells. It is hypothesized this occurs through antagonism of PML/RAR alpha actions in these leukemic cells.","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Hospital, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']","['1F32CA61646-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01 CA62275-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA01712/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The relationship between p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptotic cell death, as well as the cell cycle checkpoints induced by DNA damaging agents were explored in hematopoietic cells, using M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, which are null for p53 expression, genetically engineered M1 variants, expressing p53ts and bcl-2 transgenes, as well as myeloblast enriched bone-marrow cells obtained from wild type p53 (wt p53) and p53-deficient mice. It is shown that gamma-irradiation of M1p53ts cells activated a function of the temperature sensitive mutant transgene p53 (p53ts), promoting increased apoptosis relative to parental, null p53 M1 cells. It is also shown that the kinetics of apoptotic cell death induced by gamma-irradiation correlated with the rapidity of exit from gamma-ray-induced G2 arrest for all the different hematopoietic cell types indicated above. Finally, data has been obtained to demonstrate that, in addition to a role in apoptosis and G1 arrest, wild-type p53 positively modulated the exit from the gamma-ray-induced G2 checkpoint. Taken together, these findings indicate that this new function for p53 is a component of the physiological pathway by which p53 exerts its role in apoptosis.","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']","['1RO1CA43618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA51162/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood and bone marrow films from 36 patients with a possible-diagnosis of CLL were referred to two laboratories of Nagasaki University Hospital (Nagasaki) and Royal Marsden Hospital (London). According to the FAB criteria, typical CLL 16 and CLL/PL 2, a subtype of atypical CLL, were completely accordant in diagnosis. However, phenotypical diagnosis of CLL mixed, the other of atypical CLL, and intermediate lymphocytic leukemia (ILL) in leukemic phase often gave inconsistent results. Especially, 8 cases of atypical CLL designated as likely CLL were equivocal between CLL and ILL, suggesting clinical feature more close to typical CLL than ILL. This indicates the presence of a relatively high incidence of atypical CLL in Japan which dose not exactly fit with the FAB Criteria.

A comparative study of the biotin streptavidin enhanced peroxidase technique, the biotin streptavidin enhanced alkaline phosphatase technique and the indirect immunoperoxidase technique showed that the indirect immunoperoxidase technique was more sensitive than the other techniques for detecting p53 protein. The results of several fixation methods demonstrated that formalin and methanol, formalin and ethanol (1:9) and buffered formalin acetone gave good results for detecting p53 protein. In the eosinophils and neutrophils the endogenous peroxidase reaction disappeared after microwave heating for over three minutes. Thus enzyme pre-blocking of blood smears could be omitted. Four solutions for microwave treatment were tested. Excellent antigen retrieval was obtained with pH6.4, pH7.4 phosphate buffer saline and pH6.0 citric acid. However, the nuclear antigens could not be retrieved and the positive reaction could not be obtained after the treatment with distilled water. The optimal microwave heating time was five to ten minutes. The indirect immunoperoxidase technique performed using microwave treatment under these optimal conditions may be potentially applicable for detecting low levels of nuclear antigens in the leukemic cells within conventional blood smears.","[""Division of Laboratory, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Yokohama.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This problem may be solved by the direct genetic approach using antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (AS ODN) based on the specificity of Watson-Crick base pair formation, if an appropriate disease-specific target can be identified. Since the pioneering works by Zamecnik and Stephenson to inhibit gene expression using AS ODN, recent progress in cloning of pathogenic genes and technical advance in the synthesis of ODN analogues have spurred a research effort dedicated to the development of AS therapy for cancer and viral disease. Chemically-modified ODNs such as phosphorothioate analogues, which are nuclease resistant and considered to be suitable for clinical use, can effectively inhibit the expression of activated oncogenes or the viral replication and lead to the growth suppression of cancer cells and viral genomes in vitro and in experiments using animal models as well. Phase I clinical trials, designed to evaluate the toxicity of these compounds in leukemia or AIDS patients, have already commenced. In these trials, which are now in its infancy, a considerable number of problems will be encountered.

The balance of coagulation and fibrinolysis activation varies according to the underlying diseases of DIC. DIC cases are classified as the type with predominant coagulation activation and the type with predominant fibrinolysis activation in former type plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) are greatly increased, and those of plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex (PIC) are slightly increased. In addition plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PA1) are greatly increased, multiple organ failure is a major clinical manifestation in advanced cases and sepsis is a representative underlying disease. In the second type both plasma levels of TAT and PIC are greatly increased, plasma levels of PA1 are almost within normal limits. Bleeding is a major clinical manifestation in advanced cases and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a representative underlying disease. The classification of DIC should be considered when choosing treatment with DIC. Diagnosis of pre-DIC status is based on gradually decreasing platelets counts in sepsis and on mild elevation of FDP and D dimer in APL, leukemia and cancer.","['Department of Internal Medicine (III), Kanazawa University School of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these methods include several technical limitations. In FISH, an appropriate cut off value should be settled for each probe or procedure in estimating chromosomal gain, loss, or translocation and the sensitivity depends on the cut off values but it may reach to 10(-3). In PCR, the sensitivity is higher than that of FISH especially using genomic DNA as a template. However, the detection of chromosomal translocation-specific DNA or RNA constructs is currently applicable to limited cases and the amplification of Ig or TCR gene rearrangement has a major pitfall caused by the clonal evolution. Clinically, MRD can be an indicator for a prediction of the relapse. For example, a greater MRD on entering CR tends to be related with an early relapse, a return to MRD-positive after disappearance of MRD will be a sign of impending relapse, and MRD negativity at the termination of therapy may be correlated with a long-term disease free status. More precise evaluation of MRD is necessary with regard to therapeutic strategy.","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that the elevation of plasma sCD8 is due to expansion of CD8+ subset as well as increased sCD8 release from each CD8+ cell. Increased sCD4 release from CD4+ lymphocytes was also seen. During convalescence sCD8 and sCD4 levels showed progressive decrease; however, even at 60-120 days after onset the levels of sCD8 and sCD4 remained higher than normal, suggesting prolonged lymphocyte activation.

A new rapid method to automatically count reticulated platelets is very recently established by our research group. The principle of the measurement of reticulated platelets is based on flow cytometry. The platelets are quickly stained with a RNA fluorescent dye, auramine O and fluorescent intensity (RNA content) and forward scatter (cell size) are measured in only 80 seconds with a reticulocyte counter, equipped with special software for analysis of reticulated platelets. Both of the reproducibility and the linearity were shown to be good. Normal percentage value for reticulated platelets was 0.98% +/- 0.41% and its absolute count was 2.12 +/- 0.69 x 10(9)/l. The absolute count was decreased in patients with reduced thrombopoiesis such as acute myeloblastic leukemia, aplastic anemia and was elevated in patients with essential thrombocythemia and in chronic myelocytic leukemia. The patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura had a high percentage of reticulated platelets. An apparent rise was noticed in the percentage of reticulated platelets which preceded by several days a progressive increase in the platelet count at the recovery phase of thrombocytopenia in a couple of leukemic patients. These suggest that an automated measurement of reticulated platelets can be clinically useful to estimate thrombopoiesis in bone marrow.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was demonstrated previously that the HSV-1 Vmw65 mutant in1814, which is impaired for immediate early (IE) transcription, was retained for many days in human fetal lung (HFL) fibroblasts in a quiescent 'latent' state. Molecular analysis of the viral genome was not possible, however, due to residual expression of IE proteins and consequent cytotoxicity at high m.o.i. In the study reported here, IE transcription was reduced further by pretreatment of cells with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and by the use of mutant in1820, a derivative of in1814 in which the Vmw110 promoter was replaced by the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Momulv) enhancer. The Momulv enhancer was not expressed under IE conditions; thus in1820 was more impaired for replication than in1814 and behaved as if deficient for both Vmw65 and Vmw110. In cells pretreated with IFN-alpha and subsequently infected with in1820 cytotoxicity was overcome, enabling a tissue culture system to be developed in which all cells stably retained at least one quiescent viral genome. To assist the analysis of gene expression, in1820 was further modified by insertion of the Escherichia coli lacZ gene controlled by the human cytomegalovirus enhancer (mutant in1883) or the HSV-1 immediate early Vmw110 promoter (in1884). Expression of beta-galactosidase was not detected after infection of IFN-alpha-pretreated cells with in1883 or in1884 but could be induced in almost all cells containing a viral genome, by superinfection of cultures. In1820-derived viruses were retained for at least 9 days and were not reactivated by subculture of cells. A regular arrangement of nucleosomes, as found in cellular chromatin, was not detected on the viral genome at the thymidine kinase locus. The non-linear genome was a template for reactivation with no requirement for prior conversion to a linear form. A small number of remaining linear genomes resulted from incomplete uncoating of input virus.","['Institute of Virology, Glasgow, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, cerebrospinal fluid levels of ferritin, an iron-binding protein, were determined in controls and in patients with central nervous system pyogenic and viral infections. Among 441 controls, cerebrospinal fluid ferritin level was higher than 18 ng/mL in two relapsed patients with central nervous system leukemia, 12 with bacteremia or pneumonia, and one with hemorrhagic herpes simplex encephalitis. Cerebrospinal fluid ferritin levels were more than 18 ng/mL in 13 of 63 patients diagnosed with nonhemorrhagic aseptic meningitis/ventriculitis, when defined solely by negative cerebrospinal fluid culture. Conversely, cerebrospinal fluid ferritin exceeded 18 ng/mL in culture-proven meningitis (46 of 47 cases) and ventriculitis (five of five cases). Cases of indolent cryptococcus and tuberculous meningitis showed modest increases despite traditional cerebrospinal fluid markers, at times, being normal. Cerebrospinal fluid ferritin levels did not correlate with cerebrospinal fluid neutrophil count, cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration, serum ferritin level, or patient age. In 16 of 19 cases monitored sequentially during ongoing antibiotic treatment, levels remained over 18 ng/mL (average, 15.0 days; range, 1 to 54 days). This observation suggests that obtaining cerebrospinal fluid ferritin levels is helpful whenever traditional laboratory benchmarks normalize, as during acute or chronic antibiotic therapy, or create confusion with positive cultures stemming from sample contamination.","['Michigan State University, Department of Pediatrics/Human Development, Kalamazoo 49008, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes for insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), transforming growth factors (TGFs), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and receptors for insulin, IGF, PDGF, TGF alpha and epidermal growth factor (EGF) are expressed by early embryos of several species including mouse, rat, cow and sheep. Roles of growth factors during early development have been demonstrated by addition of purified growth factors to culture medium or by molecular genetic techniques that interfere with gene expression. In this way, it has been shown that successful development of the blastocyst is dependent on the action of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Recent experiments show that both LIF and EGF stimulate secretion of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and gelatinase B/matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in day 7 mouse blastocyst outgrowths. At the same time, tissue inhibitors of MMPs (TIMPs) are also expressed by embryonic, decidual and uterine tissues during the implantation process. It appears that LIF may act directly or indirectly, by inducing the expression of other cytokines, to regulate the temporal and spatial production and activity of proteases and protease inhibitors to create a favourable environment for implantation.","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",,,,54,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, GH is shown to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), the principle substrate of the insulin receptor. Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 is a critical step in insulin signaling and provides binding sites for proteins with the appropriate Src homology 2 domains, including the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3'-kinase. In 3T3-F442A fibroblasts, GH-dependent tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 was detected by 1 min and at GH concentrations as low as 5 ng/ml (0.23 nM). Tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 was transient, with maximal stimulation detected at 30 min and diminished signal detected at 60 min. The ability of GH receptor (GHR) to transduce the signal for IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation is mediated by the intracellular region of GHR between amino acids 295 and 380 by a mechanism not involving the two tyrosines in this region. This region of GHR is required for GH-dependent JAK2 association and activation (VanderKuur, J. A., Wang, X., Zhang, L., Campbell, G. S., Allevato, G., Billestrup, N., Norstedt, G., and Carter-Su, C. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21709-21717). When other cytokines that activate JAK2 were tested for the ability to stimulate the tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1, stimulation was detected with interferon-gamma and leukemia inhibitory factor. The correlation between JAK2 tyrosyl phosphorylation and IRS-1 tyrosyl phosphorylation in response to GH, interferon-gamma, and leukemia inhibitory factor and in cells expressing different GHR mutants, provides evidence that IRS-1 may interact with JAK2 or an auxiliary molecule that binds to JAK2. GH is also shown to stimulate binding of IRS-1 to the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of PI 3'-kinase. The ability of GH to stimulate tyrosyl phosphorylation of IRS-1 and its association with PI 3'-kinase provides a biochemical basis for responses shared by insulin and GH including the well characterized insulin-like metabolic effects of GH observed in a variety of cell types.","['Department of Physiology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0622, USA.']","['DK 43808/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK34171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK043808/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK034171/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK36836/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/D26177', 'GENBANK/L16956', 'GENBANK/L32955', 'GENBANK/M25764', 'GENBANK/M33324', 'GENBANK/M83336', 'GENBANK/S63728', 'GENBANK/S69336']",,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of 8-oxo-dGTPase mainly located in cytosolic and mitochondrial soluble fractions of Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia line. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, using a specific antibody against MTH1 protein, showed localization of MTH1 protein in the mitochondrial matrix. Activity in the mitochondria accounted for about 4% of the total activity. The specific activity in the mitochondrial soluble fraction (8093 units/mg protein) was as high as that in the cytosolic fraction (8111 unit/mg protein). The 8-oxo-dGTPase activities in cytosolic and mitochondrial soluble fractions co-eluted with MTH1 protein by anion-exchange chromatography, and the molecular mass of the mitochondrial MTH1 protein was much the same as that of the cytosolic MTH1 protein (about 18 kDa). HeLa cells expressing MTH1 cDNA showed an increased cytoplasmic signal together with a weak signal in the nucleus in in situ immunostaining of MTH1 protein, and the overexpressed MTH1 protein was recovered from both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions.

The comparable cytostatic effects occurred in both syngeneic and allogeneic BM-tumor cell combinations. The cytostatic BM-effectors were distinct from T and B lymphocytes or mature macrophages. After being separated on a discontinuous Percoll density gradient, the cells active in suppressing tumor growth were recovered predominantly in 1.075 and 1.060 density fractions. The cytostatic BM effectors, at least in their part, were resistant to x-irradiation up to 2000 rad included. Collectively these results suggest that normal BM, being deficient in cell-mediated antitumor cytolytic activity, has a significant leukemia growth inhibitory potential; and that cytostatic BM effectors are similar in their characteristics to natural suppressor cells.","['Department of Experimental Immunology, Institute of Clinical Immunology, Novosibirsk, Russia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It maps approximately 50 kb telomeric to MLL, a gene that is disrupted in a number of leukemia-associated translocation chromosomes. cDNA clones representing ARCN1 hybridize to 4-kb mRNA species present in all tissues tested. Sequencing of cDNAs suggests that at least two forms of mRNA with alternative 5' ends are present within the cell. The mRNA with the longest open reading frame gives rise to a protein of 57 kDa. Although the sequence reported is novel, remarkable similarity is observed with two predicted protein sequences from partial DNA sequences generated by rice (Oryza sativa) and fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) genome projects. The degree of sequence conservation is comparable to that observed for highly conserved structural proteins, such as heat shock protein HSP70, and is greater than that of gamma-tubulin and heat shock protein HSP60. A more distant relationship to the group of clathrin-associated proteins suggests a possible role in vesicle structure or trafficking. In view of its ancient pedigree and a potential involvement in cellular architecture, we propose that the ARCN1 protein be named archain.","['Department of Pathology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",,"['GENBANK/X81197', 'GENBANK/X81198']",,,,,,,,,,,

Inhibition of TfR mRNA expression induced by 10 nM PMA and 100 microM dbcAMP was abolished by prior incubation of cells with 0.1-1.0 microM GF109203X, a PKC-specific inhibitor, and 1-10 microM H-89, a PKA-specific inhibitor, respectively. The blocking effects of GF109203X and H-89 were dose-dependent and complete at the highest concentrations of the inhibitors used. Although treatment of cells with GF109203X or H-89 alone did not alter the constitutive expression of TfR mRNA, incubation of cells with 30-100 nM staurosporine, a wide-spectrum protein kinase inhibitor, resulted in suppression of the constitutive expression of TfR mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that (i) the down-regulation of TfR mRNA expression during the differentiation of HL-60 cells can be mediated by activation of either PKC or PKA; (ii) the constitutive expression of TfR mRNA in proliferating HL-60 cells is staurosporine-sensitive and is probably maintained by protein kinase(s) other than PKC and PKA.","['Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also investigated tissue distribution of etoposide in rats treated with Etp-oil and Etp-sol. Etoposide was injected intraperitoneally at concentrations ranging from 52 to 392 mg/kg (increasing geometrically by a factor of 1.4). The 50% lethal dose (LD50), determined over a 2-week period of observation, was 135 mg/kg for Etp-oil and 108 mg/kg for Etp-sol. Autopsy findings included macroscopic intestinal bleeding, necrosis of the intestinal mucosa, and pulmonary congestion in mice from both treatment groups. In the efficacy trials. 10(6) P388 leukemia cells were transplanted into CDF1 male mice, and Etp-oil and Etp-sol were injected at doses of 20 mg/kg and 80 mg/kg. In the groups receiving the 20 mg/kg dose, 11 of 19 mice in the Etp-oil group survived to day 60 compared with 3 of 20 mice in the Etp-sol group. Toxicity-related deaths occurred in 1 of 20 mice treated with 80 mg/kg Etp-oil and in 8 of 20 mice treated with 80 mg/kg Etp-sol. No cancer-related deaths were associated with the 80 mg/kg dose in either treatment group. Our findings showed that the Etp-oil was associated with a lower toxicity and a higher efficacy than the Etp-sol. To evaluate tissue distribution, rats were injected intraperitoneally with 5 mg/kg body weight of Etp-sol or Etp-oil. The tissue distribution of etoposide was subsequently analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Compared with Etp-sol, Etp-oil delivered significantly greater amounts of etoposide and for a longer period to the omentum, taken as representative of the intraperitoneal tissue, and the etoposide concentration in blood plasma was increased more slowly and decreased more gradually.","['First Department of Surgery, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior studies in patients with refractory solid tumors have identified the dose-limiting toxicity of hepsulfam to be cumulative myelosuppression resulting in prolonged leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. This phase I trial was designed to determine the maximally tolerated dose of hepsulfam administered intravenously in patients with refractory leukemias and other advanced hematologic malignancies. Hepsulfam was administered as a 30-min or 2-h intravenous infusion to 21 patients with advanced leukemia or multiple myeloma. All patients had been extensively treated and had progressive disease. Cycles were repeated every 5 weeks. Cohorts of patients were treated at 360, 480, 640, and 800 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxicity of intravenous hepsulfam was severe encephalopathy. The single patient treated at 800 mg/m2 became comatose within 48 h and required 3 weeks for his mental status to return to baseline. There were, however, no irreversible neurological sequelae. Several patients treated at 640 mg/m2 had clinical evidence of toxic deliriums and slowing of alpha rhythm waves on electroencephalograms indicative of a gray-matter encephalopathy. When hepsulfam was infused over 30 min, patients complained of uncomfortable parasthesias, but when the drug was administered over 2 h, these acute symptoms were less common. Myelosuppression was observed in most patients. Among those patients who had some suppression of their leukemia, peripheral blood counts recovered to pretreatment levels after 3-5 weeks. Apart from CNS toxicity, non-hematologic toxicity was minimal. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated rapid clearance of hepsulfam so that the drug was not reliably detected in the plasma after 24 h. The recommended phase II dose of hepsulfam as a single 2-h intravenous infusion is 480 mg/m2, but this dose provided relatively little clinical benefit for patients with refractory leukemia. The dose-limiting toxicity is CNS toxicity with increasingly severe encephalopathy at doses > or = 640 mg/m2. It would be reasonable to investigate further dose escalation of hepsulfam in a divided dose schedule to minimize the peak concentrations which may be related to the encephalopathy. EEG monitoring is recommended for early detection of slowing of alpha rhythm waves. Hematopoietic stem cell support will probably be required at total doses exceeding 800 mg/m2.","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637-1470, USA.']","['CA 14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-07301/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the reversal effect of S 9788 in comparison with verapamil was shown in vitro in human T-leukemic CCRF-CEM/VLB cells expressing the multidrug-resistance (MDR) phenotype. S 9788 increased in a dose-dependent manner the cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin or vinblastine, with complete reversal of resistance occurring at 2 microM for a concomitant continuous exposure (96 h) to the cytotoxic drugs. At respective concentrations equivalent to the IC10 value (the concentration inhibiting 10% of cell growth), S 9788 was 44 times more potent than verapamil in CCRF-CEM/VLB cells. S 9788 at 2 microM did not enhance the in vitro toxicity of doxorubicin or vinblastine in the human normal bone-marrow erythroid (BFU-E) and myeloid (CFU-GM) progenitors. The effect of exposure duration and concentrations on the synergistic action of modulator and cytotoxic agent closely depended on the cytotoxic agent studied. Post-incubations with S 9788 alone after a 1-h coadministration with vinblastine and S 9788 dramatically increased the reversal effect (4-41 times) in proportion to both the duration of postincubation and the concentration of S 9788. In contrast, for doxorubicin resistance, post-incubation with S 9788 alone induced a maximal 2-fold increase in the reversal effect that was not proportional to the post-incubation duration. In patients treated with S 9788 as a 30-min intravenous infusion during phase I trials, a good correlation was found between the serum levels of S 9788 and the ability to reverse MDR in CCRF-CEM/VLB cells. The reversal effect was dose-dependent and was effective beginning at a plasma concentration of 0.25 microM. These data form a basis for the design of phase II trials using a combination of a loading dose of S 9788 given before vinblastine or doxorubicin administration followed by a maintenance infusion of S 9788 alone for a period of 2-24 h.","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the single-administration study, all patients were evaluable and no clear adverse effect was observed at doses ranging from 20 to 320 mg/m2. In the daily-administration study, 28 evaluable patients (16 men and 12 women; median age, 55.5 years) were treated with a daily dose of 20-500 mg/m2. Toxicities such as myelosuppression, mild nausea/vomiting, anorexia, alopecia, tongue and perioral numbness, and hypotension were observed dose-dependently during or after the treatment. Grade 2 leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were experienced at a dose of 500 mg/m2. These usually recovered to normal values by approximately 3 weeks after treatment. A pharmacokinetic analysis of single administration revealed rapid plasma clearance, with mean half-lives for the alpha and beta phases being 28 min and 6.9 h, respectively. Approximately 12% of the infused dose was excreted into the urine in unmetabolized form. The pharmacokinetic parameters obtained after 5-day administration were similar to those recorded after single administration. Concerning treatment response, a transient but significant reduction in the number of leukemic cells was observed in one patient with adult T-cell leukemia. In this study, perioral numbness, hypotension, and hematological toxicity were concluded to be dose-limiting, with the maximal acceptable dose being 500 mg/m2. The recommended dose for a phase II study of NKT-01 against solid tumors was judged to be 400 mg/m2 given daily by 3-h infusion for 5 days, every 3 weeks. In hematological malignancies, however, higher myelosuppressive schedules of administration should be investigated.","['Miyazaki Prefectural Hospital, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This lesion was associated with an expanding erythematous annular lesion located on the anterior face of thorax and left axillary area, without any lymphadenopathy. The association of this cutaneous lymphocytoma and erythema chronicum migrans was suggestive of Borellia infection despite absence of previous tick bite. Serologic tests (indirect immunofluorescence) were negative, but both lesions disappeared within 2 weeks with ceftriaxone, 50 mg/kg/day.

This analysis was undertaken to determine the outcome for patients treated in an autologous bone marrow transplant program, which was initiated in January 1989, and to illustrate the impact which biological response modifiers have had on the toxicity, survival, and costs associated with this aggressive treatment approach. Patients with metastatic cancer and good performance status were treated according to disease-specific treatment protocols. Peripheral blood stem cells [PBSC] came into use in 1990, hematopoietic colony stimulating factors [CSFs] in 1991. Outcome was monitored prospectively from the inception of the program. Five years after the program's inception, 75 patients had undergone 96 intensive chemotherapy treatments followed by autologous PBSC rescue. This included 35 patients with breast cancer, 15 with lymphoma or Hodgkin's Disease, five ovary, four melanoma, three sarcoma, three lung cancer, three leukemia, three testicular, two myeloma, one non-lung small cell carcinoma, and one medulloblastoma. Twenty-one patients underwent back-to-back cycles of intensive therapy and rescue; 14 of whom had breast cancer. Twelve patients were treated in 1989, 14 in 1990, 18 in 1991, 14 in 1992, and 17 in 1993. While four of the first 12 patients died within 60 days of reinfusion of cells in 1989, no patients have died within this time frame as a direct result of therapy during the subsequent four years. No patients have been lost to follow-up. Median survival was only eight months in 1989, but has not been reached for subsequent years. For all patients, median failure-free survival (FFS) is 17.2 months; 1-year FFS is 57%, 2-year 36%, and 3-year 29%. Median overall survival (OS) is 30.4 months; 1-year OS 66%, 2-year 52%, and 3-year 42%. From 1990-1993, for patients with metastatic breast cancer (21), and recurrent lymphoma (15), FFS and OS are comparable to the best results published from academic teaching hospitals. Twenty-one patients have survived over two years, 18 of whom continue in remission. Patients were hospitalized for an average of 31 days in 1989, 28.9 in 1990, 24.5 in 1991, and only 13.0-14.0 days in 1992-1993. Two patients were treated entirely as outpatients. Average hospital charges for the 96 treatments have been $120,000 with a range of $15,000 to $461,000, and currently average around $100,000.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Patty & George Hoag Cancer Center, Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian, Newport Beach, California, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was shown that all tumors had a unique profile of eicosanoids. The most cyclooxygenase activity along with the significant synthesis of PGE2, PGF2 alpha, and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was noted in lung tumors. The antitumor effect of indomethacin was directly related to the ability of tumors to produce PGE2. On the other hand, there were varying lipoxygenase activities in tumors.

Twenty-two patients had acute myelogenous leukemia, nine had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 43 had Hodgkin's disease, 57 had non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 14 patients had multiple myeloma. Eighty-four patients were male and 61 female, with a median age of 37 years (range, 16 to 58 years). In 46 patients, PBPC were collected after cytotoxic chemotherapy alone, while 99 patients received cytokines either during steady-state hematopoiesis or post-chemotherapy. Sixty patients were treated with dose-escalated polychemotherapy, and 85 patients had a conditioning therapy including hyperfractionated total body irradiation at a total dose of 14.4 Gy. The duration of severe pancytopenia posttransplantation was inversely related to the number of reinfused granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and CD34+ cells. Threshold quantities of 2.5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kilogram or 12.0 x 10(4) CFU-GM per kilogram became evident and were associated with rapid neutrophil and platelet recovery within less than 18 and 14 days, respectively. These numbers were also predictive for long-term reconstitution, indicating that normal blood counts are likely to be achieved within less than 10 months after transplantation. Conversely, 12 patients were autografted with a median of 1.75 x 10(4) CFU-GM per kilogram resulting in delayed recovery to platelet counts of greater than 150 x 10(9)/L between 1 and 6 years. Our study includes bone marrow examinations in 50 patients performed at a median follow-up time of 10 months (range, 1 to 85 months) posttransplantation. A comparison with normal volunteers showed a 3.2-fold smaller proportion of bone marrow CD34+ cells, which was paralleled by an even more pronounced reduction in the plating efficiency of CFU-GM and burst-forming unit-erythroid. No secondary graft failure was observed, even in patients autografted with relatively low numbers of progenitor cells. This suggests that either the pretransplant regimens were not myeloablative, allowing autochthonous recovery, or that a small number of cells capable of perpetual self-renewal were included in the autograft products.","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our results showed that EVI1 expression was frequent in patients with post-MDS AML and AML with trilineage myelodysplasia, regardless of the presence or absence of 3q26 abnormalities. EVI1 expression was accompanied by expression of GATA-1 and GATA-2, and often by stem cell leukemia (SCL) gene expression. In patients with post-MDS AML, EVI1 expression was not always associated with a 3q26 abnormality, whereas EVI1 expression in CML myelomegakaryoblast crisis was often linked to a 3q26 abnormality. Our results suggest that the leukemogenic role of EVI1 expression may differ between post-MDS AML and leukemia, with EVI1 expression associated with a 3q26 abnormality.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inv(16) breakpoints have been cloned and shown to involve the non-DNA binding component of the AML-1 transcription factor complex termed core binding factor beta gene (CBF beta) on 16q and the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain gene (MYH11) on 16p. In this study, we analyzed 37 cases of inv(16)-containing AML and 4 cases with t(16;16)(p13;q22) for expression of the CBF beta/MYH11 chimeric message by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. CBF beta/MYH11 chimeric messages were detected in 33 of 37 cases with the inv(16) and in the 4 t(16;16)-containing cases. Sequence analysis of PCR products showed extensive breakpoint heterogeneity in both CBF beta and MYH11. In addition to the previously described breakpoint in CBF beta at nucleotide (nt) 495 (amino acid 165), we have identified a second novel fusion point at nt 399 (amino acid 133) in 7% of the cases. Similarly, a unique breakpoint site was identified in MYH11 at nt 1098, as well as at three previously characterized sites at nts 994, 1201, and 1921. Of the 4 PCR-negative cases, 2 of 3 tested lacked CBF beta rearrangements by Southern blot analysis, suggesting the possible involvement of a different genomic locus in some cases with cytogenetic evidence of inv(16). To assess whether the portions of CBF-beta contained within the CBF beta/MYH11 chimeric products retain the ability to interact with their heterodimeric DNA-binding partner AML-1, we performed in vitro DNA-binding analysis. Recombinant CBF-beta polypeptides consisting of the N-terminal 165 amino acids retained their ability to interact with AML-1, whereas mutants containing only the N-terminal 133 amino acids interacted with AML-1 less efficiently. These data suggest that different CBF beta/MYH11 products may vary subtly in their biologic activities.","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]","['CA-01429/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonal abnormalities were detected in 21 cases (80.7%), 12 of which had a complex karyotype. Partial or total monosomy 5q and/or 7q was found, either as the sole aberration or in all abnormal metaphases, in 11 patients; in 8 cases, additional chromosome changes were present, including rearrangements involving 12p12-13 and 2p12-15 seen in 3 cases each. Five patients had trisomy 13 as a possible primary chromosome change; in 5 cases, nonrecurrent chromsome abnormalities were observed. Comparison of these findings with chromosome data from 42 patients with AML-M1 shows that abnormal karyotypes, complex karyotypes, unbalanced chromosome changes (-5/5q- and/or -7/7q- and +13) were observed much more frequently in AML-M0 than in AML-M1. Patients with abnormalities of chromosome 5 and/or 7 frequently showed trilineage myelodysplasia and low white blood cell count. Despite their relatively young age, complete remission was achieved in 4 of 11 patients only. Patients with +13 were elderly males with frequent professional exposure to myelotoxic agents. Unlike patients with clonal abnormalities, most AML-M0 patients with normal karyotype showed 1% to 2% peroxidase-positive blast cells at light microscopy and frequently achieved CR. It is concluded that (1) AML-M0 shows a distinct cytogenetic profile, partially recalling that of therapy-related AML, (2) different cytogenetic groups of AML-M0 can be identified showing characteristic clinicobiologic features, and (3) chromosome rearrangements may partially account for the unfavorable outcome frequently observed in these patients.","['Institute of Haematology, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",,,['Blood. 1996 Jan 1;87(1):418-20.

In the present report, we show that the induction of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in leukemic blasts is one of the growth-inhibitory mechanisms of quercetin in these cells. This observation was supported by the following data. (1) Quercetin-sensitive leukemic blasts, when treated with quercetin, secrete large amounts of TGF-beta 1 in the medium and show positivity for TGF-beta 1-immunoreactive material in the cytoplasm. (2) At a concentration of 8 mumol/L, antisense TGF-beta 1 oligonucleotides prevent the growth-inhibitory action of quercetin. (3) Anti-TGF-beta 1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies can prevent almost completely the growth-inhibitory activity of quercetin. The analysis of quercetin-resistant cases confirmed as well the central role of TGF-beta 1 in the growth-inhibitory activity of quercetin. In conclusion, quercetin can act as a cytostatic agent for leukemic cells by modulating the production of TGF-beta 1.","['Istituti di Anatomia Patologica, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the biologic function of PML, antipeptide antibody against PML protein was raised in rabbits. This antibody was able to detect a 90-kD PML protein and a 110-kD PML-RAR alpha fusion protein by Western blotting and a nuclear speckled pattern in all cell lines by immunofluorescent staining. In K562 and NIH/3T3 cells transfected with a PML expression plasmid, we found PML to be associated with the nuclear matrix. Our results also showed that PML is a phosphorprotein. A weak signal was detected in a Western blot containing the immunoprecipitated PML protein using the phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody. Therefore, at least one of the sites was phosphorylated by a tyrosine kinase. From our analysis of the phosphoamino acids of the PML protein by complete hydrolysis and thin-layer chromatography, we concluded that both tyrosine and serine residues of PML are phosphorylated. To investigate whether expression of the PML protein is cell-cycle related, HeLa cells synchronized at various phases of the cell cycle were analyzed by immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy for PML expression. We found that PML was expressed at a lower level in S, G2, and M phases and at a significantly higher level in G1 phase. Our study showed that PML has many similar properties compared with the tumor suppressor, eg, Rb.

We examined the capacity of CML stroma to support the growth of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) obtained from normal and CML marrow. The growth of normal LTC-IC on CML stroma was significantly reduced compared with normal stroma. This did not appear to be related to abnormal production of soluble factors by CML stroma because normal LTC-IC grew equally well in Transwells above CML stroma as in Transwells above normal stroma. In addition, CML and normal stromal supernatants contained similar quantities of both growth-stimulatory (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (CSF), interleukin-6, stem cell factor, granulocyte-macrophage CSF, and interleukin-1 beta) and growth-inhibitory cytokines (transforming growth factor-beta, macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). The relative proportion of different cell types in CML and normal stroma was similar. However, polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed the presence of bcr-abl-positivo cells in CML stroma, which were CD14+ stromal macrophages. To assess the effect of these malignant macrophages on stromal function, CML and normal stromal cells were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting into stromal mesenchymal cell (CD14-) and macrophage (CD14+) populations. CML and normal CD14- cells supported the growth of normal LTC-IC equally well. However, the addition of CML macrophages to normal or CML CD14- mesenchymal cells resulted in impaired progenitor support. This finding indicates that the abnormal function of CML bone marrow stroma is related to the presence of malignant macrophages. In contrast to normal LTC-IC, the growth of CML LTC-IC on allogeneic CML stromal layers was not impaired and was significantly better than that of normal LTC-IC cocultured with the same CML stromal layers. These studies demonstrate that, in addition to abnormalities in CML progenitors themselves, abnormalities in the CML marrow microenvironment related to the presence of malignant stromal macrophages may contribute to the selective expansion of leukemic progenitors and suppression of normal hematopoiesis in CML.","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']","['R01-CA-458401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL4993001/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HO5403901/HO/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The synergistic interaction between the cyclic nucleotide analogs and the retinoid is not unique to APL cells, as it is observed also in the peripheral granulocytes of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) patients. The molecular mechanisms underlying LAP induction were studied in NB4, an immortalized APL cell line. Induction of LAP enzymatic activity is dependent on the time of exposure and on the concentrations of dibutyryl-cAMP or 8-bromo-cAMP and ATRA, two factors that influence the kinetics of appearance of detectable levels of the enzyme. Augmentation of LAP levels by ATRA and cAMP is the result of both transcriptional and early posttranscriptional events and requires de novo protein synthesis. LAP induction correlates with augmentation in the levels of the type I catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase transcript and with granulocytic differentiation. The transcriptional component of the process leading to increased LAP gene expression was reproduced in its main features by transient transfection experiments performed in COS-7 cells using the normal retinoic acid receptor type alpha (RAR-alpha) or the APL-specific aberrant form (PML-RAR) and the upstream promoter of the liver/bone/kidney (L/B/K)-type alkaline phosphatase gene. The promoter is upregulated by treatment with ATRA, and this upregulation is further increased by cAMP analogs.","['Molecular Biology Unit, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To obtain a comprehensive view of chromosomal gains and losses, we applied the recently developed technique of comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to 28 patients with chronic B-cell leukemias. CGH results were compared with those obtained by chromosome banding analysis and interphase cytogenetics. In 19 of the 28 cases, chromosomal imbalances were detected, including amplified DNA sequences in three instances. The most common aberrations included gains of chromosomal material on 8q and 12 as well as losses of 6q, 11q, 13q, and 17p. In 13 cases, CGH revealed chromosomal gains and losses not detected by banding analysis. In 8 of these 13 cases, discrepancies were further investigated using other methods, and in all instances, the CGH findings were confirmed. A limitation of detecting small deleted regions by CGH was found in one example of 18p. In conclusion, our data show that the results of banding analysis in chronic B-cell leukemias often do not reflect the chromosomal changes in the predominant cell clone. This may be one explanation for the as yet poor correlation between cytogenetic findings and clinical course in this group of neoplasms.","['Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Abt.

RA decreased the specific binding of 125I-labeled TNF to these cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The maximal decrease occurred when cells were treated with 1 mumol/L RA for 24 hours at 37 degrees C. Scatchard analysis of the binding indicated that the decrease by RA was caused by a decrease in receptor number and not by a decrease in affinity. The downmodulation of TNF receptors was also confirmed by covalent receptor-ligand cross-linking studies. Receptor-mediated internalization of the ligand was also found to be decreased on treatment of cells with RA. Northern blot analysis also indicated a decrease in the transcript of the receptor. By using antibodies specific to either the p60 or p80 form of the TNF receptor, we found that both receptors were downregulated by RA. RA treatment also decreased TNF receptors on acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1. Other analogues of RA, specifically 9-cis-RA, (E)-4-[2-(5,6,7,8- tetrahydro-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]-benzoic acid (TTNPB), and 3-methyl-TTNPB, which differ in their specificity towards different RA receptors, were also active in downregulating TNF receptors. 3-Methyl-TTNPB, which is more specific for the RXR form of the RA receptor, was found to be most potent. The downregulation of TNF receptors by RA correlated with the downmodulation of the antiproliferative effects of TNF against U-937 cells. Overall, our results indicate that RA downmodulates both the p60 and p80 form of the TNF receptor on cells of myeloid origin, which correlates with the cellular response.","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This receptor is a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily and is essential for megakaryocyte maturation; however, the molecular mechanisms of TPO and c-MpI action have not been elucidated. Recently, the Janus kinases have emerged as important elements in signaling via this family of receptors. In this report, we show that, in the M07e megakaryocytic cell line, which expresses c-MpI and proliferates in response to TPO, TPO induces phosphorylation of a number of substrates between 80 and 140 kD. Specifically, we show that stimulation with TPO induces the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-kD protein that we identify as the Janus kinase, JAK2. However, no detectable tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK3, or TYK2 was observed. TPO also induced activation of JAK2 phosphotransferase activity in vitro. Taken together, these data indicate that JAK2 likely plays a key role in TPO-mediated signal transduction.","['Arthritis and Rheumatism Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1820, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the final 6 h the tissue was cultured in sulphate free DMEM containing 35SO4. The radioactivity in the medium and tissue was determined in cetylpyridinium chloride precipitates. Biosynthetic activity was expressed as DPM per mg wet weight of cartilage. Dose-dependent suppression of proteoglycan synthesis was observed with murine and human recombinant LIF in pig and goat cartilage.

The shedding of a soluble form of ICAM-1 from melanoma impairs immune recognition and leads to tumour escape. Pretreatment of the Foss human melanoma cell line with HILDA/LIF or OSM, two cytokines involved in acute-phase response, increased the expression of membrane ICAM-1 twofold without inducing sICAM-1 shedding. Conversely, TNF-alpha, in the same conditions, strongly stimulated membrane ICAM-1 expression and the shedding of the soluble form. The same phenomenon was observed on the A375 human melanoma cell line. ICAM-1 upregulation was concomitant with an increase in the non-MHC-restricted cytotoxicity of tumour cells mediated by LAK cell.s This higher sensitivity to LAK lysis was abolished by RR1/1, a specific monoclonal antibody against ICAM-1. Our results demonstrate for the first time the ability of HILDA/LIF and OSM to upregulate ICAM-1 expression on the melanoma cell surface, suggesting a potential role for these cytokines in human immune surveillance during tumour progression.","['U211 INSERM, Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effects of G418 selection were studied at the level of vector-transduced cell populations and at the level of single-vector-transduced cell clones obtained without selection for vector expression. Selection for vector expression prior to isolation of cell clones changed the range of vector expression for the two populations of cell clones. Cell clones harboring the Akv enhancer, isolated without selection and then subjected to prolonged growth under selective conditions, exhibited no mutations in the enhancer region or major vector rearrangements although showing increased vector expression in some cases.

Human K562 cells, which express PHGPX, but not GPX, were also more sensitive to t-BuOOH in the Se-deficient (K.Se(-)) than Se-satisfied (K.Se(+)) condition. In examining the metabolic basis for selenoperoxidase-dependent resistance, we found that glucose-replete Se(-) cells reduce t-BuOOH to t-butanol far more slowly than Se(+) cells, the ratio of the first-order rate constants approximating that of the GPX activities (L1210 cells) or PHGPX activities (K562 cells). Monitoring peroxide-induced changes in GSH and GSSG gave consistent results; e.g., glucose-depleted L.Se(+) cells exhibited a first order loss of GSH that was substantially faster than that of glucose-depleted L.Se(-) cells. Under the conditions used, peroxide-induced conversion of GSH to GSSG could be stoichiometrically reversed by resupplying D-glucose, indicating that no significant lysis or GSSG efflux and/or interchange had taken place. The apparent first-order rate constant for GSH decay increased progressively for L1210 cells expressing a range of GPX activities from approximately 5% to 100%, demonstrating that peroxide detoxification is strictly dependent on enzyme content. The initial rate of 14CO2 release from D-[1-14C]glucose supplied in the medium was much greater for L.Se(+) or K.Se(+) cells than for their respective Se(-) counterparts, consistent with greater hexose monophosphate shunt activity in the former. These results highlight the importance of selenoperoxidase action in the glutathione cycle as a means by which tumor cells cope with hydroperoxide stress.","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

J., 300, 423-429) that paternal preconception irradiation may be an aetiological factor in these diseases. No malignant neoplasm was diagnosed among 382 offspring of survivors of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma followed up for a median period of 5.8 years, the largest available cohort of such offspring.

In cell line studies, idarubicin (IDR), aclarubicin (ACR) and mitoxantrone (MIT) showed a (partial) lack of cross-resistance to the conventional anthracyclines DNR and doxorubicin (DOX), but clinical studies in childhood ALL have been inconclusive about the suggested lack of cross-resistance. In the present study we determined the in vitro cross-resistance pattern between DNR, DOX, IDR, ACR and MIT in 48 untreated and 39 relapsed samples from children with ALL using the MTT assay. The relapsed ALL group was about twice as resistant to DNR, DOX, IDR, ACR and MTT as the untreated ALL group. Thus, resistance developed to all five drugs. We found a significant cross-resistance between DNR, DOX, IDR, ACR and MIT, although in some individual cases in vitro anthracycline cross-resistance was less pronounced. We conclude that IDR, ACR and MIT cannot circumvent in vitro resistance to DNR in childhood ALL.

MH35 has 85% sequence identity with human LIF and similar activity in biological assays. The 1H chemical shifts of the 12 conserved aromatic residues and the pKa values of the five conserved histidine residues in MH35 and human LIF are very similar. Temperature dependence studies indicate that both proteins are stable, with significant conformational changes occurring only above 70 degrees C. These results show that these proteins have a similar overall structure and stability and that MH35 is therefore a suitable analogue of human LIF for structural studies in solution.","['NMR Laboratory, Biomolecular Research Institute, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The activation of membrane-bound PLD by PKC partially purified from rat brain was most effectively induced with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and Ca2+ (1 microM) which caused translocation of PKC to membranes. Ro31-8425, a potent inhibitor of PKC, suppressed the catalytic activity of PKC in a concentration-dependent manner, with complete inhibition at 5 microM. However, the PKC-mediated PLD activation was not affected by Ro31-8425. It was thus suggested that membrane-bound PLD of HL60 cells was activated by PKC translocation but probably via a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. Furthermore, addition by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)trisphosphate (GTP gamma S) potentiated the PKC-mediated PLD activation and this potentiating effect was abolished by Rho GTPase dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDI). The suppressed PLD activation by RhoGDI was completely restored by addition of recombinant RhoA. These results indicate that the PKC-mediated PLD activation can be synergistically potentiated by RhoA in HL60 membranes.","['Department of Biochemistry, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of LIF in inducing the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts to syncytiotrophoblasts was dose-dependent. The same effect was shown when hCG was added to the medium.

In this system, plasmids encoding a reporter gene, the enzyme gene, and the substrate gene were simultaneously transfected into COS-1 cells. The reporter plasmid contains chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene downstream of an enhancer/promoter sequence derived from the human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-I) long-terminal repeat (LTR). The substrate expression plasmid was a triple chimera; HCV nonstructural protein 2 (NS2) and the Tax1 protein of HTLV-I sandwiched the substrate polypeptide, which was inserted upstream of Tax1. This method assumes that since the HCV NS2 appears to be located in the lipid bilayer of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, the Tax1 of the chimeric substrate was trapped on the surface of the ER in the absence of HCV proteinase activity. After release from the chimera by HCV proteinase-dependent cleavage, Tax1 could transactivate the expression of the CAT gene through the enhancer sequence of HTLV-I LTR. This system should enable us to simply and safely screen the potential antiviral activity of proteinase inhibitors in vivo, although this system may be limited to proteinase inhibitors that are permeable to the plasma membrane.","['National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",,"['GENBANK/D28814', 'GENBANK/D28815', 'GENBANK/D28816']",,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we determined the in vivo patterns of Mcl-1 protein production in normal human tissues by immunohistochemical means, using specific polyclonal antisera, and made comparisons with Bcl-2. Like Bcl-2, Mcl-1 immunostaining was observed in epithelial cells in a variety of tissues, including prostate, breast, endometrium, epidermis, stomach, intestine, colon, and respiratory tract. However, often the expression of mcl-1 and bcl-2 in complex epithelia occurred in gradients with opposing directions, such that Bcl-2 immunostaining tended to be higher in the less differentiated cells lining the basement membrane, whereas Mcl-1 immunostaining was more intense in the differentiated cells located in the upper layers of these epithelia. The in vivo patterns of mcl-1 and bcl-2 expression were also strikingly different in several other tissues as well. Within the secondary follicles of lymph nodes and tonsils, for example, germinal center lymphocytes were Mcl-1 positive but mostly lacked Bcl-2; whereas mantle zone lymphocytes expressed bcl-2 but not mcl-1. Intense Mcl-1 immunoreactivity was also detected in several types of neuroendocrine cells, including the adrenal cortical cells that are Bcl-2 negative, sympathetic neurons that also contain Bcl-2, a subpopulation of cells in the pancreatic islets, Leydig cells of the testis, and granulosa lutein cells of the ovarian corpus luteum but not in thyroid epithelium, which is strongly Bcl-2 positive. Little or no Mcl-1 was detected in neurons in the brain and spinal cord, in contrast to Bcl-2, which is present in several types of central nervous system neurons. Conversely, strong Mcl-1 immunostaining was found in cardiac and skeletal muscle, which contain comparatively less Bcl-2. Additional types of cells that are Bcl-2-negative but that expressed mcl-1 include chondrocytes and hepatocytes. These findings demonstrate that mcl-1 expression is widespread in vivo and imply that the Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins fulfill different roles in the overall physiology of cell death regulation.","['La Jolla Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Research Center, CA 92037, USA.']",['CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC1870904,,,,,,,,

The conditions in which it is seen include sickle cell disease, acute leukemia, metastatic neoplasia, and bacterial infection, particularly when hypovolemia and septic shock are present. BMN is also associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) following irradiation and antineoplastic therapy. The antiphospolipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by antibodies directed against the antiphospolipid substrate. Because this substrate is prominently involved in the coagulation cascade and widely distributed on cell walls, patients present with venous or arterial thromboses, recurrent abortion, thrombocytopenia, and Coombs' positive hemolytic anemia, typically with raised anticardiolipin antibodies or a diagnostic lupus anticoagulant test. BMN does not appear to have been previously recognized in this context.

The sequences of the open reading frames as well as the intron/exon junctions of the ovine and bovine p53 genes were determined. Pathological samples were screened for the presence of p53 mutations using a single-strand conformational polymorphism assay. Five of ten BLV-induced bovine tumors harbored p53 mutations. In contrast, only one of seven samples corresponding to circulating leukocytes from cattle in persistent lymphocytosis showed an alteration of the p53 gene. Surprisingly, no p53 mutation was found among the 10 BLV-induced sheep tumors analyzed. Altogether, these data indicate that p53 mutations are linked to BLV-induced leukemogenesis in cattle at the transition to the lymphomic stage.

Indeed, phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the low-affinity LIF receptor alpha-subunit (LIFR) in Mono Q-fractionated, LIF-stimulated 3T3-L1 extracts occurred only in those fractions containing activated MAPK; Ser-1044 served as the major phosphorylation site in the human LIFR for MAPK both in agonist-stimulated 3T3-L1 lysates and by recombinant extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 in vitro.

The pathophysiology of this reaction is unknown. It has been suggested that the anti-inflammatory effect of methotrexate in patients with arthritis is due to adenosine release brought on by inhibition of purine synthesis. Since adenosine is a central nervous system depressant, we wondered whether adenosine release in the central nervous system could account for some of the neurotoxicity due to methotrexate, and whether that toxicity could be lessened by displacement of adenosine from its receptor by aminophylline. 6 patients (age 3-16 years) who had methotrexate-induced neurotoxicity unresponsive to standard treatment received 2.5 mg/kg aminophylline. In addition, the concentration of adenosine in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 11 children completing a 24-h systemic methotrexate protocol was compared with that in 8 newly diagnosed patients and 12 who had not received any treatment for at least a week. 4 of 6 patients with toxic signs and symptoms attributed to methotrexate and unrelieved by steroids, epidural blood patch, promethazine, 5-hydroytryptamine antagonists, paracetamol, and narcotics, had complete resolution of neurotoxicity after or during a 1-h infusion of aminophylline; 2 others had a pronounced improvement but persistent nausea.

However, it is unknown whether greater constitutive expression of the tPA gene might increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) secretion, which could negate expected increases in fibrinolytic activity that accompany greater tPA protein production. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether transduction of human endothelial cells (EC) and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) with a retroviral vector containing the human tPA gene would increase tPA production and what effect this would have on endogenous PAI-1 secretion and subsequent fibrinolytic activity. METHODS: Cultivated human EC and SMC either were transduced with a murine leukemia retroviral vector (MFG) containing the human tPA gene and, in the case of controls, the lacZ gene, or they were exposed to media alone. On days 14 and 28 after transduction, supernatent tPA antigen and PAI-1 antigen levels were measured by ELISA, and supernatent tPA activity was quantitated with a spectrolyse tPA/PAI assay. RESULTS: Southern and Northern blot analyses documented integration and transcription of the tPA gene in both EC and SMC. Greater tPA antigen production occurred in MFG-tPA-transduced EC and SMC compared with nontransduced or MFG-lac Z-transduced cells (p < 0.05). The tPA activity increased in transduced human saphenous vein EC (up to 5.1-fold) and human iliac artery EC (up to 4.7-fold), but no increased tPA activity occurred in transduced SMC, compared with nontransduced or MFG-lac Z-transduced cells (p < 0.05). PAI-1 antigen was unchanged in transduced SMC but decreased in MFG-tPA-transduced EC (p < 0.05). PAI-1 mRNA was unchanged in the transduced EC and SMC compared with nontransduced cells, suggesting that posttranslational events may have caused the changes in EC PAI-1. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation demonstrated that MFG-mediated tPA gene transfer into human EC resulted in a significant increase in tPA activity. Enhancement of adult human EC fibrinolytic activity by transfer of the human tPA gene has not been previously reported and represents a necessary finding in the development of this gene therapy technology for the prevention of thrombotic complications of vascular disease.","['Jobst Research Laboratories, Department of Surgery, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nystatin perforated-patch method was used to record macroscopic currents from anti-trinitrophenyl (TNP) immunoglobulin E (IgE)-sensitized rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells at 37 degrees C. 2. An inwardly rectifying Ca2+ current (ICa) was activated upon stimulation with the multivalent antigen trinitrophenylated bovine serum albumin (TNP-BSA). Induction of ICa was not observed at room temperature. ICa was reversed and reinduced upon cyclical addition of the monovalent hapten dinitrophenyl (DNP)-lysine and multivalent antigen, indicating that a specific interaction of antigen with IgE was required to elicit ICa. 3. The antigen-induced current was also carried by Ba2+ or Sr2+, and to a lesser extent by Na+, in the nominal absence of Ca2+. ICa did not exhibit time-dependent opening (< or = 1 ms) in response to hyperpolarizing voltage steps to -100 mV, although it did accumulate steady-state inactivation of approximately 40-50% over 100 ms. 4. Two inorganic blockers of antigen-stimulated 45Ca2+ influx and secretion, La3+ and Zn2+, inhibited ICa by approximately 50% at concentrations known to produce 50% block of 45Ca2+ influx. In contrast, cromolyn sodium (0.5 mM) and the L-type Ca2+ channel antagonist nitrendipine (5 microM) had no effect on ICa. 5. ICa also was induced by the intracellular Ca2+ mobilizer thapsigargin. Because the actions of thapsigargin and antigen were not additive, IgE receptor cross-linkage appears to activate the recently described capacitative Ca2+ entry channels.","['Department of Zoology and Genetics, Iowa State University, Ames 50011-3223, USA.']",['GM48144/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC1157871,,,,,,,,

In a series of replicate studies spanning approximately 1 year, males were exposed to single, acute X-ray doses of 0, 250 and 500 cGy. In each of the 2 consecutive weeks immediately thereafter they were placed with two females to generate progeny that were derived from irradiated post-meiotic cells (spermatozoa to late spermatids). These animals were then examined at 8 or 12 months for lung tumours. While the proportion of fertile females and mean litter size was affected by the radiation, showing a dose-dependent, dominant lethal response, and while cases of mutant offspring were detected, the paternal radiation did not affect lung tumour incidence in the offspring. The incidence did not vary significantly between germ cell stages irradiated (week of mating), sex of offspring, or radiation dose. However, significant differences between lung tumour incidence (mostly representing benign adenomas) were found between different replicates, these being high at the start of the study, declining and then rising to yet higher levels at its close. The finding that lung tumour incidence in BALB/cJ mice is not affected by paternal germ cell irradiation does not accord with Nomura's reports using other strains of mice. This, in turn, weakens biological support for a causal association between the raised incidence of childhood leukaemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma near Sellafield and the father's recorded radiation exposure during employment by the nuclear industry.","['MRC Radiobiology Unit, Chilton, Didcot, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The independently developing preimplantation blastocyst then becomes dependent on the maternal environment for its continued development. Although the factors involved in the regulation of blastocyst implantation are incompletely understood, recent studies strongly suggest a critical role for leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in mice. We showed previously that LIF acts on human trophoblasts to shift their differentiation toward the anchoring phenotype by increasing the synthesis of fibronectin. In the present study, we first evaluated the temporal expression of LIF in the human endometrium in order to gain further insights into the role of LIF in human implantation. We established the LIF is expressed in the endometrium in a menstrual cycle-dependent manner. The most abundant LIF messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels are observed in the mid- and late-luteal phase samples. LIF mRNA was also present in decidual tissues of first trimester of pregnancy, but levels were lower than those found in the midluteal endometrium. We then investigated the regulation of LIF expression in human endometrial cells in culture by cytokines, steroid hormones, and growth factors. We could not show any direct stimulatory evidence of steroid hormones (estradiol and progestins) on LIF mRNA expression or protein production by endometrial cells in culture. On the other hand, we showed that interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta are potent inducers of LIF expression in endometrial stromal cells in culture in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Interferon-gamma acted to inhibit LIF expression induced by these cytokines. In contrast, we found high constitutive and relatively less regulated levels of LIF mRNA in the endometrial gland cells. The timing of the expression of LIF in the endometrium suggests a potential role in the implantation. The regulation of the expression of LIF may have an important role in the physiological and pathological processes involving human implantation.","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions the synthesis of glycoproteins was reduced to 17% of control values, while no significant changes in the rates of total protein synthesis could be observed. Tunicamycin ability to induce DNA fragmentation was in good correlation with its potency as glycosylation inhibitor in several myeloid cell lines. Tunicamycin-induced apoptosis was potentiated by activation of protein kinease C (PKC) by phorbol esters and partially prevented by the PKC inhibitor staurosporine. Inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis displayed a protective effect. Treatment of HL-60 cells with tunicamycin did not elicit the expression of cell surface differentiation antigens or their ability to generate superoxide anion. In contrast, tunicamycin significantly inhibited these processes during dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced myeloid differentiation.

The resistant cells were also unable to differentiate in response to NaB, indicating that a regulatory function controlling both G0 growth arrest and differentiation had been affected. The induced resistance was not genetic in origin since the cells regained the ability to G0 arrest and differentiate after being recultured in medium free of sodium butyrate for only three days. The resistant cells had similar cell cycle phase durations as the original wild type cells. The resistant cells retained the ability to both G0 arrest and differentiate in response to 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 (VD3), normally an inducer of G0 arrest and monocytic differentiation in wild type cells. However, they were cross-resistant to retinoic acid (RA), another ligand for the same steroid thyroid hormone receptor family, which induces G0 arrest and myeloid differentiation in wild type cells. The ability to G0 arrest and phenotypically differentiate in response to RA were both grossly impaired. Unlike wild type cells which undergo early down-regulation and then hypophosphorylation of the RB protein when induced to differentiate, in resistant cells, hypophosphorylation of RB in response to NaB was grossly retarded. These changes in RB protein occurred faster when the cells were treated with VD3. In contrast, the changes in RB phosphorylation occurred significantly slower when the cells were treated with RA. The results suggest a coupling between the ability to G0 growth arrest and phenotypically convert and the ability to hypophosphorylate RB.","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anemia and neutropenia are commonly seen in copper (Cu) deficiency. We therefore developed a serum-free medium to examine the trace mineral requirements, in particular iron and Cu, for proliferation and retinoic acid (RA)-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells. This defined medium (DFM) was composed of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) supplemented with insulin and human apo-transferrin (each at 5 micrograms/ml) and 1.4 microM FeSO4. The iron concentration range for optimal cellular proliferation was narrow (2-3 microM). HL-60 cells could be maintained in DFM for 15 passages with a doubling time of 38-40 hr. The Cu content of IMDM was very low. Thus, by the fourth passage in DFM, the activity of cuproenzymes (cytochrome c oxidase, CCO; and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, CuZnSOD) began to decline. Supplementation of DFM with CuSO4 (50 nM) restored enzyme activities. Treatment of cells with a Cu chelator (tetrathiomolybdate, 1 microM) rapidly reduced the activities of both CCO and CuZnSOD. Over the Cu concentration range examined (5-350 nM), Cu supplementation had little effect on HL-60 proliferation. Cell retained the ability to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway when treated with RA, but seemed to be less sensitive to the inducing agent except at the highest concentration tested (1 microM). This decreased sensitivity to RA did not seem to be related to the Cu status of the cells but rather to the absence of a component of serum. Indeed, cells grown in DFM regained their sensitivity to RA when allowed to differentiate in IMDM with 5% serum. These data indicate that the processes of growth and terminal differentiation in HL-60 cells are not greatly influenced by Cu. Thus, it seems likely that the insult resulting in neutropenia which is associated with Cu deficiency may occur earlier than the promyelocytic stage. However, the possibility that the mechanisms contributing to neutropenia may be unrelated to primary defects in the biochemistry of neutrophil maturation cannot be ruled out.","['United States Department of Agriculture, Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center, North Dakota 58202, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In epithelia, the bcl-2 gene is also related to development and differentiation, and the protein is strongly expressed in the embryo in the epithelial cells of the developing mammary gland. To investigate directly the effect of bcl-2 on human epithelial cells, we used an amphotropic recombinant retrovirus to introduce the gene into nontumorigenic cell lines developed from luminal epithelial cells cultured from milk. Here we demonstrate that while bcl-2 overexpression does not directly induce the tumorigenic phenotype, it provides a survival advantage to the mammary epithelial cells by inhibiting cell death at confluence or under conditions of serum starvation, bcl-2 can also affect the phenotype of the original epithelial cells, and promote epithelial-mesenchymal conversion, accompanied by loss of the cell adhesion molecules E-cadherin and alpha 2 beta 1 integrin. The extent of the epithelial-mesenchymal conversion varies with small differences in the phenotype of the parental line and with the level of expression of Bcl-2 and in some cases cell lines emerge with a mixed phenotype. The increased survival of Bcl-2-expressing cells at confluence results in multilayering, and the development of three- dimensional structures. Where a mixed phenotype is observed these structures consist of an outer layer of polarized epithelial cells separated by a basement membrane-like layer from an inner mass of fibroblastoid cells. Branching morphogenesis of bcl-2 transfectants is also observed in collagen gels (in the absence of fibroblast growth factors). The results strongly indicate that by increasing their survival under restrictive growth conditions, and by modifying the epithelial phenotype, bcl-2 can influence the specific morphogenetic behavior of mammary epithelial cells.","['Department of Epithelial Cell Biology, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom.']",,,,,PMC2120474,,['J Cell Biol 1995 Nov;131(4):following 1121'],,,,,,

In cultured monolayer cells ToxA exhibits cytotoxic activity to induce disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, which is accompanied by morphological changes. ToxA-induced depolymerization of actin filaments is correlated with a decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of the low molecular mass GTP-binding Rho proteins (Just, I., Selzer, J., von Eichel-Streiber, C., and Aktories, K. (1995) J. Clin. Invest. 95, 1026-1031). Here we report on the identification of the ToxA-induced modification of Rho. Applying electrospray mass spectrometry, the mass of the modification was determined as 162 Da, which is consistent with the incorporation of a hexose into Rho. From several hexoses tested UDP-glucose selectively served as cosubstrate for ToxA-catalyzed modification. The acceptor amino acid of glucosylation was identified from a Lys-C-generated peptide by tandem mass spectrometry as Thr-37. Mutation of Thr-37 to Ala completely abolished glucosylation. The members of the Rho family (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42Hs) were substrates for ToxA, whereas H-Ras, Rab5, and Arf1 were not glucosylated. ToxA-catalyzed glucosylation of lysates from ToxA-pretreated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells resulted in a decreased incorporation of [14C]glucose, indicating previous glucosylation in the intact cell. Glucosylation of the Rho subtype proteins appears to be the molecular mechanism by which C. difficile ToxA mediates its cytotoxic effects on cells.","['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Universitat des Saarlandes, Federal Republic of Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long terminal repeat (LTR) of Mo-MuLV affects the regulation of a number of cellular genes, including collagenase IV, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and c-jun genes, all of which contain 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element consensus sites within their promoters. We report here that Mo-MuLV stimulates the collagenase IV gene through transcription factor AP-1, and that the expression of a subgenomic portion of Mo-MuLV LTR alone is sufficient for this effect. Transient or stable expression of the viral LTR increases cellular AP-1 DNA binding activity. The collagenase IV 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-responsive element consensus sequence was shown to be required for this trans-activation. Deletions or mutations of this consensus site which abolished AP-1 binding also abolished trans-activation by the LTR. Transient or stable transfection of the viral LTR into cells stimulated c-jun gene expression, suggesting one mechanism whereby the viral LTR may induce cellular AP-1 activity. Thus, the Mo-MuLV LTR, through activation of the transcription factor AP-1, is capable of regulating cellular gene expression, including the induction of proto-oncogenes. This activity may be relevant to the mechanisms whereby retroviruses which do not contain oncogenes induce neoplasia.","['Cancer Research Center, Boston University School of Medicine, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']","['R01-CA50459/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA65420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the two phenomena could be dissociated when HL-60 cells were treated with PDBu. When HL-60 cells were cultured with PDBu for more than 36 h, apoptosis was induced following differentiation. Apoptosis was not, however, observed when PDBu was removed within 24 h, even though induction of differentiation-related phenotypes, such as NBT-reducing ability and surface marker expression, was the same as that in the control. Northern blot analysis revealed that bcl-2 mRNA was rapidly down-regulated within 6 h of the treatment with PDBu. The amount of bcl-2 mRNA recovered to that of undifferentiated HL-60 cells when PDBu was washed out within 24 h. In contrast, the recovery of bcl-2 was incomplete when the cells were treated with PDBu for more than 36 h, suggesting that bcl-2 is also a critical regulator of the cell fate during myeloid differentiation. This hypothesis was confirmed by experiments using antisense oligonucleotides, i.e., blocking the recovery of bcl-2 mRNA by antisense oligonucleotides could result in the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells from which PDBu was removed within 24 h. Moreover, overexpression of BCL-2 in HL-60 cells could block apoptosis during differentiation without any significant effect on differentiation itself. These results strongly suggest that apoptosis is not a simple consequence of differentiation-induction, and that apoptosis and differentiation are regulated independently in myeloid cells.","['Division of Hemopoiesis, Institute of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 16895-16898]. The terminal cell differentiation attendant upon the cell growth arrest was, but the early induction of CD38 NADase activity was not, inhibited by prior treatment of HL-60 cells with pertussis toxin, which catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of the membrane-bound alpha beta gamma-trimeric GTP-binding proteins. The prior treatment was, however, not essential for the toxin-induced inhibition of the cell differentiation; the inhibition by the addition of pertussis toxin was still observed even after retinoic acid-induced expression of CD38 antigen. This suggested that a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism was involved in a late process of cell differentiation. Indeed, HL-60 cells appeared to secrete a differentiation-supporting factor in response to retinoic acid, since the cell differentiation was accelerated and potentiated upon culture of the cells in a conditioned medium prepared from retinoic acid-treated cells. The action of the differentiation-supporting factor was destroyed by heating and markedly attenuated in pertussis toxin-pretreated HL-60 cells. Thus, the whole process of the retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation appeared to consist of two distinguishable periods in terms of sensitivity to pertussis toxin; the toxin-insensitive early period characterized by the induction of CD38 NADase activity and the toxin-sensitive late period in which the secretion of a differentiation-supporting factor might be involved.","['Department of Life Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the CNTF receptor complex also includes a CNTF-specific component known as CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR alpha). Here we describe the molecular cloning of the human and mouse genes encoding CNTFR. We report that the human and mouse genes have an identical intron-exon structure that correlates well with the domain structure of CNTFR alpha. That is, the signal peptide and the immunoglobulin-like domain are each encoded by single exons, the cytokine receptor-like domain is distributed among 4 exons, and the C-terminal glycosyl phosphatidylinositol recognition domain is encoded by the final coding exon. The position of the introns within the cytokine receptor-like domain corresponds to those found in other members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. Confirming a recent study using radiation hybrids, we have also mapped the human CNTFR gene to chromosome band 9p13 and the mouse gene to a syntenic region of chromosome 4.","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Incorporated, Tarrytown, New York 10591, USA.']","['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['GENBANK/L38020', 'GENBANK/L38021', 'GENBANK/L38022', 'GENBANK/L38023', 'GENBANK/L38024', 'GENBANK/L38025']",,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the possible involvement of E2F in hematopoietic malignancies, we isolated genomic clones encompassing the human E2F1 gene. We then used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize E2F1 to human chromosome 20q11, telomeric to the p107 locus, a gene whose product is related to the retinoblastoma gene product (pRb). This finding contrasts with the 1p36 and 6q22 chromosomal locations previously assigned E2F2 and E2F3, two additional members of the E2F family. Although deletions or structural rearrangements of E2F1 were not detected in 14 primary acute leukemia or myelodysplasia samples with structural abnormalities of chromosome 20q11, the gene was amplified and overexpressed in HEL erythroleukemia cells and translocated to other chromosomes in several established human leukemia cell lines. This study provides the first evidence of gene amplification involving a member of the E2F family of transcription factors. We propose that E2F1 overexpression in erythroid progenitors may stimulate abnormal cell proliferation by overriding negative regulatory signals mediated by tumor suppressor proteins such as pRb.","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]","['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42804/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunosuppression appears to be a critical factor or a predictive sign for the development of ATL in carriers of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). This study was aimed at assessing the immune status of asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers with the immunity specific to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a ubiquitous human herpesvirus with oncogenic potential. Forty-three asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers were examined for their EBV serology and EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell (EBV-CTL) activity, in comparison with 10 HTLV-I-non-infected normal controls. Both carriers and controls were all positive for EBV capsid antigen (VCA) IgG. Significantly elevated titer of VCAIgG and lower titer of EBV-determined nuclear antigen (EBNA) antibodies were observed in asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers, suggesting reactivation of EBV. Among the HTLV-I carriers, 9 (20.9%) had reduced activity of EBV-CTL as revealed by lower incidence of regression of in vitro EBV-induced B-cell transformation. Accordingly, asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers were divided into three groups: the carriers with reduced EBV-specific cellular immunity (group I), the carriers showing normal cellular immunity but aberrant EBV-specific antibody titers (group II), and the carriers with normal EBV-specific cellular immunity and serology (group III). Higher positive rate of anti-HTLV-I Tax antibody was found in the former two groups (44.4% and 56.5%, respectively) compared with group III (18.2%). An immunosuppressive agent, 4-deoxyphorbol ester induced a remarkable decrease of EBV-CTL activity in the carriers of group II and III at the concentration that affected none of the normal controls. These findings indicate that asymptomatic HTLV-I carriers suffer stepwise impairment of EBV-specific immunities, which may be caused by HTLV-I infection.","['Department of Research, Hokkaido Red Cross Blood Center, Sapporo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to obtain the definite effect, the quantities of chemotherapeutic agents should be increased and the major lethal side effect caused by bone marrow failure should be avoided. For this purpose, hematopoietic stem cells derived from either bone marrow or peripheral blood can be used for the rapid recovery of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. We prepared stem cells both from bone marrow and peripheral blood by anti-CD34 monoclonal antibody bound on magnetic beads column and administered into severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse. Four and 20 weeks after transplantation, mononuclear cells bearing human hematopoietic antigens and human immunoglobulin G were appeared in the circulation, suggesting that stem cells from peripheral blood also possess long-standing capability of maturation as well as those from bone marrow. We next conducted clinical study of high dose chemotherapy combined with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for patients with poor risk choriocarcioma. By this treatment, 4 complete response (CR) and 4 partial response (PR) were obtained, whereas 2 progressive disease (PD), 1 no change (NC) and 5 PR were obtained by the previous conventional chemotherapies.

However, the TAL-1 protein functional properties involved in this process have not been assessed so far. We have derived a clonal subline of the Jurkat T cell line which produced solely a mutant truncated form of TAL-1 protein. Sequencing of genomic DNA and cDNAs showed that the only transcribed tal-1 allele of this mutant subline harbored a G nucleotide insertion at codon 270. The resulting frameshift modifies TAL-1 residues 272-278 and creates a stop at codon 279. Although the deletion of the 53 carboxy-terminal residues of the TAL-1 protein did not directly affect the TAL-1 basic helix-loop-helix domain (residues 185-243), it had drastic effects on TAL-1 functional properties, since the mutant subline exhibited a dramatic decrease of protein binding activity to the TAL-1 DNA consensus sequence. Growth curves indicated that the mutant subline exhibited premature apoptosis upon medium depletion or serum reduction when compared with the parental cells. However, no difference between Jurkat and the mutant subline was observed in etoposide- or Fas/APO-1-triggered apoptosis. Stable expression of the mutant TAL-1 protein in Jurkat cells resulted in a phenotype that was similar to that of the mutant Jurkat subline, indicating that the TAL-1 mutant protein behaved like a dominant negative mutant and that the premature apoptosis of the mutant subline upon medium depletion was the consequence of the loss of TAL-1 protein activity.","['INSERM U.91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",,,,,PMC398343,,,,,,,,

In previous studies we showed that the d mutation carried by many inbred strains of mice (now referred to as dilute viral, dv), is caused by the integration of an ecotropic murine leukemia virus (Emv-3) into the dilute gene and that phenotypic revertants of dv (termed d+) result from viral excision; a solo viral long terminal repeat (LTR) is all that remains in revertant DNA. In the studies described here we show that Emv-3 sequences are located within an intron of the dilute gene in a region of the C-terminal tail that is differentially spliced. We also show that these Emv-3 sequences result in the production of shortened and abnormally spliced dilute transcripts and that the level of this effect varies among tissues. This tissue-specific effect on dilute expression likely accounts for the absence of neurological abnormalities observed in dv mice. Surprisingly, we also found that the solo viral LTR present in revertant d+ DNA produces a tissue-specific effect on dilute expression, although this effect is less dramatic than with the full-length provirus and produces no obvious mutant phenotype. These findings have important implications for understanding the effects of viral sequences on mammalian gene expression.","['Institute for Arthritis and Autoimmunity, West Haven, CT 06516, USA.']",['R01 NS30848/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC398341,,,,,,,,

It is generally recognised that routine administration of vitamin K (phytomenadione) shortly after birth will prevent major neonatal morbidity and mortality related to haemorrhage. Vitamin K supplementation during pregnancy is also recommended if mothers are on anticonvulsant therapy or prolonged treatment with certain antibiotics. These medications, if ingested by pregnant women, predispose the neonate to a bleeding tendency caused by vitamin K deficiency. Vitamin K treatment of pregnant mothers before premature delivery has also been suggested to reduce the incidence of severe intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) in premature neonates.

In this study, we established a ""nested"" retrotranscriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) technique which allows detection of the SIL-TAL-1 transcriptional expression.

One patient developed clinical relapse 3 months after PCR positivity. Moreover, analysis of the Tald rearrangement by DNA-based PCR in four patients with SIL-TAL-1 fusion revealed the type A (Tald1) rearrangement in all cases.

It also is being tested as adjuvant therapy for patients with acute myeloid leukemia after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: The authors tested IL-2 in a pediatric Phase II trial using a regimen that has antitumor effects in adults and was proven to be tolerated acceptably in a prior Phase I pediatric trial. Thirty-eight patients were entered into this study of whom 36 received IL-2 and were evaluable (20 with sarcoma, 9 with neuroblastoma, 5 with renal cell carcinoma, and 1 each with melanoma and lymphoma). RESULTS: Interleukin-2 dose modifications were based on tolerance and toxicity, such that 46% of these patients received a 50% increase in IL-2 dose during the second week, and 81% of those receiving the elevated dose continued receiving this dose level during the third week of treatment. A single patient with renal cell carcinoma had a complete response that was maintained; the remaining 35 patients did not show objective evidence of tumor response sufficient to qualify as either a complete response or a partial response. CONCLUSIONS: Absolute lymphocyte counts were indicative of the immunostimulatory effect of this IL-2 regimen as observed for adults, with a median 7.2-fold increase. Nevertheless, despite immune activation, a sufficient number of patients were evaluated, indicating that IL-2 does not have measurable antitumor effects in children with large refractory sarcomas or neuroblastomas, whereas one of five children with renal cell carcinoma had a complete response, consistent with the 10-20% response rate observed in adults.","['Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, USA.']","['CA13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01-CA57746/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Staging systems define high risk groups, such as patients with Rai's Stage III and IV and Binet's stage C disease, as having a poor overall median survival. Most combination therapy programs have resulted in similar results. Chlorambucil remains the most commonly used drug, and new drugs, such as fludarabine, are promising. METHODS: Fifty-three patients with poor prognosis CLL (Stage III and IV) underwent chlorambucil treatment at a high intermittent dose. When Stage 0 was obtained, patients were considered responders and kept under surveillance. When the patients stopped responding after one or several courses of chlorambucil, further therapy was performed, including splenectomy (29 patients) and total lymph node irradiation (9 of the 29 splenectomized patients). RESULTS: The overall median survival was 60 months. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were resolved in 55% and 82% of the patients, respectively, after chlorambucil therapy and in 85% and 100%, respectively, after splenectomy. Complications occurred in 34% of the splenectomized population. Total lymph node irradiation was poorly tolerated in 66% of the patients. When this analysis was performed, 24 patients were classified as having Stage 0 disease with no disease progression for a mean of 21 months. CONCLUSIONS: Therapy programs allowing the selection of responders by the successive use of high intermittent dose chlorambucil and splenectomy may be beneficial in treating patients with advanced stage CLL. Because of its toxicity, total lymph node irradiation has no significant therapeutic effect.","['Division of Haematology of the University Hospital, Albert Michallon, Grenoble, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was initiated by 100 microM 3-deazaadenosine (c3Ado), 25 microM c3Ado plus 1 mM homocysteine thiolactone (Hcy) and 100 microM c3Ado plus 5 micrograms/ml cytochalasin B (CB). Two different phenotypes of apoptotic cells (APC), blebbed and non-blebbed, were present in the cultures. Blebbed APC dominated in cultures exposed to c3Ado, whereas most APC in cultures treated with c3Ado plus Hcy and all the APC in cultures treated with c3Ado plus CB displayed a non-blebbed phenotype. A more pronounced reduction of the chromatin/cytoplasm ratio, lower volume fractions of uncondensed chromatin and higher volume fractions of highly condensed chromatin (micronuclei) were found in cultures exposed to c3Ado and c3Ado plus Hcy when compared with cultures exposed to c3Ado plus CB. A partial inhibition of c3Ado apoptosis by CB was confirmed by measurements of intact DNA. The inhibitory effect of CB was not reproducible by CE, indicating that CB exerts its effect by an actin independent mechanism. Both blebbed and non-blebbed APC displayed nuclear fragmentation, segregation of organelles and cytoplasmic vesiculation, suggesting that the differences between the phenotypes were restricted to the cytoplasmic membrane. We were not able to demonstrate the presence of F-actin by fluorescein isothiocyanate-phalloidin staining in blebbed APC nor in non-blebbed APC in cultures treated with c3Ado plus Hcy. Non-blebbed APC in cultures treated with c3Ado plus CB displayed foci of F-actin at the internal part of the cytoplasmic membrane. This suggests that F-actin is preserved by the mechanism by which CB inhibits blebbing, and may indicate that blebbing of the cytoplasmic membrane during apoptosis is associated with F-actin deficiency rather than a result of actin-myosin interactions.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Tromso, Norway.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Case-control analysis was performed comparing 25 allogeneic transplant patients (cases) with 97 patients treated with maintenance chemotherapy (controls), who were matched for site of relapse, duration of CR1 and leukemia-free interval from onset of CR2. Until the first relapse, the children were treated according to standard protocols. The majority of patients suffered from a bone marrow relapse, mostly occurring more than 24 months after the onset of CR1. Remission reinduction treatment was heterogeneous. Patients treated with allogeneic BMT received high-dose chemotherapy and total body irradiation prior to BMT. Maintenance chemotherapy in controls was given for approximately 2 years. Following BMT, relapse rate was lower but the treatment-related mortality was higher compared with maintenance chemotherapy, resulting in leukemia-free survival rates at 4 years of 44% and 24%, respectively (not significant, NS). Case-control analysis of leukemia-free survival showed a hazard ratio of 0.756 in favor of BMT compared with chemotherapy (NS). If bone marrow relapses and central nervous system relapses were analyzed separately, a tendency to better leukemia-free survival was present after BMT compared with maintenance chemotherapy for patients with a relapse in the central nervous system, but for an isolated bone marrow relapse, no differences in leukemia-free survival were seen between the two groups of patients.","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has been concluded from clinical BMT data and demonstrated by in vitro experiments. We analyzed the frequency and specificity of leukemia-reactive T cells from syngeneic and allogeneic blood donors by limiting dilution assays for interleukin-2-producing (TH1) and cytotoxic (CTLp) T cells. Target cells were leukemia blasts obtained from a patient with common ALL. Control targets were generated by EBV transformation. Effector cells were generated from the peripheral blood of the patient in remission, from his syngeneic brother and from eight healthy, HLA-mismatched volunteers. The effector cells were stimulated with leukemia cells and interleukin-2. Neither the patient nor his brother were able to generate anti-leukemic CTLp or TH1. The HLA-mismatched allogeneic donors displayed anti-leukemic CTLp frequencies with a range from 0 to 68 million. TH1 cells with anti-leukemic specificity were not detectable. We conclude that there are great inter-individual differences in the GVL potential of fully allogeneic peripheral T lymphocytes. It is possible to identify T cell lines with reactivity against leukemia blasts and non-reactivity against normal hematological cells from the same individual. These cell lines are potential effector cells for immunotherapy of human leukemia.","['Institute of Immunology, University of Kiel, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In haematological malignancies most emphasis has been placed upon the recurring translocations in which the juxtaposition of two gene sequences has resulted in the activation of an oncogene. Chromosomal loss rather than translocation is the most frequent karyotypic abnormality in the myelodysplastic syndromes, a heterogeneous group of clonal malignant blood disorders characterised by dyshaematopoiesis and/or impaired maturation of haemopoietic cells with frequent evolution to acute leukaemia. Recent attention has focused on the loss of genetic material as a result of chromosomal monosomy or deletion in the myelodysplastic syndromes. The most frequently reported deletions in these myeloid syndromes are of chromosomes 5, 20 and 7. Deletions of chromosomes 11, 12, and 13, although more rarely observed, are also characteristics of the myelodysplastic syndromes. It is probable that the deleted chromosomal bands give the location for as yet unidentified myeloid specific tumour suppressor loci and there is considerable interest in the cloning of these genes. This review discusses the three most frequently observed deletions in MDS; 7q deletion, 5q deletion and 20q deletion taking into account recent evidence on the respective critical regions of gene loss and the role of candidate genes.","['Department of Haematology, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK.']",,,,81,,,,,,,,,

Minisatellites and simple repeat probes for RFLP analysis have proved to be highly informative genetic markers, depending on their degree of homology and index of heterozygosity. Several of these probes have considerable individualization potential, thus yielding 'fingerprint' pattern. In the setting of acute leukemia DNA fingerprint (DNA-F) analysis is able to provide considerable information concerning the genetic instability of the leukemic clone. DNA-F is capable of detecting randomly occurring genetic alterations of unknown localization and to identify new hotspots of malignant transformation. As DNA-F analysis is not likely to be hampered by the effects of chemotherapy or DNA methylation, altered fingerprints may be regarded as characteristic of the leukemic clone. With the introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and increasing sensitivity, DNA-F analysis is likely to be of significant importance in monitoring minimal residual disease in human leukemia.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Germany.']",,,,93,,,,,,,,,

This gene was discovered through the study of a murine retrovirus which induces an acute myeloproliferative syndrome in mice. MPLV (for myeloproliferative leukemia virus) has transduced a truncated and constitutively activated form of the c-mpl receptor chain. The c-mpl ligand is unknown, but recent data indicate that it could specifically regulate thrombocytopoiesis. This review focuses on the expression of the c-mpl gene in a large series of human hematopoietic pathologies by Northern blot analysis. Barely detectable transcript levels were detected in normal bone marrow (BM) and in BM samples from chronic myeloproliferative disorders, plasmocytoma, Burkitt lymphoma or acute lymphoid leukemia. In contrast, high levels of c-mpl expression were detected in 45% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). No correlation was found between c-mpl expression and the French-American-British classification subtype of AML. However c-mpl expression correlated with CD34 expression, and unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities, defining a subgroup of AML with a low rate of complete remission. In myelodysplasia, c-mpl expression was elevated in 44% of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), 42% of refractory anemia with excess myeloblasts (RAEB), and RAEB in transformation to acute leukemia (RAEBt), but not in refractory anemia (RA) and RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS). In CMML, there was no correlation between c-mpl expression and any prognostic factor tested, nor with the course of the disease.

The production of G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF and IL-10 did not differ significantly between controls and B-CLL patients. However, the ability of stromal cells to release IL-6 in response to LPS was decreased in all patients: 36 +/- 5 ng/ml versus 123 +/- 47 ng/ml for normal controls (p < 0.004). Moreover, a soluble activity that inhibited hematopoietic colony formation was detected in B-CLL stromal cell conditioned media. Some potential inhibitors were envisaged and the results indicated an increased production of TGF-beta by B-CLL stromal cells compared to normal stromal cells (respectively 53 +/- 10 versus 15 +/- 4 ng/ml, p < 0.03). The reduced capacity of B-CLL stromal cells to produce IL-6 was associated with this excessive release of TGF-beta; indeed, addition of anti-TGF-beta neutralizing antibody to B-CLL stromal cells, before LPS stimulation, totally normalized the production of IL-6. TGF-beta and IL-6 were also measured in serum samples from normal subjects and B-CLL patients. No significant difference was seen in the production of total TGF-beta (bioactive and latent forms) between normal and B-CLL sera but the mean level of bioactive protein in B-CLL sera was increased in comparison with normal sera (1.74 +/- 0.44 versus 0.67 +/- 0.2 ng/ml, p < 0.04).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","[""Service de Medecine Interne et Laboratoire d'Investigation Clinique Henri Tagnon, Institut J.

Reactivity, varied between the five antibodies, and positivity was obtained with 2F8 > JSB1 > MRK16 > Mab57 > C219. Sixteen of the 60 cases were also studied by flow cytometry. In 10 cases, the results with the two techniques corresponded, in the other 6 cases, flow cytometry proved more sensitive than APAAP in detecting small amounts of gp170. In the flow cytometry analysis, the cells fixed in methanol and paraformaldehyde were more fluorescent than unfixed samples or those fixed in paraformaldehyde or methanol alone. Our results thus reveal that positivity for gp 170 depends on various factors, including the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies, the techniques used and the preservation of the samples.

In chronic leukemia GSH and GST were increased, whereas Atase, GPx and frequency of Pgp-expression were low. Treatment with cytostatic drugs did not influence median levels of expression/activity of the resistance parameters. Resistance parameter expression/activity of leukemic cells was also compared with various other tissue and tumor types. Generally the pattern of resistance parameter expression reflected the resistance status of the tissue, constitutively resistant tumor types and their corresponding normal tissue on average having higher levels than leukemic cells and other tissue and tumor types with acquired resistance.

Infusion of AcSDKP protects these animals from death by blocking the proliferation of primitive haemopoietic cells. We measured AcSDKP serum concentrations in 20 AML patients during the course of high-dose cytoreductive treatment. We observed an early and sharp increase of AcSDKP during the induction treatment in 12 patients, reaching a peak during the initial 3 d of treatment in nine of them. These results are contrary to those observed in mice treated with high doses of Ara-C.

Cellular extracts were separated into two compartments by adsorption to haptocorrin antibodies. Plasma concentrations of all cobalamin forms were increased in CML. The proportion of methylcobalamin was significantly lower than in a reference population, and a low plasma proportion of methylcobalamin was associated with a poor prognosis. Buffy coat cells and splenic tissue had a higher proportion of 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin and a lower proportion of methylcobalamin than plasma; still, there was relatively more methylcobalamin than in normal tissue. The haptocorrin-bound compartment differed from the non-haptocorrin compartment in untreated or chronic phase patients by binding less methylcobalamin.

On account of the low incidence of GVHD observed following cord blood transplantation, it has been suggested that cord blood be used for HLA-matched, or perhaps one or two antigens mismatched, and unrelated stem cell transplantation. Based on an extensive immunophenotype-functional correlation, we determined that cord blood contains mainly immature unprimed T lymphocytes that are predominantly suppressor cells. Recent findings suggest that dysregulated production of cytokines (IL-1, IL-2, TNF alpha) plays a role in GVHD. We showed that T cells in cord blood express receptors for IL-2, TNF alpha, but no receptors for IL-1. Similarly, NK cells, one of the effector cells of GVHD, express receptors for TNF alpha and gamma IFN but do not express receptors for IL-1, nor IL-2R alpha-chain (CD25) although IL-2R beta-chain is expressed. The potential for activation of T lymphocytes and NK cells therefore exists in the context of bone marrow transplantation. However, the high number of suppressor cells in cord blood most likely modulate the activation of lymphocytes and NK cells thereby minimizing GVHD.","[""Department of Haematology, Women's and Children's Hospital, North Adelaide, South Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients experienced 30 episodes of fever which occurred during granulocytopenia (defined as granulocyte counts < 0.2 x 10(9)/l) and six fever episodes when granulocyte counts were > 1.0 x 10(9)/l. Febrile episodes were classified as microbiologically defined infection, clinically defined infection, and unexplained fever. Levels of bioactive IL-6 and immunoreactive TNF increased in response to fever during granulocytopenia, whereas bioactive TNF was not detected in any sample in this study. During granulocytopenia, both sTNFR rose significantly in microbiologically defined infection (P < 0.01 for sTNFR-p55 and P < 0.05 for sTNFR-p75), but not in the other two categories. The ratio of sTNFR-p55 to sTNFR-p75 was higher during febrile periods in granulocytopenia than in a non-granulocytopenic situation with granulocyte counts > 1.0 x 10(9)/l (P < 0.01). We conclude that granulocytopenia affects release of the two sTNFR differently during febrile periods, and that release of sTNFR-p75 in response to fever is reduced during granulocytopenia, suggesting a role for the granulocytes in systemic release of sTNFR-p75.","['Institute of Cancer Research, University Medical Centre, Trondheim, Norway.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report the spontaneous appearance of EBV-positive B cells in 6/40 HLTBMCs from patients with various haematological diseases after 3-5 months of culture. After subcultivation of these cells, a novel type of cell line could be characterized, which displayed surface markers and morphological features typical for EBV transformed B-cell lines. As the deproteinized and ultrafiltrated culture supernatants of these cell lines were found to contain an agent with stroma toxic properties, they were termed SSB lines (stroma-toxic-agent-secreting B-cell lines). This agent also exhibited a colony-inhibitory activity on in vitro myelopoiesis and erythropoiesis. These properties are typical for the two polyamines spermine and spermidine which were detected at elevated levels in the culture supernatants of SSB lines. The hypothesis that latent presence of EBV in bone marrow may induce an increased synthesis of spermine and spermidine, which are known to be associated with malignant haematological diseases and bone marrow aplasia, is discussed.","['L.

We investigated the expression of bcl-2 (B-cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2) in BCC, and also in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin. The proto-oncogene bcl-2 encodes a protein which inhibits programmed cell death (apoptosis). The protein is expressed in basal cells in normal human epithelium, but not in the suprabasal cell layers. Immunohistochemical localization using a monoclonal anti-Bcl-2 antibody revealed bcl-2 expression in all the BCCs (15 patients). SCCs did not express bcl-2 (five patients). The positive Bcl-2 staining of BCC tumour cells supports the hypothesis that BCCs originate from the basal layer of the epidermis. The bcl-2 expression of BCC tumour cells also suggests a neoplastic transformation caused by extended cell survival rather than increased cell proliferation. This type of neoplastic growth is possibly associated with less aggressive tumour behaviour.","['Department of Dermatology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Maastricht, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using our optimized assay for tocopherol, we find that L1210 lymphoblastic leukemia cells, cultured in standard growth media, contain only 2.3 +/- 0.03 micrograms of tocopherol/10(8) cells, whereas when they are transplanted and grown for the same time in the ascites fluid of mice fed standard diets, this increases to 5.8 +/- 0.6 micrograms of tocopherol/10(8) cells. This apparent tocopherol deficiency in cultured cells is likely due to the low concentrations of tocopherol contained in most tissue culture media, even with the addition of serum. To further study this apparent deficiency and the relationship of cellular tocopherol to membrane lipid bis-allylic hydrogen positions, we supplemented the growth media of L1210 lymphoblastic leukemia cells with alpha-tocopherol and compared the resultant cellular tocopherol content to the degree of unsaturation of cellular lipids, alpha-Tocopherol was incorporated by cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with plateaus at 24 h and 100 microM, respectively. A maximum 400% increase in cellular tocopherol was easily achieved. By experimentally modifying the fatty acid content of cellular lipids, we were able to determine that cellular tocopherol uptake and content is not a function of cellular lipid composition; cells enriched with polyunsaturated lipids incorporated tocopherol to the same extent as those enriched with more saturated lipids. Thus, as the cellular polyunsaturated fatty acid content increases, the tocopherol:bis-allylic position ratio in the cells decreases, resulting in less antioxidant protection for each lipid double bond. Consequently, when polyunsaturated fatty acid-enriched cells are exposed to an oxidative stress, such as Fe2+, their tocopherol levels decline much faster than cells enriched with saturated fatty acids. This decline is consistent with their respective tocopherol:bis-allylic position ratio. These results provide a basis, at the cellular level, for investigators to consider vitamin E when studying cell response to oxidative stress.","['Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242, USA.']","['CA31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49264/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

At birth, all offspring were cross-fostered to surrogate mothers who had been fed laboratory chow. At weekly intervals, the neonatal mice were weighed, and 4 mice from each group were used to assess the development of splenic lymphocytes. The total number of splenocytes was similar in all three groups at each sampling. The number of T-cells, B-cells, and natural killer (NK) cells was measured by flow cytometry. T-cells and NK cells did not vary significantly among the three diet groups. However, the total number of B-cells was decreased for the first 3 weeks of life in the ethanol-exposed animals. The function of the T-cells and B-cells was determined by assessing the response to lipopolysaccharide, pokeweed mitogen, phytohemagglutinin, and concanavalin A. The response to all four mitogens was significantly reduced in the ethanol-exposed animals and did not recover to control levels until 4-5 weeks of life. Ethanol exposure had no significant effect on the kinetics of acquisition of NK lytic function, as assessed by determining the killing of chromium-51 labeled YAC-1 tumor target cells.

This late onset resembles sporadic cases which are commoner in older age, rather than the previously reported familial cases most of whom have been children or young adults. The three affected members had megaloblastoid bone marrows with an increased proportion of bone marrow blasts and developed progressive bone marrow failure without leukemic transformation. The propositus showed a dramatic but temporary response to GM-CSF therapy but eventually became unresponsive with a marked increase in bone marrow reticulin and reduction in hemopoietic elements.

A deoxyuridine (dU) suppression test of bone marrow cells was compared in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (N = 5), myelodysplastic disease (N = 3), untreated pernicious anemia (N = 16), folate deficiency (N = 7), and a hospital reference group without signs of cobalamin or folate deficiency (N = 22). All had normal MMA excretion but 3 of 15 patients had increased FiGlu excretion. In vitro thymidine uptake in bone marrow cells of CML patients were lower (mean 40 fmol/106 cells) than pernicious anemia patients (115 fmol/106 cells). Methotrexate (MTX) increased the uptake in all cases. Addition of formyl-THF, methyltetrahydrofolate (methyl-THF), and pteroylglutamic acid (PGA) tended to normalize the effect of MTX. In pernicious anemia methyl-THF only decreased the uptake in combination with CN-Cbl. dU suppression values were significantly higher (6.3%) in CML than in the reference group (4.4%), but significantly lower than in pernicious anemia (41.6%) and folate deficiency (28.5%). The dU suppression values in bone marrow cells of CML patients correlated significantly with the transferrin saturation. In buffy coat cells dU suppression values were even higher (9.3%) than in bone marrow cells of the same CML patients. Addition of folate forms and CN-Cbl did not change the dU suppression values in CML, as it did in pernicious anemia. MTX increased dU suppression values significantly in all patients, but more in CML (64.5%) than in pernicious anemia (48.6%) and controls (49.8%). The MTX effect was to some extent neutralized by folate analogues with formyl-THF as the most effective followed by methyl-THF and lastly PGA. Methyl-THF also neutralized MTX in pernicious anemia, but its effect was certainly enhanced by addition of CN-Cbl. Thymidine uptake and dU suppression patterns were not significantly changed in CML after treatment with busulfan for 1 week or in accelerated phase. We concluded that signs of cobalamin or folate deficiency (apart from one patient) cannot be demonstrated in untreated CML. However, dU suppression was significantly increased and more so in circulating myeloid cells than in bone marrow. This indicates a deranged metabolism of deoxynucleotides which is independent of cobalamin and folates, and a difference between bone marrow cells and circulating cells. dU suppression is a valuable indicator of cobalamin deficiency.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Department of Hematology L, Copenhagen County Hospital, Herlev, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-four consecutive and previously untreated patients, with a median age of 75 (range 54-86) years, with aggressive lymphoma, received daily etoposide (60 mg/m2 intravenous infusion [IVI]), cytosine arabinoside (50 mg/m2 subcutaneously), and methylprednisolone (60 mg/m2 IVI) on each of 5 consecutive days. Individuals with limited disease (stages I and II) (n = 9) received six, 3-day cycles of the same therapy and involved field radiation (36 Gy in 20 fractions) between the third and fourth courses. Patients with disseminated lymphoma (n = 25) received 10 cycles over 8 months of the same combination, with the addition of methotrexate (200 mg/m2 on days 8 and 15), followed by leucovorin rescue (10 mg/m2 orally every 6 hr for 8 doses). Of the 34 patients, 44% entered complete remission (CR), and 7 died before completing the first cycle of chemotherapy. Fifty-six percent of the patients with limited disease and 40% with disseminated lymphoma (P > 0.05) achieved CR. For all patients, median survival was 14 months (range 3 days- > 54 months), this being 12 and 15 months, respectively. For the entire population of responding patients, median survival has not been reached at a median follow-up of 39 months, while the median CR duration is 21 months. Ten of the 15 responders are alive in unmaintained CR at a median of 41 (range 30-54) months. Myelotoxicity was the major side effect, leading to adjustments in dose and schedule in two-thirds of the patients, although treatment changes did not affect outcome. Of the 15 deaths that occurred in this trial, in 53.3% it was unrelated to lymphoma or its therapy. Four patients that had achieved CR died of cardiovascular events (n = 2) or of progressive second malignancies (n = 2). It is concluded that cytosine arabinoside in combination regimens is effective in selected patients; this is particularly relevant in the elderly.","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, South Africa.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the proliferation rate of LGL leukemia cells from untreated control Fischer-344 (F-344) rats in 3 stages of leukemia compared to nonleukemic age-matched rats was determined by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). In histologic sections of spleen from aged F-344/N rats affected by LGL leukemia, there was a significant increase of both PCNA labeling and mitotic indices that was most advanced in the spleen of rats with more severe LGL leukemia.

In this paper, we describe the disruption of an additional homeostatic mechanism-evaporative water loss-by FeLV. Viremic cats had greater evaporative water losses (24.0 +/- 1.4 gm water/kg per day) at low relative humidity levels (19% to 25% relative humidity) when compared to age- and sex-matched control cats (19.7 +/- 1.4 gm of water/kg per day [P < 0.05]). At relative humidity levels greater than 50%, viremic and control cats had similar evaporative water losses. Viremia also resulted in an elevation in the average body temperature (39.1 +/- 0.5 degrees C) compared to control cats (38.4 +/- 0.3 degrees C) (P < 0.001). However, the energy expenditure of viremic cats (17.14 +/- 1.60 kJ/kg/h) was not significantly different from the energy expenditure of control cats (17.02 +/- 2.22 kJ/kg/h). The elevated body temperature of viremic cats likely causes a greater increase in evaporative water loss at low relative humidity levels and suggests further study of water balance in retroviral infection is warranted.","['Department of Veterinary Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210-1093, USA.']","['DK40640/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41066/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of the minisatellite probes MS31 and MS43 used as a routine follow-up test after bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: Twenty receivers of allogenic bone marrow transplants were followed-up. Two monoclonal minisatellite probes, MS31 and MS43, were used for comparison with the classical polymorphism methods. RESULTS: Fourteen cases of total chimeras, 3 cases of rejections and 3 cases of mixed chimeras were observed with the molecular probe techniques. In 19 of the 20 cases, this technique gave results compatible with classical polymorphism results. CONCLUSIONS: The minisatellite probes MS31 and MS43 were found to be sensitive, effective tests for bone marrow transplants which can be used in routine follow-up.","[""Departement d'Hematologie, Hopital Nord, CHRU de Saint-Etienne.""]",,,,,,Suivi de greffe allogenique de moelle osseuse par les polymorphismes de l'ADN.

Only a minority of patients dispose of an adequate donor from among his/her relatives. The remaining transplant receptors must look to unrelated donors (URD). The experience of the Escuela de Hematologia Farreras Valenti (Farreras Valenti School of Hematology, Barcelona, Spain) in BMT from URD in CML in the first chronic phase is herein reported. METHODS: Fifteen patients (9 males and 6 females, median age 33 years; range 14-48 years) were transplanted from October 1988 to May 1994. Serologic identity was expressed in the A, B and D loci in 9 cases and minor incompatibility in 6. Conditioning included total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide in 14 patients and busulphan plus cyclophosphamide in 1. Partial and selective T lymphocyte depletion was performed by elutriation in 7 cases. RESULTS: Primary implant failure was detected in 2 out of 14 risk patients (14%) and secondary failure was observed in 3 out of 12 cases (25%). The actuarial probability of acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was 55 +/- 15% at 7 weeks with a probability of appearance with an intensity of II-IV of 31 +/- 13%. Five out of 7 patients with a survival of greater than 100 days, developed chronic GVHD (71%). Ten presented fatal complications. In 5 cases, death was due to pulmonary problems. Recurrence of CML was not observed in any of the patients in the series. The probability of disease free survival at 2 years was 30 +/- 12%. CONCLUSIONS: Bone marrow transplantation from an unrelated donor is an effective treatment for a proportion of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia although severe complications are frequent and originate a high mortality.","['Escuela de Hematologia Farreras Valenti, Departamento de Medicina, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Universidad de Barcelona.']",,,,,,Transplante de medula osea a partir de donantes no emparentados en la leucemia mieloide cronica: resultados en 15 pacientes.,,,,,,,

To date, the issue of how to treat patients relapsing after 2-CdA has not been adequately addressed. In our initial study, 41 of 46 patients achieved an objective response (complete or partial remission). The only persistent toxicity associated with this agent appears to be significant suppression of CD4+ lymphocyte counts, albeit without evidence of clinical sequelae at a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 7-43). Eight patients have developed recurrent disease 3-23 months (median, 16 months) after 2-CdA. Because of progressive cytopenias, three of these patients were treated with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) (3 x 10(6) units subcutaneously three times per week), commencing 2, 9 and 16 months after the documentation of relapse. All three patients have shown an objective response with reduction of marrow hairy cells and amelioration of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia (two patients, complete remission; one patient, partial remission). Responses were maintained while on IFN-alpha, but two patients relapsed shortly (3 and 4 months, respectively) after discontinuation of IFN. There was no significant toxicity. Prior to commencing IFN-alpha, 22-36 months after 2-CdA, these patients' absolute CD4+ counts were suppressed (mean 211/microliters, s.d. +/- 85/microliters), but have not significantly changed after 10, 11 and 18 months of IFN-alpha therapy (mean 225/microliters, s.d. +/- 93/microliters). These results suggest that in hairy cell leukemia patients relapsing after 2-CdA, IFN-alpha may be a reasonable therapeutic option, especially if persistent CD4+ lymphocytopenia is present.","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antagonist was generated by alkylation to inactivate catalytic His-residues of native human interleukin-3. The resulting inhibitor caused a factor 7 inhibition of the growth-response curve of the IL-3 control-stimulated proliferation of a MO-7 leukemia cell line. A 40% inhibition of the MO-7 proliferation could be achieved with a partially alkylated inhibitor in presence of a factor 30 excess of native IL-3. Therefore, the inhibitor had a substantially improved affinity for the IL-3 receptor on these leukemia cells. At a concentration of as low as 0.1 ng/ml it still caused a 2-fold inhibition of the native IL-3-stimulated proliferation response curve. Thus it can be concluded that this alkylate IL-3 is a potent IL-3 antagonist. Based on the reported specific zinc binding of IL-2, IL-6, GM-CSF and gamma-interferon this suggests that more leukemias and even other forms of cancer can be effectively suppressed by alkylated growth factors.","['Trojan Horms Incorporated, Delft, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA methylation is usually detected by Southern blotting after restriction digest with methylation-sensitive endonucleases. Calcitonin gene hypermethylation has been described in a variety of human malignancies including lymphomas and leukemias. Here we report a technique based on the semi-quantitative differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) which is capable of detecting subtle changes in the methylation pattern of the human calcitonin gene. This technique is based on two principles: (i) simultaneous coamplification of the target gene (5'-region of the calcitonin gene) and a reference gene for quantitative purposes; and (ii) simultaneous coamplification of a competitor with identical primer-binding sites as the target gene to control for proper restriction digest. Using this technique, we investigated calcitonin gene methylation in a variety of human cell lines, primary leukemias and normal human blood donors. The data revealed good correlation with standard Southern blotting. Weak calcitonin gene methylation was found in all normal blood donors tested (n = 14). In contrast, strong calcitonin gene methylation was detected in most acute leukemias (five of 10 acute myeloid leukemias (AML); six of seven acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL)). These data show that this technique can reliably be used to quantitate gene methylation and indicate that there exists heterogeneity with regard to methylation status in different leukemias, suggesting that hypermethylation of the calcitonin gene may play a role in the transformation process of some, but not all, human leukemias. Furthermore, differential PCR may facilitate determination of calcitonin gene methylation in clinical or archival tumor samples.","['Abteilung fur Innere Medizin mit Schwerpunkt Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the apparent clinical importance of testicular relapse, its pathogenesis is still unknown. The studies with an animal model of ALL have shown that many testicular factors are able to control the intratesticular infiltration and proliferation of leukemic lymphoblasts during the untreated course of ALL. In the present study, the ultrastructure of rat testicular interstitium infiltrated by leukemic lymphoblasts was studied in two groups of rats transplanted with rat T cell leukemia in early and late puberty. In both groups most of the leukemic cells infiltrating testicular interstitium were totally or partly enveloped by one or more Leydig cells, and the endothelial cells of capillaries, arterioles and venules were hypertrophic. The Leydig cells of the younger experimental group were by nuclear and cytoplasmic ultrastructure similar to the undifferentiated Leydig cells normally seen on the third postnatal week. The results suggest that Leydig cells bind leukemic lymphoblasts on their surface in vivo as also previously observed in vitro, and that ALL may disturb the pubertal maturation of Leydig cells. The occlusion of arterial and capillary lumina by folds of hypertrophic endothelial cells together with adhered leukemic lymphoblasts may impair the circulation of leukemic testes.","['Department of Anatomy, University of Turku, Finland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blotting demonstrated that the leukemic cells were the introduced J2E cells. In addition to spleen and liver, the bone marrow was a major site of leukemic cell infiltration, and when grown in vitro leukemic cells from bone marrow remained responsive to erythropoietin. We reasoned, therefore, that treatment of mice with this hormone should alleviate the erythroleukemia, but regular injections of epo in vivo failed to arrest the progress of the disease.

The expression of cyclins in non-tumor cells, regulated by timely induction of their synthesis and proteolysis, is scheduled, occurring at discrete periods of the cell cycle. Using multiparameter flow cytometry we have recently observed that expression of cyclins B1 and E in individual normal lymphocytes mitogenically stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and lymphocytic leukemic MOLT-4 cells was similar, restricted to particular phases of the cycle: cyclin B1 was detected only in G2+M- and cyclin E in late G1 and early S-phase cells. In the present study we have measured the expression of cyclins A, D2 and D3 in these cells. The presence of cyclin A was restricted to late S and G2 phases, both in the case of lymphocytes and of MOLT-4 cells. Over 95% of the non-stimulated lymphocytes were both cyclin D2 and D3 negative. Mitogenic stimulation with PHA-induced expression of cyclins D2 and D3 in over 50% cells, which corresponds to the percentage of cells that respond to this mitogen in cultures. Expression of these proteins peaked between 8 and 24 h after addition of PHA, and then decreased at the time of cell entrance to S. During exponential growth (48-72 h after stimulation with PHA) expression of the D-type cyclins was diminished: only between 5-10% of the lymphocytes had levels of cyclin D3 as high as G1 cells between 8-24 h after PHA stimulation. Populations of proliferating lymphocytes and MOLT-4 cells were very heterogeneous in terms of expression of D-type cyclins by individual cells. While expression of cyclin D2 in exponentially growing MOLT-4 cells was similar to that of proliferating lymphocytes, the percent of cells expressing cyclin D3 as well as the degree of expression, was higher in MOLT-4 cells, regardless of the phase of the cycle. These results, with our earlier observations of the untimely expression of cyclins B1 and E in several other tumor lines, suggest that altered expression of cyclins may be a frequent feature of malignancy.","['Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Valhalla, USA.']",['CA 28704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the growth properties of the cell line, termed 'W1' showed an interleukin-1 (IL-1) mediated autocrine pattern of cell proliferation with the following features: W1 colony growth without added growth factor was density-dependent and colony growth was augmented with serum-free autologous cell culture supernatant; exogenous IL-1 beta had a growth-promoting effect on W1 colony numbers when cells were seeded at low density; W1 cells constitutively expressed mRNA for IL-1 beta, and high levels of IL-1 beta were measured in W1 cell lysates; anti-IL-1 beta antibodies as well as IL-1 receptor antagonist markedly suppressed W1 colony growth when either was added to cultures of cells seeded without growth factors at low density; anti-GM-CSF antibodies and anti-IL-3 antibodies had no inhibitory effect on W1 colony growth. Whereas W1 colony growth was also augmented by adding IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, GM-CSF, Steel factor and erythropoietin individually to the cultures, W1 cells did not constitutively express mRNA for any of these cytokines. W1 colony growth was markedly suppressed by exogenous TNF-alpha which contrasts sharply with the autocrine growth promoting effect of TNF-alpha on myelomonocytic elements of JCML in 'chronic' phase. The inhibitory effect of TNF-alpha on W1 cells was not due to downregulation of IL-1 production. The IL-1-dependent growth of W1 cells appeared to be unique because none of five other pre-B lineage ALL cell lines established as controls showed an autocrine growth loop via IL-1. W1 cells provide a valuable opportunity to examine the relationship of monosomy 7, B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia, aberrant genetic expression of cytokines and their receptors, and IL-1 mediated autocrine cell growth in cancer.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLA-DR53 is associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia at the protein level, and our previous study has shown its association with early-onset chronic myeloid leukemia only in homozygous form at the DNA level. In the present study, the homozygosity rates for DR53 were 17.5 and 13.6% in patients and controls, respectively. Ten of the 11 homozygous patients were boys. In the common ALL group (n = 40), all seven DR53 homozygous patients were boys, and among 19 girls this genotype was not observed (P = 0.006). For males, homozygosity for DR53 revealed a relative risk (RR) of 3.29 (P = 0.008) for common ALL. Five of the 11 relapsed patients were homozygous for DR53. Heterozygous frequencies for HLA-DR53 were not different between patients and controls. Homozygosity for DR53 was associated with a very high relapse rate (45.5 vs 7.7%, P = 0.002, RR = 9.1). These results extended our findings in chronic myeloid leukemia and showed the recessive nature and the male predominance of the interactive HLA influence on the development of childhood leukemia. Molecular mimicry of an HLA-DR53 epitope by oncogenic (retro)viruses or putative susceptibility genes in linkage disequilibrium with HLA-DR53 may be responsible for this association.","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We postulated that nonmalignant T lymphocytes remaining within bone marrow from children with newly diagnosed ALL could be involved in this immune response. T lymphocytes which expressed gamma delta TCR comprised less than 1% of ALL marrow cells. A preferential outgrowth of gamma delta T cells within the CD3 population was observed when marrow cells were cultured with IL-2 alone or with stimulating feeder cells. These results, obtained in a series of 14 patients with precursor B-ALL, were significantly different when compared with expansions from normal marrow cells. In one patient, the clones established from the expanded population displayed different patterns of cytotoxicity against tumoral targets of the B cell lineage. Some clones expressing the TCR V delta 1 segment showed cytotoxic activity against a cell line derived from a pre-B ALL without activity against a LAK-sensitive B cell line. Using PCR amplification, one such clone was detected at high frequency, in the primary expansion of ALL marrow cells. These results suggest a prior activation in vivo of some gamma delta T cells by leukemic cells and provide some evidence on the role of these subsets in the immune response to leukemia.","[""Service d'Hemato-Immunologie, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcription of the MPO gene is turned on only during the late myeloblast and promyelocyte stages of myeloid maturation. Identification of cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors which regulate the MPO gene should, therefore, shed light on myeloid maturation. We report transfection and in vitro transcription experiments which demonstrate promoter activity in the proximal 5'-flanking region of the human MPO gene. Using a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter vector system, and segments of the 5'-flanking MPO DNA, we constructed a series of MPO promoter-CAT expression vectors. By electroporation and lipofectin-mediated transient transfection assays, as well as by in vitro transcription studies, a 594-bp MPO DNA sequence (bp -583 to +11) showed promoter activity in a variety of MPO-expressing and non-MPO-expressing cell lines. Compared with the SV40 early promoter, the MPO promoter had greater relative activity in MPO-expressing than in non-MPO-expressing cell lines, suggesting slight tissue specificity. However, a CAT reporter plasmid containing 1099-bp of 5'-flanking MPO DNA showed greater specificity for MPO expressing cell lines. Analysis of a group of promoter deletion mutants showed that the minimal promoter was contained in a DNA fragment extending from bp-128 to +11. The remainder of the promoter region contained several segments which appeared to enhance the activity of the minimal promoter. One such enhancer sequence was homologous to an enhancer previously described in the human elastase promoter. Activity of the 594-bp MPO promoter in HL-60 was reduced by only approximately 30% following treatment of the cells with chemical inducers of maturation, but the 1099-bp MPO promoter showed 60% reduction in activity after DMSO treatment. A previously described enhancer region in intron 9 of the MPO gene had little or no effect on activity of the 594-bp MPO promoter. The availability of the MPO promoter will facilitate determination of other factors involved in the regulation of this myeloid-specific gene.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell line has been subjected to selection pressure by intermittent exposure to daunorubicin, but not ara-C, since its initial isolation. In comparison to the parental line (K562S), K562R were approximately 15-fold more resistant to ara-C as determined by 3H-dThd incorporation, MTT dye reduction and clonogenicity. Following a 4-h exposure to 10 microM ara-C, K562S accumulated approximately seven times more ara-CTP, and incorporated approximately 250% more ara-C into DNA than their resistant counterparts. The intracellular generation of ara-CTP was not significantly influenced by the cytidine deaminase inhibitor THU or the deoxycytidylate deaminase inhibitor dTHU (1 mM each) in either cell line. Rates of dephosphorylation of ara-CTP were equivalent in sensitive and resistant cells, as were intracellular levels of both ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. However, K562R displayed a significant (ie 70%) reduction in the level of activity of the pyrimidine salvage pathway enzyme, deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), compared to K562S cells. In contrast to U937 leukemic cells, DNA extracted from K562S and K562R cells following exposure to 10 microM ara-C for 6 h did not exhibit the characteristic internucleosomal DNA cleavage on agarose gel electrophoresis typical of drug-induced apoptosis. Lastly, Northern analysis revealed equivalent levels of dCK message in the two cell lines. K562R represents an unusual example of a classical multidrug resistant human leukemic cell line exhibiting spontaneous cross-resistance to the antimetabolite ara-C, and may prove of value in attempts to understand the mechanism(s) by which human leukemic myeloblasts survive in vivo exposure to combination chemotherapeutic regimens containing drugs that are not classically associated with the multidrug resistance phenomenon.","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298, USA.']","['1RO1 CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The AML cell lines were KG1a, KG1, TF1, HEL, ML1, and two non drug-selected P-gp positive subclones originating from HL-60 (HL-60JD) and U937 (U937AQ). All these cells overexpressed the mdr1 gene (analyzed by RT-PCR) and displayed variable levels of P-gp expression. Flow cytometric semi-quantitative evaluation of P-gp with two P-gp specific monoclonal antibodies (MRK16 and UIC2) showed the following P-gp expression hierarchy: TF1 < KG1a < HEL < KG1 < HL-60JD < ML1 < U937AQ; the latter expressing 13 times more P-gp than TF1. When P-gp function was assessed by Rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux kinetics, we found that only KG1a and KG1 cells, which have an early (immature) CD34+ CD33- CD38- phenotype, and to a lesser extent TF1, with an intermediate (CD34+ CD33+ CD38+) phenotype, displayed significant P-gp activity which could be inhibited by both verapamil and SDZ PSC 833. In contrast, the other more mature CD33+ CD34- AML cell lines presented no Rh123 efflux capacity although they expressed higher P-gp levels. Daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation studies showed that inhibitors of P-gp increased DNR accumulation only in the immature AML cells whereas they had no impact on the mature AML cell lines. MTT drug cytotoxicity assay confirmed that the immature AML cells were 10-15-fold more resistant to DNR than the mature AML cells. Although P-gp inhibitors were able to increase the cytotoxicity of DNR in AML cells which displayed functional P-gp, they could not increase DNR cytotoxicity to levels comparable to that of the CD34- CD33+ cells, suggesting that DNR resistance of immature AML cells may not solely be related to P-gp. With drug-selection, AML subclones displayed higher levels of P-gp expression and higher extruding capacities, and therefore chemoresistance, and this independently of their initial differentiation phenotype. Finally, this study provides evidence for a lack of correlation between expression and function of P-gp in AML cells; this relationship being dependent upon leukemic cell differentiation in unselected myeloid leukemic cells.","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie Fondamentales, CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We asked if the proto-oncogene bcl-2 played a role in this regulation. As target cells we used the continuous lines, OCI/AML-1, OCI/AML-2 or OCI/AML-5; expression of bcl-2 can be detected by Northern analysis of RNA from OCI/AML-2 or OCI/AML-5 cells; bcl-2 expression can be found in OCI/AML-1 cells only by using RT-PCR. Exposure of OCI/AML-2 or OCI/AML-5 cells to retinoic acid (all-trans retinoic acid, ATRA) led to a down-regulation of bcl-2 expression that was first seen after 2 h of exposure and was complete after a day. The down-regulation could be prevented by exposing the cells to ara-C either before or after ATRA; decrease in bcl-2 protein was moderate and only obvious after 36 h of ATRA treatment. Nuclear run-on experiments provided evidence that bcl-2 down-regulation was occurring at transcriptional and post-translational levels. Since bcl-2 is considered to have anti-oxidant activity, we tested the sensitivity of the three cell lines to H2O2; we found that OCI/AML-1, the line with very low bcl-2 expression, was a 100-fold more H2O2-sensitive than OCI/AML-2 or OCI/AML-5, where bcl-2 expression can be detected readily. We then asked if H2O2 sensitivity could be regulated. We found that exposure of cells to HC before H2O2 was protective while ATRA after peroxide treatment increased killing; this is the same pattern of regulation observed when AML blasts are exposed to HC before, or ATRA after ara-C. Finally, we asked whether N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a known radical scavenger would protect cells against ara-C killing. Significant protection was observed when NAC was given before drug, but not if given after drug. NAC protection against ara-C killing was seen for OCI/AML-1 and 2 cells, but not for OCI/AML-5 cells. We interpret the results as follows: ara-C kills cells in two ways: first, directly, by incorporation into DNA and chain termination; second, indirectly, by inducing the production of toxic radicals. Bcl-2 reduces the oxidant activity of such radicals, and is protective. ATRA regulates ara-C toxicity by its action on bcl-2. Left unexplained are the action of HC, which does not affect bcl-2 expression and the mechanism by which ara-C prevents down-regulation of bcl-2 by ATRA.","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangements of the MLL gene on chromosome 11q23 are the most common genetic abnormalities in both ALL and AML, occurring in 70-80% and approximately 60% of cases, respectively. Infants with ALL and a rearrangement of MLL typically present with hyperleukocytosis, massive organomegaly, CNS involvement, CD10- B-lineage phenotype and myeloid-associated antigen (CD15) expression. Prognosis in these cases is uniformly poor, whereas in similar cases without the genetic defect, it is good to intermediate. The presenting features of infant AML include monoblastic or myelomonoblastic morphology, hyperleukocytosis and extramedullary involvement. Expected outcome approximates that for ALL (approximately 30% long-term survival rate). Rare congenital forms of lymphoid or myeloid leukemia, manifested at birth or during the first month of life, carry a dismal prognosis, especially when a MLL/11q23 rearrangement is present; such cases should be carefully distinguished by chromosomal/molecular analysis and cell culture techniques from transient myeloproliferative disorders which require only supportive care but close follow-up for subsequent development of leukemia. Juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia also can occur in infants and may be responsive to chemotherapy alone.

These investigations have pointed to the importance of post-translational modifications of pre-existing proteins, in particular tyrosine phosphorylation, in transmitting signals and thereby linking extracellular signals to the activation of nuclear effector molecules which govern gene expression. These observations not only contribute to our understanding of the pleiotropism and redundancy ascribed to hematopoietic growth factors, but also help to trace some of the molecules conferring signal specificity. It is to be expected that this rapidly evolving research field will provide us with a significant collection of new findings in the near future and that the precise understanding of the processes involved in ligand-binding and signal transmission will also stimulate the development of novel therapeutic drugs affecting these processes. This article gives a short overview on the role of tyrosine kinases and their substrates in signal transmission processes initiated by hematopoietic growth factors.","['Abteilung fur Medizinische Onkologie und Angewandte Molekularbiologie, Universitatsklinikum Rudolf Virchow, Freien Universitat Berlin, Germany.']",,,,170,,,,,,,,,

Direct CFU-GM assays were also used in this study. Daily addition of 300 ng/ml/day of MIP-1 alpha to P delta progenitor assays of normal marrow cells suppressed CFU-GM production by 50% and in CML bone marrow P delta cultures by 20-30%. The response of CML blood P delta progenitors was heterogeneous. In five of nine cases, CFU-GM production was doubled in the presence of MIP-1 alpha and in four of nine cases, it was reduced.

To understand the possible contributions of ectropic murine leukemia viruses to MAIDS pathogenesis, we biologically cloned a series of viruses from the MAIDS-inducing LP-BM5 virus mixture. These viruses were examined for replication in tissues of infected mice and for effects on the immune system. All virus stocks replicated efficiently in mice. Infected animals showed slight lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly due primarily to B-cell proliferation associated with differentiation to immunoglobulin secretion resulting in twofold increases in serum immunoglobulin M levels; however, B-cell responses to helper T-cell-independent antigens were increased rather than decreased as in MAIDS. Analyses of CD8+ T-cell function showed that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte responses to alloantigens were comparable in control and infected mice. Finally, we showed that infection resulted in enhanced expression of transcripts for interleukin-10, interleukin-4, and gamma interferon.

Parental, chimeric, and truncated envelopes cloned into a eukaryotic expression vector were monitored for fusogenic potential in human, rat, and murine indicator cell lines by using a quantitative assay. This highly sensitive assay allowed us to assess the fusogenic properties and syncytium-forming abilities of the HTLV-1 envelope in murine NIH 3T3 cells. All chimeric envelopes containing extracellular sequences of the F-MuLV TM were blocked in their maturation process. Although deletions of the HTLV-1 cytoplasmic domain, alone and in combination with the membrane-spanning domain, did not prevent envelope cell surface expression, they impaired and suppressed fusogenic properties, respectively. In contrast, envelopes carrying substitutions of membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains were highly fusogenic. Our results indicate that these two domains in F-MuLV and HTLV-1 constitute structural entities with similar fusogenic properties.

The CWM-T15 U3 region sequences contain five nucleotide substitutions compared with the less pathogenic sequences of the endogenous ecotropic virus parent, Emv-1. Three of these substitutions are located immediately 3' of the enhancer core, and two form part of an E-box motif that is also found in the Bxv-1 sequence. A series of electromobility shift assays revealed that nuclear extracts from S194 cells and the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor E47 could distinguish between oligonucleotides that contained the core region sequences of CWM-T15 or Emv-1. The E47 homodimers appeared to bind to the CWM-T15 E-box motif and when expressed at high levels in cells transactivated the CWM-T15 but not the Emv-1 enhancer. Taken together, these results suggest that E47 or related basic helix-loop-helix proteins that are expressed in lymphoid cells bind to and transactivate the CWM-T15 enhancer in vivo. This transactivation may explain why the CWM-T15 and Bxv-1 U3 regions accelerate the onset of lymphoid neoplasms and why related enhancer core region sequences are preferentially incorporated into the genomes of recombinant MuLVs and are found in other leukemogenic mammalian retroviruses.","['Department of Microbiology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville 22908, USA.']","['5T 32CA 09109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC189150,,,,,,,,

This expansion, which appears to be critical for the development of the immunodeficiency syndrome, is initially polyclonal but becomes oligoclonal late in the disease, suggesting the involvement of a secondary genetic event(s) during this proliferation. To determine whether integration of the MAIDS defective provirus into particular regions of the cellular genome contributes to this oligoclonal expansion, we searched for common provirus integration sites in enlarged lymphoid organs of MAIDS mice. We identified two common proviral integration sites, Dis-1 and Dis-2, which were occupied by a defective provirus at frequencies of 20 and 13%, respectively. Our analysis revealed that the Dis-1 region corresponds to the Sfpil1 (Spi-1, PU.1) locus, which maps on chromosome 2, and encodes a transcription factor. Insertion of the MAIDS defective provirus into this region led to a two- to threefold increase in the expression of Sfpi1 RNA. The Dis-2 locus was found to map to mouse chromosome 11, between Hox2 and Scya. It appears to be a novel locus probably harboring a gene involved in B-cell proliferation. The present study indicates that the MAIDS defective provirus can act as an insertional mutagen, thus contributing to the oligoclonal expansion of infected cells. The detection of two common proviral integration sites, each of which targetted at a low frequency in diseased organs, suggests that the deregulation of a unique gene through provirus insertion is essential for neither proliferation of infected B cells nor development of the immunodeficiency syndrome.","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,PMC189141,,,,,,,,

However, many scFvs and scFv fusion proteins are unstable, not only as soluble proteins but also on the surface of phage. This limits and biases the recovery of specific Fv phage from display libraries to relatively stable scFvs. Also, the peptide linker in scFvs can diminish antigen binding of scFvs and scFv-fusion proteins. Disulfide-stabilized Fvs (dsFv) which have the VH-VL heterodimer stabilized by an interchain disulfide bond connecting framework regions in VH and VL rather than a peptide linker are more stable than scFvs and in some instances show better binding. To analyze whether these advantages can be utilized in a phage display system and to prove the feasibility of dsFv display, we constructed phage for dsFv display of the anti-Tac antibody and a dsFv-phage library. We find that dsFv phage can specifically bind antigen although the titer of dsFv phage in supernatants appears to be reduced compared to scFv phage. But this reduction in titer does not hamper the isolation of dsFv phages from large pools (libraries) as demonstrated by 'panning' of anti-Tac scFv and dsFv phages on living leukemia cells in suspension. In addition, dsFv phage are more stable than scFv phage. Therefore, display of dsFvs on phage is a useful alternative and addition to scFv-phage display.","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It does not, however, affect an early stage of cellular activation as the addition of the drug as late as 24 h after the start of the culture was still inhibitory for lymphocyte mitogenesis. Neither the expression of CD25, nor that of CD56 was affected by TFP, and exogenous IL-2 was unable to overcome the suppression of proliferation. In relation to cell-mediated cytotoxicity, TFP partially interfered with the effector/target binding. However, addition of lectin to the assay did not overcome the inhibition of lysis produced by the drug. Although further work remains to be done, the effect of TFP on immune responses must be taken into consideration when treating immunosuppressed patients.","['Basic Research Center, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including fresh and activated T cells, were also completely devoid of this antigen. We designated this antigen as TALLA-1 (from T-ALL-associated antigen 1). By expression cloning, a cDNA clone encoding TALLA-1 was isolated from T-ALL cell line Molt-4. TALLA-1 was found to be a member of the transmembrane 4 superfamily (TM4SF). The cDNA was also essentially identical to A15, which was isolated from another T-ALL cell line, HPB-ALL, by differential hybridization with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, and to CCG-B7, which was isolated from a brain cDNA library using CCG repeat as a probe. The gene product was now characterized in detail at the protein level. Northern blot analysis showed that the gene was expressed most strongly in brain, skeletal muscle and spleen. In a panel of 52 non-hematopoietic human cell lines, the majority of neuroblastoma cell lines were found to be positive for TALLA-1.

A total of 1,497 cancers were registered in males, after excluding non melanomatous skin cancers. The most common neoplasms were testis, lymphomas, lung, skin melanoma and oral cavity and pharynx. The overall age-standardized (world population) incidence was 750 per million males, and increased from 676 in 1974-1979 to 808 in 1986-1992. These upward trends were due mainly to cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, lung, skin melanoma and colorectum, while testicular cancer rates remained stable. For females, a total of 1,899 malignant neoplasms was notified, corresponding to an overall age-standardized incidence of 914 per million. The overall rate increased from 818 in 1974-1979 to 1,003 in 1986-1992. The most frequent neoplasms were breast, skin melanoma, ovary, thyroid and lymphomas. The major types of cancer responsible for these upward trends were breast cancer, skin melanoma and lung cancer. In the period studied there were 458 cancer deaths in males and 408 in females, corresponding to an overall age-standardized rate of 227 per million males and 193 per million females. Death rates in males tended to decline, to reach 194 per million in 1986-1992, but no consistent trend was observed in females. The decline in males was essentially due to the fall in rates for testicular cancer and Hodgkin's disease. In females, falls in death rates were observed for cancer of the cervix uteri, ovary and Hodgkin's disease. Death rates were upwards for lung cancer in both sexes, and for skin melanoma and breast cancer in females.","['Registre vaudois des tumeurs, Institut universitaire de medecine sociale et preventive, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Apache II score, which quantifies illness severity, on admission to the ICU was 32.5 +/- 8.8. The average length of stay was 7.4 d. Twenty-nine patients had diffuse pulmonary infiltrates on admission, 2 patients had large pleural effusions, and 1 patient had severe bronchospasm with a clear chest X-ray.

A single patient survived the hospital admission but died 4 months later at home. The observed vs. the predicted ICU mortality determined by Knaus' method, was significantly greater even for those with lower Apache II scores. Acute myelogenous leukemia patients had a greater mortality than 2 other intubated patient populations in our ICU admitted during the same time period, a group of 126 consecutive admissions and 53 patients with connective tissue disease. The latter 2 control groups only included patients requiring mechanical ventilation.

Analysis of cytoplasmic concentration of ascorbic acid and glutathione by HPLC in these cells showed that ascorbic acid was not detectable (detection limit: 0.1 nmol). The cellular content of glutathione was low (6 nmol/million cells). It could easily be depleted with diethylmaleate. The effect of glutathione, ascorbic acid and ascorbyl palmitate alone, or glutathione in combination with ascorbyl palmitate was investigated. It could be shown that glutathione increased DNA--protein cross-links in HL-60 cells by chromate significantly in a dose dependent manner, while pre-incubation with L-ascorbic acid and L-ascorbic acid-6-hexadecanate (ascorbyl palmitate) did not change the cross-linking activity of chromate significantly. Ascorbyl palmitate counteracted the increasing effect of glutathione on the concentration of DNA--protein cross-links in HL-60 cells after exposure to chromate.

Targeting was mediated through the use of an antibody specific for the Thy 1.2 antigen that is highly expressed on P388 cells. Briefly, the approach consists of prelabeling target cells with biotinylated anti-Thy 1.2 antibody prior to administration of drug-loaded liposomes that have streptavidin covalently attached to their surface. Results from in vitro studies demonstrate that a 30-fold increase in cell-associated lipid and a 20-fold increase in cell-associated doxorubicin can be achieved over control liposomes using this two-step procedure. Flow-cytometry and fluorescent-microscopy data were used to confirm that P388 cells can be stably labeled with the biotinylated anti-Thy 1.2 antibody in vivo. Subsequently, liposome-targeting studies were initiated in vivo, where target cell binding was assessed following i.p. or i.v. injection of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes into animals bearing P388 tumours prelabeled with biotinylated antibody. A streptavidin-mediated 3.7-fold increase in cell-associated lipid and drug was achieved when the liposomes were given i.p. When doxorubicin-loaded streptavidin liposomes were injected i.v., P388 cells located in the peritoneal cavity were specifically labeled, although the efficiency of this targeting reaction was low. Less than a 2-fold increase in cell-associated lipid was achieved through the use of target-specific (streptavidin-coated) liposomes. These studies demonstrate that the presence of a well-labeled target cell population within the peritoneal cavity will not promote accumulation of an i.v. injected, targeted liposomal drug. Furthermore, the importance of separating target-cell-specific binding from non-specific uptake by tumour-associated macrophages is discussed.","['University of British Columbia, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present in vitro studies 6HT was compared to taxol with respect to its effects on tubulin depolymerization, mitotic arrest, clonogenic survival and apoptosis in HL-60 cells. 6HT was generated by incubating taxol with human liver microsomes in a NADPH-generating system. HL-60 cells were incubated for 24 h with either taxol or 6HT, washed and placed in drug-free suspension or cultured for colony growth in agarose. For the suspension and colony culture growth of the cells, the IC50 concentrations of 6HT were 500 +/- 46 and 350 +/- 37 nM, while those of taxol were 3.2 +/- 0.2 and 2.8 +/- 0.5 nM, respectively. Immediately after a 24-h exposure of HL-60 cells to 50 nM taxol, electrophoresis of genomic DNA from HL-60 cells revealed an internucleosomal DNA fragmentation 'ladder'. In addition, 39% of the cells were arrested in mitosis and 16% showed the morphologic features of apoptosis. In contrast, an identical treatment with 6HT resulted in the mitotic arrest of only 2.8% of the cells, with 4.0% displaying apoptosis (P < 0.01); internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was not observed. 6HT was also significantly less effective than taxol in inhibiting the temperature-induced depolymerization of microtubules in a cell-free system. However, at equipotent concentrations, the effect of 6HT on tubulin depolymerization, mitotic arrest or apoptosis was similar to that of taxol. In addition, at concentrations of taxol or 6HT at or below their IC50, there was little tubulin depolymerization, mitotic arrest or apoptosis. The results presented here show that the biotransformation of taxol to 6HT substantially detoxifies taxol.","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425, USA.']",['CA63382-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The neoplasms observed covered a wide range of biologic behaviour, from a slowly growing lesion already apparent at birth, to anaplastic astrocytoma in a young adult and glioblastomas at the age of less than 10 years. The only non-neural neoplasms in this family were a case of leukemia and an adrenocortical carcinoma. A germline deletion of codon 236 of the p53 tumour suppressor gene was identified as an underlying cause and detected in all affected family members. This mutation has not previously been reported as germline transmission or in sporadic tumours. The unusual accumulation of CNS tumours may be due to a certain organ-specific effect of this particular p53 mutation or it may reflect the specific genetic back-ground of this family.","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,
