The impact of different approaches and regulations on the results of registration was investigated at three well-established records in the Saarland, Hamburg and North-Rhine Westphalia, taking the group of lymphoma and leukaemia (ICD 200-208) taken as an example. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Incidence and mortality rates calculated by the record files for the period from 1987 to 1994 were compared. The resulting mortality/incidence ratios were compared as well as the percentage of cases in each register with death certificates (DCO) as the only information source. RESULTS: There was a distinct increase of incidence rates visible in Hamburg and Munster. As far as the male patients was concerned, both records attained the level of Saarland at the end of the period. However, the leukaemia and lymphoma mortality figures for males and females was about 10% lower for Saarland than in the comparative regions. The male mortality incidence ratio was 0.55 for Saarland versus 0.60 average in Hamburg and Munster at the end of the period. In Saarland and Hamburg there was a decrease of DCO-cases from 14% to less than 6% in 1994. More constant values around 11% could be observed in the Munster registry. The distribution of diagnosis within the group as well as age-specific incidence rates for the selected diagnosis ""lymphatic leukaemia"" (ICD 204) and ""Hodgkin's disease"" (ICD 201) yielded only slight differences. CONCLUSION: The increase of incidence rates in Munster and Hamburg indicates more complete reporting. Assuming that the survival rates are the same in the three regions, the lower mortality in Saarland points to lower morbidity. Hence in spite of a definite approximation the cancer registries in Hamburg and Munster do not reach the level of completeness of the Saarland cancer registry. This may be due to the informed patient consent required by regional law for reports to the registry. To achieve completeness a special reporting procedure for pathological and haematological Institutes is mandatory. Simple indicators should be available in each registry for continuous estimation of completeness. Standardised case definitions and rules for the coding of diagnosis in cancer registries will improve national and international comparability and feasibility of data exchange.","['Lehnert, M', 'Baumgardt-Elms, C', 'Stegmaier, C', 'Liese, A', 'Krieg, V', 'Mattauch, V', 'Hense, H W']","['Lehnert M', 'Baumgardt-Elms C', 'Stegmaier C', 'Liese A', 'Krieg V', 'Mattauch V', 'Hense HW']","['Institut fur Epidemiologie und Sozialmedizin, Universitat Munster.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Lymphome und Leukamien in bevolkerungsbezogenen Krebsregistern in Deutschland.,Germany,Gesundheitswesen,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),9204210,IM,['Gesundheitswesen 1999 Jun;61(6):298'],"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data']",1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gesundheitswesen. 1999 Apr;61(4):161-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GC act via binding to their specific receptor, a ligand-activated transcription factor, and might induce apoptosis by transcriptional activation of ""death"" or repression of ""survival"" genes. GC regulate gene expression directly, i.e. via GC responsive elements, or indirectly by modulating the activity of other transcription factors such as AP-1, NF-KB, Oct, Ets, and CREB. To analyze possible alterations in the activity of these transcription factors during GC-induced apoptosis, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the human acute T-cell leukemia line CCRF-CEM C7H2 as a model system. Although AP-1 was highly inducible by phorbol ester treatment, it was almost undetectable in logarithmically growing cells and apparently unregulated during GC-induced apoptosis. Thus, alterations in AP-1 activity do not appear to be involved in GC-induced apoptosis. Oct, Ets, and CREB DNA binding activity were detectable prior to and during GC treatment, and appeared to have been down-regulated after 48 hours. At this time, however, cells had already undergone considerable apoptosis, and this downregulation might reflect cell death-associated protein degradation. In contrast, NF-KB DNA binding activity was reduced 12 to 24 hours after GC exposure but reached levels equal to or higher than pre-treatment levels after 48 hours. Thus, while AP-1, Oct, Ets, and CREB may not be involved in GC-induced apoptosis, the maintenance of NF-KB levels suggests that it may participate in this form of cell death.","['Hartmann, B L', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R']","['Hartmann BL', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R']","['Institute for General and Experimental Pathology, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Autoradiography', 'DNA Damage', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1999 May 7;111(9):360-7.,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Austrian Working Party for Stem Cell Transplantation. Austrian Society of Hematology and Oncology.,348-53,"Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is limited by the availability of suitable HLA-matched donors and the risk of graft versus host disease (GvHD). In an attempt to overcome these limitations umbilical cord blood (UCB), has become a further alternative. UCB transplantations in Austria were started in 1991. As of September 31, 1998, six patients have been transplanted. Diagnoses were severe aplastic anaemia (SAA) (n = 2), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) (n = 1), familial hemophagocytic syndrome (FHL) (n = 2) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) (n = 1). Three patients received UCB grafts from HLA-identical siblings and three patients from unrelated donors, of whom two were disparate at two HLA loci (A/B) and one mismatched at one locus (C). Five patients were engrafted with complete donor hematopoiesis, with a median time of 26.5 days (range 14 to 39 days) to an ANC count of > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a median time of 42.5 days (range 24 to 67 days) to a platelet count of > or = 20 x 10(9)/L. One patient with FHL had partial engraftment and died due to reactivation of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and CMV pneumonia on day +25. Of the five patients surviving the post-transplant period, one with CMML had a relapse on day +128 and died after a HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation from the same sibling donor in the second relapse. Another patient with ALL relapsed on day +200 but is still alive under palliative treatment; one patient with SAA showed graft rejection and autologous hematopoietic reconstitution and later had a successful CD34(+)-selected allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplant from a C-locus mismatched unrelated donor. Two patients (one with SAA and one with FHL) are alive with complete remission of the underlying disease. This report reflects the experience and results of UCB transplantation in Austria and discusses the position of UCB transplantation in the context of the other stem cell alternatives available today.","['Schwinger, W', 'Urban, C', 'Lackner, H', 'Kerbl, R', 'Sovinz, P', 'Gardner, H', 'Peters, C', 'Niederwieser, D', 'Fink, F M', 'Kogler, G']","['Schwinger W', 'Urban C', 'Lackner H', 'Kerbl R', 'Sovinz P', 'Gardner H', 'Peters C', 'Niederwieser D', 'Fink FM', 'Kogler G']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Graz, Austria. wolfgang.schwinger@kfunigraz.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Comment']",,Austria,Wien Klin Wochenschr,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,21620870R,IM,,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/therapy', 'Austria', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/07/17 00:00,1999/07/17 00:01,['1999/07/17 00:00'],"['1999/07/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1999 May 7;111(9):348-53.,,['Wien Klin Wochenschr. 1999 May 7;111(9):335-8.

Furthermore, a review of reported parvovirus B19 infections in pediatric ALL patients is presented. The serum of 65 consecutive pediatric patients with a diagnosis of ALL was examined for possible parvovirus B19 infection employing the polymerase chain reaction and ELISA techniques. Specific IgG was demonstrated in 30% of the patients. One patient diagnosed with pre-ALL had evidence of parvovirus B19 DNA in the serum during pancytopenia 5 months prior to the onset of ALL. The results suggest that there is an insignificant chance of finding a parvovirus B19 infection in pediatric patients with ALL at the time of diagnosis.

Furthermore, there is a risk for viral hepatitis acquired by blood products. In this study we looked for hepatotoxicity and for chronic viral hepatitis during and after chemotherapy in 50 unselected children with malignant diseases. 29 children had been treated for leukemia or lymphoma, 19 for solid tumors, 2 for histiocytosis. All patients had been treated before 1991 and had received blood products not screened for hepatitis C-antibodies. In 18 girls and 32 boys aged 12.3 years (range 6.7-24.5 years) hepatitis B- and hepatitis C-serology and liver function tests were measured during a routine check-up 3.6 years (range 0.5-11.8 years) after the last chemotherapy. Liver function tests during chemotherapy were reviewed retrospectively. During chemotherapy 86% of children showed increased ALT and AST levels, 10% had levels above 500 U/l. At follow up 16 children (32%) had pathological liver function tests, especially slightly increased AST and ALT, 13 of these 16 patients had chronic hepatitis C. In contrast only 2 of 34 patients with normal liver function tests had a viral hepatitis (p = 0.001). Patients with elevation of AST and ALT above 100 U/l during chemotherapy had significantly more often a viral hepatitis than those with normal or slightly elevated aminotransferases.

A cost-effective guide to treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia?,173-84,"The differential staining cytotoxicity (DiSC) assay involves in vitro drug panel testing against patient tumor cells to identify optimal therapy. This observational study investigated whether DiSC assay guided treatment could improve outcome in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A cohort of 178 patients were categorized either as sensitive to drugs in vitro and receiving a sensitive drug in vivo, sensitive in vitro but not treated with a sensitive drug, or having disease resistant to all drugs tested in vitro. Response and survival for these patient categories were compared using multivariate regression techniques. Patients receiving a sensitive drug, compared with those who though having sensitivity did not, had a higher remission rate (odds ratio, 6.5; 95% CI, 2.91-14.53) and reduced death rate (hazard ratio, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.16-0.53). Having adjusted for all known confounding factors, the results suggest that in vitro drug sensitivity is an important independent prognostic variable to include in future trials, and that the DiSC assay may be a cost-effective use of health resources: the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness was 1,470 Pounds per life-year gained.

However, these and other studies indicate that most between-residence variability in measured magnetic fields remains unexplained by wire codes. To better understand this remaining variability, engineering and demographic data were examined for 333 underground (UG) and very-low current configuration (VLCC) single-family or duplex residences, selected from a database of nearly 1000 residences specifically because their magnetic fields are most likely affected negligibly by overhead power lines. Using linear regression techniques, four factors predictive of the log-transformed residential field were identified: the square-root of the 24-h average net service drop current (this current is equivalent to the current in the grounding system), the log of the number of service drops on the same secondary serving the residence, residence age (four categories), and area type (rural, suburban, or urban). Complete data on ground current and service drops, the two factors with the strongest individual relationships to measured fields, were available for only half of the residences in the sample. However, these data were determined to be ""missing at random"" according to established statistical criteria. The full-sample or ""composite"" models thus relied on a method similar to regression imputation, accounting for missing data with binary dummy variables. When applied to the samples from which they were derived, these models accounted for 25% of the variance of the log-spot-measured magnetic field values in the full sample, while models that considered only those residences with complete data (n = 167) explained about 35%.

The intracellular Ca2+ concentration data were collected for single Jurkat cells that exhibited a sustained spiking for at least 1 h while repeatedly exposing them to an alternating magnetic field in 10-min intervals interposed with nonexposure intervals of the same length. The obtained data were analysed by computing spectral densities of the Ca2+ oscillating patterns for each of these 10-min intervals. For every single-cell experiment the spectra of all exposure as well as nonexposure periods were then averaged separately. A comparison between the resulting averages showed that the total spectral power of the cytosolic Ca2+ oscillator was reduced by exposure of the cells to an alternating magnetic field and that the effect increased in an explicit dose-response manner. The same relationship was observed within the 0-10 mHz (10 x 10(-3) Hz) subinterval of the Ca2+ oscillation spectrum.

The cells exhibited substantial migration also within the non-neurogenic region, the striatum, in a seemingly nondirected manner up to approximately 1-1.5 mm from the graft core, and showed differentiation into both neuronal and glial phenotypes. Only cells with glial-like features migrated over longer distances within the mature striatum, whereas the cells expressing neuronal phenotypes remained close to the implantation site.

This study was performed to assess the distribution of 13q14 deletion in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and to analyze its correlation with salient clinicopathologic features. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-five NHL were analyzed by cytogenetics and by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using a 13q14 cosmid probe recognizing DNA sequences between the Rb gene and the D13S25 marker. Clinical records all patients were surveyed. RESULTS: A 13q14 rearrangement was present in the stemline in 10 patients; 15 additional cases were shown by FISH to carry 13q14 deletion in 55-90% of the interphase cells, giving a 20% overall incidence for this anomaly. Six of 44 patients had a low-grade NHL, 14/28 had mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 5/42 had a high grade NHL (p<0.0001). There was not correlation between 13q, karyotype status and complexity. A statistically significant association was found between 13q-, presence of splenomegaly and PB involvement, lower probability of attaining complete remission (CR) and shorter survival. These findings were not simply a function of the association of 13q- with MCL. In multivariate analysis, a complex karyotype had prognostic importance (p=0.0078), along with age (p=0.01), histology (p=0.001), LDH (p=0.03), PS (p=0.001), sex (p=0.03) and splenomegaly (p=0.02). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: 13q14 deletion represented an early chromosome change and showed a preferential association with MCL, though it was found in virtually all principal histologic subtypes, irrespective of clinical stage, karyotype status and complexity. Patients with 13q14 deletions had a low CR rate, suggesting that genes relevant to lymphomagenesis are located in this chromosome segment that warrants molecular cytogenetic investigation.","['Cuneo, A', 'Bigoni, R', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Roberti, M G', 'Bardi, A', 'Campioni, D', 'Minotto, C', 'Agostini, P', 'Milani, R', 'Bullrich, F', 'Negrini, M', 'Croce, C', 'Castoldi, G']","['Cuneo A', 'Bigoni R', 'Rigolin GM', 'Roberti MG', 'Bardi A', 'Campioni D', 'Minotto C', 'Agostini P', 'Milani R', 'Bullrich F', 'Negrini M', 'Croce C', 'Castoldi G']","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita di Ferrara, via Savonarola 9, 44100 Ferrara, Italy. sse@dns.unife.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', '*Sequence Deletion']",1999/07/16 00:00,1999/07/16 00:01,['1999/07/16 00:00'],"['1999/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Jul;84(7):589-93.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective noncomparative case series. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 150 ASCT patients. INTERVENTION: Ophthalmologic examinations of 130/150 patients were made, with particular attention to the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). RESULTS: One hundred thirty patients with a mean age of 35.5 (SD 10.6) years at the time of ASCT were followed up for a mean of 12 months (range 3-60 months). GVHD developed in 73 patients (56.2%). Of 130 patients, 52 (40.0%) had ocular complications, and 29 (22.3%) of those had GVHD. Keratoconjunctivitis sicca was diagnosed in 13 (10.0%) patients, and 12 (9.2%) had different stages of pseudomembranous conjunctivitis. Cataract developed in 3 patients (2.3%) in the observation period, and 7 (5.4%) had keratitis. Six (4.6%) patients had uveitis, and 8 (6.2%) had retinal hemorrhages. No ischemic retinopathy was found. Bilateral optic disc edema developed in 10 (7.7%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fewer ocular complications were observed in this series than in earlier studies, and the visual outcome was favorable. Cyclosporine has been linked to the development of optic disc edema and ischemic retinal lesions. The latter condition was not observed in the study patients, and the optic disc edema resolved within 1 year in all patients without any detectable visual impairment, in spite of continuation of the drug. Seven patients had acute GVHD at the time of optic disc edema, which is considered to be another manifestation of acute GVHD.","['Kerty, E', 'Vigander, K', 'Flage, T', 'Brinch, L']","['Kerty E', 'Vigander K', 'Flage T', 'Brinch L']","['Department of Neurology, Rikshospitalet, The National Hospital, University of Oslo, Norway. emilia.kerty@rh.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,IM,,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Eye Diseases/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1999/07/16 00:00,1999/07/16 00:01,['1999/07/16 00:00'],"['1999/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 1999 Jul;106(7):1334-8. doi: 10.1016/S0161-6420(99)00720-4.,,,,"['S0161-6420(99)00720-4 [pii]', '10.1016/S0161-6420(99)00720-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

International Commission on Radiological Protection.,1-157,"A Task Group of the ICRP Committee 1 (Radiation Effects) has reviewed relevant data with the objective of advising the Main Commission of the ICRP on the possible implications for radiological protection of emerging views on genetic susceptibility to cancer (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 considers DNA damage and its processing/repair after ionising radiation and serves principally to demonstrate that a few rare cancer-prone, human recessive genetic disorders show DNA repair deficiency and profound increases in radiosensitivity. Less dramatic changes in radiosensitivity are also apparent in a wider range of such disorders. The cellular mechanisms that underly the association between DNA damage processing and tumorigenesis are discussed. Chapter 3 reviews the mechanisms and genetics of solid tumours illustrating the ways in which mutations in proto-oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes together with those in DNA repair and cell cycle control genes can contribute to tumour development. Specific examples are given of how germ line mutation of such genes can predispose to familial cancer. It is judged that up to 5% of all solid tumours have a recognisable genetic component. Heritable organ-specific effects are most usual and cancers of the breast and colon tend to show the most obvious genetic components. Clearly discernible genetic effects are seen when rare dominant germ line mutations express strongly as familial cancer (high penetrance mutations), but the existence of perhaps less rare low penetrance mutations and gene-gene interactions are recognised but not well understood. Chapter 4 considers the mechanisms and genetics of lympho-haemopoietic tumours. Specific chromosomal translocations and proto-oncogene activation events are much more frequent in human leukaemia/lymphoma than in solid tumours. Genetic predisposition to leukaemia/lymphoma is found in a number of non-familial recessive genetic disorders of DNA processing and/or chromosomal instability. Familial manifestation of susceptibility to these tumours is, however, extremely rare. The genetic component, although poorly defined, is judged to be less than that of solid tumours and expressed largely in childhood. Chapter 5 reviews and discusses limited data that comment upon tumorigenic radiosensitivity in cancer-prone genetic conditions. From knowledge of the fundamental processes involved it is judged that in most, but not all, cases genetic susceptibility to spontaneous tumours will be accompanied by a greater-than-normal risk after radiation. A review of epidemiological, clinical and experimental data relevant to this issue suggests that although a wide range of different sensitivities may be involved, a factor of 10 increase in sensitivity broadly accords with the limited human data available. This interim judgement of a factor of 10 increase in radiation risk in such human genetic disorders is made for the purposes of illustrative modelling and calculation. In addition, specific attention is given to breast cancer risk in heterozygotes for the radiosensitive human disorder, ataxia-telangiectasia; this association, while in no way discounted, is judged to be less strong than that claimed by some. Chapter 6 discusses and develops computational modelling procedures that aim to describe the impact of genetic factors on radiation-tumorigenesis in human populations. Estimates of the prevalence of known cancer-prone genetic disorders are made but breast cancer susceptibility is used to illustrate the application of the model developed. The most important message to emerge from this work is that, even at an assumed high level of radiation sensitivity, the prevalence of familial (high penetrance) genetic disorders in the population is too low (<1%) for there to be a significant impact on risk in typical human populations. In principle, however, there is the potential for such impact in atypical inbred sub-populations where these mutations can be more common.

An unusually high frequency of brain tumours seen among children enrolled in one of our leukaemia treatment protocols, Total Therapy Study XII, prompted us to identify the potential causes of this complication. METHODS: We assessed clinical, biological, and pharmacokinetic features in all 52 children who received prophylactic cranial radiotherapy. We compared the cumulative incidence of brain tumours between subgroups, and with that of 421 children who received radiotherapy in previous studies. FINDINGS: The incidence of brain tumours among irradiated children (six of 52, 12.8% [SE 5.0]) was high compared with patients in the same study who did not receive radiotherapy (none of 101; p=0.0008) and with other protocols that included cranial radiotherapy (p<0.0001). Of the six children, four had erythrocyte concentrations of thioguanine nucleotide metabolites higher than the 70th percentile for the entire cohort, and three had a genetic defect in thiopurine catabolism. The 8-year cumulative incidence of brain tumour among children with defective versus wild-type thiopurine methyltransferase phenotype was 42.9% (SE 20.6) versus 8.3% (4.7; p=0.0077). This protocol differed from previous protocols, in that more intensive systemic antimetabolite therapy was given before and during radiotherapy. INTERPRETATION: These data support the elimination of prophylactic radiotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia except in patients at high risk of central-nervous-system relapse. Underlying genetic characteristics and treatment variables may be associated with an increased risk of radiation-associated brain tumours.","['Relling, M V', 'Rubnitz, J E', 'Rivera, G K', 'Boyett, J M', 'Hancock, M L', 'Felix, C A', 'Kun, L E', 'Walter, A W', 'Evans, W E', 'Pui, C H']","['Relling MV', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Rivera GK', 'Boyett JM', 'Hancock ML', 'Felix CA', 'Kun LE', 'Walter AW', 'Evans WE', 'Pui CH']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Cranial Irradiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1999/07/16 00:00,1999/07/16 00:01,['1999/07/16 00:00'],"['1999/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1999 Jul 3;354(9172):34-9. doi: 10.1016/S0140-6736(98)11079-6.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",,"['Lancet. 1999 Sep 25;354(9184):1126.

This cIBR peptide is derived from sequence numbers 11-20 of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Binding studies were performed using a fluorescence-labeled peptide (FITC-cIBR) in which the fluorescence marker fluorescein 5-isothiocyanate (FITC) was conjugated to the N-terminal of the cIBR peptide. The binding affinity of the FITC-cIBR peptide to Molt-3 T cells was evaluated using a FACScan flow cytometer. The binding specificity of the FITC-cIBR peptide was also confirmed by inhibition of binding using unlabeled peptide (cIBR). The results show that FITC-cIBR binds to two populations of T cells with different affinities; population 1 has high cell numbers (75%) but low affinity, and population 2 has high binding affinity but low cell numbers (25%). Binding to both populations was saturable and could be inhibited by the unlabeled peptide (cIBR), suggesting a receptor-mediated binding process. In addition to binding, receptor-mediated internalization was also observed for population 2; this was confirmed by confocal microscopy and temperature-dependence studies at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The binding and internalization of this peptide may be carried out by surface receptors on Molt-3 T cells such as LFA-1. In the future, the binding and internalization of cIBR peptide can be utilized as a method of targeted drug delivery to leukocytes for the treatment of leukocyte-related diseases.","['Gursoy, R N', 'Siahaan, T J']","['Gursoy RN', 'Siahaan TJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The University of Kansas, Lawrence 66047, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Denmark,J Pept Res,The journal of peptide research : official journal of the American Peptide Society,9707067,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/16 00:00,1999/07/16 00:01,['1999/07/16 00:00'],"['1999/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pept Res. 1999 Apr;53(4):414-21. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-3011.1999.00079.x.,"['0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['10.1034/j.1399-3011.1999.00079.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RBL cells have been used for the study of secretion and for the possible involvement of MMC in food allergies and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The flavonoid quercetin is one of very few molecules that inhibit RBL cell proliferation and constitutive histamine release; it also induces synthesis of rat mast cell protease (RMCP) II and accumulation of secretory granules. Even though quercetin is available as a food supplement over the counter, some early studies had indicated it may be carcinogenic. We, therefore, compared the effect of quercetin to that of other flavonoids with similar structure. Flavone, kaempferol, myricetin and morin were investigated for their action on RBL cell secretion of beta-hexosaminidase stimulated by anti-DNP serum and DNP-BSA, as well as on secretory granule development. Quercetin, myricetin and kaempferol inhibited RBL cell secretion significantly only at 10(-4) M.

For this reason T cell subpopulations were analysed in bone marrow and peripheral blood in two selected groups of B-CLL patients. These groups differed significantly in percentages of CD4+ helper T cells in bone marrow. In the first group (11 patients) percentage of CD4+ cells was higher than 9 p.c., in the second (10 patients) this percentage was equal, or lower than 2 p.c. Moreover these groups differed also in total tumor mass score (TTM-score) according to the criteria of Jaksic and Vitale. TTM-score in the first group was 9.7 in the second--22.9.

In the second group we observed some superiority of CD8+ and CD4+ CD45RA+ cells. We can speculate that the predominance of CD4+ and CD4+ CD45RO+ cells over CD8+ and CD4+ CD45RA+ cells in bone marrow facilitate the proliferation or inhibits the apoptosis of CLL cells when the TTM-score is small. On the contrary when the TTM-score is larger, than the leukemic cells expanded in bone marrow without concomitant helper cells.","['Rolinski, J', 'Rupniewska, Z M', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, E']","['Rolinski J', 'Rupniewska ZM', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E']","['Zaklad Immunologii Klinicznej AM, Lublinie.']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Subpopulacje limfocytow T u chorych z przewlekla bialaczka limfatyczna B-komorkowa rozniacych sie odsetkami pomocniczych komorek T CD4+ w szpiku.,Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology/pathology', 'CD4 Lymphocyte Count', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']",1999/07/16 00:00,1999/07/16 00:01,['1999/07/16 00:00'],"['1999/07/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 1998 Dec;100(6):526-35.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gold immunolabeling revealed the presence of actin on the surface of delipidized VLP and delipidized wt virus particles. Statistical evaluation of the number of colloidal gold particles per VLP revealed a large range of values and a prevalence of VLP with small numbers of gold particles. Labeling for actin was lost after prolonged treatment of VLP with 1% Nonidet-P40, high-pH buffer, or gelsolin. Gold immunolabeling with antibodies to gag proteins p15 (MA) and p12 and p30 (CA) was abundant and was not affected by treatment of VLP or wt virus with 1% Nonidet or gelsolin. VLP treated with a mixture of detergent and aldehyde fixatives showed more uniform and consistent labeling for actin than without fixatives. Negative staining or heavy metal shadowing revealed a globular surface of delipidized VLP. Stereomicrographs of gold-immunolabeled VLP showed that p15gag and p12gag were associated with the globular projections. Delipidized VLP were also well labeled with antibody to p30gag, which indicated that the gag shell permitted access of antibodies to p30gag and was therefore not a closely packed structure. Labeling for actin-binding proteins moesin and ezrin was negative in both the wt virus and the VLP. The absence of Gaussian distribution of actin in the sample of VLP suggests that actin is not a structural protein and its presence in MuLV virus particles may be fortuitous. This, however, does not rule out any possible role of actin in transport, assembly, budding, or release of virus particles, events which take place in the cytoplasm or at the plasma membrane.

However, there are few reports on the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system in macrophages and in monocytes as their source. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the renin-angiotensin system is upregulated during the differentiation of monocytes to macrophages, and whether it is further regulated by angiotensin II and cytokines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a human leukemia cell line, THP-1, for monocytes. Differentiated THP-1, induced by adding phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 24 h, were used as macrophages. Expression of messenger RNA of the renin-angiotensin system components was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Angiotensin converting enzyme activity and subtype-specific angiotensin-binding sites of cultured cells, and angiotensin II production in the culture medium were measured. RESULTS: Macrophages expressed all components of the renin-angiotensin system except chymase. Cellular angiotensin converting enzyme activity and angiotensin II in the medium were increased 3.2- and 4.5-fold during differentiation, respectively. Expression of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) receptors was increased 6.2-and 6.4-fold during differentiation, and was sustained for 7 days.

To analyze the mechanism of intestinal infiltration of ATL cells, we made mAbs against ATL-43T, a human T cell line derived from an ATL patient with severe intestinal mucosal infiltration. One of the mAbs, named H920, was noted for a high and relatively specific reactivity with ATL-43T. Molecular cloning was done to identify this molecule and disclosed that the Ag molecule was identical to integrin beta 7. Since integrin beta 7 and its ligand MAdCAM-1 had been reported to mediate homing of lymphocytes to endothelial cells in intestinal mucosa, we next examined wither ATL-43T cells could adhere to MAdCAM-1+ cells. Human MAdCAM-1 transfectants of MMCE, a mouse epithelial cell line, were made and used to evaluate cell adhesion mediated by integrin beta 7 and MAdCAM-1. Considerable levels of cell adhesion were observed between ATL-43T and the transfectant cells, which was inhibited by H920 mAb in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, peripheral blood leukemic cells or lymphoma cells from 10 ATL patients were examined for expression of integrin beta 7 with regard to organ involvement. Samples from three patients with gastrointestinal tract involvement showed considerably higher expression of integrin beta 7. These results suggest that integrin beta 7 may play a role in adhesion and subsequent infiltration of a certain type of ATL cells into intestinal mucosa.","['Chen, H', 'Hori, T', 'Maeda, M', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Chen H', 'Hori T', 'Maeda M', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Virus Immunology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,J Clin Immunol,Journal of clinical immunology,8102137,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Biotinylation', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Integrin beta Chains', 'Integrins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucoproteins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/15 00:00,1999/07/15 00:01,['1999/07/15 00:00'],"['1999/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Immunol. 1999 May;19(3):186-93. doi: 10.1023/a:1020507828066.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (MADCAM1 protein, human)', '0 (Madcam1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mucoproteins)', '0 (integrin beta7)']",,,['10.1023/a:1020507828066 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA binding by PEBP2/CBF alpha is accomplished by a highly conserved DNA binding domain, the Runt domain (RD), whose structure adopts an S-type immunoglobulin fold when bound to DNA. The supplementary subunit beta enhances DNA binding by the RD in vitro, but its role in the control of gene expression has remained largely unknown in vivo. Chromosome 16 inversion creates a chimeric gene product fusing PEBP2/CBF beta to a portion of the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (PEBP2/CBF beta-SMMHC) that is causally associated with the onset of acute myeloid leukemia in humans. The three-dimensional structure of PEBP2/CBF beta has been determined in solution and is shown to adopt a fold related to the beta-barrel oligomer binding motif. Direct analysis of a 43.6 kD ternary RD-beta-DNA complex identifies the likely surface of beta in contact with the RD.

The purpose of this study was to determine conditions of formaldehyde fixation that permit intracellular GFP fluorescence and adequate DNA histograms to be generated following transient transfection of cells with a GFP-encoding plasmid. Cell cycle analysis was also performed in GFP-positive cells. METHODS: The murine myeloid leukemic cell line, 32Dcl3, was used as the model system. Cells were transfected with a GFP-encoding plasmid (pEGFPC1). Following fixation in different formaldehyde concentrations and permeabilization with 70% ethanol, cells were stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry for GFP fluorescence and DNA content. Transfected cells were also analyzed for GFP fluorescence and DNA content following release from nocodazole block. RESULTS: Fixing cells in 0.51-1.75% formaldehyde concentrations prior to ethanol permeabilization resulted in 14-19% of transfected cells being GFP-positive, with acceptable coefficients of variation on the G(1) peak of DNA histograms. Analysis of cells synchronized to and released from the G(2)-M phase by nocodazole suggested that GFP-positive cells, when compared to GFP-negative cells, did not appear to progress out of G(2)-M following release from nocodazole block. Simultaneous detection of GFP fluorescence and DNA content by PI staining is possible following transient transfection of cells with a single expression vector encoding GFP. Our results demonstrate that GFP expression can be detected, using flow cytometry to perform cell cycle analysis in murine leukemic cells.","['Chu, Y W', 'Wang, R', 'Schmid, I', 'Sakamoto, K M']","['Chu YW', 'Wang R', 'Schmid I', 'Sakamoto KM']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and UCLA School of Medicine and Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, California 90095-1752, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Luminescent Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Propidium', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/15 00:00,1999/07/15 00:01,['1999/07/15 00:00'],"['1999/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1999 Aug 1;36(4):333-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990801)36:4<333::aid-cyto8>3.0.co;2-f.,"['0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '36015-30-2 (Propidium)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0320(19990801)36:4<333::AID-CYTO8>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0320(19990801)36:4<333::aid-cyto8>3.0.co;2-f [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['AI28697/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16042/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATL comprises 4 clinical forms: acute, chronic, smoldering and lymphoma types. ATL is usually resistant to conventional chemotherapy and has a relatively poor prognosis; however, the resistance mechanisms remain undetermined. To explore the multidrug-resistance (MDR) mechanisms of ATL, we examined the expression and functional activity of MDR-related genes in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from ATL patients by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and FACScan with calcein-AM. PBMC from ATL patients expressed similar or higher levels of MRP, LRP and cMOAT mRNAs, as compared with normal PBMC. In normal controls and ATL patients, MDR1 mRNA expression was undetectable in this study. PBMC from acute and chronic ATL patients expressed significantly higher levels of MRP and LRP mRNA than did normal PBMC (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively). In chronic ATL, positive correlations were apparent between levels of MRP and LRP mRNA expression (r = 0.759, p = 0.018), and between each mRNA level and the absolute number of abnormal lymphocytes in peripheral blood. Probenecid, an inhibitor of the MRP pump, significantly increased the accumulation of calcein in PBMC from 3 chronic ATL patients. Our findings suggest that the MRP and LRP genes in ATL are often activated by HTLV-I infection and may confer MDR of ATL cells in vivo. Combined chemotherapy with inhibitors of these MDR genes may be promising in the treatment of ATL.","['Ikeda, K', 'Oka, M', 'Yamada, Y', 'Soda, H', 'Fukuda, M', 'Kinoshita, A', 'Tsukamoto, K', 'Noguchi, Y', 'Isomoto, H', 'Takeshima, F', 'Murase, K', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Kohno, S']","['Ikeda K', 'Oka M', 'Yamada Y', 'Soda H', 'Fukuda M', 'Kinoshita A', 'Tsukamoto K', 'Noguchi Y', 'Isomoto H', 'Takeshima F', 'Murase K', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M', 'Kohno S']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan. okamikio@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Fluoresceins/pharmacokinetics', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacokinetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/*genetics']",1999/07/15 00:00,1999/07/15 00:01,['1999/07/15 00:00'],"['1999/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Aug 12;82(4):599-604. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990812)82:4<599::aid-ijc21>3.0.co;2-r.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990812)82:4<599::AID-IJC21>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990812)82:4<599::aid-ijc21>3.0.co;2-r [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For further analysis of the role of HBx in the induction of FasL, PLC/PRF/5 cells were transfected transiently with the HBV genome, or HBx, or the frameshift mutant of HBx. In PLC/PRF/5 cells transfected with the HBV genome or HBx but not in cells transfected with the frameshift mutant of HBx, FasL expression was detected.

Ced-4 facilitates the proteolytic activation of the caspase, Ced-3, while Ced-9 opposes Ced-3/Ced-4 killing. To examine the interactions among these proteins they were expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ced-3 and Ced-4 were lethal when expressed alone, revealing an intrinsic Ced-4 killing activity. Coexpression of Ced-9 blocked Ced-3- and Ced-4-induced killing, showing Ced-9 can independently antagonize the action of both proteins. Ced-3- but not Ced-4-toxicity was attenuated by coexpression of the caspase inhibitors, CrmA and p35. Thus, besides its Ced-3- and Ced-9-dependent action in C. elegans, Ced-4 has an additional Ced-9-dependent, Ced-3-independent killing mechanism in yeast. Two-hybrid analysis confirmed that Ced-4 formed heteromers with Ced-9. In addition, Ced-4 formed homomers and mutation of its nucleoside triphosphate binding motif eliminated both homomerization and cell killing. We suggest the caspase-independent lethality of Ced-4 in yeast is mediated by a Ced-4 homomer.","['Tao, W', 'Walke, D W', 'Morgan, J I']","['Tao W', 'Walke DW', 'Morgan JI']","[""Department of Developmental Neurobiology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale Street, Memphis, Tennessee, 38105-2794, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/genetics/metabolism/toxicity', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Helminth Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Serpins/genetics/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",1999/07/15 00:00,1999/07/15 00:01,['1999/07/15 00:00'],"['1999/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Jul 14;260(3):799-805. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0982.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Ced-4 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Ced-9 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Helminth Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Serpins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', '96282-35-8 (interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (ced-3 protein, C elegans)']",,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.0982 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)90982-8 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

L-Asparaginase preparation derived from E. coli converts asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) to aspartate (Asp) and glutamate (Glu), respectively, and causes rapid depletion of Asn and Gln. It thus suppresses growth of malignant cells that are more dependent on an exogenous source of Asn and Gln than are normal cells. It remains unclear, however, which signaling events in leukemic cells are affected by L-asparaginase. Recently, amino acid sufficiency has been demonstrated to selectively regulate p70 S6 kinase (p70(s6k)) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1), both of which are targeted by the anti-proliferative drug rapamycin. Here we demonstrate that addition of L-asparaginase to human leukemic cells inhibits activity of p70(s6k) and phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, but not activities of other cell growth-related serine/threonine kinases. The rate and kinetics of p70(s6k) inhibition by L-asparaginase were comparable to those seen by deprivation of Asn and/or Gln from cell culture media, suggesting that the effect of L-asparaginase on p70(s6k) is explained by depletion of Asn and/or Gln. Moreover, L-Asparaginase as well as rapamycin selectively suppressed synthesis of ribosomal proteins at the level of mRNA translation. These data indicate that L-asparaginase and rapamycin target a common signaling pathway in leukemic cells.","['Iiboshi, Y', 'Papst, P J', 'Hunger, S P', 'Terada, N']","['Iiboshi Y', 'Papst PJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Terada N']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado, 80206, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Phosphoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sirolimus/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/15 00:00,1999/07/15 00:01,['1999/07/15 00:00'],"['1999/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Jul 5;260(2):534-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0920.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.0920 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)90920-8 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],['CA-64685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Telomere elongation by telomerase is implicated in chromosome stabilization in immortal cells. Here we found that hypoxia enhanced telomerase activity in the solid tumor A2780 and HT-29 cells but not in the leukemia U937 cells. The telomerase activation correlated with activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-fos expression. The MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 repressed telomerase activation in the hypoxic cells. Consistently, a dominant negative MEK1 inhibited telomerase activation by hypoxia. Finally, we found a good correlation between telomerase activation and resistance to apoptotic cell death under hypoxic conditions. These findings indicate that hypoxia up-regulates telomerase activity via MAPK cascade signaling especially in solid tumor cells and suggest that solid tumor cells might enhance the telomerase activity as a stress response against genotoxicity induced by hypoxia.","['Seimiya, H', 'Tanji, M', 'Oh-hara, T', 'Tomida, A', 'Naasani, I', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Seimiya H', 'Tanji M', 'Oh-hara T', 'Tomida A', 'Naasani I', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 1-37-1 Kami-Ikebukuro, Tokyo, Toshima-ku, 170-8455, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Cell Hypoxia', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Up-Regulation']",1999/07/15 00:00,1999/07/15 00:01,['1999/07/15 00:00'],"['1999/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 Jul 5;260(2):365-70. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0910.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.0910 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)90910-5 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, dexamethasone caused a significant enhancement of the phospholipid metabolism in the dexamethasone-resistant CEM-C1-15 cells, indicating a significant difference between the two cell lines in phospholipid metabolism during apoptosis. The results of this study suggest the involvement of phospholipid metabolism in the mechanism of dexamethasone resistance in the CEM-C1-15 cells.","['Adebodun, F']",['Adebodun F'],"['Department of Chemistry, North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, Greensboro 27411, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Choline/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/14 00:00,1999/07/14 00:01,['1999/07/14 00:00'],"['1999/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1999 Jun 1;140(1-2):189-94. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(99)00085-3.,"['0 (2-hydroxyethyltriphenylphosphonium choline)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",,,"['S0304-3835(99)00085-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(99)00085-3 [doi]']",,,['2S06GM08019/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies reveal that resveratrol can inhibit each step of multistage carcinogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying anti-tumorigenic or chemopreventive activities of this phytochemical remain largely unknown. In the present work, we have found that resveratrol reduces viability and DNA synthesis capability of cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. The growth inhibitory and antiproliferative properties of resveratrol appear to be attributable to its induction of apoptotic cell death as determined by morphological and ultrastructural changes, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, and increased proportion of the subdiploid cell population. Resveratrol treatment resulted in a gradual decrease in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2. These results, together with previous findings, suggest the cancer therapeutic as well as chemopreventive potential of resveratrol.","['Surh, Y J', 'Hurh, Y J', 'Kang, J Y', 'Lee, E', 'Kong, G', 'Lee, S J']","['Surh YJ', 'Hurh YJ', 'Kang JY', 'Lee E', 'Kong G', 'Lee SJ']","['Laboratory of Biochemistry and Molecular Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, South Korea. surh@plaza.snu.ac.kr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1999/07/14 00:00,1999/07/14 00:01,['1999/07/14 00:00'],"['1999/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1999 Jun 1;140(1-2):1-10. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(99)00039-7.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,"['S0304-3835(99)00039-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(99)00039-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 24-hr exposure to 10 nM BRY or PMA after a 6-hr incubation with 1 microM ara-C or 100 nM dFdC resulted in equivalent increases in apoptosis, caspase-3 activation, and polyADP-ribose polymerase degradation, as well as identical DNA cleavage patterns. BRY and PMA did not modify retention of the lethal ara-C metabolite ara-CTP or alter ara-CTP/dCTP ratios. Unexpectedly, pretreatment of cells with ara-C or dFdC opposed BRY- and PMA-related induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs) p21CIP1 and/or p27KIP1. These effects were not mimicked by the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin or by VP-16, a potent inducer of apoptosis. Inhibition of PKC activator-induced CDKI expression by ara-C and dFdC did not lead to redistribution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen but was accompanied by sub-additive or antagonistic effects on leukemic cell differentiation. Sequential exposure of cells to ara-C followed by BRY or PMA led to substantial reductions in clonogenicity that could not be attributed solely to apoptosis. Finally, pretreatment of cells with ara-C attenuated PMA- and BRY-mediated activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase, an enzyme implicated in CDKI induction. Collectively, these findings suggest that pretreatment of leukemic cells with certain dCyd analogs interferes with CDKI induction by the PKC activators PMA and BRY, and that this action may contribute to modulation of apoptosis and differentiation in cells exposed sequentially to these agents.","['Vrana, J A', 'Kramer, L B', 'Saunders, A M', 'Zhang, X F', 'Dent, P', 'Povirk, L F', 'Grant, S']","['Vrana JA', 'Kramer LB', 'Saunders AM', 'Zhang XF', 'Dent P', 'Povirk LF', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298-0230, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Bryostatins', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Lactones/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'U937 Cells']",1999/07/14 00:00,1999/07/14 00:01,['1999/07/14 00:00'],"['1999/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1999 Jul 1;58(1):121-31. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00077-5.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['S0006-2952(99)00077-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(99)00077-5 [doi]']",,,"['CA-09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cross-reactivity of the major allergens of sweet cherry (Pru a 1), apple (Mal d 1), pear (Pyr c 1), celery tuber (Api g 1) and carrot (Dau c 1) is due to structural similarities which are reflected by high amino acid sequence identities with Bet v 1a, the major birch pollen allergen. Apart from a strong cross-reactivity to Bet v 1a, IgE inhibition experiments with Mal d 1, Pru a 1 and Api g 1 demonstrated the presence of common and different epitopes among the tested food allergens. Secondary structure prediction of all investigated allergens indicated the presence of almost identical structural elements. In particular, the 'P-loop' region is a common domain of the pollen related food allergens and of pathogenesis related proteins. To identify the IgE binding epitopes, five overlapping recombinant Pru a 1 fragments representing the entire amino acid sequence with lengths of approximately 60-120 residues were investigated. Weak IgE binding capacity was measured exclusively with Pru a IF4 (1-120) by immunoblotting, whereas none of the fragments showed allergenicity in the rat basophil leukaemia cell mediator release assay. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments with Pru a 1 revealed that amino acid S112 is critical for IgE binding of almost all patients sera tested. This reduced IgE binding was also observed with a single point mutant of Bet v 1a (S112P) and thus indicated serine 112 as an essential residue for preserving the structure of a cross-reactive IgE epitope. Moreover, two Pru a 1 mutants with an altered 'P-loop' region, showed a lowered IgE binding capacity for IgE from a subgroup of allergic patients. The investigation of essential features for preserving cross-reactive IgE-epitopes provides the structural basis for understanding the clinically observed cross-allergenicity between pollen and fruits. Moreover, non-anaphylactic allergen fragments or variants derived from the IgE-inducing pollen allergens may serve as useful tools for a new strategy of specific immunotherapy.","['Scheurer, S', 'Son, D Y', 'Boehm, M', 'Karamloo, F', 'Franke, S', 'Hoffmann, A', 'Haustein, D', 'Vieths, S']","['Scheurer S', 'Son DY', 'Boehm M', 'Karamloo F', 'Franke S', 'Hoffmann A', 'Haustein D', 'Vieths S']","['Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Department of Allergology, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,,"['Allergens/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cross Reactions', 'Epitopes/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis/genetics', 'Plant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/14 00:00,1999/07/14 00:01,['1999/07/14 00:00'],"['1999/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1999 Feb;36(3):155-67. doi: 10.1016/s0161-5890(99)00033-4.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (PRUA1 protein, Prunus avium)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Plant Proteins)']",,,"['S0161589099000334 [pii]', '10.1016/s0161-5890(99)00033-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mammalian DNA polymerases catalyze the insertion of the arabinofuranosyl analogs of dNTPs (aranucleotides) into DNA efficiently, but elongate from the 3' aranucleotides poorly. Slow elongation provides an opportunity for exonucleases to remove aranucleotides. The exonuclease activity associated with DNA polymerase delta removes araCMP from 3' termini with the same efficiency that it removes a paired 3' deoxycytosine suggesting that the proofreading exonucleases associated with DNA polymerases might remove aranucleotides inefficiently. A separate 30 kDa exonuclease has been purified from mammalian cells that removes araCMP from 3' termini. The activity of this enzyme in the cell could remove aranucleotides from 3' termini of DNA and decrease the efficacy of the analogs. Inhibition analysis of the purified exonuclease shows that this enzyme is inhibited by thioinosine monophosphate (TIMP) with a Ki = 17 microM. When high TIMP levels are generated in HL-60 cells, incorporation of araC in DNA is increased about 16-fold relative to total DNA synthesis. This increased araC in DNA is likely a result of exonuclease inhibition in the cell. Thus, exonucleases in cells might play an important role in removing aranucleotides inserted by DNA polymerases.","['Perrino, F W', 'Mazur, D J', 'Ward, H', 'Harvey, S']","['Perrino FW', 'Mazur DJ', 'Ward H', 'Harvey S']","['Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Department of Biochemistry, Winston-Salem, NC 27157, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cell Biochem Biophys,Cell biochemistry and biophysics,9701934,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography', 'Cytarabine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cytidine Monophosphate/*metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase gamma', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Replication', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Exodeoxyribonucleases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/enzymology', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases/chemistry']",1999/07/14 00:00,1999/07/14 00:01,['1999/07/14 00:00'],"['1999/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Biochem Biophys. 1999;30(3):331-52. doi: 10.1007/BF02738118.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase gamma)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exodeoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.11.2 (exodeoxyribonuclease III)', 'F469818O25 (Cytidine Monophosphate)']",,,['10.1007/BF02738118 [doi]'],,,"['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-75350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The copper(II) ions exhibit distorted square-planar geometry with both bidentate thiosemicarbazone ligands placed in a centrosymmetric way. Metal to ligand pi-backdonation is proposed to explain several structural and spectroscopic features in these complexes. The EPR spectra of compound 1 show an orthorhombic g tensor indicating the presence of weak magnetic exchange interactions. The reaction of compound 1 with glutathione causes the reduction of the metal ion and the substitution of the thiosemicarbazone ligand by the thiol ligand.

In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, mutated NP (dNP) accumulates in highly insoluble ubiquitinated and nonubiquitinated species in nuclear substructures known as promyelocytic leukemia oncogenic domains (PODs) and the microtubule organizing center (MTOC). Immunofluorescence revealed that dNP recruits proteasomes and a selective assortment of molecular chaperones to both locales, and that a similar (though less dramatic) effect is induced by proteasome inhibitors in the absence of dNP expression. Biochemical evidence is consistent with the idea that dNP is delivered to PODs/MTOC in the absence of proteasome inhibitors. Restoring proteasome activity while blocking protein synthesis results in disappearance of dNP from PODs and the MTOC and the generation of a major histocompatibility complex class I-bound peptide derived from dNP but not NP. These findings demonstrate that PODs and the MTOC serve as sites of proteasomal degradation of misfolded dNP and probably cellular proteins as well, and imply that antigenic peptides are generated at one or both of these sites.","['Anton, L C', 'Schubert, U', 'Bacik, I', 'Princiotta, M F', 'Wearsch, P A', 'Gibbs, J', 'Day, P M', 'Realini, C', 'Rechsteiner, M C', 'Bennink, J R', 'Yewdell, J W']","['Anton LC', 'Schubert U', 'Bacik I', 'Princiotta MF', 'Wearsch PA', 'Gibbs J', 'Day PM', 'Realini C', 'Rechsteiner MC', 'Bennink JR', 'Yewdell JW']","['Laboratory of Viral Diseases, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,,"['*Antigen Presentation/drug effects', 'Antigens, Viral/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Canavanine/pharmacology', 'Centrosome/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/chemistry/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', 'Molecular Chaperones/metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nucleocapsid Proteins', '*Nucleoproteins', 'Orthomyxoviridae', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Conformation/drug effects', 'Protein Folding', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism']",1999/07/14 00:00,1999/07/14 00:01,['1999/07/14 00:00'],"['1999/07/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/14 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1999 Jul 12;146(1):113-24. doi: 10.1083/jcb.146.1.113.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Nucleocapsid Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '3HZV514J4B (Canavanine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,['10.1083/jcb.146.1.113 [doi]'],PMC2199725,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The method compares the wire codes of case residences with the wire codes of specular residences constructed by switching the location of the case residence across the center of the street. The method was designed to discriminate between the magnetic field hypothesis, which postulates that childhood cancer is affected by magnetic fields and that wire codes are a proxy for magnetic fields, and the neighborhood hypothesis, which postulates that childhood cancer is affected by some characteristics of the neighborhood other than magnetic fields and that wire codes are a proxy for those characteristics. Although the results from the two applications of the method have limited precision, they support the results originally reported (odds ratios of around 2 for very high current configuration residences and childhood cancers) and do not support suggestions that the associations are due to confounding by socio-economic and neighborhood factors. The results leave open the question of whether or not control selection bias could have influenced the original associations, because there was no convincing evidence that the control-specular matrices were symmetric.","['Ebi, K L', 'Zaffanella, L E', 'Greenland, S']","['Ebi KL', 'Zaffanella LE', 'Greenland S']","['Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,,"['California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Colorado/epidemiology', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio']",1999/07/13 00:00,1999/07/13 00:01,['1999/07/13 00:00'],"['1999/07/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 1999 Jul;10(4):398-404. doi: 10.1097/00001648-199907000-00007.,,,,"['00001648-199907000-00007 [pii]', '10.1097/00001648-199907000-00007 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of the high physiological ratio of [O2]/[H2O2] (> or = 10(3)), we hypothesize that the Fenton reaction with pre-existing H2O2 is only a minor initiator of free radical oxidations and that the major initiators of biological free radical oxidations are the oxidizing species formed by the reaction of Fe2+ with dioxygen. We have employed electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping to examine this hypothesis. Free radical oxidation of: 1) chemical (ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide); 2) biochemical (glucose, glyceraldehyde); and 3) cellular (L1210 murine leukemia cells) targets were examined when subjected to an aerobic Fenton (Fe2+ + H2O2 + O2) or an aerobic (Fe2+ + O2) system. As anticipated, the Fenton reaction initiates radical formation in all the above targets. Without pre-existing H2O2, however, Fe2+ and O2 also induce substantial target radical formation. Under various experimental ratios of [O2]/[H2O2] (1-100 with [O2] approximately 250 microM), we compared the radical yield from the Fenton reaction vs. the radical yield from Fe2+ + O2 reactions. When [O2]/[H2O2] < 10, the Fenton reaction dominates target molecule radical formation; however, production of target-molecule radicals via the Fenton reaction is minor when [O2]/[H2O2] > or = 100. Interestingly, when L1210 cells are the oxidation targets, Fe2+ + O2 is observed to be responsible for formation of nearly all of the cell-derived radicals detected, no matter the ratio of [O2]/[H2O2]. Our data demonstrate that when [O2]/[H2O2] > or = 100, Fe2+ + O2 chemistry is an important route to initiation of detrimental biological free radical oxidations.","['Qian, S Y', 'Buettner, G R']","['Qian SY', 'Buettner GR']","['Free Radical Research Institute, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242-1101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,,"['Animals', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Free Radicals', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Iron/*chemistry', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/*chemistry', 'Spin Trapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/13 00:00,1999/07/13 00:01,['1999/07/13 00:00'],"['1999/07/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/13 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1999 Jun;26(11-12):1447-56. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(99)00002-7.,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,"['S0891-5849(99)00002-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(99)00002-7 [doi]']",,,['CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite broad genomic similarities, type I and type II viruses do not share concordant evolutionary histories. HTLV-I/STLV-I are united through distinct phylogeographic patterns, infection of 20 primate species, multiple episodes of interspecies transmission, and exhibition of a range in levels of genetic divergence. In contrast, type II viruses are isolated from only two species (Homo sapiens and Pan paniscus) and are paradoxically endemic to both Amerindian tribes of the New World and human Pygmy villagers in Africa. Furthermore, HTLV-II is spreading rapidly through new host populations of intravenous drug users. Despite such clearly disparate host populations, the resultant HTLV-II/STLV-II phylogeny exhibits little phylogeographic concordance and indicates low levels of transcontinental genetic differentiation. Together, these patterns generate a model of HTLV/STLV emergence marked by an ancient ancestry, differential rates of divergence, and continued global expansion.","['Slattery, J P', 'Franchini, G', 'Gessain, A']","['Slattery JP', 'Franchini G', 'Gessain A']","['Laboratory of Genomic Diversity, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Research Development Center Frederick, Maryland 21702 USA.

We have recently demonstrated that several structural cell types in human airways produce LIF in response to inflammatory stimuli and that LIF augments contractile responses to tachykinins in airway explants. Because the eosinophil is a major effector cell in asthma and often found adjacent to the nerves, we hypothesized that eosinophils produce LIF and that LIF primes and upregulates eosinophil recruitment and function, allowing bidirectional neuroimmune interactions and augmentation of eosinophil-mediated injury. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that human eosinophils synthesize and release LIF, to determine the effects of LIF on eosinophil functions (ie, chemotaxis, granule protein release, expression of the activation marker CD69, and apoptosis), and to compare serum LIF levels between atopic and nonatopic individuals. METHODS: Reverse-transcription PCR, ELISA, immunocytochemistry, chemotaxis assay, and flow cytometry were used. RESULTS: Peripheral blood eosinophils express LIF and messenger RNA for LIF and LIF receptor. Serum LIF levels were higher in atopic patients with mild asthma than in nonatopic normal donors. Eosinophils from nonatopic donors were stimulated by calcium ionophore to release small amounts of LIF (from almost none to 5.3 +/- 1.8 pg/10(6) cells). Eosinophils from atopic donors showed a 10-fold increase (from 45.1 +/- 38.7 pg/106 cells to 414.5 +/- 189.9 pg/10(6) cells). Preincubation of eosinophils with LIF increased eosinophil peroxidase release 4-fold. LIF was not chemotactic for eosinophils but augmented chemotaxis mediated by substance P by 82% and by platelet-activating factor by 31%. LIF did not effect eosinophil apoptosis but increased CD69 expression. CONCLUSION: LIF has proinflammatory roles in eosinophil-dependent airway disorders.","['Zheng, X', 'Knight, D A', 'Zhou, D', 'Weir, T', 'Peacock, C', 'Schellenberg, R R', 'Bai, T R']","['Zheng X', 'Knight DA', 'Zhou D', 'Weir T', 'Peacock C', 'Schellenberg RR', 'Bai TR']","[""University of British Columbia, Pulmonary Research Lab, St Paul's Hospital, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Allergy Clin Immunol,The Journal of allergy and clinical immunology,1275002,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asthma/blood', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Eosinophil Peroxidase', 'Eosinophils/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/blood', '*Interleukin-6', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Peroxidases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Allergy Clin Immunol. 1999 Jul;104(1):136-44. doi: 10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70125-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Eosinophil Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)']",,,"['S0091-6749(99)70125-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0091-6749(99)70125-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-10 has received growing attention as a potential tool in immunotherapy, due to its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Therefore, using two experimental models of long-term interactions between parasites and laboratory mice, we monitored some effects of the systemic delivery of an adenovirus (Ad) expressing EBV-derived IL-10 (vIL-10) designated Ad-vIL-10. We first monitored the vIL-10 serum level following intranasal, intraperitoneal, intramuscular and intravenous administration. The i. p. and i.v. delivery of Ad-vIL-10 allowed a high serum level of vIL-10 (= 100 ng/ml), the i.v. route leading to a more sustained expression (up to 3 weeks). As a first model of parasite/mouse interaction, Schistosoma mansoni/C57Bl/6 mouse was selected. Ad-vIL-10 delivery was performed 4 weeks after S. mansoni infection i.e. at the time of egg-laying, and several parameters were monitored: (i) number of adult worms in the mesenteric vein, (ii) number of eggs trapped in the liver and intestine, (iii) liver fibrosis, (iv) serum levels of egg-reactive antibody subclasses, (v) serum content of cytokines, and (vi) cytokine production in the supernatant of antigen-stimulated mesenteric lymph node cells. No apparent effect was observed, either on the different parasitological parameters or on fibrosis development at day 70 of infection. Surprisingly, a marked increase in both Th1 and Th2 type cytokines was observed in the sera of the Ad-vIL-10 injected animals, as well as in the supernatants of their Ag-stimulated mesenteric lymph node cells. Nevertheless, polarization of the humoral response towards a Th2 profile was demonstrated by an increase in the IgE level in the Ad-vIL-10-injected animals. As far as the second model is concerned, namely the Leishmania amazonensis /C57Bl6 mouse interactions, Ad-vIL-10 was delivered intravenously one day before subcutaneous injection of stationary promastigotes and footpad swelling was monitored over 110 days. Under these conditions, vIL-10 exhibited a biphasic effect, decreasing the lesion size at the early stages of infection, but leading to a more pronounced lesion size during the chronic phase.

Remarkably, expression of IgE is equivalent in normal and IL-4-deficient mice with MAIDS (Morawetz et al., J. Exp. Med. 184:1651-1661, 1996). To understand this anomaly, we studied mice with a null mutation of STAT6.

To target retroviruses to melanomas, we fused a single-chain variable fragment antibody (scFv) directed against the surface glycoprotein high-molecular-weight melanoma-associated antigen (HMW-MAA) to the amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelope. A proline-rich hinge and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) cleavage site linked the two proteins. The modified viruses bound only to HMW-MAA-expressing cells, as inclusion of the proline-rich hinge prevented viral binding to the amphotropic viral receptor. Following attachment to HMW-MAA, MMP cleavage of the envelope at the melanoma cell surface removed the scFv and proline-rich hinge, allowing infection. Complexing of targeted retroviruses with 2, 3-dioleoyloxy-N-[2(spermine-carboxamido)ethyl]N, N-dimethyl-1-propanaminium trifluoroacetate-dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine liposomes greatly increased their efficiency without affecting their target cell specificity. In a cell mixture, 40% of HMW-MAA-positive cells but less than 0.01% of HMW-MAA-negative cells were infected. This approach can therefore produce efficient, targeted retroviruses suitable for in vivo gene delivery and should allow specific gene delivery to many human cell types by inclusion of different scFv and protease combinations.","['Martin, F', 'Neil, S', 'Kupsch, J', 'Maurice, M', 'Cosset, F', 'Collins, M']","['Martin F', 'Neil S', 'Kupsch J', 'Maurice M', 'Cosset F', 'Collins M']","['Department of Immunology, Windeyer Institute for Medical Science, University College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Antibodies, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Melanoma/*therapy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteoglycans/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virion']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Aug;73(8):6923-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.8.6923-6929.1999.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (immunoglobulin Fv)', '0 (melanoma-associated proteoglycan antigen, human)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.8.6923-6929.1999 [doi]'],PMC112777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, we have previously shown that CasBrE-induced disease requires late, rather than early, virus replication events in microglial cells (W. P. Lynch et al., J. Virol. 70:8896-8907, 1996). Furthermore, neurodegeneration requires the presence of unique sequences within the viral env gene. Thus, the neurodegeneration-inducing events could result from microglial expression of retroviral envelope protein alone or from the interaction of envelope protein with other viral structural proteins in the virus assembly and maturation process. To distinguish between these possible mechanisms of disease induction, we engineered the engraftable neural stem cell line C17-2 into packaging/producer cells in order to deliver the neurovirulent CasBrE env gene to endogenous CNS cells. This strategy resulted in significant CasBrE env expression within CNS microglia without the appearance of replication competent virus. CasBrE envelope expression within microglia was accompanied by increased expression of activation markers F4/80 and Mac-1 (CD11b) but failed to induce spongiform neurodegenerative changes. These results suggest that envelope expression alone within microglia is not sufficient to induce neurodegeneration. Rather, microglia-mediated disease appears to require neurovirulent Env protein interaction with other viral proteins during assembly or maturation. More broadly, the results presented here prove the efficacy of a novel method by which neural stem cell biology may be harnessed for genetically manipulating the CNS, not only for studying neurodegeneration but also as a paradigm for the disseminated distribution of retroviral vector-transduced genes.","['Lynch, W P', 'Sharpe, A H', 'Snyder, E Y']","['Lynch WP', 'Sharpe AH', 'Snyder EY']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, Rootstown, Ohio 44272, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, env', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mice', '*Microglia/cytology', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', '*Stem Cells/cytology']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Aug;73(8):6841-51. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.8.6841-6851.1999.,,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.8.6841-6851.1999 [doi]'],PMC112769,,"['NS34247/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS37614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS31065/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 HD018655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 NS037614/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The major determinant for FeLV-C-induced anemia has been mapped to a small region of the surface envelope glycoprotein that is responsible for its receptor binding specificity. Thus, erythroblast destruction may directly or indirectly result from FeLV-C binding to its receptor. To address these issues, we functionally cloned a putative cell surface receptor for FeLV-C (FLVCR) by using a human T-lymphocyte cDNA library in a retroviral vector. Expression of the 2.0-kbp FLVCR cDNA in naturally resistant Swiss mouse fibroblasts and Chinese hamster ovary cells caused substantial susceptibility to FeLV-C but no change in susceptibilities to FeLV-B and other retroviruses. The predicted FLVCR protein contains 555 amino acids and 12 hydrophobic potential membrane-spanning sequences. Database searches indicated that FLVCR is a member of the major-facilitator superfamily of transporters and implied that it may transport an organic anion. RNA blot analyses showed that FLVCR mRNA is expressed in multiple hematopoietic lineages rather than specifically in erythroblasts. These results suggest that the targeted destruction of erythroblasts by FeLV-C may derive from their greater sensitivity to this virus rather than from a preferential susceptibility to infection.","['Tailor, C S', 'Willett, B J', 'Kabat, D']","['Tailor CS', 'Willett BJ', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201-3098, USA. tailorc@ohsu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*virology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/*classification/genetics', 'Cats', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/*classification/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Aug;73(8):6500-5. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.8.6500-6505.1999.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (feline leukemia virus receptor)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.8.6500-6505.1999 [doi]'],PMC112732,,['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/AF118637'],,,,,,,,,,,

Fv-2 resistance to Friend virus-induced erythroleukemia acts through nonimmunological mechanisms to prevent early virus spread, but it does not completely block infection. The current experiments were done to determine whether Fv-2 alone could provide resistance or whether immunological mechanisms were also required to bring infection under control. Fv-2-resistant mice that were CD4(+) T-cell deficient were able to restrict early virus replication and spread as well as normal Fv-2-resistant mice, but they could not maintain control and developed severe Friend virus-induced splenomegaly and erythroleukemia by 6 to 8 weeks postinfection. Mice deficient in CD8(+) T cells and, to a lesser extent, B cells were also susceptible to late Friend virus-induced disease.

In the present study, we established a seronegative HTLV-1 carrier state in rats inoculated with a newly established HTLV-1-infected rat T cell line, FPM1. FPM1 originated from rat thymocytes cocultured with a human HTLV-1 producer, MT-2 cells, and expressed rat CD4, CD5, CD25, and HTLV-1 Tax. However, FPM1 scarcely expressed other major HTLV-1 structural proteins and failed to induce typical antibody responses against HTLV-1 in inoculated rats. In contrast, control rats inoculated with MT-2 cells generated significant levels of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. HTLV-1 proviruses were detected in peripheral blood cells of syngeneic rats inoculated with FPM1 for more than 1 year. Analysis of the flanking region of HTLV-1 provirus integrated into host cells suggested that FPM1 cells remained in these animals over a relatively long period of time.

Our findings indicated that (i) HTLV-1-immortalized T cells which preferentially express HTLV-1 Tax persisted in vivo but failed to induce any diseases in immunocompetent syngeneic rats and that (ii) suboptimal levels of HTLV-1 for antibody responses allowed the establishment of persistent HTLV-1 infection.","['Koya, Y', 'Ohashi, T', 'Kato, H', 'Hanabuchi, S', 'Tsukahara, T', 'Takemura, F', 'Etoh, K', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Fujii, M', 'Kannagi, M']","['Koya Y', 'Ohashi T', 'Kato H', 'Hanabuchi S', 'Tsukahara T', 'Takemura F', 'Etoh K', 'Matsuoka M', 'Fujii M', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Medical Research Division, Tokyo 113, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', '*Carrier State', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, env/analysis', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', '*Gene Products, tax/biosynthesis', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/immunology/*virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses', 'RNA, Viral', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/analysis', 'Virus Integration', 'Virus Latency', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Aug;73(8):6436-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.8.6436-6443.1999.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (p19 protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.8.6436-6443.1999 [doi]'],PMC112724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the B cell neoplasm multiple myeloma, tumour cells have generally undergone class switching and often contain oncogenic sequences translocated into switch regions, presumably as a result of aberrant switch recombination. We have developed a method (LDV-PCR) which combines long distance PCR with one-sided vectorette PCR that is capable of detecting and isolating both normal and aberrant switch recombination breakpoints from multiple myeloma cell lines and primary multiple myeloma tumour material. Using LDV-PCR we have directly cloned the translocation breakpoints present in two multiple myeloma cell lines and isolated a normal productive switch recombination event from a primary tumour. Furthermore, we have isolated a novel translocation t(14;22)(q32;q12) from a primary tumour sample and have demonstrated that internal deletions within switch regions can occur in multiple myeloma cells. Compared to a Southern blotting approach, LDV-PCR is simpler and more rapid to perform, allows the simultaneous detection and isolation of recombination events, and can also be applied to amounts of DNA which are too low to permit the conventional cloning of recombination breakpoints.","['Proffitt, J', 'Fenton, J', 'Pratt, G', 'Yates, Z', 'Morgan, G']","['Proffitt J', 'Fenton J', 'Pratt G', 'Yates Z', 'Morgan G']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Switch Region/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1100-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401465.,,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401465 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to assess the specific variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) genes used by PEL and to define the heavy and light chain isotypes expressed by these lymphomas, immunoglobulin (Ig) genes from seven AIDS-related PEL were sequenced (three cell lines and four primary samples). Most of the samples (five out of seven) used lambda light chain genes; the majority of these (n = 4) belonged to the V lambda 3 family. Two cases expressed mu chains, whereas gamma chains were found in two cases. In all cases, significant deviations from the presumed germline counterpart were found in both the expressed VH and VL genes. Statistical evidence for antigen selection was evident in four out of seven samples studied. Evidence for selection was more frequent in the light chain genes than in the heavy chain genes.

As the AFT024 cell line supports LTC-IC cultured in contact conditions better than M2-10B4 feeders, we evaluated LTC-IC support in non-contact conditions above AFT024 feeders. We show that only 15% of LTC-IC were maintained for 5 weeks in AFT024 non-contact cultures (n=6, P<0.05). As AFT024-conditioned media added to M2-10B4 non-contact cultures did not inhibit LTC-IC maintenance, AFT024 cells do not secrete factors that inhibit LTC-IC growth. We next characterized heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HS-GAGs) and cytokines produced by AFT024 cells, which are both required for LTC-IC maintenance in M2-10B4 non-contact cultures. The size and extent of O-sulfation of HS-GAGs in AFT024 and M2-10B4 conditioned medium were similar, indicating that absence of hematopoietic specific HS-GAGs is not responsible for the lack of hematopoietic in AFT024 non-contact cultures. Levels of 13 different cytokines secreted in AFT024- and M2-10B4-conditioned medium were similar. However, addition of human SCF, G-CSF, GM-CSF, LIF, MIP-1alpha and IL-6 in concentrations found in human marrow stroma-conditioned medium to AFT024 non-contact cultures increased LTC-IC-maintenance to 72% at 5 weeks. These cytokines improved LTC-IC maintenance in part through interaction with the progenitors and in part, through interaction with the AFT024 feeder. Thus, although LTC-IC maintenance is poor in AFT024 non-contact cultures, addition of human cytokines enhances LTC-IC maintenance in part through indirect effects on the AFT024 feeder. Characterization of known or novel growth factors secreted by AFT024 cells before and after cytokine stimulation may lead to the identification of cytokines that support growth of human hematopoietic stem cells.","['Punzel, M', 'Gupta, P', 'Roodell, M', 'Mortari, F', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Punzel M', 'Gupta P', 'Roodell M', 'Mortari F', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Biology Program University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Biological Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver/*drug effects/embryology/metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Time Factors']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1079-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401432.,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401432 [doi]'],,,"['P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These duplications have been reported to lead to autophosphorylation of the receptor. In this study we investigated the effect of such mutations in the Flt3 gene on the in vitro proliferation of human acute myeloid leukemia cells. The mutations were detected in 10 out of 59 AML bone marrow samples analyzed and were not restricted to a specific FAB class or cytogenetic aberration. PCR analysis of those samples showed all mutations to be present in exon 11 of the gene. Whilst samples without a mutation of the Flt3 gene showed an increased cell production in response to either IL-3 and G-CSF or IL-6, SCF, TPO and Flt3L in long-term stroma supported cultures, mutant samples failed to do so. As we could not find a relationship between the absence of a response and either FAB class or cytogenetic aberrations, we interpret these results as an indication that the internal tandem duplications in the Flt3 gene are the prime cause of this unresponsiveness. Although our study does not explain the mechanism by which these mutations cause this unresponsiveness it does suggest that AML cells need a wild-type Flt3 for optimal in vitro proliferation.","['Rombouts, W J', 'Broyl, A', 'Martens, A C', 'Slater, R', 'Ploemacher, R E']","['Rombouts WJ', 'Broyl A', 'Martens AC', 'Slater R', 'Ploemacher RE']","['Dept of Haematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*pathology', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1071-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401446.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401446 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that in APL patients receiving ATRA or As2O3 treatment, the improvement in hypercoagulobility and hyperfibrinolysis paralleled the correction of plasma fibrinogen level and amelioration of bleeding symptoms. Notably, clinical improvement was also correlated to ATRA/As2O3-induced rapid decrease of membrane procoagulant activity (PCA) and TF contents of APL blasts. Consistent with the in vivo findings, the membrane PCA, TF antigen and its mRNA level within NB4 cells were rapidly down-regulated by 1 microM ATRA or As2O3, while 0.2 microg/ml DNR increased these TF parameters prior to its effect upon apoptosis induction. The down-regulation of TF mRNA by ATRA was partially de novo protein synthesis-dependent and at least partially attributed to a mechanism of destabilizing TF mRNA. On the other hand, in addition to its modulation on mRNA, As2O3 could also induce an accelerated TF protein turnover. These distinct effects were corroborated with the properties of these agents in causing the degradation of PML-RARalpha protein. All three therapeutic agents, however, enhanced the potential of NB4 cells to stimulate the expression of TF and PCA in endothelium.

This effect was both dose-and time-dependent with nuclear fragmentation detectable by 8 h. Caspases have been implicated in pro-apoptotic events. By utilizing synthetic fluorochrome-linked substrates of the caspases, we observed that a caspase-3-like enzyme had dramatically increased activity (3340 130% with respect to basal levels) in response to daunorubicin treatment. Furthermore, by using an inhibitor to caspase-3, Ac-DEVD-CHO, we have shown that activation of a caspase-3-like enzyme appears to be necessary for nuclear fragmentation and apoptotic body formation, but is not required for chromatin condensation. In contrast, a general caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-fmk, inhibited all apoptotic parameters measured. Ceramide has been implicated in daunorubicin-induced apoptosis in human myeloid leukemia cells. However, in Jurkat cells, caspase activation does not appear to be a consequence of ceramide generation since, although ceramide levels were elevated through the action of ceramide synthase in response to daunorubicin treatment, this occurred with slower kinetics than either nuclear fragmentation or caspase activation. In contrast, caspase inhibitors abrogated ceramide elevation induced by DNR treatment, suggesting that ceramide synthase may be a downstream target for caspase action. Therefore, daunorubicin-induced apoptosis does not appear to be mediated by ceramide in the lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Jurkat E6.1. Instead, caspase 3 activity appears to be necessary, but not sufficient for this process.","['Turnbull, K J', 'Brown, B L', 'Dobson, P R']","['Turnbull KJ', 'Brown BL', 'Dobson PR']","['Division of Oncology and Cellular Pathology, University of Sheffield Medical School, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases/drug effects']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1056-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401438.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.1.- (dihydroceramide desaturase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401438 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine exerted dose-dependent effects on U937 cell viability and growth which were associated with both induction of apoptosis, as well as cellular maturation. Incubation of cells with bryostatin 1 (10 nM; 24 h) after, but not before a 6-h exposure to 10 microM fludarabine resulted in a modest but significant increase in apoptosis, and was associated with greater than a 1 log reduction in clonogenicity. Subsequent exposure to bryostatin 1 also increased the percentage of fludarabine-treated cells displaying differentiation-related features (eg plastic adherence, CD11b positivity) compared to cells exposed to fludarabine alone. Bryostatin 1 did not increase the retention of the active fludarabine metabolite, F-ara-ATP, nor did it increase 3H-F-ara-A incorporation into DNA. Despite its capacity to trigger cellular maturation, fludarabine exposure (either with or without bryostatin 1) failed to induce the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKls) p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1. Nevertheless, dysregulation of p21 (resulting from stable transfection of cells with a p2lWAF1/CIP1 antisense construct) reduced fludarabine-mediated differentiation, while inducing a corresponding increase in apoptosis. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 partially protected cells from fludarabine-related apoptosis, an effect that was overcome, in part, by subsequent exposure of cells to bryostatin 1. Interestingly, Bcl-2-overexpressing cells were as or in some cases, more susceptible to differentiation induction by fludarabine (+/- bryostatin 1) than their empty vector-containing counterparts. Collectively, these results indicate that the antiproliferative effects of fludarabine toward U937 leukemic cells involve both induction of apoptosis and cellular maturation, and that each of these processes may be enhanced by bryostatin 1.","['Vrana, J A', 'Wang, Z', 'Rao, A S', 'Tang, L', 'Chen, J H', 'Kramer, L B', 'Grant, S']","['Vrana JA', 'Wang Z', 'Rao AS', 'Tang L', 'Chen JH', 'Kramer LB', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Macrolides', 'U937 Cells', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1046-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401454.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401454 [doi]'],,,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth factor deprivation of the erythroleukemic cell line TF-1 led to apoptosis which was associated with an enhanced activity of JNK and p38 and immediate dephosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs). Enhanced activity of p38 and JNK was not only observed during apoptosis but also in TF-1 cells stimulated with IL-1. IL-1 rescued TF-1 cells from apoptosis. In this case, the upregulation of p38 and JNK was associated with an enhanced activity of ERK. By using SB203580, a specific inhibitor of the p38 signaling pathway, it was demonstrated that p38 plays a pivotal role in the apoptotic process. SB203580 repressed the apoptotic process to a large extent. In contrast, PD98059, a specific inhibitor of the ERK pathway, counteracted the suppressive effects of SB203580 and IL-1 on the apoptotic process indicating that the protective effect of SB203580 and IL-1 might be the result of a shift in the balance between the ERK1/2 and p38/JNK route. This was also supported by experiments with TF-1 cells overexpressing the Shc protein that demonstrated a significantly lower percentage of apoptotic cells, which coincided with higher ERK activity. Finally, the IL-1 and SB203580-mediated effects were associated with an enhanced nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding activity, which could also be blocked by PD98059. These data demonstrate a dual function of the p38 pathway whereby other factors, such as ERK kinases, AP-1 and NF-kappaB, might determine the final cellular response.","['Birkenkamp, K U', 'Dokter, W H', 'Esselink, M T', 'Jonk, L J', 'Kruijer, W', 'Vellenga, E']","['Birkenkamp KU', 'Dokter WH', 'Esselink MT', 'Jonk LJ', 'Kruijer W', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Growth Substances/deficiency', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/pathology', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1037-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401447.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401447 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that microtubule-active drugs do not activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in leukemia cells. PD98059, a MEK inhibitor, and SB202190, a p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, do not abrogate Bcl-2 phosphorylation nor apoptosis. Simultaneously with PARP cleavage, paclitaxel induces cleavage of Bcl-2 protein yielding a potentially pro-apoptotic 22 kDa product. In comparison, the stimulation of Raf-1 by phorbol ester (TPA) activates the MAPK pathway, causes MAPK-dependent p21WAF1/CIP1 induction, Rb dephosphorylation and growth arrest without Bcl-2 phosphorylation or apoptosis. Like TPA, cAMP induces p21WAF1/CIP1 but does not cause Bcl-2 phosphorylation. MEKK1 and Ras, upstream activators of JNK and ERK MAPK, also fail to induce Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation. Although Lck tyrosine kinase has been recently implicated in Raf-1 activation during mitotic arrest, microtubule-active drugs induce Raf-1/Bcl-2 hyperphosphorylation and apoptosis in a Lck-deficient Jurkat cells. Therefore, microtubule-active drugs induce apoptosis which is associated with Raf-1 and Bcl-2 phosphorylation and Bcl-2 cleavage but is independent of the MAPK pathway. In contrast, TPA-activated MAPK pathway causes p21WAF1/CIP1-dependent growth arrest without apoptosis.","['Blagosklonny, M V', 'Chuman, Y', 'Bergan, R C', 'Fojo, T']","['Blagosklonny MV', 'Chuman Y', 'Bergan RC', 'Fojo T']","['Medicine Branch, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/therapeutic use', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1028-36. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401449.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401449 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic colony formation was found in approximately 70 to 80% of the patients in the presence of at least one of the above CSFs. Although IL-11 alone did not support L-CFU, the growth of these progenitors in the presence of other cytokines was enhanced by IL-11 in 16 out of 33 patients and it showed a synergistic action with G-CSF in 12 of them. This synergistic action occurred in seven out of nine M5 patients (French-American-British (FAB) classification). A single cell clone-sorting experiment clearly demonstrated that this synergistic effect was operative at the single progenitor cell level. The number of leukemic cells proliferating in the presence of G-CSF+IL-11 was significantly higher than in the presence of G-CSF alone, suggesting that IL-11 recruited dormant leukemic progenitors into the cell cycle. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that all types of AML blast cells (M0 approximately M6) ubiquitously expressed gp130, although the level of expression was significantly higher in M5 cells. In contrast, expression of the IL-11 receptor alpha chain (IL-11Ralpha) varied between FAB types. Blast cells obtained from M1, M3 and M5 patients showed higher levels of expression, with M5 cells showing the strongest expression. Interestingly, the leukemic progenitor cells for which proliferation was synergistically enhanced by IL-11 had significantly higher expression of both IL-11Ralpha and gp130. These results suggest that administration of IL-11 in vivo may stimulate the proliferation of leukemic progenitor cells, particularly M5 cells, in the presence of G-CSF, and that the responsiveness of L-CFU to IL-11 may be predicted by a simple receptor assay.","['Kimura, T', 'Sakabe, H', 'Minamiguchi, H', 'Fujiki, H', 'Abe, T', 'Kaneko, H', 'Yokota, S', 'Nakagawa, H', 'Fujii, H', 'Tamaki, H', 'Ogawa, H', 'Sugiyama, H', 'Sonoda, Y']","['Kimura T', 'Sakabe H', 'Minamiguchi H', 'Fujiki H', 'Abe T', 'Kaneko H', 'Yokota S', 'Nakagawa H', 'Fujii H', 'Tamaki H', 'Ogawa H', 'Sugiyama H', 'Sonoda Y']","['Department of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*chemistry', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):1018-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401433.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401433 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eligibility criteria included an Hb level of less than 10.5 g/dl for newly diagnosed patients, or symptomatic anemia. GM-CSF was given at a dose of 3 microg/kg s.c. on days 1-2, rhEpo at a dose of 60 U/kg s.c. on days 3-5. No treatment was given on days 6-7. Patients were followed-up with full blood count on a weekly basis. The treatment was repeated for a total of 6 weeks. At that time, if a rise in Hb above 1.5 g/dl had not been achieved, the dose of rhEpo increased to 120 U/kg. Post-treatment evaluation was performed at the completion of 12 weeks. Erythroid response was defined as good (GR), if an increase in untransfused Hb values above 2 g/dl or a 100% decrease in red blood cell transfusion requirements, over the treatment period was observed, while an increase in untransfused Hb values 1-2 g/dl or a >50% decrease in transfusion requirements, were considered as partial response. Responders continued to receive the same treatment until disease progression. Nineteen patients (13 male and six female) with a median age of 69 years were enrolled in the study. The FAB subtypes were: RA one case, RAS eight cases and RAEB 10 cases. Ten of 19 patients (52.6%) responded to the treatment: 7/19 (36.8%) achieved a GR and 3/19 (15.8%) a PR. Six of eight (75%) patients with RAS, one case with RA and 3/10 (30%) of cases with RAEB responded to treatment. Pretreatment serum epo levels were generally low (less than 200 Mu/ml) in responding patients. At the completion of the initial 12 weeks, 8/12 responding patients (5 RAS, 2 RAEB and 1 RA) continued to receive the same treatment. All responding patients with RAS continued to show an erythroid response in a time period from 3 to 24 months, whilst one patient with RA and two with RAEB did not have a continuing response at 2, 4 and 12 months, respectively.

From a clinical point of view, BCR-ABL mRNA detection has become the basis for the study of minimal residual disease in CML, particularly when a complete cytogenetic remission is achieved after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We have recently demonstrated that it is possible to mobilize normal peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) in higher rates if this procedure is performed during the early chronic phase. In an attempt to monitor the leukemic cell content of PBPC collections, we used quantitative-competitive RT-PCR (QC-RT-PCR). Thirty consecutive Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome positive patients were enrolled in this study. After chemotherapy and G-CSF, 14 patients achieved 100% Ph-negative metaphases, nine patients had < or =34% and seven patients >34% leukemic metaphases. A total of 116 collection samples were studied. For each sample, BCR-ABL transcript numbers and BCR-ABL/ABL ratio were evaluated. A highly significant correlation between Ph-positive metaphases and BCR-ABL transcript numbers (r = 0.84, P < 0.0001) or BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001) was found. For patients that underwent the procedure in early chronic phase, Ph-negative collections showed different levels of BCR-ABL expression. BCR-ABL transcript numbers varied from a median of 100/microg RNA in the first and second leukaphereses, to 500/microg RNA in the third and fourth leukaphereses, and 1500/microg RNA in the fifth leukapheresis (P = 0.002). BCR-ABL/ABL ratio values showed similar kinetics. We have also demonstrated that there is a correlation between low values in BCR-ABL/ABL ratio (< or =0.01) in the reinfused PBPC and the achievement of cytogenetic remission after autografting (chi2 test, P = 0.01). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that QC-RT-PCR for BCR-ABL is a reliable and helpful method for monitoring residual leukemic load in mobilized PBPC, particularly in Ph-negative collections. Moreover, QC-RT-PCR allows selection of the best available collections for reinfusion into patients after myeloablative therapy.","['Corsetti, M T', 'Lerma, E', 'Dejana, A', 'Basta, P', 'Ferrara, R', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Vassallo, F', 'Abate, M', 'Piaggio, G', 'Parodi, C', 'Sessarego, M', 'Li Pira, G', 'Manca, F', 'Carella, A M']","['Corsetti MT', 'Lerma E', 'Dejana A', 'Basta P', 'Ferrara R', 'Benvenuto F', 'Vassallo F', 'Abate M', 'Piaggio G', 'Parodi C', 'Sessarego M', 'Li Pira G', 'Manca F', 'Carella AM']","['NOA Hematology and AMBT Unit, DEMA, San Martino Hospital, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):999-1008. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401457.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401457 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction studies on pooled LTC cells or secondary colonies were also negative. By contrast, LTC cells or secondary colonies obtained from CML CD34+ cells without culture in the presence of 5-FU were always positive for BCR/ABL rearrangement. Finally, 5-FU selected cells were able to engraft NOD/SCID mouse, as human cells were detected in blood and marrow 10 weeks post transplantation, which were BCR/ABL negative by RT-PCR. This method of culture makes it possible to select constantly BCR/ABL-negative cells with capacities of development in LTC assay and of NOD/SCID mouse engraftment.","['Guyotat, D', 'Wahbi, K', 'Viallet, A', 'Piselli, S', 'Campos, L']","['Guyotat D', 'Wahbi K', 'Viallet A', 'Piselli S', 'Campos L']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Faculte de Medecine, St Etienne, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Separation', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interleukin-3/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Stem Cell Factor/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jul;13(7):991-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401456.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401456 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus far, p73 has not been investigated in hematopoietic malignancies. We used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to examine 60 de novo acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients for p73 mutations in exons 4, 6 and 7, which are homologous to the most frequently mutated exons in p53. Mutations were not found, but we did identify polymorphisms in exons 4 and 7. We also examined p73 RNA expression in 15 AML samples, eight cell lines, and eight normal bone marrows using the reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction assay. All 31 RNA samples had p73 expression. Fourteen RNA samples were informative for allelic expression, being heterozygous for a polymorphism in codon 173 of exon 4. The two normal bone marrows and the K562 cell line had evidence of biallelic expression while six of 10 AML patients and the Kasumi (AML) cell line had monoallelic expression. These data suggest that functional p73 mutations in exons 4, 6 and 7 do not occur in most de novo AML patients. In addition, biallelic expression of p73 occurs in normal bone marrows, some AML samples, and specific cell lines.

A PCR-MIMIC strategy was employed to construct PCR-fragments for a competitive and quantitative mdr1 reverse transcription-PCR-assay. Using K562 cells, which had been selected for drug resistance to the epipodophyllotoxin VP16, a stepwise increase of mdr1 levels depending on the concentration of VP16 was shown with the MIMIC technique. Comparison of mdr1 levels in drug selected K562 cells with the corresponding levels for P-gp and functional data indicated a mRNA threshold that has to be exceeded for the full expression of the MDR-phenotype. Subsequently mdr1 levels of 34 samples of de novo acute myeloid leukemia were determined with the PCR-MIMIC strategy. Ten patient samples could be identified with elevated mdr1 levels which were substantially lower than the levels observed in the MDR-cell line K 562 0.7 microM VP16. Outcome analysis revealed that eight of the ten patients had an unfavourable prognosis and did not achieve CR after induction chemotherapy. Coexpression of mdr1 and CD 34 was not associated with CR in all examined cases. Moreover all these patients had unfavourable cytogenetic aberrations.

Since the transforming activity of the GAS6 receptor (AXL/UFO) was documented, GAS6 might stimulate rather than inhibit proliferation. In order to detect aberrant expression of GAS6 we examined gene expression in 46 cell lines of precursor B-, B- and T-cell origin as well as from Hodgkin's disease and cell lines established from various myeloproliferative disorders. In our study, the expression of GAS6 reveals a constitutive transcriptional activation in 8/46 cases of proliferating cell lines. The GAS6 mRNA expression could be shown in 4/22 cell lines of the lymphoid arm and in 4/17 of the myeloid lineages of the hematopoietic system. No transcripts could be detected in the CD30+ Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphomas (0/7). Interestingly, the steady state mRNA levels showed neglectable GAS6 expression in precursor B and B-cell lines (1/9), but could be detected in terminally differentiated plasma cell lines (4/4). The predominantly GAS6-expressing cell lines of non-lymphoid origin have been established from acute myeloid leukemias of the M4 subtype (3/4). In order to demonstrate evidence for an autocrine regulation of growth in permanent hematopoietic cell lines, we measured the GAS6 expression in cell lines with strong positivity for the AXL/UFO receptor mRNA. Constitutive basal levels of GAS6 mRNA and protein expression could be only detected in 3/23 AXL/UFO expressing cell lines. Although a general mechanism seems most unlikely, further studies are necessary to demonstrate the involvement of GAS6 in single cases of disordered growth or chemotaxis/adhesion of leukemia and lymphomas.","['Dirks, W', 'Rome, D', 'Ringel, F', 'Jager, K', 'MacLeod, R A', 'Drexler, H G']","['Dirks W', 'Rome D', 'Ringel F', 'Jager K', 'MacLeod RA', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig. wdi@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Jul;23(7):643-51. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00075-2.,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (growth arrest-specific protein 6)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)']",,,"['S0145-2126(99)00075-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00075-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further sequence analysis demonstrated that the mutated band was a point mutation of G to A in exon 2 codon 140 (GCG-->ACG) causing an amino acid substitution of alanine to threonine demonstrating this patient either carried an mutated gene in one allele as a polymorphism (heterozygous carrier of a mutant p16 gene) or carried a mutant p16 gene clone.

The amount of viral DNA was determined using externally amplified known amounts of the plasmid DNA containing the viral target sequences. First, we determined a viral burden in peripheral blood leukocytes obtained from 23 healthy volunteers and four specimens of lymph nodes with reactive hyperplasia. Using 1 microg of DNA, the prevalence of HHV-6 was 43.4% (10/23), ranging from 0 to 100 HHV-6 genomes in blood obtained from healthy volunteers. The amounts of HHV-6 genomes were < 10 in four non-neoplastic lymph node specimens. We next examined the amount of viral DNA in 21 blood specimens and 19 lymph node specimens obtained from patients with lymphoproliferative diseases (LPD) at the time of diagnosis. The number of HHV-6 genomes in most of the B-cell lymphoma was < 5 in both blood and lymph node specimens, however, two lymph node specimens obtained from immunoblastic lymphadenopathy (IBL) and T-cell lymphoma had very high levels of HHV-6 viral DNA (3705 and 810, respectively). We also found that HHV-6 genomes in peripheral blood were more than 1000 in two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. For all LPD patients combined, there were significantly higher levels of viral DNA (200.6 +/- 654.8 HHV-6 genomes per 1 microg purified DNA) compared to those in healthy volunteers (10.0 +/- 21.0 HHV-6 genomes per 1 microg purified DNA) (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that a high level of HHV-6 viral DNA is occasionally associated with LPD patients. Although it is still uncertain whether HHV-6 is related to the pathogenesis in LPD or not, our results suggest that measurement of HHV-6 genomes using PCR-ELISA may be useful not only to understand the mechanism of HHV-6 infection in hemopoietic neoplasia but also to manage the care of immnocompromised patients such as bone marrow transplant patients.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Abe, K', 'Ojima, T', 'Wang, P', 'Zhou, C F', 'Suzuki, A', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Yamamoto, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Abe K', 'Ojima T', 'Wang P', 'Zhou CF', 'Suzuki A', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan. junko@hh.iij4u.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesviridae Infections/complications/epidemiology/*virology', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/complications/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prevalence']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Jul;23(7):625-30. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00079-x.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,"['S014521269900079X [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(99)00079-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we as well as others have drawn attention to some neoplasms of conceivable NK cell precursor origin that might represent two distinct entities, i.e. myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia and blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. Both of these diseases were characterized by remarkable extramedullary involvement and lymphoblastoid morphology, although the sites of involvement differed. Myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia exhibited more frequent involvement of bone marrow (BM) and lymph nodes, whereas blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia affected extranodal sites, mainly the skin/subcutis. Tumor cells of these two diseases shared the CD16-, CD56+ and CD57- phenotype, but differed in other phenotypic profiles. Indeed, myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia was immunophenotypically characterized by the expression of CD34 and blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia by that of CD4. On the theoretical level in the NK cell differentiation pathway, myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia might be derived from a myeloid antigen-positive precursor preceding a NK cell committed precursor as a conceivable counterpart of blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. Most cases with either disease lacked cytotoxic activities or molecules, a finding which seems to support their precursor origin. Notably, Epstein Barr virus (EBV) was negative in all cases, which contrasted with its high level associated with mature NK cell malignancies. Chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia was generally effective for myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia, while the regimen for lymphoid malignancy was effective for blastic NK cell lymphoma/leukemia. These data suggests that each of these two diseases constitutes a distinct entity, which is also different from mature NK cell malignancies.","['Suzuki, R', 'Nakamura, S']","['Suzuki R', 'Nakamura S']","['Laboratory of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/diagnosis/epidemiology/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 Jul;23(7):615-24. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00194-5.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,"['Leuk Res. 1999 Jul;23(7):675-6.

Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study.,1485-91,"BACKGROUND: To determine whether human T-lymphotropic virus type II (HTLV-II) infection is associated with an increased incidence of bacterial infections, we prospectively observed cohorts of HTLV-I- and HTLV-II-infected and seronegative subjects in 5 US cities. METHODS: Of 1340 present and former blood donors examined at enrollment, 1213 (90.5%) were re-examined after approximately 2 years, including 136 HTLV-I- and 337 HTLV-II-seropositive subjects and 740 demographically stratified HTLV-seronegative subjects. All subjects were seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus. Odds ratios (ORs) for incident disease outcomes were adjusted for covariates, including age, sex, race or ethnicity, education, and, if significantly associated with the outcome, blood center, donation type, income, smoking, alcohol intake, and injected drug use. RESULTS: Compared with seronegative status, HTLV-II infection was associated with an increased incidence of bronchitis (OR, 1.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.75), bladder and/or kidney infection (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.26-2.98), oral herpes infection (OR, 9.54; 95% CI, 3.33-27.32), and a borderline increased incidence of pneumonia (OR, 2.09; 95% CI, 0.92-4.76); HTLV-I infection was associated with an increased incidence of bladder and/or kidney infection (OR, 2.79; 95% CI, 1.63-4.79). One incident case of HTLV-I-positive adult T-cell leukemia was observed (incidence, 348 per 100,000 HTLV-I person-years), and 1 case of HTLV-II-positive tropical spastic paraparesis-HTLV-associated myelopathy was diagnosed (incidence, 140 per 100,000 HTLV-II person-years).

Both ecotropic (mouse tropic) and recombinant retroviruses, including the polytropic mink cytopathic focus-inducing type, have been studied for disease pathogenesis and as targets for humoral and cellular immunity, particularly cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses. For AKR/Gross murine leukemia viruses (MuLV) we have defined an immunodominant CTL epitope in the p 15E transmembrane anchor envelope protein and three minor/subdominant epitopes. Evidence is presented for retroviral escape from CTL by selection following genetic recombination and point mutation both within and outside CTL epitope sequences, and via endogenous retrovirus-infected cell downregulation of the generation of anti-AKR/Gross MuLV CTL. As demonstrated in vivo in naturally occurring non-responder strains by adoptive transfer, and in vitro by cell-mixing experiments, a central non-responsiveness mechanism appears to be peripheral inhibition mediated by infected cells expressing MHC-presented viral peptides. Such inhibition requires Fas expression by antiviral T cells; occurs upon TCR-mediated recognition of virus-infected, Fas ligand-expressing ""veto"" cells; and apparently leads to an antigen-specific form of activation-induced cell death of T cells. In the LP-BM5 MuLV isolate that causes murine AIDS (MAIDS) retroviral variation also leads to CTL escape--the BM5-helper virus has altered forms of the immunodominant and two minor/subdominant epitopes. In contrast, a novel immunodominant CTL epitope is recognized by MAIDS resistant, but not MAIDS-susceptible, strains. This epitope is uniquely encoded in an alternative translational reading frame of the viral gag gene. It also appears that the LP-BM5 MuLV have co-opted the cells of the immune system for retroviral pathogenesis--CD40/CD40L (CD154) interactions are required both for the initiation and progression of MAIDS.","['Green, W R']",['Green WR'],"['Department of Microbiology, Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire 03756, USA. william.r.green@dartmouth.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,,"['Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1999/07/10 00:00,1999/07/10 00:01,['1999/07/10 00:00'],"['1999/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 1999 Apr;168:271-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065x.1999.tb01298.x.,,,,['10.1111/j.1600-065x.1999.tb01298.x [doi]'],,,"['CA36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50157/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",93,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Rate ratios (RR) were used to compare directly adjusted mortality rates between applicators and a comparison cohort of 9,969 flight instructors. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated for comparisons with the U.S. white male population. RESULTS: Among applicator pilots, there were 1,441 deaths, and among instructors, 1,045. In both groups, aircraft accidents were the major cause of death (446 applicators; 234 instructors). Compared with flight instructors, aerial applicator pilots were at significantly elevated risk for all causes of death (risk ratio = 1.34) and for malignant neoplasms (1.18), non-motor vehicle accidents (1.71), motor vehicle accidents (1.69), and stroke (1.91). Pancreatic cancer (2.71) and leukemia (3.35) were significantly elevated. Applicators were at lower risk of colon cancer (0.51) and multiple myeloma (0.23) mortality. Based on U.S. rates, the SMR for all causes of death among applicators was 111 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 105-117) and among instructors, 81 (CI = 76-85). CONCLUSIONS: Aircraft accidents were a major cause of mortality in both applicator and flight instructor cohorts.

Two different segments, 7q22 and 7q32-q33, have been implicated as critical regions of gene loss associated with these disorders. In the present study, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to characterize the 7q22 breakpoint of an apparently balanced t(7;7)(p13;q22) in an acute myeloid leukemia patient. FISH analysis on bone marrow metaphases from this patient revealed that the sequence corresponding to a series of three ordered cosmids from 7q22 was deleted from one of the der(7) chromosomes. These cosmids contain the human homologue of the Drosophila homeobox gene cut (CUTL1) and span a region of approximately 150 kb. Although the proximal boundary of the deleted segment could not be exactly defined, we estimate the size of this deletion to be approximately 500 kb. Subsequently, we carried out FISH studies using the CUTL1 cosmids on a further 16 patients with deletions of 7q and myeloid disorders. The sequence corresponding to at least two of the cosmids was deleted from the del(7q) in 11 out of 14 cases with a proximal breakpoint within 7q22.

The myeloid-associated antigen CD33 and the stem cell factor receptor (CD117, c-kit) was expressed by 82.3% and 73.5% on CP-CML patients and by 57% and 57.5% on healthy donors, respectively (P < 0.005). CD34+/CD19+ or CD34+/CD10+ B-lymphoid cell population represented 9. 1% and 10.7% of the CD34+ cells in CML whereas in normal controls this subpopulation was expressed by 27.9% and 30.4% of the CD34+ cells, respectively (P< 0.005). The T-lineage associated markers (CD7 and CD2) were detected on a minor population of CD34+ BM cells of healthy controls (mean, 3.6% and 4.6%, respectively). The CD2 positive cells represented 1.5% of the CD34+ cells in CML patients. CP-CML patients co-expressed the CD7 antigen on a mean of 32.6% of the CD34+ BM cells. Moreover, 93% of this CD34/CD7 double positive subpopulation co-expressed CD33 antigen in CML patients. Co-expression of CD7 on CD34+ cells was induced to decrease significantly after short-term in vitro culture with the differentiation-inducing agent phorbol ester (PMA) and with a combination of cytokines (stem-cell factor, interleukin-3 and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor). In conclusion, a high co-expression of CD7 antigen is demonstrated on CD34+ cells of chronic phase-chronic myeloid leukaemia patients. The loss of CD7 marker following incubation with PMA and cytokines suggests that this antigen is expressed transiently in early myeloid leukaemic CML haemopoiesis.","['Martin-Henao, G A', 'Quiroga, R', 'Sureda, A', 'Garcia, J']","['Martin-Henao GA', 'Quiroga R', 'Sureda A', 'Garcia J']","['Department of Cryobiology and Cell Therapy, Cancer Research Institute, Hospital Duran i Reynals, Barcelona, Spain. gmartinh@iro.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Blast Crisis', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/analysis', 'Reference Values', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Jul;61(3):178-86. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199907)61:3<178::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199907)61:3<178::AID-AJH4>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199907)61:3<178::aid-ajh4>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We expressed and purified the recombinant protein (rIL6-alt) resulting from this alternatively spliced mRNA and now report the initial characterization of its biologic activities with comparison to full length IL6 (rIL6-full). rIL6-alt was found to have 10(4) to 10(5) fold less activity in proliferation assays with 7TD1 murine plasmacytoma cells and did not competitively inhibit the stimulatory activity of rIL6-full. In addition, like rIL6-full, rIL6-alt had antiproliferative activity toward M1 murine myeloblast cells and was 10-200-fold less active than rIL6-full. In contrast, in assays with human HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, rIL6-alt had greater antiproliferative activity than rIL6-full and more strongly upregulated phagocytosis as well as surface expression of the differentiation antigen CD11b. rIL6-full and rIL6-alt upregulated the level of lysozyme mRNA in HL60 cells approximately equally. These findings suggest that IL6-alt, which lacks amino acid residues encoded by the second exon of the gene, is not a natural inhibitor of IL6-full but may be relatively tissue specific and may play a role in modulation of hematopoietic cell growth and differentiation.","['Kestler, D P', 'Goldstein, K M', 'Agarwal, S', 'Fuhr, J E', 'Andrews, R', 'Hall, R E']","['Kestler DP', 'Goldstein KM', 'Agarwal S', 'Fuhr JE', 'Andrews R', 'Hall RE']","['Department of Medicine (Division of Hematology/Oncology), University of Tennessee Medical Center/Graduate School of Medicine, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA. dkestler@utk.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/chemistry/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muramidase/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Jul;61(3):169-77. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199907)61:3<169::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-9.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199907)61:3<169::AID-AJH3>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199907)61:3<169::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['CA58205/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The statistics are the standardized incidence ratio, the empirical Bayes method of Clayton and Kaldor, Poisson probability, a statistic based on the 'Breslow T' test (BT) and two statistics based on the 'Potthoff-Whittinghill' test (PW) for extra-Poisson variance. Two alternative processes of clustering are simulated in which high-risk locations could be caused by environmental sources or could be sites of microepidemics of an infectious agent contributing to a rare disease such as childhood leukaemia. The simulation processes use two parameters (proportion of cases found in clusters and mean cluster size) which are varied to embrace a variety of situations. Real and artificial data sets of small area populations are considered. The most extreme of the artificial sets has all areas of equal population size. The other data sets use the small census areas (municipalities) in Finland since these have extremely heterogeneous population size distribution. Subset selection allows examination of this variability. Receiver operator curve methodology is used to compare the efficacy of the statistics in identifying the cluster areas; statistics are compared for the proportion of true high-risk areas identified in the top 1 per cent and 10 per cent of ranked areas. One of the PW statistics performed consistently well under all circumstances, although the results for the BT statistic were marginally better when only the top 1 per cent of ranked areas was considered.

Two approaches to the problem can be used. One fits a proportional hazards model with a fixed covariate included for each centre (except one). The need for a centre specific adjustment is evaluated using either a score, Wald or likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that all the centre specific effects are equal to zero. An alternative approach is to introduce a random effect or frailty for each centre into the model. Recently, Commenges and Andersen have proposed a score test for this random effects model. By a Monte Carlo study we compare the performance of these two approaches when either the fixed or random effects model holds true. The study shows that for moderate samples the fixed effects tests have nominal levels much higher than specified, but the random effect test performs as expected under the null hypothesis. Under the alternative hypothesis the random effect test has good power to detect relatively small fixed or random centre effects.

Despite intensive investigation by haematological, biochemical, and microbiological means, accurate diagnosis is not always possible. Histological and microbiological examination of biopsies from the affected organ may be indicated to enable an accurate diagnosis to be made in these patients. Here we assess the indications, findings, and outcomes in patients who have required surgical biopsy after BMT. PROCEDURE: We retrospectively reviewed all BMT patients who had surgical biopsies between February 1994 and January 1997. Twenty-six patients (1-46 years, median age 10 years) underwent 40 biopsies from the upper and lower GI tract, lung, or liver. Indications for BMT were: relapsed leukaemia = 18; other types of leukaemia = 3; aplastic anaemia=3; other diseases = 2. Type of BMT: matched related donor = 3, unrelated T-cell depleted donor = 23. RESULTS: Eleven (42%) cases had a change in management; 4 (16%) patients avoided further aggressive therapy because of poor prognosis. Unexpected diagnoses were found in 7 biopsies: 1 acute colitis, 1 duodenal ulcer, 1 liver aspergilloma, 2 transfusion siderosis, 1 radiation fibrosis of the lung, and 1 cytomegalovirus infection of the lung. Three patients were noted to have complications after their procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical biopsies for undiagnosed problems can be of benefit in the management of very sick patients who have received bone marrow transplantations. Despite the fact that these patients are so unwell, there is a low rate of complications related to surgery and anaesthesia.","['Arul, G S', 'Mullan, M H', 'Cornish, J', 'Oakhill, A', 'Spicer, R D']","['Arul GS', 'Mullan MH', 'Cornish J', 'Oakhill A', 'Spicer RD']","['Department of Paediatric Surgery, Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol, United Kingdom. suren.arul@bristol.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Aug;33(2):95-8. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199908)33:2<95::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199908)33:2<95::AID-MPO6>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199908)33:2<95::aid-mpo6>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to classify immunophenotypes, to decrease cranial irradiation, and to assess whether this protocol would improve the survival rate. PROCEDURE: From June, 1987, to June, 1992, 444 unselected children were diagnosed with ALL. Of them, 425 were evaluable. Therapy was stratified by risk. Standard-risk (SR) and high-risk (HR) patients received protocols I, M, II, and maintenance therapy. Very-high-risk (VHR) patients received protocol E instead of protocol M. All patients received a prephase treatment consisting of prednisone and intrathecal methotrexate (MTX). HR and VHR patients received cranial irradiation (12-18 Gy). The following changes were made to the ALL BFM 86 protocol: in protocol M, MTX 1 g/m2 instead of 5 g/m2; in protocol E, citarabine 1 g/m2 instead of 2 g/m2; mithoxantrone and ifosfamide were substituted by teniposide and cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: Immunophenotypes: pro-B-ALL, 14%; common ALL, 67.4%; pre-B-ALL, 4.3%; T-ALL, 10%; undifferentiated leukemia (AUL), 4.3%. The overall 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rate was 60% +/- 2% (SE). The 5-year EFS rate for each risk group was: SR 75%, HR 62%, VHR 28%, with a median follow-up of 6.5 years (range 4.5-9.5 years). The cumulative incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse was 5.4%. CONCLUSIONS: We have been able successfully to perform a nationwide study. Our strategy to adapt the BFM protocol to our population of patients trial was effective in improving the EFS. The immunophenotype distribution is similar to that in other reported series.","['Campbell, M', 'Salgado, C', 'Quintana, J', 'Becker, A', 'Vargas, L', 'Cabrera, M E', 'Beresi, V', 'Rojas, J', 'Paez, E', 'Tapia, S', 'Zolezzi, P', 'Advis, P']","['Campbell M', 'Salgado C', 'Quintana J', 'Becker A', 'Vargas L', 'Cabrera ME', 'Beresi V', 'Rojas J', 'Paez E', 'Tapia S', 'Zolezzi P', 'Advis P']","['Departments of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Roberto del Rio, Santiago, Chile.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chile', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/immunology/radiotherapy', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Aug;33(2):88-94. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199908)33:2<88::aid-mpo5>3.0.co;2-z.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'BFM-86 protocol']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199908)33:2<88::AID-MPO5>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199908)33:2<88::aid-mpo5>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistological staining of routine biopsy sections for increased levels of phosphotyrosine may therefore provide a simple means of screening for tumours containing activated tyrosine kinases. In this study, monoclonal antibodies to phosphotyrosine were used to immunostain a cell line and tumour biopsies from lymphomas known to contain the activated anaplastic-lymphoma-kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase. A range of normal and other neoplastic tissues were also immunostained for comparison. An anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell line carrying the (2;5) translocation, which creates the activated nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) tyrosine kinase, was strongly labelled. Routine tissue biopsies from five cases of ALK-positive ALCL were also strongly positive for phosphotyrosine. The characteristic granular cytoplasmic labelling pattern for phosphotyrosine observed in a B-cell lymphoma (expressing full length ALK kinase) was identical to that obtained using an ALK-specific antibody, thus confirming that labelling for phosphotyrosine in lymphoma cells reflects the presence of an activated kinase. When normal lymphoid tissues were stained, there was little or no labelling for phosphotyrosine, but stronger labelling was seen in other cells and tissues; for example, endothelial cells and some carcinoma samples. Whilst the strong labelling for phosphotyrosine observed in the lymphoma cells is due to the presence of activated ALK, the strong staining of some normal cells presumably represents physiologically active kinases and this should be taken into account when interpreting the immunostaining of non-lymphoid tumours. The simplicity of this method, however, means that it offers a new rapid approach to the screening of large numbers of tumours for the presence of aberrant tyrosine kinase activation, particularly if they arise from tissues which normally contain only background levels of phosphotyrosine.","['Pulford, K', 'Delsol, G', 'Roncador, G', 'Biddolph, S', 'Jones, M', 'Mason, D Y']","['Pulford K', 'Delsol G', 'Roncador G', 'Biddolph S', 'Jones M', 'Mason DY']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Cellular Science, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, U.K. karen.pulford@cellular-science.ox.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/09 10:00,2000/04/01 09:00,['1999/07/09 10:00'],"['1999/07/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/04/01 09:00 [medline]', '1999/07/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1999 Apr;187(5):588-93. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199904)187:5<588::AID-PATH287>3.0.CO;2-F.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199904)187:5<588::AID-PATH287>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9896(199904)187:5<588::AID-PATH287>3.0.CO;2-F [doi]']",,"['Copyright 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improved survival after BMT therefore requires more effective GVHD prophylaxis that does not impair graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. We studied the administration of human recombinant keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) in a well- characterized murine BMT model for its effects on GVHD. KGF administration from day -3 to +7 significantly reduced GVHD mortality and the severity of GVHD in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, reducing serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha levels, but preserving donor T-cell responses (cytotoxic T lymphocyte [CTL] activity, proliferation, and interleukin [IL]-2 production) to host antigens. When mice received lethal doses of P815 leukemia cells at the time of BMT, KGF treatment significantly decreased acute GVHD compared with control-treated allogeneic mice and resulted in a significantly improved leukemia-free survival (42% v 4%, P <.001).

A point mutation in codon 187 (Pro to Ser) results in complete loss of enzyme activity in homozygous subjects, whereas those with 2 wild-type alleles have normal activity. The frequency of homozygosity for the mutant allele among Caucasians and African Americans is 4% to 5% but is higher in Hispanics and Asians. Using an unambiguous polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, we assayed nonmalignant lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 104 patients with myeloid leukemias; 56 had therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), 30 had a primary myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 9 had AML de novo, and 9 had chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). All patients had their leukemia cells karyotyped. Eleven percent of the t-AML patients were homozygous and 41% were heterozygous for the NQO1 polymorphism; these proportions were significantly higher than those expected in a population of the same ethnic mix (P =.036). Of the 45 leukemia patients who had clonal abnormalities of chromosomes 5 and/or 7, 7 (16%) were homozygous for the inactivating polymorphism, 17 (38%) were heterozygous, and 21 (47%) had 2 wild-type alleles for NQO1. Thus, NQO1 mutations were significantly increased compared with the expected proportions: 5%, 34%, and 61%, respectively (P =.002). An abnormal chromosome no. 5 or 7 was observed in 7 of 8 (88%) homozygotes, 17 of 45 (38%) heterozygotes, and 21 of 51 (41%) patients with 2 wild-type alleles. Among 33 patients with balanced translocations [14 involving bands 11q23 or 21q22, 10 with inv(16) or t(15;17), and 9 with t(9;22)], there were no homozygotes, 15 (45%) heterozygotes, and 18 (55%) with 2 wild-type alleles. Whereas fewer than 3 homozygotes were expected among the 56 t-AML patients, 6 were observed; 19 heterozygotes were expected, but 23 were observed. The gene frequency for the inactivating polymorphism (0. 31) was increased approximately 1.4-fold among the 56 t-AML patients. This increase was observed within each of the following overlapping cohorts of t-AML patients: the 43 who had received an alkylating agent, the 27 who had received a topoisomerase II inhibitor, and the 37 who had received any radiotherapy. Thus, the frequency of an inactivating polymorphism in NQO1 appears to be increased in this cohort of myeloid leukemias, especially among those with t-AML or an abnormality of chromosomes 5 and/or 7. Homozygotes and heterozygotes (who are at risk for treatment-induced mutation or loss of the remaining wild-type allele in their hematopoietic stem cells) may be particularly vulnerable to leukemogenic changes induced by carcinogens.","['Larson, R A', 'Wang, Y', 'Banerjee, M', 'Wiemels, J', 'Hartford, C', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Smith, M T']","['Larson RA', 'Wang Y', 'Banerjee M', 'Wiemels J', 'Hartford C', 'Le Beau MM', 'Smith MT']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Cancer Research Center of the University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. ralarson@mcis.bsd.uchicago.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Ethnicity/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/genetics', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/deficiency/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/deficiency/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/enzymology/*genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/enzymology/*genetics/radiotherapy', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Racial Groups/genetics', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):803-7.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67470-5 [pii]'],,,"['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These rearrangements fuse RARalpha to different partner genes creating the chimeric proteins: PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha, and NPM-RARalpha. Although the vast majority of APLs respond to retinoic acid therapy, those associated with PLZF-RARalpha are resistant. We have used retroviruses to express PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha, NPM-RARalpha, RARalpha403 (a dominant negative mutant of RARalpha), and wild-type RARalpha in murine bone marrow progenitors and found that all of these constructs blocked differentiation and led to the immortalization of myeloid progenitors. This cellular transformation is specific to an alteration of the RARalpha pathway because overexpression of RARbeta, RARgamma, or RXRalpha did not result in similar growth perturbations. Pharmacological doses of RA induced differentiation and inhibited proliferation of cells transformed with either of the APL fusion genes, including PLZF-RARalpha, whereas physiological retinoic acid concentrations were sufficient to reverse the phenotype of cells transformed with wild-type RARalpha. The cellular responses to retinoic acid were accompanied by a sharp decrease in the amount of the RARalpha-fusion proteins expressed in the cells. Our findings suggest that the oncogenicity of RARalpha-fusion proteins results from their nature to behave as unliganded RARalpha in the presence of physiological concentrations of retinoic acid.","['Du, C', 'Redner, R L', 'Cooke, M P', 'Lavau, C']","['Du C', 'Redner RL', 'Cooke MP', 'Lavau C']","['Systemix Inc, Palo Alto, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):793-802.,"['0 (NPM-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67469-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK Cancer Cytogenetics Group (UKCCG)",773-80,"Partial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, del(5q), is the cytogenetic hallmark of the 5q-syndrome, a distinct subtype of myelodysplastic syndrome-refractory anemia (MDS-RA). Deletions of 5q also occur in the full spectrum of other de novo and therapy-related MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) types, most often in association with other chromosome abnormalities. However, the loss of genetic material from 5q is believed to be of primary importance in the pathogenesis of all del(5q) disorders. In the present study, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using a chromosome 5-specific whole chromosome painting probe and a 5q subtelomeric probe to determine the incidence of cryptic translocations. We studied archival fixed chromosome suspensions from 36 patients with myeloid disorders (predominantly MDS and AML) and del(5q) as the sole abnormality. In 3 AML patients studied, this identified a translocation of 5q subtelomeric sequences from the del(5q) to the short arm of an apparently normal chromosome 11. FISH with chromosome 11-specific subtelomeric probes confirmed the presence of 11p on the shortened 5q. Further FISH mapping confirmed that the 5q and 11p translocation breakpoints were the same in all 3 cases, between the nucleophosmin (NPM1) and fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4) genes on 5q35 and the Harvey ras-1-related gene complex (HRC) and the radixin pseudogene (RDPX1) on 11p15.5. Importantly, all 3 patients with the cryptic t(5;11) were children: a total of 3 of 4 AML children studied. Two were classified as AML-M2 and the third was classified as M4. All 3 responded poorly to treatment and had short survival times, ranging from 10 to 18 months. Although del(5q) is rare in childhood AML, this study indicates that, within this subgroup, the incidence of cryptic t(5;11) may be high. It is significant that none of the 24 MDS patients studied, including 11 confirmed as having 5q-syndrome, had the translocation. Therefore, this appears to be a new nonrandom chromosomal translocation, specifically associated with childhood AML with a differentiated blast cell phenotype and the presence of a del(5q).","['Jaju, R J', 'Haas, O A', 'Neat, M', 'Harbott, J', 'Saha, V', 'Boultwood, J', 'Brown, J M', 'Pirc-Danoewinata, H', 'Krings, B W', 'Muller, U', 'Morris, S W', 'Wainscoat, J S', 'Kearney, L']","['Jaju RJ', 'Haas OA', 'Neat M', 'Harbott J', 'Saha V', 'Boultwood J', 'Brown JM', 'Pirc-Danoewinata H', 'Krings BW', 'Muller U', 'Morris SW', 'Wainscoat JS', 'Kearney L']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, University Department of Cellular Science, and the Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):773-80.,,,,['S0006-4971(20)67467-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have developed a new fluorescent beads adhesion assay that facilitates flow cytometric investigation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1)- and very late activation antigen-4 (VLA-4)-mediated functional adhesion in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of both the CD10(-) and CD10(+) (leukemic) cell population within one blood or bone marrow sample. Surprisingly, of the 20 B-lineage ALL patients investigated, 17 contained a leukemic cell population with LFA-1- and/or VLA-4-mediated adhesion defects. Five patients contained CD10(+) cells that did not exhibit any LFA-1-mediated adhesion due to the lack of LFA-1 surface expression. The CD10(+) cells from 10 ALL patients expressed LFA-1 that could not be activated by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), whereas the CD10(-) cells expressed a functional LFA-1. Seven patients contained CD10(+) cells that expressed a PMA-unresponsive form of VLA-4. The PMA unresponsiveness of the integrins LFA-1 and VLA-4 expressed by the CD10(+) cells may be due to mutations in the integrins itself, in protein kinases, or in other intracellular molecules involved in integrin adhesion. These data clearly demonstrate the importance of investigating integrin function in addition to integrin surface expression. The strikingly high frequency (85%) of adhesion defects in ALL could suggest a causal relationship between integrin-mediated adhesion and B-lineage ALL.","['Geijtenbeek, T B', 'van Kooyk, Y', 'van Vliet, S J', 'Renes, M H', 'Raymakers, R A', 'Figdor, C G']","['Geijtenbeek TB', 'van Kooyk Y', 'van Vliet SJ', 'Renes MH', 'Raymakers RA', 'Figdor CG']","['Departments of Tumor Immunology and Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/drug effects/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/*pathology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/analysis/*deficiency', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*analysis', 'Microspheres', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*deficiency', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/drug effects/pathology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/pathology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/analysis/*deficiency', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):754-64.,"['0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67465-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is associated with extensive lymph node involvement and poor survival. The minimal consensus deletion comprises a segment, which contains the ATM gene presenting an interesting candidate gene, as mutations in ATM predispose A-T patients to lymphoid malignancies. To investigate a potential pathogenic role of ATM in B-cell tumorigenesis, we performed mutation analysis of ATM in 29 malignant lymphomas of B-cell origin (B-CLL = 27; mantle cell lymphoma, [MCL] = 2). Twenty-three of these carried an 11q22-q23 deletion. In five B-CLLs and one MCL with deletion of one ATM allele, a point mutation in the remaining allele was detected, which resulted in aberrant transcript splicing, alteration, or truncation of the protein. In addition, mutation analysis identified point mutations in three cases without 11q deletion: two B-CLLs with one altered allele and one MCL with both alleles mutated. In four cases analyzed, the ATM alterations were not present in the germ line indicating a somatic origin of the mutations. Our study demonstrates somatic disruption of both alleles of the ATM gene by deletion or point mutation and thus its pathogenic role in sporadic B-cell lineage tumors.","['Schaffner, C', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Rappold, G A', 'Dohner, H', 'Lichter, P']","['Schaffner C', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Rappold GA', 'Dohner H', 'Lichter P']","['Abteilung ""Organisation komplexer Genome"", Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia/complications/genetics', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Exons/genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', '*Point Mutation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):748-53.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67464-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MSH2 is one of the genes involved in DNA mismatch repair to maintain fidelity of genomic replication, and defects of MSH2 are directly involved in MSI in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal tumors and other human tumors. We have examined the expression of MSH2 protein by Western blotting in 43 adult leukemia samples, including 42 AML and 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using the antibody MSH2 (Ab-1) (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA). Abnormal expression of MSH2 protein was found in 14 of 43 (32.6%) cases; a control antibody to actin was always positive. Of the 14 patients that had abnormal expression of MSH2, 2 had therapy-related acute leukemia and 9 were elderly patients (>60 years of age). Expression of MSH2 mRNA was further examined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Deletion of MSH2 mRNA was found in 1 of 14 cases with deficient MSH2 protein expression. This group of patients was also screened for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the MSH2 locus using a panel 4 microsatellite markers (D2S367, D2S288, D2S391, and D2S2294). LOH was found in 5 of 11 cases examined. There was no evidence of LOH in 14 patients with normal MSH2 expression who were examined using the same markers. Functional evidence for defective DNA mismatch repair in leukemic cells lacking MSH2 as manifest by MSI was found in 7 of 11 cases studied. Mutations of the p53 gene in these 43 samples were also investigated by direct sequencing of full-length p53 cDNA. Mutations of p53 were found in 6 of 43 cases, including 5 of the 14 (35.7%) cases that did not express MSH2 protein. In contrast, mutation of p53 was only found in 1 of 29 (3.4%) cases with normal MSH2 protein expression (chi2 = 5.720, P <.02).

In multiple myeloma (MM), variable chromosome partners have been identified by conventional cytogenetics, including the 11q13, 8q24, 18q21, and 6p21 loci. We and others have recently reported a novel, karyotypically undetectable chromosomal translocation t(4;14)(p16. 3;q32) in MM-derived cell lines, as well as in primary tumors. The 4p16.3 breakpoints are relatively scattered and located less than 100 kb centromeric of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene or within the recently identified WHSC1 gene, both of which are apparently deregulated by the translocation. To assess the frequency of the t(4;14)(p16.3;q32) translocation in MM, we performed a double-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of interphase nuclei with differently labeled probes specific for the IGH locus (a pool of plasmid clones specific for the IGH constant regions) or 4p16.3 (yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) 764-H1 spanning the region involved in breakpoints). Thirty MM patients, the MM-derived cell lines KMS-11 and OPM2, and six normal controls were examined. The identification of a t(4;14) translocation, evaluated as the presence of a der(14) chromosome, was based on the colocalization of signals specific for the two probes; a cutoff value of 15% (mean + 3 standard deviation [SD]) derived from the interphase FISH of the normal controls (range, 5% to 11%; mean +/- SD, 8.16 +/- 2.2) was used for the quantification analysis. In interphase FISH, five patients (one in clinical stage I, two in stage II, one in stage III, and a plasma cell leukemia) were found to be positive (approximately 15%).

Since the demonstration of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) influence on mouse leukemia in 1964, an HLA association has been considered as a possible genetic risk factor. Despite extensive efforts, however, no strong evidence comparable to the H-2(k) influence on mouse leukemia has been shown. The number of negative serological studies resulted in a loss of interest and consequently, no molecular HLA-DR association study has been published to date. We reconsidered the HLA-DR association in childhood ALL in 114 patients from a single center and 325 local newborn controls by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the HLA-DRB1/3/4/5 loci. With conventional analysis, there was a moderate allelic association with the most common allele in the HLA-DR53 group, HLA-DRB1*04, in the whole group that was stronger in males (P =.0005, odds ratio = 2.9). When the other expressed HLA-DRB loci were examined, homozygosity for HLA-DRB4*01, encoding the HLA-DR53 specificity, was increased in patients (21.1% v 8.3%; odds ratio = 2.9, P =.0005). Consideration of gender showed that all of these associations were reflections of a male-specific increase in homozygosity for HLA-DRB4*01 (32.8% v 4. 0%; odds ratio = 11.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.9 to 28.0; P = 3 x 10(-8)). This highly significant result provided the long-suspected evidence for the HLA-DR influence on the development of childhood ALL while confirming the recessive nature of the MHC influence on human leukemogenesis as in experimental models. The cross-reactivity between HLA-DR53 and H-2Ek, extensive mimicry of the immunodominant epitope of HLA-DR53 by several carcinogenic viruses, and the extra amount of DNA in the vicinity of the HLA-DRB4 gene argue for the case that HLA-DRB4*01 may be one of the genetic risk factors for childhood ALL.","['Dorak, M T', 'Lawson, T', 'Machulla, H K', 'Darke, C', 'Mills, K I', 'Burnett, A K']","['Dorak MT', 'Lawson T', 'Machulla HK', 'Darke C', 'Mills KI', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, Wales, UK. dorak@cardiff.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Abortion, Habitual/epidemiology', 'Adenoviruses, Human/immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-DRB4 Chains', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', '*Molecular Mimicry', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology/genetics/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Virus Diseases/*complications/immunology']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):694-700.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2E(k) antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR53)', '0 (HLA-DRB4 Chains)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)']",,['Blood. 1999 Dec 1;94(11):3957.

PTP-RO is a human homologue of murine PTPlambda and is related to the homotypically adhering kappa and mu receptor-type tyrosine phosphatases. PTP-RO is expressed in human megakaryocytic cell lines, primary bone marrow megakaryocytes, and stem cells. PTP-RO mRNA and protein expression are upregulated upon phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) treatment of the megakaryocytic cell lines CMS, CMK, and Dami. To elucidate the function of PTP-RO in megakaryocytic cells and its potential involvement in the stem cell factor (SCF)/c-Kit receptor pathway, COS-7 and 293 cells were cotransfected with the cDNAs of both the c-Kit tyrosine kinase receptor and PTP-RO. PTP-RO was found to be associated with the c-Kit receptor in these transfected cells and the SCF/Kit ligand induced a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PTP-RO. Interestingly, these transfected cells demonstrated a decrease in their proliferative response to the SCF/Kit ligand. In addition, we assessed the association of PTP-RO with c-Kit in vivo. The results demonstrated that PTP-RO associates with c-Kit but not with the tyrosine kinase receptor FGF-R and that PTP-RO is tyrosine-phosphorylated after SCF stimulation of Mo7e and CMK cells. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against PTP-RO mRNA sequences significantly inhibited megakaryocyte progenitor proliferation. Therefore, these data show that the novel tyrosine kinase phosphatase PTP-RO is involved in megakaryocytopoiesis and that its function is mediated by the SCF/c-Kit pathway.","['Taniguchi, Y', 'London, R', 'Schinkmann, K', 'Jiang, S', 'Avraham, H']","['Taniguchi Y', 'London R', 'Schinkmann K', 'Jiang S', 'Avraham H']","['Division of Experimental Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Institutes of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2', 'Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta Catenin']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):539-49.,"['0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRO protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRU protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpro protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpru protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 3)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67443-2 [pii]'],,,['HL 51456/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using retroviral vectors that contained both HOXA5 and a cell surface marker gene, pure populations of progenitors that expressed the transgene were obtained for analysis of differentiation patterns. Based on both immunophenotypic and morphological analysis of cultures from transduced CD34(+) cells, HOXA5 expression caused a significant shift toward myeloid differentiation and away from erythroid differentiation in comparison to CD34(+) cells transduced with Control vectors (P =.001, n = 15 for immunophenotypic analysis; and P <.0001, n = 19 for morphological analysis). Transduction of more primitive progenitors (CD34(+)CD38(-) cells) resulted in a significantly greater effect on differentiation than did transduction of the largely committed CD34(+) population (P =.006 for difference between HOXA5 effect on CD34(+) v CD34(+)CD38(-) cells). Erythroid progenitors (burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFU-E]) were significantly decreased in frequency among progenitors transduced with the HOXA5 vector (P =.016, n = 7), with no reduction in total CFU numbers. Clonal analysis of single cells transduced with HOXA5 or control vectors (cultured in erythroid culture conditions) showed that HOXA5 expression prevented erythroid differentiation and produced clones with a preponderance of undifferentiated blasts. These studies show that constitutive expression of HOXA5 inhibits human erythropoiesis and promotes myelopoiesis. The reciprocal inhibition of erythropoiesis and promotion of myelopoiesis in the absence of any demonstrable effect on proliferation suggests that HOXA5 diverts differentiation at a mulitpotent progenitor stage away from the erythroid toward the myeloid pathway.","['Crooks, G M', 'Fuller, J', 'Petersen, D', 'Izadi, P', 'Malik, P', 'Pattengale, P K', 'Kohn, D B', 'Gasson, J C']","['Crooks GM', 'Fuller J', 'Petersen D', 'Izadi P', 'Malik P', 'Pattengale PK', 'Kohn DB', 'Gasson JC']","['Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pathology, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/physiology']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):519-28.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67441-9 [pii]'],,,['HL54850/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is some debate as to whether the megakaryocyte and platelet synthesize PAI-1, take it up from plasma, or both. We examined the expression of PAI-1 in differentiating megakaryocytic progenitor cells (UT-7) and in CD34(+)/CD41(-) cells from cord blood. UT-7 cells differentiated with thrombopoietin (TPO) resembled megakaryocytes (UT-7/TPO) with respect to morphology, ploidy, and the expression of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. PAI-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was upregulated and PAI-1 protein synthesized in the UT-7/TPO cells accumulated in the cytoplasm without being released spontaneously. In contrast, erythropoietin (EPO)-stimulated UT-7 cells (UT-7/EPO) did not express PAI-1 mRNA after stimulation with TPO because they do not have endogenous c-Mpl. After cotransfection with human wild-type c-mpl, the cells (UT-7/EPO-MPL) responded to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) with enhanced PAI-1 mRNA expression within 24 to 48 hours. However, induction of PAI-1 mRNA in UT-7/EPO-MPL cells by TPO required at least 14-days stimulation. UT-7/EPO cells expressing c-Mpl changed their morphology and the other characteristics similar to the UT-7/TPO cells. TPO also differentiated human cord blood CD34(+)/CD41(-) cells to CD34(-)/CD41(+) cells, generated morphologically mature megakaryocytes, and induced the expression of PAI-1 mRNA. These results suggest that both PAI-1 mRNA and de novo PAI-1 protein synthesis is induced after differentiation of immature progenitor cells into megakaryocytes by TPO.","['Madoiwa, S', 'Komatsu, N', 'Mimuro, J', 'Kimura, K', 'Matsuda, M', 'Sakata, Y']","['Madoiwa S', 'Komatsu N', 'Mimuro J', 'Kimura K', 'Matsuda M', 'Sakata Y']","['Division of Hemostasis and Thrombosis, Institute of Hematology, Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):475-82.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67437-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the period from 1984 to 1994, 1,011 CLL patients (204 [20%] </=55 years of age and 807 [80%] >55 years of age) were observed. At diagnosis, younger and older patients displayed a similar distribution of clinical features, except for a significantly higher male/female ratio in younger patients (2.85 v 1. 29; P <.0001). Both groups showed an elevated rate of second primary cancers (8.3% v 10.7%), whereas the occurrence of Richter's syndrome was significantly higher in younger patients (5.9% v 1.2%; P <. 00001). Younger and older patients showed a similar overall median survival probability (10 years) but were characterized by a different distribution of causes of deaths: CLL unrelated deaths and second primary malignancies predominated in the older age group, whereas the direct effects of leukemia were prevalent in the younger age group. Although younger and older patients displayed a similar survival, the evaluation of the relative survival rates showed that the disease had a greater adverse effect on the expected survival probability of the younger population. Multivariate analysis showed that for young CLL patients only dynamic parameters, such as lymphocyte doubling time and other signs of active disease, were the independent factors that significantly influenced survival probability (P =.00001). A prolonged clinico-hematologic follow-up allowed us to identify two subsets of young CLL patients with a different prognostic outcome: a group of patients (40%) with long-lasting stable disease without treatment and an actuarial survival probability of 94% at 12 years from diagnosis and another group (60%) with progressive disease and a median survival probability of 5 years after therapy.

However, there has been a corresponding reduction in the graft-versus-leukemia effect so that any decrease in GVHD-related mortality has been offset by an increased rate of disease relapse. Therapy of recurrent disease with donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) has been proven to be effective salvage therapy for the majority of patients who relapse after allogeneic BMT with CP CML. However, the overall impact of salvage DLI therapy on the survival of CP CML patients initially transplanted with TCD marrow grafts is not defined. To address this question, we have evaluated a clinical strategy of TCD followed by targeted adoptive immunotherapy with DLI in 25 CP CML patients undergoing allogeneic BMT from HLA-identical siblings. All patients received a standardized preparative regimen along with ex vivo TCD and posttransplant cyclosporine as GVHD prophylaxis. Durable engraftment was observed in all 25 patients. The incidence of grade II to IV acute GVHD was 8%. The cumulative incidence of transplant-related mortality (TRM) was 4%, and the 1-year probability of overall survival was 96%. The 3-year cumulative relapse incidence was 49%. All relapsed patients received DLI to reinduce remission. The total T-cell dose administered to these patients varied from 0.1 to 5.0 x 10(8) T cells/kg. Complete responses were observed in 12 of 14 patients, with 1 additional patient still too early to evaluate. Three patients died of GVHD after DLI, and 1 relapsed into blast crisis after a transient cytogenetic remission. Of the remaining 10 patients, 8 are in molecular remission, 1 is alive in relapse, and 1 is receiving DLI treatment. The median follow-up after infusion of surviving DLI patients in remission is 5.3 years.

Human IL-2 was fused to the amino-terminus of amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope glycoproteins. Retroviral vectors were pseudotyped with both the IL-2 chimeric envelope and the wild-type amphotropic MLV envelope. The chimeric IL-2 glycoproteins were incorporated on retroviral vectors and the IL-2-displaying vector particles could bind specifically to cell surface IL-2 receptors. In addition, the IL-2-displaying vectors could infect proliferating cells through amphotropic receptors irrespective of whether the cells expressed the IL-2 receptor. IL-2-displaying vector particles could also transiently stimulate the cell cycle entry and proliferation of several IL-2-dependent cell lines. Finally, retroviral vectors displaying IL-2 could efficiently transduce G0/G1-arrested cells expressing the IL-2 receptor at a 34-fold higher efficiency compared with vectors with unmodified envelopes. This new strategy, whereby C-type retroviral vector particles display a ligand that activates the cell cycle of the target cells at the time of virus entry, may represent an alternative to lentivirus-derived retroviral vectors for the infection of quiescent cells. In addition, upon infection of an heterogeneous population of nonproliferating cells, MLV-retroviral vectors that display cytokines/growth factors will allow the transgene of interest to be integrated specifically in quiescent cells expressing the corresponding cytokine/growth factor receptor.","['Maurice, M', 'Mazur, S', 'Bullough, F J', 'Salvetti, A', 'Collins, M K', 'Russell, S J', 'Cosset, F L']","['Maurice M', 'Mazur S', 'Bullough FJ', 'Salvetti A', 'Collins MK', 'Russell SJ', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, Unite de Virologie Humaine, INSERM U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', '*Symporters', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Virus Integration']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):401-10.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Symporters)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67428-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A molecular relapse (MR), as defined by two consecutive positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the detection of M-bcr-abl transcripts in a 4-week interval, was found in two of 29 (7%) patients after PBSCT compared with 20 of 62 (32%) patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This corresponds to a 4-year molecular relapse estimate (+/- standard error) of 7% +/- 5% after PBSCT and of 44% +/- 8% after BMT (P <.009). With identical follow-up periods of survivors in both patient subsets between 6 and 55 months (median, 28 months), 14 of the 20 patients with MR after BMT progressed to an isolated cytogenetic (n = 10) or a hematologic (n = 4) disease recurrence, resulting in a 4-year cytogenetic relapse estimate of 47% +/- 11%, while none of the patients after PBSCT has so far relapsed (P <.006). Multivariate analysis including all potential influencial factors of posttransplant disease recurrence identified the source of stem cells (P <.02) as the only independent predictor of molecular relapse. In conclusion, this prospective comparison of molecular and cytogenetic residual disease demonstrates that peripheral blood stem cell transplants have a more pronounced activity against residual CML cells than bone marrow transplants. Prospective randomized trials comparing PBSCT and BMT in patients with first chronic phase Ph1-positive CML are strictly required to further substantiate differences in the antileukemic activity of the two stem cell sources.","['Elmaagacli, A H', 'Beelen, D W', 'Opalka, B', 'Seeber, S', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Elmaagacli AH', 'Beelen DW', 'Opalka B', 'Seeber S', 'Schaefer UW']","['Departments of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Internal Medicine (Tumor Research), University Hospital of Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood', 'Germany/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/blood/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):384-9.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,['Blood. 1999 Jul 15;94(2):381-3.

Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) is etiologically considered to cause ATLL. It has been suggested that HTLV-I integrates its provirus into random sites in host chromosomal DNA after infection. Clonal integration has been observed in patients with ATLL, including smoldering, chronic and acute leukemia states. Almost all cases with ATLL demonstrate clonal chromosome abnormalities, with karyotypes being very complicated in both number and structure. However, there are no specific karyotype abnormalities in ATLL. In order to examine the role of HTLV-I in the pathogenesis of ATLL, we investigated whether or not HTLV-I randomly integrates and whether the integration site in the human genome is associated with any chromosomal abnormality. We analyzed 18 cases with ATLL, which included 15 cases with acute states, two cases with chronic states and one case with a smoldering state. In four of the 18 cases, the HTLV-I provirus integrated into the 9th chromosome, while in three cases, it integrated into the 1st or 10th chromosome. However, the integrated site in the chromosome varied in each case and the random integration was considered to be true. All 15 cases with acute ATLL had complicated chromosomal abnormalities and two cases with chronic and smoldering ATLL showed simple abnormal karyotypes, while one case with chronic ATLL showed a normal karyotype. In 15 of the 18 cases, the chromosomes with HTLV-I integration showed abnormalities. In particular, in two cases with simple chromosome abnormalities, HTLV-I integrated into the abnormal chromosome, but not into the normal chromosome. The HTLV-I proviral integration thus seems to be associated with chromosome abnormalities. In the multistage leukemogenesis of ATLL, these findings indicate that HTLV-I integration might play an important role in the induction of chromosomal instability.","['Ohshima, K', 'Ohgami, A', 'Matsuoka, M', 'Etoh, K', 'Utsunomiya, A', 'Makino, T', 'Ishiguro, M', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kikuchi, M']","['Ohshima K', 'Ohgami A', 'Matsuoka M', 'Etoh K', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Makino T', 'Ishiguro M', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/*genetics', '*Virus Integration']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Oct 23;132(1-2):203-12. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00188-8.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,"['S0304-3835(98)00188-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00188-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether other polyunsaturated fatty acids share 22:6's cytotoxic activity, we treated cultured T27A murine leukemia cells with PC liposomes composed of stearic acid in the sn-1 position and alpha-linolenic acid (alpha-18:3), arachidonic acid (20:4), or eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5) in the sn-2 position. PC containing 22:6 in both positions was also tested. Following treatment, the cells were monitored for fatty acid composition, liposome uptake and viability. Here we demonstrate that cytotoxicity is unique to 22:6-containing PCs and is not shared by PCs with other polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Because PCs with fatty acids other than 22:6 were taken up by cells but did not kill the cells, we propose that 22:6-containing PCs incorporated into cellular membranes produce unique changes in the membrane structure incompatible with cell survival. PC liposomes containing 22:6 are potential drug delivery vehicles that may, by virtue of their cytotoxicity, serve concomitantly as adjunct cancer therapy.","['Kafrawy, O', 'Zerouga, M', 'Stillwell, W', 'Jenski, L J']","['Kafrawy O', 'Zerouga M', 'Stillwell W', 'Jenski LJ']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, 46202-5132, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/toxicity', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-6', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*toxicity', 'Liposomes', 'Phosphatidylcholines/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Toxicity Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1998 Oct 23;132(1-2):23-9. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00163-3.,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-6)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)']",,,"['S0304-3835(98)00163-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(98)00163-3 [doi]']",,,['R01CA57212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increase of size of carboxamide chain resulted in the loss of capability of acridines to penetrate cell membrane. Cytotoxic effects of acridines were well correlated with the level of drugs accumulated by cells, whereas no clear correlation between uptake and lipophilicity was observed.

Anti-CD79a (clone ZL7.4) was used to detect the Igalpha/mb1 protein in fresh CD5+ B-lymphocytes by dual-channel flow cytometry. Expression of CD19 and CD23 were similarly assessed. As expected, CD19 was expressed in all specimens, whereas CD23 expression was zero in 3/4 MCLs, weak in 1/4 MCLs, and 2/8 CLLs (10-19%) and stronger in 6/8 CLLs (> or =45%). However, although all the CD19+/CD5+ cells of MCL expressed high CD79a levels, CD79a expression was negligible or absent in 8/8 CLL specimens (mean positivity for CD79a = 2.41 +/- 2.71%). CD79a (ZL7.4) levels may provide a more reliable distinction than CD23 levels between CLL and MCL.

New paradigms are therefore being devised considering software systems as autonomous agents able to help professionals in accomplishing their duties.

This paper illustrates a methodology facilitating the development of interoperable intelligent software agents for medical applications and proposes a generic computational model for implementing them. That model may be specialized in order to support all the different information and knowledge related requirements of a Hospital Information System.

The framework segregates the classification problem into a number of bi-dimensional classification problems, requiring individual bi-group classifiers for each individual diagnostic class. The bi-group classifiers were generated employing Neural Networks (NN), combined with a combination framework containing an Evidential Reasoning framework to accommodate for any conflicting situations between the bi-group classifiers. A number of different feature selection techniques were investigated with the aim of generating the most appropriate input vector for the bi-group classifiers. It was found that by reducing the original input feature vector, the generalisation ability of the classifiers, when exposed to unseen data, was enhanced and subsequently this reduced the computational requirements of the network itself. The entire framework was compared with a conventional approach to NN classification and a rule based classification approach. The framework attained a significantly higher level of classification in comparison with the other methods; 80.0% compared with 66.7% for the rule based technique and 68.00% for the conventional neural approach.","['Nugent, C D', 'Webb, J A', 'Black, N D', 'Wright, G T', 'McIntyre, M']","['Nugent CD', 'Webb JA', 'Black ND', 'Wright GT', 'McIntyre M']","['The Northern Ireland Bio-engineering Centre, School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, University of Ulster at Jordanstown, Newtownabbey, UK. cd.nugent@ulst.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Artif Intell Med,Artificial intelligence in medicine,8915031,IM,,"['*Computer Simulation', '*Electrocardiography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/therapy', '*Neural Networks, Computer', '*Patient Care Management']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Artif Intell Med. 1999 Jul;16(3):205-22. doi: 10.1016/s0933-3657(99)00006-8.,,,,"['S0933365799000068 [pii]', '10.1016/s0933-3657(99)00006-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated the technical advantages as well as the clinical relevance of quantitating bcr/abl fusion mRNA using the 5-nuclease assay and a real-time fluorescence reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) detection system (ABI PRISM 7700 SDS). Meanwhile, another technique was introduced (LightCycler technology) that may be used for the same purpose. To investigate whether this method may be an appropriate alternative to the described procedure, we have established bcr/abl LightCycler RT-PCR for major and minor bcr/abl fusion transcripts. We found that, with only minor modifications, TaqMan RT-PCR and fluorescent probe design can be used to obtain comparable results in the LightCycler system. The developed method could quantitate as little as 10 bcr/abl copies per 100 ng cDNA and was as safe and reproducible as the previously described technique. Because reaction efficiency was identical within different bcr/abl major fusions, one single RT-PCR could be established that simultaneously detects b2a3, b2a2, b3a2, and b3a3 fusion RNA with equal specificity and sensitivity. Compared to results generated by the ABI PRISM 7700 SDS, absolute amounts of bcr/abl did not differ significantly, and there was a linear correlation between the respective values. We conclude that TaqMan chemistry can be used in the LightCycler and that both real-time fluorescence PCR detection systems equally fulfill the criteria for the safe and reliable quantitation of bcr/abl fusion RNA in clinical samples. This may be of help for further standardization of quantitative bcr/abl RT-PCR, which, again, is necessary for the comparison of results generated by different investigators.","['Kreuzer, K A', 'Lass, U', 'Bohn, A', 'Landt, O', 'Schmidt, C A']","['Kreuzer KA', 'Lass U', 'Bohn A', 'Landt O', 'Schmidt CA']","['Abteilung fur Innere Medizin und Poliklinik m.S.

In this study, we demonstrated that a single in vivo administration of an amount less than 0.125 mg of anti-CD25 interleukin 2 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody (mAb; PC61) caused the regression of tumors that grew progressively in syngeneic mice. The tumors used were five leukemias, a myeloma, and two sarcomas derived from four different inbred mouse strains. Anti-CD25 mAb (PC61) showed an effect in six of the eight tumors. Administration of anti-CD25 mAb (PC61) caused a reduction in the number of CD4+ CD25+ cells in the peripheral lymphoid tissues. The findings suggested that CD4+ CD25+ immunoregulatory cells were involved in the growth of those tumors. Kinetic analysis showed that the administration of anti-CD25 mAb (PC61) later than day 2 after tumor inoculation caused no tumor regression, irrespective of depletion of CD4+ CD25+ immunoregulatory cells. Two leukemias, on which the PC61-treatment had no effect, seemed to be incapable of eliciting effective rejection responses in the recipient mice because of low or no antigenicity.","['Onizuka, S', 'Tawara, I', 'Shimizu, J', 'Sakaguchi, S', 'Fujita, T', 'Nakayama, E']","['Onizuka S', 'Tawara I', 'Shimizu J', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Fujita T', 'Nakayama E']","['Department of Parasitology and Immunology, Okayama University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/chemically induced/immunology/*therapy', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*immunology']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jul 1;59(13):3128-33.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the feasibility of their selective expression has been demonstrated, functional evidence of their ability to activate therapeutic agents within the tumor environment leading to tumor eradication has not been established. Glucose deprivation, chronic anoxia, and acidic pH known to persist in poorly vascularized solid tumors strongly induce the transcription of the glucose-regulated protein 78 (grp78) gene, which encodes an Mr 78,000 stress-inducible protein. In this report, we tested directly the efficacy of the grp78 promoter in a retroviral system to drive the expression of the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSVtk) suicide gene, using a murine fibrosarcoma model, in the context of their syngeneic, immunocompetent hosts. Our results showed that under glucose starvation conditions, the expression of HSVTK was enhanced in tumor cells where the HSVtk gene was driven by the internal grp78 promoter, in contrast to the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, where suppression was observed. We further demonstrated that in vivo, HSVTK expression was elevated to much higher levels inside tumors when driven by the internal grp78 promoter, resulting in complete eradication of sizable tumor mass, with no recurrence of tumor growth. Our study suggests that the glucose starvation-inducible grp78 promoter could be useful for enhanced expression of a variety of therapeutic agents within the solid tumor environment.","['Gazit, G', 'Hung, G', 'Chen, X', 'Anderson, W F', 'Lee, A S']","['Gazit G', 'Hung G', 'Chen X', 'Anderson WF', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern California/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Fibrosarcoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Ganciclovir/*toxicity', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/genetics', 'Hypoxia', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Chaperones/*genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Retroviridae', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jul 1;59(13):3100-6.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hspa5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",,,,,,"['CA27607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is also a known carcinogen associated with induction of therapy-related leukemia and bladder cancer. The DNA repair protein, O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), protects cells from the toxic and mutagenic effects of O6-alkylating agents. We report here the contribution of AGT in protecting against the toxic and mutagenic effects of cyclophosphamide. CHO cells transduced with wild-type human AGT (CHO(AGT)) and pcDNA3 (CHOpcDNA3) were treated with activated cyclophosphamide derivatives, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC), 4-hydroperoxydidechlorocyclophosphamide (4-HDC), a progenitor of acrolein, and phosphoramide mustard (PM). The results show that CHO(AGT) is 7- or 20-fold less sensitive to the toxic effects of 30 microM 4-HC or 300 microM 4-HDC, respectively, than CHOpcDNA3 cells as measured by cell survival using a colony-forming assay. CHO(AGT) cells treated with 20 microM 4-HC or 200 microM 4-HDC produced 4- or 7-fold lower mutation frequency as measured at the HPRT locus than CHOpcDNA3 cells treated with the same dose of drugs. At 30 microM acrolein, the cell survival for CHO(AGT) was 30% compared with 18.7% for CHOpcDNA3. The mutation frequency of acrolein at the same dose was 57 mutants/10(6) cells in CHOpcDNA3 compared with no mutants in CHO(AGT). In contrast, CHO(AGT) and CHOpcDNA3 cells treated with PM had similar survival curves and exhibited no difference in mutation frequency. The present study demonstrates that AGT plays an important role in protecting against the toxic and mutagenic effect of cyclophosphamide and suggests that acrolein, not PM, is responsible for generating the toxic and mutagenic lesion(s) protected by the AGT protein.","['Cai, Y', 'Wu, M H', 'Ludeman, S M', 'Grdina, D J', 'Dolan, M E']","['Cai Y', 'Wu MH', 'Ludeman SM', 'Grdina DJ', 'Dolan ME']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Mutagens/toxicity', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/toxicity', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jul 1;59(13):3059-63.,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '10159-53-2 (phosphoramide mustard)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.- (DNA alkyltransferase)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,"['CA37323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71627/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we found that arsenic induces activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases (JNKs) at a similar dose range for induction of apoptosis in JB6 cells. In addition, we found that arsenic did not induce p53-dependent transactivation. Similarly, there was no difference in apoptosis induction between cells with p53 +/+ or p53 -/-. In contrast, arsenic-induced apoptosis was almost totally blocked by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of JNK1. These results suggest that the activation of JNKs is involved in arsenic-induced apoptosis of JB6 cells. Taken together with previous findings that p53 mutations are involved in approximately 50% of all human cancers and nearly all chemotherapeutic agents kill cancer cells mainly by apoptotic induction, we suggest that arsenic may be a useful agent for the treatment of cancers with p53 mutation.","['Huang, C', 'Ma, W Y', 'Li, J', 'Dong, Z']","['Huang C', 'Ma WY', 'Li J', 'Dong Z']","['The Hormel Institute, University of Minnesota, Austin 55912, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jul 1;59(13):3053-8.,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",,,,,,['CA74916/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: The study used school records, yearbooks, and Texas Department of Health records for the school years 1963-64 to 1992-93 to construct a cohort of 15,403 students. Three mortality databases were searched to identify deaths, and mortality rates in the cohort were compared with mortality rates from the United States and Texas. Computed standardised mortality ratios and 95% confidence intervals were used. SETTING: Eastern Texas high school adjacent to facilities that have been producing synthetic styrene-butadiene since 1943. MAIN RESULTS: 338 deaths were identified. The all causes standardised mortality ratio was 0.84 (95% confidence intervals 0.74, 0.95) for men and 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for women. The standardised mortality ratio for all lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers was 1.64 (95% confidence intervals 0.85, 2.87) for men and 0.47 (0.06, 1.70) for women. The slight male excess in lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers was stronger among men who attended school for two years or less. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality from lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer among the students was little different from that of the United States as a whole. A moderate excess for men, predominantly among the shorter-term students, was offset by a deficit among women. These variations are compatible with random fluctuations; the overall pattern is not indicative of an effect of environmental exposure sustained while attending the high school.","['Loughlin, J E', 'Rothman, K J', 'Dreyer, N A']","['Loughlin JE', 'Rothman KJ', 'Dreyer NA']","['Epidemiology Resources Inc., Newton Lower Falls, MA 02462-1450, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,,"['Adult', 'Butadienes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Styrenes', 'Texas/epidemiology']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1999 May;53(5):283-7. doi: 10.1136/jech.53.5.283.,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Styrenes)']",,['J Epidemiol Community Health. 2000 Jun;54(6):480.

To test a prior hypothesis that some cancers are initiated by early exposures to toxic atmospheric pollutants from point sources. DESIGN: Address changes in children dying from cancer are examined in relation to potentially hazardous sites of several different types. The relative proximities of birth addresses and death addresses to these sites, are compared. The approach is based upon the premise that a local exposure, effective only at an early age, must be preferentially linked with an early address. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Records of 22,458 children dying from leukaemia or other cancer under the age of 16 years in Great Britain between 1953 and 1980: including 9224 who moved house between birth and death. The migration analysis was based upon birth and death addresses, converted first to postcodes and thence to map coordinates. The geographical locations of potentially toxic industrial sites were obtained through direct map searches and from commercial directories. RESULTS: Systematic asymmetries were found between measured distances from birth and death addresses to sources emitting volatile organic compounds, or using large scale combustion processes. The children had more often moved away from these hazards than towards them. Many of the sources had already been identified as hazardous using other methods. There was also a birth association with areas of dense habitation; possibly because of unidentified toxic sources contained within them. All forms of cancer were involved although some effluents were associated preferentially with specific types. CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of an earlier study, based upon a different and independent method, were confirmed. Proximities to several types of industrial source, around the time of birth, were followed by a raised risk of childhood cancer. Combustion products and volatile organic compounds were especially implicated. Within the 16 year limit of the study, the increased risk did not decay with advancing age. Low atmospheric concentrations of many carcinogenic substances suggest that the mother acts as a cumulative filter and passes them to the fetus across the placenta or in breast milk.","['Knox, E G', 'Gilman, E A']","['Knox EG', 'Gilman EA']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Medical School, University of Birmingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Hazardous Substances', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Population Dynamics', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1998 Nov;52(11):716-26. doi: 10.1136/jech.52.11.716.,['0 (Hazardous Substances)'],,,['10.1136/jech.52.11.716 [doi]'],PMC1756635,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: New Zealand Map Grid coordinates, derived from the birth addresses of cases and controls were used in clustering analyses that applied Cuzick and Edwards' method. SETTING: The whole of New Zealand. PARTICIPANTS: The cases were ascertained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry. They were diagnosed with leukaemia or lymphoma at ages 0-14 years during the period 1976 to 1987. For Hodgkin's disease, the age range was extended to include those aged from 0-24 years. The cancer registrations were linked with national birth records, to obtain the birth addresses of the cases. The controls were selected at random from birth records, with matching to cases (1:1) on age and sex. The analyses included 600 cases and 600 controls. MAIN RESULTS: There was no statistically significant spatial clustering for any tumour group overall, including acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia, other leukaemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, Hodgkin's disease, and all these combined. Significant clustering was found in a sub-analysis for one of three age specific subgroups of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ages 10-14 years, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: The subgroup finding may have been real or a chance association, as several comparisons were made. This study found little evidence for spatial clustering of leukaemias or lymphomas in a population with no nuclear installations.","['Dockerty, J D', 'Sharples, K J', 'Borman, B']","['Dockerty JD', 'Sharples KJ', 'Borman B']","['Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk Factors', 'Space-Time Clustering']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1999 Mar;53(3):154-8. doi: 10.1136/jech.53.3.154.,,,,['10.1136/jech.53.3.154 [doi]'],PMC1756850,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Fourteen male and ten female survivors, treated for ALL in childhood, were cross-sectionally studied, at a mean age of 25.1 years (range 20.1-34.9). All patients, except for two, had received cranial irradiation as part of their treatment (mean radiation dose 2460 cGy). MEASUREMENTS: Height and weight were measured. Bone mineral density (BMD) was assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in the lumbar spine, femoral neck, femoral trochanter and at 1/3 distal and ultradistal in the radius. Early morning serum levels of LH, FSH, oestradiol or testosterone, IGF-1 and IGF-BP3 were determined as well as several specific markers of bone turnover. RESULTS: Mean height, expressed as standard deviation score (SDS) was -1.12, significantly reduced. BMD in the lumbar spine, femoral neck and at 1/3 distal and ultradistal in the radius, was significantly lower compared to the reference population (P < 0.05). No correlation was found between the BMD values and the cumulative dose of administered cytotoxic drugs, the age at diagnosis of ALL or the duration of follow-up. Mean IGF-1 and IGF-BP3 SDS-scores were -1.24 and -0.78 respectively, significantly reduced. GH stimulation tests performed in a subgroup of 9 patients showed an insufficient peak GH response in at least one test in all tested patients. The values of LH, FSH oestradiol or testosterone were within the normal adult range. Serum markers of bone formation and bone resorption were in the normal range, indicating that bone turnover was normal at the time of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Bone development in patients cured of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is disturbed, resulting in a significantly reduced bone mineral density. Impaired growth hormone activity, as a long term effect of cranial irradiation, may be one of the underlying causes as well as the illness itself and the administered cytotoxic drugs. Since a reduced bone mineral density predispose patients to osteoporosis, intervention in order to improve bone mass should be considered.","['Hoorweg-Nijman, J J', 'Kardos, G', 'Roos, J C', 'van Dijk, H J', 'Netelenbos, C', 'Popp-Snijders, C', 'de Ridder, C M', 'Delemarre-van de Waal, H A']","['Hoorweg-Nijman JJ', 'Kardos G', 'Roos JC', 'van Dijk HJ', 'Netelenbos C', 'Popp-Snijders C', 'de Ridder CM', 'Delemarre-van de Waal HA']","['Department of Paediatrics, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Body Mass Index', '*Bone Density', 'Bone Remodeling', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Femur', 'Growth Hormone/blood', 'Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/blood', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Lumbar Vertebrae', 'Male', 'Pituitary Irradiation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*physiopathology/radiotherapy', '*Survivors']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1999 Feb;50(2):237-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00654.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', '9034-39-3 (Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone)']",,,['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00654.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Thirty-one patients and 18 controls had fat mass and lean body mass assessed by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), using a lunar DPX-L scanner. Serum leptin concentrations were also measured in 27 patients and all controls. Growth hormone status had previously been determined using an insulin tolerance test and arginine stimulation test. Nine patients were classified as severe growth hormone (GH) deficient (group 1), 12 patients as GH insufficient (group 2) and 11 patients as normal (group 3). RESULTS: BMI and absolute fat mass were not significantly different between the patients and controls regardless of their gender (P = 0.1 and P = 0.14 respectively). In contrast, absolute lean mass was significantly reduced (P < 0.01) and leptin concentrations were significantly increased (P < 0.001) in patients compared with controls. BMI, fat mass and leptin concentrations but not lean mass were significantly different between the three GH status groups (P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P = 0.004, and P = 0.67 respectively). When leptin concentrations were expressed per unit of fat mass, they were increased in the patients compared with the controls (P = 0.03) with significant differences between the GH status groups (P = 0.004), being significantly higher in the severe GH deficient group. CONCLUSIONS: Young adults who receive cranial irradiation in childhood are prone to GH deficiency and hyperleptinaemia. The pathophysiological significance of the hyperleptinaemia remains to be established but it has occurred either as a consequence of radiation induced hypothalamic damage or GH deficiency.","['Brennan, B M', 'Rahim, A', 'Blum, W F', 'Adams, J A', 'Eden, O B', 'Shalet, S M']","['Brennan BM', 'Rahim A', 'Blum WF', 'Adams JA', 'Eden OB', 'Shalet SM']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Body Composition', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Hormone/deficiency', 'Humans', 'Hypothalamus/radiation effects', 'Leptin', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Obesity/blood/*etiology', 'Pituitary Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Proteins/*analysis', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1999 Feb;50(2):163-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00622.x.,"['0 (Leptin)', '0 (Proteins)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",,,['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00622.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The usefulness of such assays extends beyond refining diagnoses in that they also provide relevant prognostic information. Moreover, since most are based on the polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we are more sensitively able to monitor for residual disease after attempts at curative therapy, and our definition of remission has been dramatically altered. However, molecular genetic tests are not without limitations, and we must remain cognizant of their cost effectiveness and be aware of current deficiencies in standardization.

However, the recombination patterns display several unusual features as compared to normal lymphoid counterparts. Cross-lineage gene rearrangements occur in more than 90% of precursor-B-ALL and in approximately 20% of T-ALL, whereas they are rare in normal lymphocytes. Approximately 25-30% of the Ig and TCR gene rearrangements at diagnosis are oligoclonal, and can undergo continuing or secondary recombination events during the disease course. Based on our extensive molecular studies we hypothesize that the unusual Ig and TCR gene rearrangements in ALL occur as an early postoncogenic event resulting from the continuing V(D)J recombinase activity on accessible gene loci. This hypothesis is on the one hand supported by the virtual absence of cross-lineage gene rearrangements in normal lymphocytes and mature lymphoid malignancies and on the other hand by the presence of oligoclonality and secondary Ig and TCR gene rearrangements in ALL.","['Szczepanski, T', 'Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Langerak, A W', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Szczepanski T', 'Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Langerak AW', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Dept. of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*immunology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1999;246:205-13; discussion 214-5. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-60162-0_26.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,,['10.1007/978-3-642-60162-0_26 [doi]'],,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytogenetic analysis has revealed specific chromosomal aberrations in ALL as well as in NHL. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) is a novel molecular cytogenetic technique which allows the visualization of all human chromosomes in different colors, therefore greatly facilitating the recognition of chromosomal aberrations. The potential of SKY is exemplified by the fact that in our experience, 70% of the cases analyzed resulted in karyotypes where the majority of aberrations were either refined or new aberrations were detected when compared to their G-banding karyotypes. This also applies to the analysis of B-cell neoplasias. In hematologic malignancies, especially acute leukemias, specific chromosomal aberrations are of etiologic as well as diagnostic and prognostic importance. The identification of new recurrent chromosomal aberrations could therefore lead to a better characterization of disease entities or subgroups in ALL and NHL and further improve diagnosis, treatment stratification and ultimately prognosis. Interestingly, the comparison of the pattern of chromosomal aberrations in hematological neoplasias and carcinomas revealed striking differences. While about 50% of the aberrations in hematological malignancies are balanced translocations, such aberrations are exceedingly rare in epithelial cancers in which unbalanced structural and numerical aberrations prevail.","['Hilgenfeld, E', 'Padilla-Nash, H', 'Schrock, E', 'Ried, T']","['Hilgenfeld E', 'Padilla-Nash H', 'Schrock E', 'Ried T']","['Genetics Department, National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol,Current topics in microbiology and immunology,0110513,IM,,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Cytogenetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping/*methods', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Top Microbiol Immunol. 1999;246:169-74. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-60162-0_21.,,,,['10.1007/978-3-642-60162-0_21 [doi]'],,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we provided the evidence for specific P4.2 expression in erythroid cells during development (L. Zhu et al., 1998, Blood 91, 695-705). Using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells as a model, transcription of the P4.2 gene was found to be induced during erythroid differentiation. To examine the mechanism for this induction, we isolated the mouse P4.2 genomic DNA containing the 5' flanking sequence and defined the location of the P4.2 promoter. Transcription of the mouse P4.2 gene initiates at multiple sites, with the major initiation site mapped at 174 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon. The mouse P4.2 promoter is TATA-less and contains multiple potential binding sites for erythroid transcription factors GATA-1, NF-E2, EKLF, and tal-1/SCL. Transient transfection experiments demonstrated that a 1.7-kb mouse P4.2 promoter fused with the luciferase coding regions was induced in DMSO-treated MEL cells. Deletion analysis showed that a 259-bp P4.2 promoter DNA (nucleotide position -88 to +171 relative to the major transcription initiation site designated +1), containing a GATA-binding site at position -29 to -24, could still respond to the induction in differentiated MEL cells. Importantly, mutations in the -29/-24 GATA motif rendered the promoter unresponsive to DMSO induction. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that GATA-1 could bind to the -29/-24 GATA motif and this was confirmed by the observation that the nuclear protein bound to the motif was supershifted by an anti-GATA-1 monoclonal antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1 plays an important role in the induction of P4.2 gene expression during erythroid cell differentiation.","['Karacay, B', 'Chang, L S']","['Karacay B', 'Chang LS']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43205-2696, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry/cytology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/09 00:00,1999/07/09 00:01,['1999/07/09 00:00'],"['1999/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1999 Jul 1;59(1):6-17. doi: 10.1006/geno.1999.5846.,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (erythrocyte membrane band 4.2 protein)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,"['10.1006/geno.1999.5846 [doi]', 'S0888-7543(99)95846-9 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,['GENBANK/AF102234'],,,,,,,,,,,

Rodent cells and mice defective in these components are radiation-sensitive and defective in V(D)J-recombination, showing that NHEJ also functions to rejoin DSBs introduced during lymphocyte development [7] [8]. 180BR is a radiosensitive cell line defective in DSB repair, which was derived from a leukaemia patient who was highly sensitive to radiotherapy [9] [10] [11]. We have identified a mutation within a highly conserved motif encompassing the active site in DNA ligase IV from 180BR cells.

NK109 (3) had the highest activity among them. NK109 is similar in structure to fagaronine and fagaridine; however, it has a phenolic-OH at C-7. NK109 exists as a resonance hybrid, the keto-amine and zwitterionic forms in neutral media. The resonance hybrid is cationic and has molecular planarity; these have been considered to be essential for the antitumor activity of the benzo[c]phenanthridinium salts. On the other hand, the structurally similar benzo[c]phenthridine alkaloids, chelerythrine and sanguinarine, exist as pseudobases under the same conditions. The latter do not exhibit antitumor activity in vivo, probably because they lose both the immonium region and molecular planarity.

These dimeric analogues of the mixed topoisomerase I/II inhibitor N-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]acridine-4-carboxamide (DACA), currently in clinical trial, show superior potencies to the corresponding monomeric DACA analogues in a panel of cell lines, including wild-type (JLC) and mutant (JLA and JLD) forms of human Jurkat leukemia. The latter mutant lines are resistant to topoisomerase II targeted agents because of lower levels of the enzyme. Analogues with small substituents (e.g., Me, Cl) at the acridine 5-position were clearly superior, with IC50's as low as 2 nM against the Lewis lung carcinoma and 11 nM against JLC. Larger substituents at any position caused a steady decrease in potency, likely due to lowering of DNA binding affinity. A small series of analogues of the most potent bis(5-methylDACA) compound, with second substituents (Me and Cl) in the 1- or 8- position had broadly similar potencies to the 5-Me compound, indicating that, while the 1- and 8-substituents are acceptable, they add little to the enhancing effect of the 5-methyl group. All of the compounds were at least equitoxic (some up to 4-fold more cytotoxic) against the mutant Jurkat lines than in the wild-type, consistent with a relatively greater effect on topoisomerase I compared with topoisomerase II. The bis(5-methylDACA) compound was found to inhibit the action of purified topoisomerase I in a cell-free assay. Compounds were on average 10-fold less cytotoxic in an MCF7 breast cancer line overexpressing P-glycoprotein than in the wild-type line and showed some selectivity for colon tumor lines in the NCI human tumor cell line panel. Several analogues produced significant growth delays in the relatively refractory subcutaneous colon 38 tumor model in vivo at substantially lower doses than DACA. The bis(acridine-4-carboxamides) represent a new and interesting class of potent topoisomerase inhibitors.","['Gamage, S A', 'Spicer, J A', 'Atwell, G J', 'Finlay, G J', 'Baguley, B C', 'Denny, W A']","['Gamage SA', 'Spicer JA', 'Atwell GJ', 'Finlay GJ', 'Baguley BC', 'Denny WA']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, The University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland 1000, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,,"['Acridines/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/08 00:00,1999/07/08 00:01,['1999/07/08 00:00'],"['1999/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1999 Jul 1;42(13):2383-93. doi: 10.1021/jm980687m.,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (N,N-bis(3-(5-bromoacridine-4-carboxamido)propyl)methylamine)', '0 (N,N-bis(3-(5-methylacridine-4-carboxamido)propyl)methylamine)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",,,"['10.1021/jm980687m [doi]', 'jm980687m [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To modify its host range, we have engineered the FPV HA to display four different polypeptides on its N terminus: the epidermal growth factor, an anti-human MHC class I molecules scFv (single-chain antibody), an anti-melanoma antigen scFv, and an IgG Fc-binding polypeptide. All recombinant HA glycoproteins were correctly expressed and processed, and efficiently incorporated into Mo-MuLV retroviral particles, indicating that amino-terminal insertion of large polypeptides did not alter the conformation of HA chimeras. Virions carrying the different chimeras bound specifically to cells expressing the targeted cell surface molecules of each ligand. In addition, all virion types were infectious but exhibited various degrees of specificity regarding the use of the targeted cell surface molecule versus the wild-type FPV HA receptor for cell entry and infection. For some ligands tested, infectivity was significantly increased on cells that express the targeted receptor, compared with cells that express only the wild-type HA receptor. Furthermore, some polypeptides could abolish infectivity via the wild-type FPV HA receptor. Our data therefore indicate that it is possible to engineer the HA envelope glycoprotein by fusing ligands to its amino-terminal end without affecting its fusion activity.","['Hatziioannou, T', 'Delahaye, E', 'Martin, F', 'Russell, S J', 'Cosset, F L']","['Hatziioannou T', 'Delahaye E', 'Martin F', 'Russell SJ', 'Cosset FL']","['Laboratoire de Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, INSERM U412, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Binding Sites', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Influenza A virus/genetics', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Peptides/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virion/metabolism']",1999/07/08 00:00,1999/07/08 00:01,['1999/07/08 00:00'],"['1999/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 Jun 10;10(9):1533-44. doi: 10.1089/10430349950017860.,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",,,['10.1089/10430349950017860 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found CD1A to be a biallelic locus with a common allele which was present in the majority of the individuals studied. The second allele differed from the common one by a single-point mutation, resulting in a change of Cys to Trp at position 52 in the alpha1 domain. This second allele was found in heterozygosis in 7 out of 70 Caucasians from Europe (allelic frequencies P=0.95 and q=0.05). In the Chinese population, we found the second allele present in heterozygosis in 19 from the 44 individuals studied, and we also found 6 homozygous individuals for the second allele (allelic frequencies P=0.64 and q=0.35).

We have studied the effects of 4-HPR on neuroblastoma cell lines. Since neuroblastomas commonly relapse in bone marrow, a hypoxic tissue compartment, and many chemotherapeutic agents are antagonized by hypoxia, our purpose was to study in these cell lines several factors influencing 4-HPR-induced cytotoxicity, including induced levels of ROS, effects of physiologic hypoxia and antioxidants, levels of ceramide, and the mechanism of cell death. METHODS: ROS generation was measured by carboxydichlorofluorescein diacetate fluoresence. Ceramide was quantified by radiolabeling and thin-layer chromatography. Immunoblotting was used to assess p53 protein levels. Apoptosis (programmed cell death) and necrosis were analyzed by nuclear morphology and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation patterns. Cytotoxicity was measured by a fluorescence-based assay employing digital imaging microscopy in the presence or absence of the pancaspase enzyme inhibitor BOC-d-fmk. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: In addition to increasing ROS, 4-HPR (2.5-10 microM) statistically significantly increased the level of intracellular ceramide (up to approximately 10-fold; P<.001) in a dose-dependent manner in two neuroblastoma cell lines, one of which is highly resistant to alkylating agents and to etoposide. Cell death induced by 4-HPR was reduced but not abrogated by hypoxia in the presence or absence of an antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine. Expression of p53 protein was not affected by 4-HPR. Furthermore, the pan-caspase enzyme inhibitor BOC-d-fmk prevented apoptosis, but not necrosis, and only partially decreased cytotoxicity induced by 4-HPR, indicating that 4-HPR induced both apoptosis and necrosis in neuroblastoma cells.

In this study, we investigated the expression and function of CXCR3 on normal and malignant B cells from 65 patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLDs). Although CXCR3 is lacking on CD5(+) and CD5(-) B cells from healthy subjects, it is expressed on leukemic B lymphocytes from all (31/31) patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The presence of CXCR3 was heterogeneous in other B-cell disorders, being expressed in 2 of 7 patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), 4 of 12 patients with hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and 11 of 15 patients with other subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). Chemotaxis assay shows that normal B cells from healthy subjects do not migrate in response to IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and IFN-gamma-induced monokine (Mig). In contrast, a definite migration in response to IP-10 and Mig has been observed in all malignant B cells from patients with CLL, but not in patients with HCL or MCL (1/7 cases tested). Neoplastic B cells from other NHLs showed a heterogenous pattern. The migration elicited by IP-10 and Mig was inhibited by blocking CXCR3. No effect of IP-10 and Mig chemokines was observed on the cytosolic calcium concentration in malignant B cells. The data reported here demonstrate that CXCR3 is expressed on malignant B cells from CLDs, particularly in patients with CLL, and represents a fully functional receptor involved in chemotaxis of malignant B lymphocytes.","['Trentin, L', 'Agostini, C', 'Facco, M', 'Piazza, F', 'Perin, A', 'Siviero, M', 'Gurrieri, C', 'Galvan, S', 'Adami, F', 'Zambello, R', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Agostini C', 'Facco M', 'Piazza F', 'Perin A', 'Siviero M', 'Gurrieri C', 'Galvan S', 'Adami F', 'Zambello R', 'Semenzato G']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Clinical Immunology Branch, 35128 Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL10', 'Chemokines, CXC/pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/*physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1999 Jul;104(1):115-21. doi: 10.1172/JCI7335.,"['0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['10.1172/JCI7335 [doi]'],PMC408409,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a basis for studying the mechanism of deregulation of HOX11 expression in leukaemia, the locus containing the HOX11 proto-oncogene at 10q24 was cloned from a genomic P1 Artificial Chromosome (PAC) library. The PAC clone with an insert size of 120kb was isolated and mapped by restriction analysis. A series of contiguous subclones were then obtained which span 20kb surrounding the HOX11 gene. These subclones were used to sequence across the entire 20kb region to the 3' boundary of the PAC insert. This work provides for the first time the full intron and 5' non-coding sequences of the HOX11 gene which will aid the identification of novel transcriptional control elements which may be involved in silencing HOX11 expression in normal cells. The sequence information was also used to search for novel large open reading frames (ORFs). One such ORF (1.1kb) would encode a protein of at least 39kDa. This basic protein (pI, 12.5) would be very proline rich and could potentially encode a novel transcription factor. In order to establish if this ORF corresponds to a bona fide transcribed gene, RT-PCR analysis was performed.

Each of these tends to associate with a specific leukaemia type, for example, MLL-AF9 is found mainly in acute myeloid leukaemia. We have studied the role of the Mll-AF9 gene fusion made in mouse embryonic stem cells by an homologous recombination knock-in. Acute leukaemias developed in heterozygous mice carrying this fusion as well as in chimeric mice. As with human chromosomal translocation t(9;11), the majority of cases were acute myeloid leukaemias (AMLs) involving immature myeloblasts, but a minority were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The AMLs were preceded by effects on haematopoietic differentiation involving a myeloproliferation resulting in accumulation of Mac-1/Gr-1 double-positive mature myeloid cells in bone marrow as early as 6 days after birth. Therefore, non-malignant expansion of myeloid precursors is the first stage of Mll-AF9-mediated leukaemia followed by accumulation of malignant cells in bone marrow and other tissues. Thus, the late onset of overt tumours suggests that secondary tumorigenic mutations are necessary for malignancy associated with MLL-AF9 gene fusion and that myeloproliferation provides the pool of cells in which such events can occur.","['Dobson, C L', 'Warren, A J', 'Pannell, R', 'Forster, A', 'Lavenir, I', 'Corral, J', 'Smith, A J', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Dobson CL', 'Warren AJ', 'Pannell R', 'Forster A', 'Lavenir I', 'Corral J', 'Smith AJ', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Division of Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Germ-Line Mutation/genetics', 'Heterozygote', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Kidney/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/pathology', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/pathology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1999 Jul 1;18(13):3564-74. doi: 10.1093/emboj/18.13.3564.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",,,['10.1093/emboj/18.13.3564 [doi]'],PMC1171435,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro experiments indicate that Brother family proteins regulate the DNA binding activity of Runt-domain proteins without contacting DNA. In both mouse and human there is genetic evidence that the CBF(alpha) and CBF(beta) proteins function together in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis. Here we demonstrate functional interactions between Brother proteins and Runt domain proteins in Drosophila. First, we show that a specific point mutation in Runt that disrupts interaction with Brother proteins but does not affect DNA binding activity is dysfunctional in several in vivo assays. Interestingly, this mutant protein acts dominantly to interfere with the Runt-dependent activation of Sxl-lethal transcription. To investigate further the requirements for Brother proteins in Drosophila development, we examine the effects of expression of a Brother fusion protein homologous to the dominant negative CBF(beta)::SMMHC fusion protein that is associated with leukemia in humans. This Bro::SMMHC fusion protein interferes with the activity of Runt and a second Runt domain protein, Lozenge. Moreover, we find that the effects of lozenge mutations on eye development are suppressed by expression of wild-type Brother proteins, suggesting that Brother/Big brother dosage is limiting in this developmental context. Results obtained when Runt is expressed in developing eye discs further support this hypothesis. Our results firmly establish the importance of the Brother and Big brother proteins for the biological activities of Runt and Lozenge, and further suggest that Brother protein function is not restricted to enhancing DNA-binding.","['Li, L H', 'Gergen, J P']","['Li LH', 'Gergen JP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology and the Institute for Cell and Developmental Biology, SUNY at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Drosophila/*genetics/*growth & development/physiology', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Eye/*growth & development', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Insect', 'Humans', 'Insect Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Point Mutation', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1999 Aug;126(15):3313-22.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Sxl protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (lz protein, Drosophila)', '0 (run protein, Drosophila)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In d,l-alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)-resistant L1210 cells stimulated to grow from quiescence, treatment with PD98059 inhibited p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation and the induction of ODC activity and protein. A marked reduction of the accumulation of mature ODC mRNA and its intron-containing precursor was observed, whereas ODC turnover was hardly affected. PD98059 also reduced the content of antizyme, but not that of antizyme mRNA. U0126, a novel and more potent inhibitor of MEK1/2, provoked a dose-dependent inhibition of ODC induction at lower concentrations with respect to PD98059. Other effective inhibitors of ODC induction proved to be genistein, manumycin A, herbimycin A, LY294002, wortmannin and KT5823, suggesting the involvement of other key proteins of signal-transduction pathways, i.e. Ras, Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which may have a positive impact on MAPK. Cells kept in a DFMO-free medium, and thus containing high levels of putrescine and spermidine, showed enhanced MAPK phosphorylation and lower sensitivity to PD98059, compared with cells maintained in the presence of DFMO. In conclusion, these results indicate that the activation of p44/42 MAPK may favour the expression of ODC, and that polyamines, in turn, may affect the phosphorylation state of MAPK.","['Flamigni, F', 'Facchini, A', 'Capanni, C', 'Stefanelli, C', 'Tantini, B', 'Caldarera, C M']","['Flamigni F', 'Facchini A', 'Capanni C', 'Stefanelli C', 'Tantini B', 'Caldarera CM']","[""Dipartimento di Biochimica 'G.

The conditioning regimen included total-body irradiation and cyclophosphamide; etoposide was added to the regimen of patients in the accelerated phase. Continuous-infusion cyclosporine and pulse methotrexate were administered to all patients for prophylaxis of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). All patients achieved hematologic and cytogenetic remission. At a median follow-up of 37 months, the freedom from progression (FFP) and overall survival (OS) were 90 and 82%, respectively. None of the patients in accelerated phase have relapsed. Five patients have died of late transplant-related complications while in complete remission. Acute GVHD of grade > or = II was observed in 20% (14% grade II, 6% grade III). Fifty-one percent of patients developed limited chronic GVHD. The median posttransplant creatinine level was 1.2 mg/dL (range 0.6-4.2). Renal dysfunction, manifested as a persistent elevation in serum creatinine level (> 1.2 mg/dL), was observed in 40% of the patients. Only 8.5% had a creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dL, and no patient required dialysis as a result of renal dysfunction. Seven patients (18.9%) developed pulmonary complications, which included idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (two), biopsy-proven interstitial fibrosis (four), and alveolar hemorrhage (one). The low relapse rate observed in this study may reflect the use of splenic RT as a part of the cytoreductive regimen before BMT. The fractionation schedule of 500 cGy in five daily fractions was well tolerated and did not appear to increase the toxicity of the preparative regimen. These favorable results indicate that splenic RT deserves further investigation and may be of benefit as a part of the conditioning regimen for patients receiving allogeneic BMT for CML.","['Jabro, G', 'Koc, Y', 'Boyle, T', 'Schenkein, D P', 'Ravalese, J', 'Wazer, D', 'Miller, K B']","['Jabro G', 'Koc Y', 'Boyle T', 'Schenkein DP', 'Ravalese J', 'Wazer D', 'Miller KB']","['Department of Radiation Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Tufts University School of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Spleen/*radiation effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(3):173-9. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392963.,['AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)'],,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2000;6(2A):211-3.

The reasons for this are 1) autologous transplantation lacks the in vivo graft-vs.-tumor (GVT) effect associated with allogeneic SCT, which is effective in controlling or eliminating residual malignant cells remaining in the body after high-dose therapy, and 2) contaminating malignant cells in the autologous graft are reinfused into the body. Some researchers have attempted to administer immunomodulatory cytokines to simulate a GVT effect, and although this has shown some efficacy, it has several disadvantages. These include high toxicity associated with systemic administration, a short in vivo half-life, and insufficient levels reaching the site of residual disease. As an alternative, we investigated whether delivery of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-2 to the bone marrow can exert an antileukemic effect while avoiding the problems associated with systemic administration. We describe the delivery of IL-2 to the bone marrow by transplantation of syngeneic bone marrow, retrovirally transduced with the gene for IL-2, into lethally irradiated mice. We were able to efficiently transduce murine bone marrow with the IL-2 gene without adversely affecting clonogenic output from hematopoietic progenitors, and we were able to achieve expression of the transgene in transplanted animals. However, IL-2 transduction inhibited hematopoietic reconstitution in lethally irradiated mice. Marrow transduced with high-titer, high-expressing IL-2 retrovirus failed to engraft, and a low-titer, low-expressing IL-2 retrovirus also demonstrated reduced engraftment, although engraftment was sufficient to support survival of transplanted mice. Long-term, low-level expression of the IL-2 transgene was detectable in these mice and was effective in exerting an antileukemic effect. Mice transplanted with control marrow and challenged with leukemic cells suffered 100% mortality within 70 days, whereas mice transplanted with IL-2-transduced marrow exhibited 50% survival over the 175-day duration of this study. The work shows that delivery of immunomodulatory cytokines to the bone marrow can be achieved by transplantation of genetically modified hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, low-level IL-2 expression can exert an antileukemic effect. These data suggest that this may be an effective immunotherapeutic strategy to reduce relapse after autologous transplantation, but the selection and expression of the cytokine must be carefully considered to minimize adverse effects on hematopoiesis.","['Tam, Y K', 'Klingemann, H G']","['Tam YK', 'Klingemann HG']","['Section of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rush Cancer Institute, Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA. ytam@rush.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects/virology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(3):144-54. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392960.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,"['S1083-8791(99)50019-0 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392960 [doi]']",,,,,,,['Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(4):231-42.

These mice are specifically tolerant to donor and host antigens. When nontolerant donor T cells are given to chimeras several months after BMT, full donor-type chimerism develops, but graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) does not occur. The induction of such lymphohematopoietic GVH reactions without GVHD could provide an approach to separating graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) from GVHD in patients with hematologic malignancies. To make the nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen described above more cytoreductive for such malignancies, we have now modified it by replacing TBI with cyclophosphamide (CP). Treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs on day -5, 200 mg/kg CP on day -1, and 7 Gy thymic irradiation on day 0 was only slightly myelosuppressive and allowed fully major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched (with or without multiple minor antigen disparities) allogeneic bone marrow to engraft and establish long-term mixed chimerism in 40 to 82% of recipients in three different strain combinations. The administration of nontolerant donor spleen cells at 5 weeks or at 5, 8, and 11 weeks posttransplant was capable of eliminating host hematopoietic cells, leading to full or nearly full donor chimerism in six of six and two of four chimeric animals in two different strain combinations. No clinical evidence of GVHD was observed in any recipients of these donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). These studies demonstrate that induction of mixed chimerism with nonmyeloablative conditioning followed at appropriate times by DLI might allow lymphohematopoietic GVH reactions, and hence GVL effects, to eliminate chronic hematologic malignancies without causing clinically significant GVHD.","['Pelot, M R', 'Pearson, D A', 'Swenson, K', 'Zhao, G', 'Sachs, J', 'Yang, Y G', 'Sykes, M']","['Pelot MR', 'Pearson DA', 'Swenson K', 'Zhao G', 'Sachs J', 'Yang YG', 'Sykes M']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Section, Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Chimera/*drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*prevention & control', '*Graft vs Host Reaction/drug effects/immunology', 'Hematopoiesis/immunology', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukocytes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(3):133-43. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392959.,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],,,"['S1083-8791(99)50018-9 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392959 [doi]']",,,['R01 CA64912/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with these delayed infusions of donor cells has been called delayed or donor leukocyte infusion (DLI). While graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) has typically been less severe than expected after DLI, it still remains a significant risk factor. Recently, we used a full major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-mismatched model (C57BL/6 into AKR) to determine how increased immunogenetic disparity affects GVH and graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) reactions after DLI. In contrast to an MHC-matched model (B10.BR into AKR), GVHD was still observed when MHC-mismatched donor T cells were infused 3 weeks posttransplant. Limiting dilution analysis was used to determine the frequency of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and interleukin (IL)-2-secreting T helper cells in the spleens of MHC-mismatched recipients 7 days after DLI treatment. GVHD correlated with elevated frequencies of alloreactive T-helper cells. One strategy for reducing the severity of GVHD after DLI is the selective administration of CD4 or CD8 T-subsets. Delayed infusion of purified T-subsets 3 weeks posttransplant resulted in significantly less GVHD than infusion of a mixture of the two subsets. No GVH-associated mortality was observed after DLI with purified donor CD4+ T cells. In GVL studies, MHC-mismatched CD8+ T cells were the most potent antitumor effectors against an acute T cell leukemia. The GVL effect of MHC-mismatched T-subsets was compared with that of MHC-matched subsets. When naive MHC-matched cells were given as DLI, depletion of either T-subset eliminated the GVL effect. CD8+ T cells from MHC-matched donors primed against host alloantigens, however, mediated a CD4 (T-helper)-independent GVL reaction. Together, these results suggest that administration of T-subsets can significantly reduce GVHD after DLI without loss of the beneficial GVL effect.","['Johnson, B D', 'Becker, E E', 'Truitt, R L']","['Johnson BD', 'Becker EE', 'Truitt RL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA. bjohnson@mcw.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/mortality/therapy', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/07/07 00:00,1999/07/07 00:01,['1999/07/07 00:00'],"['1999/07/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/07 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1999;5(3):123-32. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392958.,,,,"['S1083-8791(99)50017-7 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.1999.v5.pm10392958 [doi]']",,,"['CA39854/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zymosan-induced AA liberation was markedly inhibited by methyl arachidonoyl fluorophosphonate, a dual inhibitor of group IV cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and iPLA2. We found that a relatively specific iPLA2 inhibitor, bromoenol lactone, significantly decreased the zymosan-induced AA liberation in parallel with the decrease in iPLA2 activity, without an effect on diacylglycerol formation. Consistent with this, attenuation of iPLA2 activity by a group VI iPLA2 antisense oligonucleotide resulted in a decrease in zymosan-induced prostaglandin D2 generation. These findings suggest that zymosan-induced AA liberation may be, at least in part, mediated by iPLA2. A protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor diminished zymosan-induced AA liberation, while a PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), enhanced the liberation. Bromoenol lactone suppressed the PMA-enhanced AA liberation without any effect on PMA-induced PKC activation. Down-regulation of PKCalpha on prolonged exposure to PMA also decreased zymosan-induced AA liberation. Under these conditions, the remaining AA liberation was insensitive to bromoenol lactone. Furthermore, the PKC depletion suppressed increases in iPLA2 proteins and the activity in the membrane fraction of zymosan-stimulated cells. In contrast, the zymosan-induced increases in iPLA2 proteins and the activity in the fraction were facilitated by simultaneous addition of PMA. Although intracellular Ca2+ depletion prevented zymosan-induced AA liberation, the translocation of PKCalpha to membranes was also inhibited. Taken together, we propose that zymosan may stimulate iPLA2-mediated AA liberation, probably through a PKC-dependent mechanism.","['Akiba, S', 'Mizunaga, S', 'Kume, K', 'Hayama, M', 'Sato, T']","['Akiba S', 'Mizunaga S', 'Kume K', 'Hayama M', 'Sato T']","['Department of Pathological Biochemistry, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Misasagi, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto 607-8414, Japan. akiba@mb.kyoto-phu.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Group VI Phospholipases A2', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Naphthalenes', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Organophosphonates', 'Phospholipases A/*metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Pyrones', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zymosan']",1999/07/03 00:00,1999/07/03 00:01,['1999/07/03 00:00'],"['1999/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jul 9;274(28):19906-12. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.28.19906.,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '0 (Pyrones)', '0 (methyl arachidonylfluorophosphonate)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '88070-98-8 (6-(bromomethylene)tetrahydro-3-(1-naphthaleneyl)-2H-pyran-2-one)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Group VI Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Pla2g6 protein, mouse)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.28.19906 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)87112-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-inflammatory agents salicylates have been proposed to act in part by inhibiting NF-kappaB. We have therefore studied the effects of sodium salicylate on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced kappaB-binding activity and on cytokine and chemokine gene expression in the RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line and compared them to those of an established NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). PDTC (100 microM) completely abrogated LPS-induced kappaB-binding activity and also profoundly inhibited the induction of interleukin 1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and MCP-1 and, to a lesser extent, leukemia inhibitory factor, RANTES, and IL-1Ra. In contrast, sodium salicylate (15 to 20 mM) had no effect on NF-kappaB activation but, nevertheless, suppressed several LPS-induced cytokine and chemokine genes to a degree similar to that obtained with PDTC. However, compared to PDTC, sodium salicylate caused significantly less inhibition of IL-1Ra and IL-10 gene expression after LPS stimulation. Neither LPS-induced MIP-1alpha, MIP-1beta, nor MIP-2 was significantly affected by PDTC or sodium salicylate, demonstrating that NF-kappaB is dispensable for the transcriptional regulation of these genes by LPS. In summary, these results suggest that both NF-kappaB-dependent and NF-kappaB-independent pathways are necessary for the induction by LPS of a complex cytokine and chemokine response. In the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line, suprapharmacological concentrations of sodium salicylate exert a potent inhibitory effect on LPS-induced cytokine gene induction but appear to accomplish this by interfering with NF-kappaB-independent pathways of activation.","['Lemay, S', 'Lebedeva, T V', 'Singh, A K']","['Lemay S', 'Lebedeva TV', 'Singh AK']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Nephrology, New England Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA. serge.lemay@lan1.molonc.mcgill.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol,Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology,9421292,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chemokines/genetics', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Sodium Salicylate/*pharmacology', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology']",1999/07/03 00:00,1999/07/03 00:01,['1999/07/03 00:00'],"['1999/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Diagn Lab Immunol. 1999 Jul;6(4):567-72. doi: 10.1128/CDLI.6.4.567-572.1999.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', 'WIQ1H85SYP (Sodium Salicylate)']",,,['10.1128/CDLI.6.4.567-572.1999 [doi]'],PMC95729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax stimulates HTLV-I transcription through high affinity binding to the KIX domain of CBP, a pleiotropic coactivator. Several cellular proteins, including c-jun, also bind to KIX and utilize CBP as a coactivator. To test whether Tax binding to KIX may disable cellular CBP function, we examined the potential interplay between Tax and c-jun for binding to KIX. We show that Tax represses the transcription function of c-jun in vivo and demonstrate that both transcription factors bind to an overlapping minimal region of KIX in vitro. c-jun binding to KIX is displaced by Tax, indicating that their binding is mutually exclusive and providing a molecular basis for the observed repression. The competition between Tax and cellular transcription factors for CBP represents a novel pathway for HTLV-I dependent deregulation of gene expression, and may have significant implications for cellular homeostasis and transformation in the HTLV-I infected T-cell.","['Van Orden, K', 'Yan, J P', 'Ulloa, A', 'Nyborg, J K']","['Van Orden K', 'Yan JP', 'Ulloa A', 'Nyborg JK']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523-1870, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1999/07/03 00:00,1999/07/03 00:01,['1999/07/03 00:00'],"['1999/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jun 24;18(25):3766-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202703.,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202703 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth of cell lines expressing inactive HER1 is inhibited on IRF-1 activation. In contrast, the same cells are killed by apoptosis when HER1 and IRF-1 are activated simultaneously. We identified promoters stimulated synergistically by IRF-1 and by activated HER1. To determine the signals causing transcriptional synergism and/or apoptosis we tried to modulate these effects by various dominant negative acting proteins.

NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts engineered to overexpress NPM-MLF1 grew normally but serum deprivation triggered apoptotic cell death with slower kinetics than did other well-known apoptotic inducers such as c-Myc or E2F-1. Quantitative analysis of apoptotic induction confirmed that, neither NPM nor MLF1, but the NPM-MLF1 fusion protein was able to induce apoptosis. Analyses using a variety of deletion mutants of NPM-MLF1 revealed that induction of apoptosis required the N-terminal domain of MLF1 and the NPM domain containing nuclear localization signal and that removal of the NPM dimerization domain markedly impaired the ability to induce apoptosis. Co-expression of Bcl-2 rescued NIH3T3 fibroblasts from NPM-MLF1-mediated cell death without affecting the expression level or the subcellular localization of NPM-MLF1 and enabled cells to progress into S phase in low serum.

It is conveniently managed by hospitalization and empiric administration of parenteral antibiotics. This study attempted to determine whether pediatric cancer patients with F&N identified as low risk for morbidity and mortality by clinical criteria at the time of presentation could be treated safely as outpatients. METHODS: Seventy-three episodes of F&N in 41 patients were studied prospectively over 2 years. Eligibility criteria included age > or =2 years, reliable caretakers, and residence within 1 hour of the hospital. Exclusion criteria included hemodynamic instability, dehydration, severe mucositis, pneumonia, leukemia/lymphoma induction therapy, bone marrow transplantation, or other serious comorbidity. Patients were evaluated, received a single dose of intravenous ceftazidime, and were observed for 3-16 hours. They were randomized to receive either oral ciprofloxacin or intravenous ceftazidime as outpatients. Patients were seen daily until they had been afebrile for at least 48 hours and had a rising absolute phagocyte count of >500 cells/microL. RESULTS: Sixty-three of 73 episodes (86%) were successfully managed on an outpatient basis. For 31 of 33 episodes in the ceftazidime arm, the patients remained outpatients, compared with 32 of 40 in the ciprofloxacin arm; this difference was not statistically significant. On average, patients remained febrile for 2.7 days and were treated for 4.7 days. Seventy-seven percent of episodes required no modification of initial antibiotic therapy. Of the 10 patients who were hospitalized, 4 had prolonged fever and 3 had emesis. Protracted neutropenia was associated with the need for hospitalization. There were no deaths, intensive care unit transfers, or serious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Carefully selected low risk children with fever and neutropenia can be treated safely as outpatients.

A possible sex-determined risk linked to the ABO blood group genes.,233-6,"Acute leukemia is more common in males at almost every age, and this fact remains unexplained. A study was carried out in northeast peninsular Malaysia, where the population is predominantly Malay, to examine whether there was a difference in ABO blood group distribution between males and females with acute leukemia (AL). The ABO blood groups of 109 male and 79 female patients with AL (98 ALL, 90 AML) were compared with those of 1019 controls. In the control population, 39.7% were group O. Among males with AL, 39.4% were group O, whereas among females with AL, the proportion was 24.1% (p=0.03). The same trend to a lower proportion of group O among females was seen if the group was divided into adult/pediatric or lymphoblastic/myeloblastic groups, though these differences were not statistically significant. If these findings can be confirmed, they suggest the presence of a ""sex-responsive"" gene near to the ABO gene locus on chromosome 9, which relatively protects group O women against AL, at least in our population. The existence of such a gene might also partly explain why acute leukemia, and possibly other childhood cancers, are more common in males.","['Jackson, N', 'Menon, B S', 'Zarina, W', 'Zawawi, N', 'Naing, N N']","['Jackson N', 'Menon BS', 'Zarina W', 'Zawawi N', 'Naing NN']","['School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan. jackson@charis.co.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['ABO Blood-Group System/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Malaysia/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Determination Processes', 'Sex Ratio']",1999/07/03 00:00,1999/07/03 00:01,['1999/07/03 00:00'],"['1999/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 May;78(5):233-6. doi: 10.1007/s002770050507.,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],,,['10.1007/s002770050507 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When 1 x 10(7) cells of TF-1, a human erythroleukemia cell line, were transplanted into the peritoneum of irradiated Tg-SCID mice (TF-1 ip/Tg-SCID mice), TF-1 cells grew in both the single cell suspension form (asTF-1) and solid form in ascites and invaded various tissues: lungs, liver, pancreas, and genitals, 3-6 weeks following transplantation. Subsequently, 0.5-1 x 10(7) cells of UT-7/GM, a subline of the UT-7 human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, grown in the back of hGM-CSF Tg-SCID mice after subcutaneous inoculation, were transplanted into the peritoneum of other irradiated hGM-CSF Tg-SCID mice. After 4 weeks, UT-7/GM cells (asUT-7/GM) also grew in the same manner as TF-1 cells in hGM-CSF Tg-SCID mice. Analysis of the cells from the peritoneum and tissues by PCR amplifying ALU and human GM-CSF receptor beta sequences and by immunohistochemical staining using anti-human CD45 revealed that they possessed the original characteristics of the parental cells. To confirm the usefulness of this human AML-ascites model, experimental treatment of AML cells grown in these mice was carried out with a differentiation inducer, delta-aminolevulinic acid (deltaALA), which induces hemoglobin synthesis for TF-1 in vitro and is thus regarded as an anti-leukemia drug candidate. Unexpectedly, growth promotion of TF-1 cells was observed in the treated TF-1 ip/hIL-3 Tg-SCID mice without differentiation to erythroid cells after treatment with delta-ALA (5 mM) for 7 days. These results indicate that Tg-SCID mice can support the growth of human hematopoietic growth factor-dependent AML cell lines which are usually rejected by SCID mice, without modification of the parental cell characteristics. In addition, this Tg-SCID leukemia-ascites model may become a useful preclinical tool for estimation of drug efficacy in vivo, since the drug candidate which was promising in vitro did not act in the same manner in vivo.","['Fukuchi, Y', 'Miyakawa, Y', 'Kizaki, M', 'Umezawa, A', 'Shimamura, K', 'Kobayashi, K', 'Kuramochi, T', 'Hata, J', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Tamaoki, N', 'Nomura, T', 'Ueyama, Y', 'Ito, M']","['Fukuchi Y', 'Miyakawa Y', 'Kizaki M', 'Umezawa A', 'Shimamura K', 'Kobayashi K', 'Kuramochi T', 'Hata J', 'Ikeda Y', 'Tamaoki N', 'Nomura T', 'Ueyama Y', 'Ito M']","['Central Institute for Experimental Animals, Miyamae, Kawasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Ascites/metabolism/pathology/*veterinary', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/*veterinary', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID/*metabolism', 'Mice, Transgenic/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1999/07/03 00:00,1999/07/03 00:01,['1999/07/03 00:00'],"['1999/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 May;78(5):223-31. doi: 10.1007/s002770050506.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",,,['10.1007/s002770050506 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two isoforms of IMPDH have been identified. IMPDH Type I is ubiquitous and predominantly present in normal cells, whereas IMPDH Type II is predominant in malignant cells. IMPDH plays an important role in the expression of cellular genes, such as p53, c-myc and Ki-ras. IMPDH activity is transformation and progression linked in cancer cells. IMPDH inhibitors, tiazofurin, selenazofurin, and benzamide riboside share similar mechanism of action and are metabolized to their respective NAD analogues to exert antitumor activity. Tiazofurin exhibits clinical responses in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis. These responses relate to the level of the NAD analogue formed in the leukemic cells. Resistance to tiazofurin and related IMPDH inhibitors relate mainly to a decrease in NMN adenylyltransferase activity. IMPDH inhbitors induce apoptosis. IMPDH inhitors are valuable probes for examining biochemical functions of GTP as they selectively reduce guanylate concentration. Incomplete depletion of cellular GTP level seems to down-regulate G-protein function, thereby inhibit cell growth or induce apoptosis. Inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH, EC 1.1.1.205) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of IMP to XMP utilizing NAD as the proton acceptor. Studies have demonstrated that IMPDH is a rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of guanylates, including GTP and dGTP. The importance of IMPDH is central because dGTP is required for the DNA synthesis and GTP plays a major role not only for the cellular activity but also for cellular regulation. Two isoforms of IMPDH have been demonstrated. IMPDH Type I is ubiquitous and predominately present in normal cells, whereas the IMPDH Type II enzyme is predominant in malignant cells. Although guanylates could be salvaged from guanine by the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8), the level of circulating guanine is low in dividing cells and this route is probably insufficient to satisfy the needs of guanylates in the cells.","['Jayaram, H N', 'Cooney, D A', 'Grusch, M', 'Krupitza, G']","['Jayaram HN', 'Cooney DA', 'Grusch M', 'Krupitza G']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 699 West St., Indianapolis, IN 46202-5119, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'Organoselenium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Ribavirin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/analysis/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Ribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*cdc25 Phosphatases']",1999/07/03 00:00,1999/07/03 00:01,['1999/07/03 00:00'],"['1999/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 1999 Jul;6(7):561-74.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '138385-29-2 (3-(1-deoxyribofuranosyl)benzamide)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25A protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'I5R2V02E8Z (selenazofurin)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",,,,,,,81,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Immunization Monitoring Program-Active (IMPACT).,7-14,"OBJECTIVE: Primarily, to determine the direct medical costs and productivity losses associated with complicated chickenpox (hospitalized cases) and, secondarily, to quantify the overall economic burden of chickenpox in Canada. METHODS: Direct medical resource consumption patterns were determined by chart review of 160 otherwise healthy children and 40 children with leukemia hospitalized for chickenpox. Children were selected from the database of the Immunization Monitoring Program Active (IMPACT), a network of 11 tertiary-care hospitals in Canada that collected information at the time of hospitalization from January 1991 to March 1996. An additional 26 healthy children hospitalized were recruited prospectively by IMPACT. Productivity losses (time lost from work and daily activities) were assessed by caregiver interviews. Treatment costs were determined from the patient, Ministry of Health, and societal perspectives. RESULTS: The average societal per case cost for complicated chickenpox in healthy children was $7060 and $8398, respectively, from the retrospective and prospective assessments. For children with leukemia, the direct medical cost was estimated at $7228. These costs were combined with a cost established previously for uncomplicated chickenpox. The estimated yearly overall economic impact of chickenpox in Canada was $122.4 million, with $24.0 million attributable to Ministry of Health costs, assuming an estimated yearly incidence of 346 527 cases and a 0.54% rate of hospitalization for healthy children. CONCLUSIONS: Direct medical costs are the major cost driver in the care of complicated chickenpox. However, in the context of the overall economic burden of the disease, uncomplicated chickenpox is the major cost driver, contributing 89% to the total cost.","['Law, B', 'Fitzsimon, C', 'Ford-Jones, L', 'McCormick, J', 'Riviere, M']","['Law B', 'Fitzsimon C', 'Ford-Jones L', 'McCormick J', 'Riviere M']","['University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Quintiles Canada Inc., Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,,"['Canada/epidemiology', 'Chickenpox/*complications/*economics/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cost of Illness', '*Direct Service Costs', 'Efficiency', 'Female', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hospitalization/*economics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 1999 Jul;104(1 Pt 1):7-14. doi: 10.1542/peds.104.1.7.,,,,['10.1542/peds.104.1.7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient population consisted of 168 patients with hematologic malignancies, 26 with severe aplastic anemia (SAA), and 22 with hemoglobinopathies, half of whom received marrow treated in vitro with Campath-1M (IgM) and half received marrow with Campath-1G (IgG2b isotype). Patients with durable engraftment had fast hematopoietic recovery: SAA patients reached ANC > 0.5 x 10(6)/L on Day 14; those with leukemia attained ANC > 0.5 x 10(6)/L on Days 18, 17, and 15 for ANLL, ALL and CML respectively, while patients with thalasemia reached ANC > 0.5 x 10(6)/L on Day 21. Overall, 24 patients (17 with leukemia, 4 with SAA, and 3 with thalassemia) suffered graft failure: 10 patients (all grafted with Campath-1M) rejected their grafts, while 14 others (9 grafted with Campath-1M, and 5 with 1G isotype) never engrafted (p = 0.009). Multivariate analysis revealed that neither pretransplant protocol, nor stage of disease or type of antibody used, donor sex and ABO match had any impact on engraftment. The variables favorably associated with engraftment were older age (p = 0.030, RR = 1.016) and CFU-GM number (p = 0.013, RR = 1.001). Patients with ANLL or SAA had a better chance to engraft (p = 0.027, RR = 1.400; and p = 0.003, RR = 2.677, respectively) compared to patients with thalassemia (p = 0.001, RR = 0.551). A higher concentration of Campath-1 antibody in vitro and in vivo adversely affected engraftment. Our data show that satisfactory engraftment can be achieved in patients transplanted with Campath-1 treated marrow allografts. However, despite the measures undertaken to prevent rejection, graft failure still poses a problem. Further pretransplant immunosuppression and perhaps more selective T-cell depletion may reduce the increased graft failure in these patients.","['Naparstek, E', 'Delukina, M', 'Or, R', 'Nagler, A', 'Kapelushnik, J', 'Varadi, G', 'Strauss, N', 'Cividalli, G', 'Aker, M', 'Brautbar, C', 'Waldmann, H', 'Hale, G', 'Slavin, S']","['Naparstek E', 'Delukina M', 'Or R', 'Nagler A', 'Kapelushnik J', 'Varadi G', 'Strauss N', 'Cividalli G', 'Aker M', 'Brautbar C', 'Waldmann H', 'Hale G', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. enaparst@cc.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['ABO Blood-Group System/genetics', 'Age Factors', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival/*drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nuclear Family', 'Rats', 'Sex Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'beta-Thalassemia/therapy']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Jul;27(7):1210-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00052-1.,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00052-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00052-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be of considerable use to develop a test that could be used prospectively to assess an individual patient's capacity to mobilize HPC. Twenty-two patients with lymphoma, myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia were given a single dose of 12 microg/kg SC of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Blood colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and CD34+ cells were scored prior to the test dose, and 72, 96, and 120 hours later. The patients were then mobilized with a standard cyclophosphamide and G-CSF regimen and had blood stem cells harvested. Patients were categorized as good, poor, or intermediate mobilizers on the basis of the CFU-GM/CD34+ cell harvest content and the number of aphereses required to reach established threshold counts. The outcome of cyclophosphamide/G-CSF mobilization was correlated with the response to the test dose of G-CSF. Good mobilizers had significantly higher peak CFU-GM values and CFU-GM increment in response to the test dose of G-CSF compared to intermediate and poor mobilizers. A peak CFU-GM count of > or = 250/mL identified the good mobilizers; conversely, all poor mobilizers had a peak CFU-GM count of <102/mL. An increment in CD34+ cells counts of > or = 2.5/microL was only observed in good mobilizers. The ""G-CSF"" test is a reliable test that can be used successfully for the assessment of mobilizable HPC in patients with hematologic malignancies.

However, the therapy is associated with clinically significant side effects such as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and bone marrow (BM) hypoplasia that may be avoided through the administration of T cells with specific antileukemic activity. Dendritic cells (DC) functioning as potent antigen presenting cells (APC) may play an important role in the generation of T cells with specificity against CML. We examined a subpopulation of CD1a+/CD14- DC generated in vitro from BM of normal subjects and patients with CML using granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). These DC derived from both the BM of normal subjects and of patients with CML, differentiated and matured in culture in a similar way. However, DC derived from patients with CML, displayed decreased activity when tested with allogeneic T cells in a mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). Addition of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) to DC cultures significantly upregulated the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (class I and class II) and costimulatory molecules (B7.1 and B7.2) on DC from normal donors and CML patients. However, DC grown from CML patients required a higher concentration of IFN-alpha. IFN-alpha also significantly improved the capacity of CML DC to stimulate T-lymphocyte responses. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed that only some CD1a+/CD14- DC derived from BM of patients with CML expressed the bcr/abl fusion gene.

Tax induction of NF-kappaB is presumed to be involved in proliferation and activation of primary leukemia cells in vivo. Recent studies have demonstrated that NF-kappaB activities in human T cells are mediated by at least four c-Rel-related DNA binding proteins - p50, p55, p75 and p85. We examined the significance of NF-kappaB induction in primary adult T cell leukemia cells and the induction kinetics of each of the four NF-kappaB species. Marked NF-kappaB activity was detected using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) in the primary cells of patients with acute disease, but little activity was noted in the cells of chronic patients. NF-kappaB activity was enhanced in a time-dependent manner in acute type cells cultured with mitogen-free medium; there was no induction of activity in chronic type cells. UV crosslinking demonstrated all four species of NFkappaB complex - high levels of p50 and lower levels of p55 and p75, in acute type cells; chronic type cells showed only the p50. As a control, normal resting T cells similarly showed only p50; control cells showed little change in activity when cultured without mitogenic stimulation, analogous to chronic type ATL. Northern blotting revealed enhancement of c-rel (encoding p85) and KBFI (encoding p50 and p55) expression in acute type cells during culture, while there was no significant enhancement of mRNAs in chronic type ATL cells or unstimulated normal T cells. Northern blotting also revealed that Tax is upregulated at the mRNA level in acute- but not chronic-type cells during culture. Expression of c-rel and KBF1 mRNAs in acute type cells appeared to be related to Tax mRNA expression. These results suggest that Tax is capable of inducing nuclear expression of all four NF-kappaB species in primary ATL cells of acute type patients, with marked effects on p55, p75, and p85. Tax induction of NF-kappaB species is regulated, at least in part, at a pretranslational level involving increases in c-rel and KBF1 mRNA.","['Arima, N', 'Matsushita, K', 'Obata, H', 'Ohtsubo, H', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Arimura, K', 'Kukita, T', 'Suruga, Y', 'Wakamatsu, S', 'Hidaka, S', 'Tei, C']","['Arima N', 'Matsushita K', 'Obata H', 'Ohtsubo H', 'Fujiwara H', 'Arimura K', 'Kukita T', 'Suruga Y', 'Wakamatsu S', 'Hidaka S', 'Tei C']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka, Japan. nao@med6.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Jul;27(7):1168-75. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00053-3.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00053-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00053-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+ cells from six normal volunteers were enriched by immune selection from steady-state bone marrow and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood (10 microg/kg/day for 5 days). Cell cycle status of the phenotypically primitive CD34+CD38- hematopoietic stem cell population was analyzed using a four-color flow cytometry technique that distinguished the G0, G1, and S/IG2/M phases of the cell cycle. Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to measure mRNA expression of the amphotropic retroviral receptor. Peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells had 2.6-fold more cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle compared to steady-state bone marrow. Furthermore, lineage CD34+CD38- cells from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood had a fourfold higher level of amphotropic retrovirus receptor mRNA. In conclusion, we found that CD34+ CD38- hematopoietic stem cells isolated from G-CSF mobilized peripheral blood differ from those isolated from steady-state bone marrow in that a significant proportion have entered the G1 phase of the cell cycle and express higher levels of amphotropic receptor mRNA. These biologic properties are consistent with the reported rapid recovery of hematopoietic function following transplantation with peripheral blood hematopoietic stem cells and make these cells a preferred target for retroviral-based gene transfer.","['Horwitz, M E', 'Malech, H L', 'Anderson, S M', 'Girard, L J', 'Bodine, D M', 'Orlic, D']","['Horwitz ME', 'Malech HL', 'Anderson SM', 'Girard LJ', 'Bodine DM', 'Orlic D']","['Laboratory of Host Defenses, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. mhorwitz@nig.gov']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', '*G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Organ Specificity', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Retroviridae/physiology']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Jul;27(7):1160-7. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00049-1.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00049-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00049-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic dose is relatively low, which reflects the large number of cellular targets affected by the chemotherapeutic agent as well as its inability to distinguish between normal and malignant cells. The discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in the process of transformation of normal cells into malignant cells has opened new areas of research in oncology, aimed at discovering drugs that could selectively inhibit their biological effects. This therapeutic modality, called an antisense strategy, has become a powerful tool for selectively reducing the expression of target genes in vitro, and there is increasing interest in the possibility of using the same technology in vivo for therapeutic purposes. In oncohematology, a number of trials have been initiated with antisense oligonucleotides directed against molecular targets, including the bcl-2, c-myc, bcr-abl, c-myb or p53 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. The experience gained from these studies will be applicable to the next generation of antisense compounds, which may include oligonucleotides with novel backbones or other structural modifications, as well as for expansion of the use of antisense oligonucleotides in combination approaches for the treatment of hematological malignancies.","['Warzocha, K']",['Warzocha K'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther,"Cytokines, cellular & molecular therapy",9713367,IM,,"['Animals', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/*therapeutic use']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokines Cell Mol Ther. 1999 Mar;5(1):15-23.,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)']",,,,,,,90,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoids and their analogues have been evaluated as chemoprevention agents, and also in the management of acute promyelocytic leukaemia. Retinoids exert most of their effects by binding to specific receptors and modulating gene expression. The development of new active retinoids and the identification of two distinct families of retinoid receptors has led to an increased understanding of the cellular effects of activation of these receptors.

The active site of JAK3 in this homology model measures roughly 8 A x 11 A x 20 A, with a volume of approximately 530 A3 available for inhibitor binding. Modeling studies indicated that 4-(phenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline (parent compound WHI-258) would likely fit into the catalytic site of JAK3 and that derivatives of this compound that contain an OH group at the 4' position of the phenyl ring would more strongly bind to JAK3 because of added interactions with Asp-967, a key residue in the catalytic site of JAK3. These predictions were consistent with docking studies indicating that compounds containing a 4'-OH group, WHI-P131 [4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], WHI-P154 [4-(3'-bromo-4'-hydroxylphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], and WHI-P97 [4-(3',5'-dibromo-4'-hydroxylphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazolin e], were likely to bind favorably to JAK3, with estimated K(i)s ranging from 0.6 to 2.3 microM. These compounds inhibited JAK3 in immune complex kinase assays in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, compounds lacking the 4'-OH group, WHI-P79 [4-(3'-bromophenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], WHI-P111 [4-(3'-bromo-4'-methylphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], WHI-P112 [4-(2',5'-dibromophenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], WHI-P132 [4-(2'-hydroxylphenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], and WHI-P258 [4-(phenyl)-amino-6,7-dimethoxyquinazoline], were predicted to bind less strongly, with estimated K(i)s ranging from 28 to 72 microM. These compounds did not show any significant JAK3 inhibition in kinase assays. Furthermore, the lead dimethoxyquinazoline compound, WHI-P131, which showed potent JAK3-inhibitory activity (IC50 of 78 microM), did not inhibit JAK1 and JAK2, the ZAP/SYK family tyrosine kinase SYK, the TEC family tyrosine kinase BTK, the SRC family tyrosine kinase LYN, or the receptor family tyrosine kinase insulin receptor kinase, even at concentrations as high as 350 microM. WHI-P131 induced apoptosis in JAK3-expressing human leukemia cell lines NALM-6 and LC1;19 but not in melanoma (M24-MET) or squamous carcinoma (SQ20B) cells. Leukemia cells were not killed by dimethoxyquinazoline compounds that were inactive against JAK3. WHI-P131 inhibited the clonogenic growth of JAK3-positive leukemia cell lines DAUDI, RAMOS, LC1;19, NALM-6, MOLT-3, and HL-60 (but not JAK3-negative BT-20 breast cancer, M24-MET melanoma, or SQ20B squamous carcinoma cell lines) in a concentration-dependent fashion.

The 67-kDa laminin receptor (67LR) is a nonintegrin protein with high affinity for laminin, which plays a critical role in basement membrane invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. By Western blotting, we documented that 67LR was strongly expressed in myelomonocytic THP1 and histiocytic U937 cells and was weakly expressed in promyelocytic HL-60 cells. In HL-60 cells, 67LR expression almost disappeared after retinoic-induced granulocytic differentiation, whereas it strongly increased after phorbol ester-induced monocytic differentiation. We did not detect 67LR expression in normal BM hematopoietic cells, in precursor-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or in chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase. By contrast, we detected enhanced 67LR expression in 40% of 53 de novo acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs), which frequently exhibited monocytic or myelomonocytic morphology and expressed CD14 and CD11a (P < 0.05). Using a colorimetric assay, we found that the expression pattern of this receptor corresponded to a higher adhesion to laminin; the adhesion was specific because in vitro addition to laminin-coated wells of recombinant 37-kDa laminin receptor precursor (37LRP), which is the cytoplasmic precursor containing both laminin-binding domains of cell surface 67LR, significantly reduced laminin binding of AML cells. The expression of 67LR on AML cell surface did not correlate with other differentiation and integrin antigens such as CD7, CD13, CD33, CD34, CD11b, CD11c, CD49d, CD49e, CD45RA, and CD45RO. In contrast with 67LR behavior in solid tumors, no statistically significant difference was found between 67LR expression and any hematological characteristic of the disease at diagnosis, nor between 67LR expression and outcome of the disease as measured by complete remission rate, disease-free survival, or overall survival. In conclusion, our results indicate that 67LR expression mediates specific adhesion to laminin and that the detection of this molecule may be a valuable addition to other lineage-associated antigens in identifying monocytic-oriented AML.","['Montuori, N', 'Selleri, C', 'Risitano, A M', 'Raiola, A M', 'Ragno, P', 'Del Vecchio, L', 'Rotoli, B', 'Rossi, G']","['Montuori N', 'Selleri C', 'Risitano AM', 'Raiola AM', 'Ragno P', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Rotoli B', 'Rossi G']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology and Pathology, Federico II University Medical School, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Laminin/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Survival Rate', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 Jun;5(6):1465-72.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, CS-682 showed strong cytotoxicity against human tumor cells comparable with that of CNDAC; both compounds displayed a similar broad spectrum. In vivo, however, orally administered CS-682 showed a more potent activity against human tumor xenografts than CNDAC, 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine, 5-fluorouracil and 2',2'-difluorodeoxycytidine. Moreover, CS-682 was effective against various human organ tumor xenografts at a wide dose range and with low toxicity, and was effective against P388 leukemic cells resistant to mitomycin-C, vincristine, 5-fluorouracil or cisplatin in syngeneic mice. CNDAC, an active metabolite of CS-682, had a prolonged plasma half-life after repeated oral administrations of CS-682 but not after oral administrations of CNDAC itself. This difference may partially explain the higher antitumor activity of CS-682 relative to CNDAC. In both CNDAC- and CS-682-treated carcinoma cells, CNDAC 5'-triphosphate (CNDACTP) was generated and incorporated into a DNA strand. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometric analysis of the nucleosides prepared by digestion of the DNA from the CNDAC-treated cells detected ddCNC (2'-Ccyano-2',3 '-didehydro-2',3 '-dideoxycytidine), which was shown to be generated only when the self-strand-breakage of CNDACTP-incorporated DNA occurred. The cytotoxicity of CNDAC was completely abrogated by the addition of 2'-deoxycytidine and was low against cells with decreased deoxycytidine kinase. Our results suggest that CNDAC is converted to CNDACMP by deoxycytidine kinase and that the resulting CNDACTP incorporated into a DNA strand as CNDACMP may induce DNA-self-strand-breakage. This novel DNA-self-strand-breaking mechanism may contribute to the potent antitumor activity of CS-682.","['Hanaoka, K', 'Suzuki, M', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Tanzawa, F', 'Tanaka, K', 'Shibayama, T', 'Miura, S', 'Ikeda, T', 'Iwabuchi, H', 'Nakagawa, A', 'Mitsuhashi, Y', 'Hisaoka, M', 'Kaneko, M', 'Tomida, A', 'Wataya, Y', 'Nomura, T', 'Sasaki, T', 'Matsuda, A', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Kurakata, S']","['Hanaoka K', 'Suzuki M', 'Kobayashi T', 'Tanzawa F', 'Tanaka K', 'Shibayama T', 'Miura S', 'Ikeda T', 'Iwabuchi H', 'Nakagawa A', 'Mitsuhashi Y', 'Hisaoka M', 'Kaneko M', 'Tomida A', 'Wataya Y', 'Nomura T', 'Sasaki T', 'Matsuda A', 'Tsuruo T', 'Kurakata S']","['Biological Research Laboratories, Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. hanaok@shina.sankyo.co.jp']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biotransformation', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Deoxycytidine/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'KB Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1999/07/02 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/07/02 10:00'],"['1999/07/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/07/02 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Jul 19;82(2):226-36. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990719)82:2<226::aid-ijc13>3.0.co;2-x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', ""134665-72-8 (2'-cyano-2'-deoxyarabinofuranosylcytosine)"", '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'W335P73C3L (sapacitabine)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990719)82:2<226::AID-IJC13>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990719)82:2<226::aid-ijc13>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Participating subjects consisted of 201 cases, diagnosed at 0 to 14 years of age during 1985-1993, ascertained from the records at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto), and 406 individually matched controls. Where possible, point-in-time measurements of magnetic fields were made in all residences occupied by subjects during the period of inquiry in the defined catchment area. Three different classification schemes of wire code were assigned to each residence. Detailed information was collected by interviewer-administered questionnaires, which enabled risk estimates to be adjusted for socio-economic characteristics, medical history of parent(s) and child and environmental exposures. Inconsistent elevations in risk were associated with time-weighted averages of magnetic fields both inside and outside the home for subjects having residential point-in-time measurements that represented at least 70% of their etiological period. These risks increased in magnitude when analysis was restricted to children under 6 years of age at diagnosis or to those with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Previously, we found that Tax binds to p16ink4a, a member of the INK4 family of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, and counteracts its inhibitory activity, resulting in cell cycle progression. In this study, we examined the effects of Tax on other members of the INK4 family and found that Tax can bind to p15ink4b similarly to p16ink4a, but not to p18ink4c and p19ink4d. Tax binding to p15ink4b inactivated its function and restored CDK4 kinase activity. Accordingly, Tax-expressing cells became resistant to p15ink4b-mediated growth arrest induced by TGFbeta. On the other hand, expression of p18ink4c was transcriptionally repressed by Tax through the E-box element of the promoter, which may contribute to the marked reduction of p18ink4c mRNA in HTLV-1-infected T-cells. These observations indicate that Tax suppresses the inhibitory activities of INK4 family members through two independent mechanisms: functional inhibition of two INK4 proteins and repression of expression of another INK4 protein. These effects may play roles in HTLV-1-induced deregulation of the cell cycle, possibly promoting cellular transformation.","['Suzuki, T', 'Narita, T', 'Uchida-Toita, M', 'Yoshida, M']","['Suzuki T', 'Narita T', 'Uchida-Toita M', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Shirokanedai, Minato-ku, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Jul 5;259(2):384-91. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9760.,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (CDKN2C protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p18)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,"['10.1006/viro.1999.9760 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)99760-X [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism of apoptosis caused by this reactive oxygen species is unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that singlet oxygen induced caspase-3 activation and Z-DEVD-FMK, a caspase-3 inhibitor, blocked apoptosis induction, while caspase-1 activity was not detectable and the caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMK had a very limited effect on apoptosis. This suggests that the activation of caspase-3 by singlet oxygen is essential for the commitment of cells to undergo apoptosis. Further studies showed that singlet oxygen induced an increase in caspase-8 activity and a reduction in mitochondrial cytochrome c. Time course analysis indicated that the cleavage of caspase-8 precedes that of caspase-3. In addition, blockade of caspase-8 by Z-IETD-FMK inhibited cleavage of pro-caspase-3 and prevented loss of mitochondrial cytochrome c. These results suggest that caspase-8 mediates caspase-3 activation and cytochrome c release during singlet oxygen-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Zhuang, S', 'Lynch, M C', 'Kochevar, I E']","['Zhuang S', 'Lynch MC', 'Kochevar IE']","['Wellman Laboratories of Photomedicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Oxygen/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Singlet Oxygen']",1999/07/02 00:00,1999/07/02 00:01,['1999/07/02 00:00'],"['1999/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Jul 10;250(1):203-12. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4501.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '17778-80-2 (Singlet Oxygen)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,"['10.1006/excr.1999.4501 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(99)94501-9 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],['GM 30955/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The validity of this multimodality approach to treating cancer was initially demonstrated with the successful treatment and cure of highly chemosensitive childhood cancers, such as Wilms' tumor, and these cures were only realized when adjuvant chemotherapy was included with local control measures. We attribute our treatment successes in childhood cancers to the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, and we attribute our inability to cure many adults with more common forms of solid tumors to the ineffectiveness of chemotherapy in these diseases. Curing disease is not the goal of most pharmacological interventions in nonmalignant diseases. With the exception of antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy, most of the common classes of drugs are administered with the intent of controlling the disease or the symptoms caused by disease. We administer antihypertensive agents to control blood pressure, but the underlying cause of the hypertension is not cured by this therapy. If the hypertension recurs after antihypertensive therapy is stopped, we would conclude that the therapy was successful at controlling the disease. However, if a patient's tumor relapses after completing anticancer chemotherapy, the anticancer therapy would be considered to be unsuccessful. By setting lofty goals for our therapy, we increase the probability that the treatment will not meet our own and our patient's expectations. Schipper et al. [J Clin Oncol 1995;13:801-805] proposed that we abandon the ""killing paradigm,"" which dictates that the treatment of cancer is directed toward eradication of all cancer cells, and that we adopt a ""regulatory model"" of cancer. This model views cancer as a maladaptive, constantly evolving process in which cancer cells differ only slightly from normal cells as a result of a few critical genetic changes that lead to dysregulation of growth. The treatment approach under this new paradigm is debulking of tumor burden with standard multimodality therapy followed by control of residual disease by ""reregulation"" of the remaining cancer cells. Controlling growth and spread of this residual disease would be accomplished with non-cytotoxic agents which target pathways that are responsible for the dysregulation in cancer cells. We are now on the verge of having the capacity to test this new paradigm of cancer. Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of many common forms of cancer at a molecular level have led to a revolution in anticancer drug development. A number of new agents that target a variety of critical molecular targets, such as the farnesyl transferase inhibitors that block ras oncogene activation, the matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors that block the enzymes involved in tissue invasion and metastasis [Editor's note: please see ""New Drugs on the Horizon, page 271], and the angiogenesis inhibitors that block new vessel formation in growing tumors, are now being clinically tested. These new classes of anticancer drugs are aimed at regulating or controlling cancers rather than killing them. The potential utility of targeting the critical molecular lesion in tumor cells is illustrated by the efficacy of all-trans-retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Although the capacity of all-trans-retinoic acid to induce complete remissions by inducing terminal differentiation of leukemic blasts was discovered empirically, the subsequent demonstration that the pathognomonic 15:17 translocation that is present in up to 90% of cases of APL results in the production of a dysfunctional retinoid receptor appears to explain the specificity and high level of activity of retinoid therapy in this disease. This is the first example of a cancer that can be treated by specifically targeting therapy to a pathogenetic molecular lesion. Retinoids are now being used in combination with standard chemotherapy for the treatment of APL, an example of the successful application of combining a molecularly targeted agent with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. The development and use of molecularly targeted agents for the treatment of cancer may require us to view cancer in a new light and to adjust our goals and expectations of its treatment as well as the endpoints of our clinical trials. However, pharmacologically controlling cancer may result in an equally acceptable outcome for our patients if it leads to what Schipper et al. termed a ""functional cure.""",['Balis'],['Balis FM'],"['Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-0001, USA. balisf@pbmac.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1998;3(4):V.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IFNs have been approved for clinical use by the United States Food and Drug Administration for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), hairy cell leukemia, follicular lymphomas, Kaposi's sarcoma in the setting of AIDS, and melanoma for patients at high risk for recurrence after surgery. In addition, as a result of their antiviral activity, IFNs result in control of chronic active hepatitis and recurring papillomas that may reduce cancer development resulting from these processes and their underlying viruses. For almost all of these indications, therapeutic activity has been established from well-conducted, international phase III clinical trials. IFNs were the first successful biological therapy for human malignancy; they can synergize to produce tumor regression with surgery and chemotherapy and can potentiate other cytokines and monoclonal antibodies. IFNs and cytokines can modulate gene expression, resulting in enhanced immune effector-cell number, cytotoxicity, antigen expression, and production of other cytokines. IFNs have pleiotropic effects on cellular function, including influences on growth, differentiation, and immunologic function. For greatest effects, IFNs are used in combination with other modalities of therapy. This increases the effect of IFNs or allows IFNs to increase the effects of other therapies.

The main characteristic of this mutation is the formation of a fusion gene (BCR-ABL) with increased tyrosine kinase activity from which a transforming activity for myelopoiesis derives. Clinically, CML is characterized by an initial chronic phase, followed by inevitable progression to an accelerated phase, and then to a terminal blastic phase. Allografting represents the only therapeutic procedure capable of curing the disease. Most centers currently use HLA-identical sibling transplants for patients less than 55 years of age. However, the majority of patients do not have an HLA-matched sibling donor. Matched or partially matched unrelated donor transplants are associated with a high transplant-related mortality within the first 100 days following the procedure. This approach should be offered to patients less than 50 years of age. Conventional therapy for CML includes hydroxyurea, busulfan and interferon alpha (IFN-&agr;). Conventional chemotherapy is unable to modify the natural history of the disease. On the contrary, recent randomized studies suggest that IFN-&agr; produces cytogenetic conversions to Philadelphia (Ph)-negative in some cases and may prolong overall survival [1-5]. Considering that the majority of Ph-negative patients maintain evidence of BCR/ABL positivity after IFN-&agr; therapy, it is unlikely that IFN-&agr; can cure the disease. In upcoming years, we must evaluate whether the high cost of IFN-&agr;, the poor tolerance of it in about one-fourth of treated patients, and the small chance of long-term benefit will be justified by a higher overall survival than with hydroxyurea. About 70% of CML patients do not have a matched family donor, and unrelated transplantation may produce high morbidity, particularly in older patients. For these patients and for those who do not achieve a cytogenetic remission after IFN-&agr; therapy, alternative treatment strategies are needed to increase disease-free survival. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been explored as an option for the treatment of these patients. In this review, we will focus on the recent update of this procedure, particularly on the in vivo manipulation technique.",['Carella'],['Carella AM'],"['Hematology and ABMT Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera e Cliniche Universitarie Convenzionate, Ospedale San Martino, Largo Rosanna Benzi, 16132 Genoa, Italy. amcarella@smartino.ge.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1998;3(1):54-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis is essentially one of exclusion in first ruling out other disorders that can also cause peripheral blood/bone marrow cell dysplasia and cytopenias. The distinguishing biological characteristic of MDS is that it is a clonal disorder of the marrow with impaired differentiation. Recent studies implicate extensive apoptosis as the explanation of the paradoxical observation of marrow hyperplasia but peripheral blood cytopenia. Neutropenia and/or neutrophil dysfunction account for the primary clinical manifestation of MDS in terms of an increased risk for infection, which is the leading cause of death in MDS. The clonal nature of MDS places it also at continual risk for transformation to acute leukemia. Predicting overall survival as well as the risk of AML transformation has been improved by the recent development of a scoring system (International Prognostic Scoring System) that incorporates three laboratory variables: percent of marrow blasts, degree of cytopenias, and presence of chromosomal abnormalities. Based on these variables, four prognostic subgroups can be delineated ranging from low risk with a median survival of 5.7 years, to high risk with a median survival of 0.4 years. Management of MDS can now be based on the patient's respective prognostic subgrouping, with low-risk patients being considered for hematopoietic growth factor singly or in combination if at the point of red cell transfusion dependence and/or neutropenia with recurrent infections, while high-risk patients should be offered AML-induction therapy or novel agents such as topotecan. One must individualize further in patients in the remaining intermediate groups, I and II, in choosing the most appropriate therapy. Future advances upon understanding the molecular details of the MDS clone should ultimately improve the care of patients with MDS.","['Kouides', 'Bennett']","['Kouides PA', 'Bennett JM']","['University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Department of Medicine, Rochester General Hospital, Rochester, New York, 14621, USA. pkouides@rghnet.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1997;2(6):389-401.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ever since autologous marrow transplantation was first used to reconstitute recipients of high-dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy, there has been much discussion about the relative contribution of residual tumor cells in the graft to the occurrence of subsequent relapse. It was not until the early 1990s that this risk was finally confirmed by the use of gene marking [1]. A retroviral vector was used to mark a proportion of the autologous remission bone marrow from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) before marrow infusion after high-dose therapy. Two recipients relapsed and both had leukemic blasts with the marker, the neomycin-resistance gene. As the safety of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has increased, the use of high-dose therapy followed by stem cell ""rescue"" is becoming more widespread. The malignancies treated in this way include leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, neuroblastoma, breast cancer, and ovarian tumors. In each of these conditions a number of important questions should be addressed: Can we identify and quantitate tumor cells in the grafts and establish their oncogenic potential?

As David's story recounts, he came to me in deep despair. He believed that there was little hope to escape what is commonly termed a ""death sentence"" from AIDS. With state-of-the-art treatment, he has regained considerable health, as his HIV viral load has fallen to undetectable levels and his helper T-cell number has increased. How long these changes will be sustained and what the future holds are still unclear. But it is clear that David is pursuing life with great vigor and his sense of optimism and commitment to survive have been restored.

Our history of conquering diseases which were, like AIDS, regularly associated with decline and death, gives us a perspective that engenders hope. I recall a friend and classmate in the fifth grade in Public School 187 in Queens, New York, who died of childhood leukemia. In those days, mentioning the word ""leukemia"" was forbidden, so our teacher informed us that Eric had died of ""blood poisoning."" We children all sat confused, wondering how to protect ourselves from such insidious ""poisons."" Childhood leukemia is now curable in the majority of afflicted children; I suspect that Eric would have been saved had the current treatment regimens existed in the early 1950s. Similar triumphs against lymphoma and testicular cancer are held up as real examples of progress in the field of oncology. I point to such victories in counseling patients with AIDS facing currently incurable diseases. AIDS is a moving target. Important breakthroughs in rational drug design provided us with the protease inhibitors, and laid the foundation for combination therapy which might potentially control the replication of the virus for decades and thereby restore longevity. Prospects for a true cure (full eradication of the virus from the system) are still hotly debated, but no one can deny that the clinical gains made in the last two years have been significant. We have witnessed the first clinical remission of AIDS. David Sanford's individual story is a mirror to the larger world of people with HIV. His restoration of health is not unique, not an isolated antidote, but a prototype of what is being seen in controlled clinical trials. Moreover, the importance of access to medical care, particularly new drugs, is evident from his tale. The impact of these new therapies on a humanitarian plane is the greatest, but its economic impact, with reduction of hospitalization, and increase in individual productivity, is also apparent.

Supportive care is the standard treatment for most patients, particularly those who are elderly, with the judicious use of blood components and antibiotics.

This review presents an analysis of risk factors associated with delayed platelet engraftment. The retrospective analysis included 1,468 recipients of autologous or allogeneic transplants treated between January 1, 1990 and July 1, 1995. Risk factors associated with delayed platelet engraftment after autologous HSCT included use of marrow rather than peripheral blood as the source of stem cells, being transplanted for acute myeloid leukemia rather than other diseases, positive patient serology for cytomegalovirus and the presence of infection post-transplant before engraftment. Risk factors associated with delayed platelet engraftment after allogeneic marrow transplantation included unrelated as opposed to related donor transplants, being transplanted for diseases other than chronic myelogenous leukemia, increased age, onset of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), male gender, the administration of methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis and the presence of infection before engraftment. Delayed platelet recovery is associated with decreased survival after both autologous and allogeneic transplants. Management of delayed platelet recovery by transfusion of blood products requires significant medical resources and is of some risk to the patients. Further development of new strategies may safely reduce the need for blood products.

The addition of the vitamin A derivative, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), to treatment regimens has been responsible for this improvement in survival. Although ATRA is a potent remission induction agent in APL, continuous administration of ATRA as a single agent does not maintain patients in remission. Although lower plasma concentrations were initially noted at the time of relapse in patients with APL, subsequent studies have demonstrated that the decline in plasma drug concentrations occurs within one to two weeks of initiation of treatment, and possibly as early as three days. The inability to maintain adequate plasma concentrations of ATRA because of rapid upregulation of its catabolism is an attractive hypothesis to explain the inevitable recurrences in patients with initially responsive disease, but more recent data suggest that this mechanism alone is unlikely to be responsible for drug resistance. Cellular retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABPs) play a critical role in regulating the amount of free retinoic acid capable of reaching and activating nuclear receptors. Recent studies using leukemic blasts obtained at the time of relapse have demonstrated a shift in the ATRA dose-response curve in vitro. In addition, there is an upregulation in the expression of CRABP in leukemic blasts obtained at relapse. These observations suggest that ATRA resistance is not simply an inability to maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations of drug, but rather may be linked to the intracellular regulation of drug. The intricate nature of the homeostatic mechanisms that maintain tight control over retinoids, combined with the multiplicity of retinoid receptors and signaling pathways, leave open the possibility of a yet-to-be-defined mechanism of resistance that is independent of the clinical pharmacology of ATRA.",['Adamson'],['Adamson PC'],"['Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Section, Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, USA. adamsonp@pbmac.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1996;1(5):305-314.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is little that can be done therapeutically, and the prognosis for patients with this disease is poor. The main hematologic finding is anemia, but MDS responds poorly to the various kinds of drugs used to treat anemia, and in the past it was called refractory anemia. Moreover, 25% to 40% of MDS patients develop acute leukemia, so MDS has also been referred to as preleukemia or a preleukemic condition. When blood diseases are classified as either erythrocytic or leukocytic, it is often unclear into which category MDS falls. Although MDS sometimes occurs in young adults and children, it most often appears in older patients. Diagnosis is confirmed in laboratory tests by a reduction in peripheral blood cells, an abundance of cells in the bone marrow (cellular marrow), abnormal cellular morphology, and chromosomal abnormalities. In primary cases there is no history of underlying disease or administration of drugs that is toxic to the marrow. The course of the disease is chronic but irreversible, and in a high percentage of cases it either develops into acute leukemia or the patient succumbs to infection or hemorrhage (death due to bone marrow failure). In general, all blood cells arise from a single type of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cell in the marrow. In MDS, the hematopoietic stem cells acquire mutations and cannot produce sufficient numbers of mature blood cells (Fig. 1). In aplastic anemia the hematopoietic stem cells are also abnormal, and blood cell production in the marrow generally declines. In MDS, however, there are sufficient numbers of blood cells of each lineage along the path from hematopoietic stem cell to mature blood cell, but the cells do not completely mature and differentiate. Because of this deficiency in the differentiation process, the cells die in the marrow without maturing and differentiating (ineffective hematopoiesis). Furthermore, blood cells that escape death in the bone marrow and are released into the peripheral blood have both morphological and functional abnormalities compared with normal blood cells. In other words, MDS is an abnormality at the hematopoietic stem cell level, and it is characterized by the presence of clonal blood cells that are abnormal both in quality (morphology, function, differentiation) and quantity (cytopenia) [1]. Because these abnormalities are found in multiple blood cell lineages, they are believed to be clonal abnormalities that originate in the pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells. The reason why the stem cells become abnormal is still unclear. However, MDS can arise following treatment with antineoplastic agents such as alkylating agents or radiation treatments (therapy-related MDS), and it has been proposed that MDS is caused by cumulative DNA damage in stem cells from mutagenic substances such as antitumor drugs [2]. DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Screening for MDS should begin with the fact that there is chronic, progressive cytopenia, the marrow is normal or hyperplastic, and there is no underlying disease (such as disseminated intravascular coagulation [DIC], portal hypertension, collagen disorder, etc.) that could otherwise cause these conditions (Table 1). MDS is most likely to occur in middle-aged and elderly patients, but because it can also occur in the young, age is not a determining factor for diagnosis. Diagnosis is verified by ineffective hematopoiesis and blood cells with morphological abnormalities in the marrow and peripheral blood. Although there are, for example, ferrokinetic studies for erythroid cells, etc., it is impossible to make an accurate evaluation of ineffective hematopoiesis based only on abnormal laboratory test results. Therefore, if chronic cytopenia and cellular marrow are both present, then abnormal morphology of blood cells becomes the deciding factor in diagnosis. Typical morphological abnormalities in MDS include megaloblasts (photo 1), dissociated maturation of the nucleus and cytoplasm (photo 2), abnormal multinucleated erythroblasts with three or more nuclei (photo 1), and ringed sideroblasts (photo 3) in the erythrocytic lineage; hypersegmented (photo 4) or hyposegmented neutrophils (pseudo Pelger-Huet nuclear anomaly, photo 5), reduced or missing granules (photos 4 and 5), and peroxidase-negative neutrophils in the granulocytic lineage; and micromegakaryocytes (photo 6), megakaryocytes with multiple, isolated disc-shaped nuclei (photo 7) and giant platelets (photo 8) in the megakaryocytic lineage. However, these morphological abnormalities are not specific to MDS, and they are also seen in pernicious anemia, acute myelocytic leukemia, etc. Therefore, a diagnosis of MDS must exclude these other diseases with which we are already familiar. Once MDS is confirmed, then the type of MDS is determined in accordance with FAB classification [1] (Fig. 2). Differential diagnosis applies to all cases presenting with cytopenia. Various types of anemia such as aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, secondary anemia, etc., blood disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, chronic neutropenia, etc., as well as collagen diseases, portal hypertension, DIC, etc., can all be differentiated from MDS based on their characteristic symptoms and laboratory test results. However, atypical forms of MDS [3, 4] also occur, such as hypoplastic marrow MDS, MDS with minimal dysplasia, amegakaryocytic MDS, etc. Meticulous microscopic examination of blood cell morphology and careful observation of the clinical course are essential, in addition to bone marrow biopsy, chromosomal studies of marrow cells, blood cell clonality analysis, etc. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: APOPTOSIS: One biological characteristic of MDS is the presence of blood cells of abnormal clones derived from abnormal hematopoietic stem cells. These abnormal clones demonstrate ineffective hematopoiesis, which is reflected in the contradictory phenomena of normal or hyperplastic bone marrow concurrent with cytopenia in the peripheral blood. This is a result of premature cell death in the bone marrow that accompanies the abnormal blood cell differentiation found in MDS. Therefore, it has been proposed that it is very likely this early cell death takes the form of apoptosis, and, little by little, experimental results supporting this view have been published [5-7]. The development of MDS into acute leukemia is thought to be due to the survival of immature cells (blast cells) that have escaped apoptosis and have acquired the ability to proliferate [6]. Antileukemic drugs act by inducing apoptosis in leukocytes, and it is likely that acute leukemia from MDS is intractable because it has managed to bypass the mechanism of apoptosis. Research is now focused on the detection of excessive apoptosis in vivo in MDS patients and the relationship between apoptosis and the development of MDS. ORIGIN OF BLOOD CELL CLONING: Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow cells is effective as an everyday laboratory test to verify clonality, but it lacks sensitivity. The FISH method is useful for determining clonality at the level of individual blood cells, but cannot be used in patients with no chromosomal abnormalities. DNA polymorphism of enzymes mapped on the X chromosome can only be used in females, but interesting research is being conducted on the clonality of lymphocytes and the possible survival of normal hematopoietic clones. ONSET AND PROGRESSION: Unstable clones with functional deficiencies are produced by abnormal stem cells. From the standpoint of chromosomal research, it is believed that MDS occurs not from a single type of stem cell damage, but from an accumulation of multiple and random stem cell damage. MDS is a prime candidate for research on the onset of human leukemia, and when we combine what we know about MDS with its development into leukemia, we can understand the development of MDS from the standpoint of apoptosis, genetic abnormalities, chromosomal abnormalities and progression of cloning. RISK FACTORS: Many risk factors for MDS have been proposed, and it has been confirmed internationally that the four major risk factors are the blast cell ratio in the bone marrow, advanced age, chromosomal abnormalities, and thrombocytopenia.",['Yoshida'],['Yoshida Y'],"['Division of Human Environment, The Center for South East Asian Studies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1996;1(4):284-287.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel association between lack of the retinoblastoma protein and intrinsic MTX resistance has been found.

Aplastic anemia is a hematological disease characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypoplasia. Acquired cases of aplastic anemia are almost all idiopathic and arise from unknown causes. Other cases of aplastic anemia are secondary and are caused by radiation, chemicals or viruses. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: Aplastic anemia is manifested as a marked reduction in the number of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells, but why this occurs is still uncertain. Some of the proposed causes include abnormalities of the hematopoietic stem cells, abnormalities in the hematopoietic microenvironment, and immunologically mediated damage to the hematopoietic stem cells (Figure 1). ABNORMALTIES OF THE HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS: Patients with aplastic anemia, and long-term survivors in particular, are at increased risk of developing paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), or acute myelocytic leukemia. This suggests that, in at least some of these patients, the hematopoietic stem cells themselves are abnormal. It also suggests that in some of these patients the blood cells are clonal (that is, all the blood cells are derived from a single pluripotent stem cell). In short, what these findings imply is that aplastic anemia may be caused by the emergence of an abnormal clone. Clonal hematopoiesis, however, can also be considered nothing more than a consequence. In other words, it is possible that hematopoiesis in this kind of patient is performed by a lone pluripotent stem cell that somehow managed to survive eradication. No definitive interpretation of clonal hematopoiesis has been agreed upon, and it is still a topic for future research. ABNORMAL HEMATOPOIETIC MICROENVIRONMENT: The presence of stromal cells, which form the microenvironment of bone marrow, is very important in hematopoiesis. Hematopoietic stem cells proliferate and differentiate either by adhering to stromal cells or by being stimulated by the various hematopoietic factors that stromal cells produce. Therefore, it is quite possible that aplastic anemia is caused by abnormalities in the hematopoietic microenvironment. However, many separate studies have demonstrated that the hematopoietic microenvironment in the vast majority of aplastic anemia cases is normal. IMMUNE MECHANISMS: Immunosuppressive agents are often effective in treating aplastic anemia, and therefore it is believed that immunological mechanisms contribute to the disease in more than half the cases. The following mechanisms have been proposed as causes for the onset of immunologically mediated aplastic anemia: * Decreases in Hematopoietic Factors Produced by Monocytes and Lymphocytes. Some patients with aplastic anemia show decreased production of interleukin 1 (IL-1) by peripheral blood monocytes, and it is possible that a drop in the concentration of this factor is linked to the onset of the disease [1]. It is also possible, however, that decreased IL-1 production by monocytes is not a cause of the disease, but merely a consequence. Moreover, no cases have been reported that exhibit reduced production of hematopoietic factors produced by lymphocytes such as GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-6. * Damage by Cytokines that Suppress Hematopoiesis. It has been reported that increased levels of interferon &ggr; (IFN-&ggr;), which is produced by lymphocytes, and tumor necrosis factor &agr; (TNF-&agr;), which is produced by monocytes and macrophages, are found in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of aplastic anemia patients [2, 3]. These two factors act as suppressors of hematopoiesis, and it is possible that they contribute to the disease. The increase of these inflammatory cytokines in the bone marrow strongly suggests the presence of either specific or non-specific destruction of the hematopoietic stem cells by immunoregulatory cells. * Suppression of Hematopoiesis by Cytotoxic T Cells (Killer T Cells). Cases have been reported in which cytotoxic T cell clones that damage the autologous hematopoietic precursor cells are present [4]. Therefore, we can easily conceive of a mechanism in which these cytotoxic T cells specifically destroy the hematopoietic stem cells and cause aplastic anemia. * Suppression of Hematopoiesis by Natural Killer (NK) Cells. NK activity of aplastic anemia patients is depressed, and, generally speaking, it is highly unlikely that NK cells contribute to this condition. However, it has been reported that clonal NK cells are thought to cause the disease in patients exhibiting pancytopenia and bone marrow hypoplasia. Therefore, when this disease is diagnosed, a peripheral blood granular lymphocyte count and NK cell surface marker analysis should always be performed. DIAGNOSIS: A necessary condition for the diagnosis of aplastic anemia is the presence of pancytopenia. Moreover, it is necessary to rule out all other causes of pancytopenia. It is especially important in differential diagnosis to look for PNH and MDS. In cases of aplastic anemia there are patients that exhibit PNH during the course of the disease, and this condition is called aplastic anemia-PNH syndrome. It has recently been shown that bone marrow and peripheral blood cells in some patients diagnosed with aplastic anemia are partially lacking GPI anchor proteins (CD16, CD55, and CD59) [5]. Whether such patients become to exhibit aplastic anemia-PNH syndrome in the future remains to be elucidated. In MDS the bone marrow generally exhibits normoplasia or hyperplasia, and only in rare cases does it exhibit hypoplasia. This condition is referred to as hypoplastic MDS. Hypoplastic MDS can be differentiated from aplastic anemia by the presence of abnormal cell morphology that is sometimes accompanied by chromosomal abnormalities. TREATMENT:Aplastic anemia is treated with androgens, high-dose methylprednisolone, cyclosporin A (CyA), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, and bone marrow transplantation. Interestingly, patients who require continuous CyA administration to maintain stable hematopoiesis have a specific HLA class II haplotype (DRB1*1501-DQA1*0102-DQB1*0602) [6]. Recent reports from EBMT SAA Working Party showed the excellent therapeutic result (response rate 82%) when severe cases were treated with ALG, CyA and G-CSF in combination [7].","['Teramura', 'Mizoguchi']","['Teramura M', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical College, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1996;1(3):187-189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has become standard therapy for many patients with leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma and testicular cancer. Encouraging results of autologous BMT in treating patients with poor-risk breast cancer have led to this approach being tested in nationwide randomized trials. In order to increase availability and efficacy of BMT, other sources of hematopoietic cells are explored for transplantation, such as from HLA-matched unrelated volunteer donors, partially matched related donors, placental/umbilical cord blood and allogeneic peripheral blood. Relapse of original malignancy remains the main obstacle for the success of BMT. Recent clinical investigations have demonstrated that donor-derived peripheral blood leukocytes are effective in inducing remissions in patients with hematological malignancies who relapse after allogeneic BMT. BMT procedures are associated with significant complexity and should be carried out only in transplant units that meet adequate standards. In order to better define the role of BMT in treating cancer, more phase III clinical trials are needed.

Recently, three active agents for the treatment of these diseases have been identified: the purine analogs fludarabine, pentostatin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the mechanism of action, clinical activity and toxicities of the purine analogs. METHODS: Articles, abstracts and letters to the editor appearing in English literature and involving the use of the purine analogs in the treatment of hairy cell leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cutaneous T cell lymphomas and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were reviewed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Purine analogs have marked cytoreductive potential in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and hairy cell leukemia. Major side effects include myelosuppression and infections. Profound lymphocytopenia can be sustained, predisposing patients to opportunistic infections. Although remissions achieved with these agents can be long-lasting, minimal residual disease frequently persists. Postremission strategies aimed at eradicating such microscopic diseases can potentially improve the results of purine analog therapy. Alternatively, the up-front combination of these agents with traditional chemotherapy may lead to higher response rates and more sustained remissions.","['Fidias', 'Chabner', 'Grossbard']","['Fidias P', 'Chabner BA', 'Grossbard ML']","['Hematology-Oncology Unit, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1996;1(3):125-139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hospitalization for chemotherapy is now limited to specific situations, reflecting the need for prolonged direct observation, prevention or treatment of anticipated or real side effects, the use of special facilities and the minimization of certain treatment risks which cannot be effectively dealt with in an outpatient setting. New financial guidelines also have a significant impact on the location of chemotherapy administration. Outpatient chemotherapy has the advantages of allowing safe, easy drug administration, respecting the patient's wish to avoid hospitalization and providing a familiar facility, which enhances the patient's physical comfort and psychological well-being. The oncologist has direct and immediate control of drug administration, assistance is immediately available if problems arise, care is less expensive than inpatient care and overnight stay can be avoided. It also facilitates monitoring and control of treatment costs and allows treatment to be administered at the patient's convenience. Specific circumstances which justify hospitalization for chemotherapy, as detailed in Table 1, include: higher dosage cisplatin, special procedure chemotherapy, induction therapy for acute leukemia, high-dosage chemotherapy with or without stem cell/bone marrow transplantation, severely emetogenic chemotherapy, ifosfamide therapy, combination radiation therapy plus chemotherapy programs, coexistent medical problems (comorbidities), complex chemotherapy programs, the initial dose of chemotherapy while hospitalized for diagnosis of cancer, a scheduled dose of chemotherapy occurring during hospitalization for an unrelated problem, special measures required to prevent significant side effects, high-dose methotrexate protocols, intraperitoneal chemotherapy, certain investigational treatment protocols, and if chemotherapy administration is mandatory despite comorbidities that would ordinarily delay or contraindicate chemotherapy.",['Dollinger'],['Dollinger M'],"[""University of Southern California School of Medicine; John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Hospital, Santa Monica, California, 90404, USA. malinml@aol.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1996;1(1 & 2):107-111.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia, lymphoma and solid tumors may all metastasize to the meninges, where the blood-brain barrier may provide a sanctuary from cytotoxic concentrations of chemotherapeutic agents. Because meningeal disease may be clinically silent or may present with unusual signs and symptoms, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion for this problem. Diagnosis is usually made by cerebrospinal fluid cytologic testing, magnetic resonance imaging, or both. Treatment options include radiation therapy, systemic chemotherapy and intrathecal chemotherapy. Systemic therapy usually requires administration of either very high drug doses or prolonged infusions in order to overcome the poor penetration of most anticancer agents into the central nervous system. Thus, systemic toxicity is often a major drawback to this approach. Intrathecal chemotherapy results in delivery of anticancer agents directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, usually with minimal systemic toxicity. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be administered by lumbar puncture or by use of an Ommaya reservoir with the tip in the ventricle. Studies are under way to evaluate new agents for both systemic and intrathecal administration. Further research is required to overcome this difficult clinical challenge.","['Berg', 'Poplack']","['Berg SL', 'Poplack DG']","[""Texas Children's Cancer Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:00,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 1996;1(1 & 2):56-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Late Effects Working Committee of the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry.,14-21,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: It is uncertain whether mortality rates among patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation return to the level of the mortality rates of the general population. We analyzed the characteristics of 6691 patients listed in the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. All the patients were free of their original disease two years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Mortality rates in this cohort were compared with those of an age-, sex-, and nationality-matched general population. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to identify risk factors for death more than two years after transplantation (late death). RESULTS: Among patients who were free of disease two years after transplantation, the probability of living for five more years was 89 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88 to 90 percent). Among patients who underwent transplantation for aplastic anemia, the risk of death by the sixth year after transplantation did not differ significantly from that of a normal population. Mortality remained significantly higher than normal throughout the study among patients who underwent transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia and through the ninth year among those who underwent transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia. Recurrent leukemia was the chief cause of death among patients who received a transplant for leukemia, whereas chronic graft-versus-host disease was the chief cause among those who received a transplant for aplastic anemia. Advanced, long-standing disease before transplantation and active chronic graft-versus-host disease were important risk factors for late death. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplant as treatment for acute myelogenous or lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or aplastic anemia and who are free of their original disease two years later, the disease is probably cured. However, for many years after transplantation, the mortality among these patients is higher than that in a normal population.","['Socie, G', 'Stone, J V', 'Wingard, J R', 'Weisdorf, D', 'Henslee-Downey, P J', 'Bredeson, C', 'Cahn, J Y', 'Passweg, J R', 'Rowlings, P A', 'Schouten, H C', 'Kolb, H J', 'Klein, J P']","['Socie G', 'Stone JV', 'Wingard JR', 'Weisdorf D', 'Henslee-Downey PJ', 'Bredeson C', 'Cahn JY', 'Passweg JR', 'Rowlings PA', 'Schouten HC', 'Kolb HJ', 'Klein JP']","[""Service d'Hematologie-Greffe de Moelle, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*mortality/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:01,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1999 Jul 1;341(1):14-21. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199907013410103.,,,"['N Engl J Med. 1999 Jul 1;341(1):50-1.

For a long time, these alkaloids have been used in African folk medicine in the form of plant extracts for the treatment of multiple diseases, in particular as antimalarial drugs. To date, the molecular basis for their diverse biological effects remains poorly understood. To elucidate their mechanism of action, we studied their interaction with DNA and their effects on topoisomerase II. The strength and mode of binding to DNA of the three alkaloids were investigated by spectroscopy. The alkaloids bind tightly to DNA and behave as typical intercalating agents. All three compounds stabilize the topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complex and stimulate the cutting of DNA by topoisomerase II. The poisoning effect is more pronounced with cryptolepine than with matadine and serpentine, but none of the drugs exhibit a preference for cutting at a specific base. Cryptolepine which binds 10-fold more tightly to DNA than the two related alkaloids proves to be much more cytotoxic toward B16 melanoma cells than matadine and serpentine. The cellular consequences of the inhibition of topoisomerase II by cryptolepine were investigated using the HL60 leukemia cell line. The flow cytometry analysis shows that the drug alters the cell cycle distribution, but no sign of drug-induced apoptosis was detected when evaluating the internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA in cells. Cryptolepine-treated cells probably die via necrosis rather than via apoptosis. The results provide evidence that DNA and topoisomerase II are the primary targets of cryptolepine, matadine, and serpentine.","['Dassonneville, L', 'Bonjean, K', 'De Pauw-Gillet, M C', 'Colson, P', 'Houssier, C', 'Quetin-Leclercq, J', 'Angenot, L', 'Bailly, C']","['Dassonneville L', 'Bonjean K', 'De Pauw-Gillet MC', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Quetin-Leclercq J', 'Angenot L', 'Bailly C']","['INSERM U524, Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,,"['Alkaloids/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA/*chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Electrochemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescence Polarization', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', '*Indoles', 'Intercalating Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Quinolines', 'Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:01,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1999 Jun 15;38(24):7719-26. doi: 10.1021/bi990094t.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Secologanin Tryptamine Alkaloids)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (matadine)', '480-26-2 (cryptolepine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'B503RKE34F (serpentine (alkaloid))', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",,,"['10.1021/bi990094t [doi]', 'bi990094t [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their activities include providing neurotrophic factors and increasing the production of extracellular matrix components and cell surface adhesion molecules to promote axon regeneration. Following nerve transection, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is up-regulated by Schwann cells at the injury site. LIF receptors are also up-regulated at the nerve injury site, but their cellular localization and function have not been fully characterized. We demonstrate that Schwann cells express mRNAs for LIF and the LIF receptor components LIF receptor subunit beta and glycoprotein 130 in vitro. We also show that although LIF is not required for the genesis of Schwann cells, it can potentiate the survival of differentiated Schwann cells in the context of neuregulin support. Not only does exogenous LIF promote survival under these conditions, but addition of the soluble LIF receptor (LIF binding protein) and anti-LIF antibodies significantly reduced cell survival, suggesting that LIF exerts autocrine effects. These results suggest that Schwann cell survival following nerve injury is potentially modulated by LIF.","['Dowsing, B J', 'Morrison, W A', 'Nicola, N A', 'Starkey, G P', 'Bucci, T', 'Kilpatrick, T J']","['Dowsing BJ', 'Morrison WA', 'Nicola NA', 'Starkey GP', 'Bucci T', 'Kilpatrick TJ']","[""Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery, St. Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Schwann Cells/*physiology', 'Sciatic Nerve/cytology']",1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:01,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 1999 Jul;73(1):96-104. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0730096.x.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1999.0730096.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, IL-7 stimulates the proliferation of both antitumor reactive cells and a number of T and B cell malignancies, underlining its significance for leukemogenesis. However, its exact role in the process of pathologic maturation of lymphocytes and regulation of the immune response is not completely understood. As alternative splicing of pre-mRNA has been shown to be involved in the control of gene expression, and splicing-derived protein isoforms with antagonistic activity have been found, we assessed the mRNA-expression of IL-7 and its previously described alternative splice variant lacking exon 4, IL-7delta4, in leukemic cells from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PCR of full-length IL-7 cDNA enabling the competitive amplification of both variants led to the amplification of diverse unexpected PCR products. The sequence data demonstrated the existence of three additional in-frame splice variants resulting from exon skipping of exon 3 or exon 5 or both in combination with exon 4. We named these IL-7delta3/4, IL-7delta4/5, and IL-7delta3/4/5.

Pressure inhibition of translation is advanced as a possible cause of this perturbation.","['Mentre, P', 'Hamraoui, L', 'Hui Bon Hoa, G', 'Debey, P']","['Mentre P', 'Hamraoui L', 'Hui Bon Hoa G', 'Debey P']","['Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France. mentre@ibpc.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleolus/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Hydrostatic Pressure', 'Intracellular Membranes/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/physiology/ultrastructure']",1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:01,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 1999 May;45(3):353-62.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, many observations suggest that acquisition of CDDP resistance in cell lines confers cross-resistance to IR, but the molecular mechanisms involved have not been well documented yet. We report here the selection and characterization of a murine CDDP-resistant L1210 cell line (L1210/3R) that exhibits cross-resistance to IR because of an increased capacity to repair double-strand breaks compared with parental cells (L1210/P). In resistant cells, electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed an increased DNA-end binding activity that could be ascribed, by supershifting the retardation complexes with antibodies, to the autoantigen Ku. The heterodimeric Ku protein, composed of 86-kDa (Ku80) and 70-kDa (Ku70) subunits, is the DNA-targeting component of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), which plays a critical role in mammalian DNA double-strand breaks repair. The increased Ku-binding activity in resistant cells was associated with an overexpression affecting specifically the Ku80 subunit. These data strongly suggest that the increase in Ku activity is responsible for the phenotype of cross-resistance to IR. In addition, these observations, along with previous results from DNA-PK- mutant cells, provide evidence in favor of a role of Ku/DNA-PK in resistance to CDDP. These results suggest that Ku activity may be an important molecular target in cancer therapy at the crossroad between cellular responses to CDDP and IR.","['Frit, P', 'Canitrot, Y', 'Muller, C', 'Foray, N', 'Calsou, P', 'Marangoni, E', 'Bourhis, J', 'Salles, B']","['Frit P', 'Canitrot Y', 'Muller C', 'Foray N', 'Calsou P', 'Marangoni E', 'Bourhis J', 'Salles B']","['Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Propre de Recherche 9062, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Dimerization', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Kinetics', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:01,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1999 Jul;56(1):141-6. doi: 10.1124/mol.56.1.141.,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,['10.1124/mol.56.1.141 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that phenylarsine oxide, a strong vicinal thiol-binding agent, neither induced nuclear fragmentation or DNA laddering nor increased caspase activity in NB4 cells; however, As2O3 and a weak thiol-binding agent, dimethylarsinic acid, did increase activity. Dithiothreitol (DTT) effectively suppressed the phenylarsine oxide-inhibited cellular reductive capacity, but unexpectedly, enhanced As2O3-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells. As2O3-induced and As2O3-plus-DTT-induced apoptosis in NB4 cells was modulated by oxidant modifiers, but not by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.

Thirty-four methotrexate transport-defective L1210 leukemia cell lines were isolated with folic acid as the sole folate source under antifolate selective pressure. The RFC1 mRNA levels were comparable with, or not substantially decreased, in most of these cell lines relative to wild-type L1210 cells. The molecular basis for the transport defects was investigated by sequencing multiple RFC1 cDNA clones isolated from these mutants by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, which encompassed the entire coding region. The mutations identified were further confirmed either by direct sequencing or, when applicable, by restriction analysis of total reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products. The majority of mutations (21) led to single amino acid substitutions that were in, or near, 9 of 12 predicted transmembrane domains, with the highest frequencies in the first, fifth, and eighth. There were no mutations in the sixth, ninth, and twelfth transmembrane domains. Glycine, serine, and arginine were the most frequently mutated residues. These data suggest that several transmembrane domains, rather than the amino- and carboxyl-termini, and the large intracellular loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains play key roles as sites for RFC1 inactivation because of single point mutations. This panel of mutated cell lines offers an important resource for studies on RFC1 structure-function and for the evaluation of transport-related cross-resistance patterns with new-generation antifolate inhibitors of tetrahydrofolate cofactor-dependent enzymes.","['Zhao, R', 'Sharina, I G', 'Goldman, I D']","['Zhao R', 'Sharina IG', 'Goldman ID']","['Departments of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, and the Albert Einstein Comprehensive Cancer Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/physiology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/07/01 00:00,1999/07/01 00:01,['1999/07/01 00:00'],"['1999/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1999 Jul;56(1):68-76.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Slc19a2 protein, mouse)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,['CA39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanism by which A20 exerts this effect is still unclear. We show that A20 does not inhibit TNF- induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-kappaB, although it completely prevents the TNF- induced activation of an NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene, as well as TNF-induced IL-6 and granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor gene expression. Moreover, NF-kappaB activation induced by overexpression of the TNF receptor-associated proteins TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), receptor interacting protein (RIP), and TNF recep- tor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) was also inhibited by expression of A20, whereas NF-kappaB activation induced by overexpression of NF-kappaB-inducing kinase (NIK) or the human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax was unaffected. These results demonstrate that A20 inhibits NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression by interfering with a novel TNF-induced and RIP- or TRAF2-mediated pathway that is different from the NIK-IkappaB kinase pathway and that is specifically involved in the transactivation of NF-kappaB. Via yeast two-hybrid screening, we found that A20 binds to a novel protein, ABIN, which mimics the NF-kappaB inhibiting effects of A20 upon overexpression, suggesting that the effect of A20 is mediated by its interaction with this NF-kappaB inhibiting protein, ABIN.","['Heyninck, K', 'De Valck, D', 'Vanden Berghe, W', 'Van Criekinge, W', 'Contreras, R', 'Fiers, W', 'Haegeman, G', 'Beyaert, R']","['Heyninck K', 'De Valck D', 'Vanden Berghe W', 'Van Criekinge W', 'Contreras R', 'Fiers W', 'Haegeman G', 'Beyaert R']","['Department of Molecular Biology, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, University of Ghent, B-9000 Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', '*Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Yeasts/genetics', 'Zinc Fingers', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",1999/06/29 00:00,1999/06/29 00:01,['1999/06/29 00:00'],"['1999/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1999 Jun 28;145(7):1471-82. doi: 10.1083/jcb.145.7.1471.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 1)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 2)', '0 (Tradd protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-Associated Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ripk1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (NF-kappa B kinase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (TNFAIP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha-Induced Protein 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Tnfaip3 protein, mouse)']",,,['10.1083/jcb.145.7.1471 [doi]'],PMC2133159,,,,"['GENBANK/AJ242777', 'GENBANK/AJ242778']",,,,,,,,,,,

Many patients receive chemotherapy prior to BMT, but its effect on subsequent toxicities is controversial. METHODS: We studied the effect of prior chemotherapy on GVHD severity and inflammatory cytokine generation in a well-established murine model of allogeneic BMT (B6-->B6D2F1). RESULTS: Three weeks after a single dose of cyclophosphamide, bone marrow and splenic cellularity was reduced by 50% and the production of TNF-alpha to LPS stimulation by macrophages was also markedly impaired (both before and after total body irradiation). Allogeneic BMT recipients previously treated with cyclophosphamide had significantly less GVHD and improved survival relative to recipients previously pretreated with diluent only. This survival advantage was associated with reduced systemic levels of both TNF-alpha and interleukin-1beta 7 days after BMT.

In this study we perform a series of cellular and molecular assays to characterize an autologous, endogenous immune response against a transplantation-associated, monoclonal, EBV+ posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). Following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, a patient developed a monoclonal PTLD of donor B cell origin. With a decrease in immune suppression, we document the emergence of endogenous, donor-derived CD3+CD8+ CTLs, followed by regression of the PTLD. The TCR Vbeta repertoire went from a polyclonal pattern prior to the development of PTLD to a restricted TCR Vbeta pattern during the outgrowth and regression of PTLD. Donor-derived CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes displayed MHC class I-restricted cytolytic activity against the autologous EBV+ B cells ex vivo without additional in vitro sensitization. The striking temporal relationship between the endogenous expansion of a TCR Vbeta-restricted, CD3+CD8+ population of MHC class I-restricted CTL, and the regression of an autologous monoclonal PTLD, provides direct evidence in humans that endogenous CD3+CD8+ CTLs can be responsible for effective immune surveillance against malignant transformation of EBV+ B cells.","['Khatri, V P', 'Baiocchi, R A', 'Peng, R', 'Oberkircher, A R', 'Dolce, J M', 'Ward, P M', 'Herzig, G P', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Khatri VP', 'Baiocchi RA', 'Peng R', 'Oberkircher AR', 'Dolce JM', 'Ward PM', 'Herzig GP', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Division of Surgery, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/pathology/virology']",1999/06/29 00:00,1999/06/29 00:01,['1999/06/29 00:00'],"['1999/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jul 1;163(1):500-6.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,['ji_v163n1p500 [pii]'],,,"['CA09581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA-16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many are polymorphic, constituting the basis for the wide inter-individual variation in metabolic capacity and possibly a source of variation in the susceptibility to chemical-induced carcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine the existence of any association between the main genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6), glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) and N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) and an altered risk for haematological neoplasias. A total of 160 patients and 128 controls were genotyped by means of PCR-RFLP-based assays. Mutated alleles comprising CYP2D6*4, GSTM1*0, NAT2*5A, *5B, *5C, *6 and *7 were analysed along with the wild-type alleles. The results showed a higher frequency of CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers carrying two functional alleles in the leukaemia group, when compared with controls (76.6 versus 57.0%, P = 0.008). No differences were found in the case of Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Analysis of the GSTM1 and NAT2 polymorphisms failed to show an association with any of the neoplasias, although a near significant increase in fast acetylators was also found in the leukaemia group (50.0 versus 35.9%, P = 0.06). The results suggest an association of extensive metabolism with an increased risk for leukaemia, possibly by an increase in the metabolic activation of chemical carcinogens or linkage to another cancer-causing gene. Opposite findings presented in other studies may reflect geographical differences in the type of environmental carcinogens to which different populations are exposed.","['Lemos, M C', 'Cabrita, F J', 'Silva, H A', 'Vivan, M', 'Placido, F', 'Regateiro, F J']","['Lemos MC', 'Cabrita FJ', 'Silva HA', 'Vivan M', 'Placido F', 'Regateiro FJ']","['Medical Genetics Unit, Faculty of Medicine, University of Coimbra, and Department of Clinical Haematology, University Hospital of Coimbra, 3049 Coimbra Codex, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Linkage', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', '*Polymorphism, Genetic']",1999/06/29 00:00,1999/06/29 00:01,['1999/06/29 00:00'],"['1999/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1999 Jul;20(7):1225-9. doi: 10.1093/carcin/20.7.1225.,"['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP2D6)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (NAT2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",,,['10.1093/carcin/20.7.1225 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Twenty-nine paired samples of cerebrospinal fluid and plasma were collected from children with leukaemia undergoing therapeutic lumbar puncture. An intravenous dose of morphine was administered at selected intervals before the procedure. Concentrations of morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) were measured in each sample. Morphine was measured using a specific radioimmunoassay (r.i.a.) and M6G was measured using a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: The ELISA for measuring M6G was highly sensitive. The intra-and interassay variations were less than 15%. Using a two-compartment model for plasma morphine, the area under the curve to infinity (AUC, 7143 ng ml-1 min), volume of distribution (3.6 l kg-1 ) and elimination half-life (88 min) were comparable with those reported in adults. Clearance (35 ml min-1 ) was higher than that in adults. Morphine-6-glucuronide was readily synthesized by the children in this study. The elimination half-life (321 min) and AUC (35507 ng ml-1 min) of plasma M6G were much greater than those of morphine. CONCLUSIONS: Extensive metabolism of morphine to M6G in children with cancer has been demonstrated. These data provide further evidence to support the importance of M6G accumulation after multiple doses. There was no evidence that morphine passed more easily into the CSF of children than adults.","['Hain, R D', 'Hardcastle, A', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Aherne, G W']","['Hain RD', 'Hardcastle A', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Aherne GW']","['Departments of Paediatric Oncology and Palliative Care, Llandough and Community NHS Trust, Penlan Road, Cardiff CF64 2XX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,IM,,"['Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Morphine/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics', 'Morphine Derivatives/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*pharmacokinetics']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 1999 Jul;48(1):37-42. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00948.x.,"['0 (Morphine Derivatives)', '64Y9KYM60R (morphine-6-glucuronide)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",,,"['bcp948 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2125.1999.00948.x [doi]']",PMC2014881,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the cellular basis for this aberrant production, we analyzed two cell lines, B1 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and W1 (juvenile chronic myelogenous leukemia), which express high levels of IL-1beta and have mutations in the K-RAS and N-RAS genes, respectively. Electromobility shift assays demonstrated transcription factor binding at multiple IL-1beta promoter elements [nuclear factor (NF)-IL6/CREB, NFB1, NFkappaB, and NF-IL6], consistent with the activation of an upstream signaling pathway. To determine whether activated Ras was involved, two structurally distinct classes of farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitors (the monoterpenes and a peptidomimetic) and an adenoviral vector expressing antisense targeted to K-RAS were used to specifically interfere with Ras function and/or expression. Treatment with the FTase inhibitors resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in both NF-IL6/CREB binding to the IL-1beta promoter and IL-1beta protein levels, without a significant change in total cellular protein levels. Furthermore, exposure of the B1 cells to antisense against K-RAS resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in both p21Ras and IL-1beta protein levels. Growth suppression was observed after FTase inhibitor or antisense exposure, an effect that was partially reversible by the addition of recombinant IL-1beta to the cultures. Our observations suggest that mutated RAS genes may mediate autocrine IL-1beta production in some leukemias by stimulating signal transduction pathways that activate the IL-1beta promoter.","['Beaupre, D M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Marini, F C 3rd', 'Cristiano, R J', 'Roth, J A', 'Estrov, Z', 'Albitar, M', 'Freedman, M H', 'Kurzrock, R']","['Beaupre DM', 'Talpaz M', 'Marini FC 3rd', 'Cristiano RJ', 'Roth JA', 'Estrov Z', 'Albitar M', 'Freedman MH', 'Kurzrock R']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, ras/physiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger', 'Signal Transduction', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/26 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/06/26 10:00'],"['1999/06/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jun 15;59(12):2971-80.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In initial dose-finding studies in nude mice, the efficacy of P-4055 was highest when using schedules with repeated daily doses. In a Raji Burkitt's lymphoma leptomeningeal carcinomatosis model in nude rats, the control cytarabine- and saline-treated animals (five in each group) had a mean survival time of 13.2 days, whereas treatment with P-4055 resulted in three of five long-time survivors (>70 days). In a systemic Raji leukemia model in nude mice, 8 of 10 of the P-4055-treated animals survived (>80 days), compared with none of the cytarabine-treated animals (mean survival time, 34.2 days). In s.c. xenograft models, the effects of maximum tolerated doses of P-4055 and cytarabine, given in four weekly cycles of daily bolus i.v. injections for 5 subsequent days, against seven tumors (three melanomas, one lung adenocarcinoma, one breast cancer, and two osteogenic sarcomas) were investigated. P-4055 induced partial or complete tumor regression of the lung carcinoma, as well as of all three malignant melanomas. In two of the melanomas the activity was highly superior to that of cytarabine, and both P-4055 and cytarabine were, in general, more effective than several clinically established drugs previously tested in the same tumor models. In in vitro studies, inhibitors of nucleoside carrier-dependent transport, nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside and dipyridamol, reduced strongly the cellular sensitivity to cytarabine, but not to P-4055, indicating that P-4055 uses an alternative/additional mechanism of internalization into the cell compared with cytarabine. The results explain, at least in part, the observed differences between the two compounds in in vivo efficacy, and together the data strongly support the evaluation of P-4055 in clinical studies.","['Breistol, K', 'Balzarini, J', 'Sandvold, M L', 'Myhren, F', 'Martinsen, M', 'De Clercq, E', 'Fodstad, O']","['Breistol K', 'Balzarini J', 'Sandvold ML', 'Myhren F', 'Martinsen M', 'De Clercq E', 'Fodstad O']","['Department of Tumor Biology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Nude', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jun 15;59(12):2944-9.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (elaidic acid-cytarabine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This E-ring modification provides a less reactive lactone with enhanced stability and decreased protein binding in human plasma. Biological testing against CPT revealed that, instead of being detrimental, the modified lactone of hCPT has a positive impact on topoisomerase I (Topo I) poisoning properties. In vitro tests showed hCPT to fully conserve the ability to stabilize Topo I-DNA cleavage complexes and to stimulate a higher level of DNA cleavage than CPT. A similar trend toward improvement was also observed in antiproliferative assays with human tumor cell lines (including cells overexpressing P-glycoprotein). In two distinct in vivo models, using L1210 murine leukemia or human colon carcinoma HT29, hCPT was found to be more efficacious than CPT. The slow, but irreversible, hydrolysis of hCPT, instead of the fast equilibrium of CPT, may account for its good in vivo activity. Overall, these results provide evidence that a highly reactive lactone is not a requisite for the Topo I-mediated antitumor activity of CPT analogues, and that hCPT is an interesting pharmacological tool with improved solution behavior as well as a promising new template for the preparation of more efficacious Topo I poisons.","['Lesueur-Ginot, L', 'Demarquay, D', 'Kiss, R', 'Kasprzyk, P G', 'Dassonneville, L', 'Bailly, C', 'Camara, J', 'Lavergne, O', 'Bigg, D C']","['Lesueur-Ginot L', 'Demarquay D', 'Kiss R', 'Kasprzyk PG', 'Dassonneville L', 'Bailly C', 'Camara J', 'Lavergne O', 'Bigg DC']","['Institut Henri Beaufour, Les Ulis, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Camptothecin/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'HT29 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactones/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jun 15;59(12):2939-43.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'CW4115HGT9 (homocamptothecin)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we used inhibitors of HDAC1 to study the pathophysiology of AML1-ETO. Both the potent inhibitor, trichostatin (TSA), and the well-known but less specific inhibitor, phenylbutyrate (PB), could partially reverse ETO-mediated transcriptional repression. PB was also able to induce partial differentiation of the AML1-ETO cell line, Kasumi-1. With the intention of developing a clinically useful protocol, we combined PB with a number of other agents that induced differentiation and apoptosis of Kasumi-1 cells. In summary, transcriptional repression mediated by AML1-ETO appears to play a mechanistic role in the t(8;21) AML, and relief of repression using agents such as PB (alone or in combination) may prove to be therapeutically useful.","['Wang, J', 'Saunthararajah, Y', 'Redner, R L', 'Liu, J M']","['Wang J', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Redner RL', 'Liu JM']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phenylbutyrates/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jun 15;59(12):2766-9.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylbutyrates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively reviewed all adult ABMT/PBSCT cases performed at the University of Chicago Medical Center from 1985 to 1997 in order to determine the incidence of therapy-related leukemia. Among 649 patients, seven (1.1%) developed therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia (one patient) or t-MDS/t-AML (six patients). Of these seven, primary malignancies included one case of breast carcinoma, five cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Disease-specific incidences for therapy-related leukemia occurring after ABMT/PBSCT were one in 354 (0.3%) for breast carcinoma, five in 79 (6.3%) for HD and one in 103 (1%) for NHL. The median latency periods for the development of therapy-related leukemia from the time of initial diagnosis and of ABMT/PBSCT were 5.5 and 1.5 years, respectively, for the combined HD and NHL group of patients and 4.4 and 2.8 years, respectively, for the one breast carcinoma patient. All seven patients had clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and five had recurring abnormalities typical of myeloid disorders. Given the similar latency period observed in patients treated with conventional chemotherapy alone, our findings support the hypothesis that therapy-related leukemia after ABMT/PBSCT likely results from pre-transplant therapy. Early detection of therapy-related leukemia is therefore critical to exclude these patients from undergoing ABMT/PBSCT.","['Sobecks, R M', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Anastasi, J', 'Williams, S F']","['Sobecks RM', 'Le Beau MM', 'Anastasi J', 'Williams SF']","['Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 Jun;23(11):1161-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701781.,,,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701781 [doi]'],,,['CA 40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Producing this effect (referred to as the graft-versus-leukemia reaction or GVL) is a current goal of clinical transplantation. At present, all protocols rely on the injection of donor T cells with unknown specificities. In keeping with this approach, we recently proposed the use of a single allogeneic T cell clone transfected with the HSv-tk gene to target an HLA-DPB1 mismatch in the GVH direction. For this strategy to be successful, HLA-DP antigens must be expressed on leukemic cells, which should be recognised by the HLA-DP-specific T cell clone and subsequently destroyed. In the present study, differential expression of HLA-DR, -DQ and -DP was tested by fluorescence using monoclonal antibodies on a panel of 46 acute myeloid leukemias (AML), 28 acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) and 31 chronic lymphocytic leukemias of B cell origin (B-CLL). The vast majority of leukemic cells expressed HLA-DP antigens although with considerable variability. HLA-DPB1 genotyped leukemic cells were used as target cells for an HLA-DPB1*0401-specific T cell clone. Specific recognition of leukemic blasts was demonstrated for 11 out of 11 B-CLL, 11 out of 19 AML and nine out of 16 ALL.

Fifty-eight patients with hematologic malignancies were treated with cyclophosphamide, high-dose ara-C and total body irradiation (TBI) followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Fifty patients had good prognosis disease and eight had poor prognosis disease. Cyclosporine and short-course methotrexate were used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.

Cyclophosphamide, ara-C and TBI is a safe and effective myeloablative regimen for patients with leukemia. The overall relapse rate in our study was 7% with a median follow-up of 28 months and appears to be lower than relapse rates reported in other series.

A secondary objective was to determine whether apoptosis induced by ATO compared with VP-16 is differentially affected by an activator of protein kinase C (PKC), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which has been reported to inhibit apoptosis induced by some chemotherapeutic agents. NB4 and HL60 cells were incubated with ATO in the presence and absence of the caspase protease inhibitors Z-VAD.fmk or Y-VAD.cho. Apoptosis was assessed by morphology, DNA laddering and flow cytometry. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage was used as a marker for the activation of caspases. PARP cleavage occurred during ATO-induced apoptosis in both NB4 and HL60 cells. Z-VAD.fmk, a broad-spectrum inhibitor, could block ATO-induced apoptosis and PARP cleavage, whilst Y-VAD.cho, a selective inhibitor of caspase 1, had no such effect. PMA pre-incubation for up to 8 hours under conditions known to activate PKC had no effect on either ATO- or VP-16-induced apoptosis. We conclude that in cultured myeloid leukemia cells ATO-induced apoptosis is executed by caspases from the distal, PARP-cleaving part of the activation cascade and that PKC activation has no effect on apoptosis induced by either ATO or VP-16 in these cells.","['Huang, X J', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Klein, R S', 'Gallagher, R E']","['Huang XJ', 'Wiernik PH', 'Klein RS', 'Gallagher RE']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, The Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,IM,,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/enzymology/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol. 1999 Apr;16(1):58-64. doi: 10.1007/BF02787360.,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,['10.1007/BF02787360 [doi]'],,,['P30 CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiazolidinediones were developed as insulin-sensitizing drugs and are ligands for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptory (PPARgamma). We hypothesized that the anti-diabetic mechanism of thiazolidinediones depends on the quantity of PPARgamma in the insulin resistant state in which inflammatory cytokines play a part. METHODS: We isolated rat PPARgamma1 and gamma2 cDNAs and examined effects of various cytokines and thiazolidinediones on PPARgamma mRNA expression in rat mature adipocytes. RESULTS: Various inflammatory cytokines, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6 and leukaemia inhibitory factor decreased PPARgamma mRNA expression. In addition, hydrogen peroxide, lysophosphatidylcholine or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also decreased the expression of PPARgamma. The suppression of PPARgamma mRNA expression caused by 10 nmol/l of TNF-alpha was reversed 60% and 55% by treatment with 10(-4) mol/l of troglitazone and 10(-4) mol/l of pioglitazone, respectively. The suppression of glucose transporter 4 mRNA expression caused by TNF-alpha was also reversed by thiazolidinediones. Associated with the change of PPARgamma mRNA expression, troglitazone improved glucose uptake suppressed by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Our study suggests that inflammatory cytokines could be factors that regulate PPARgamma expression for possible modulation of insulin resistance. In addition, we speculate that the regulation of PPARgamma mRNA expression may contribute to the anti-diabetic mechanism of thiazolidinediones.","['Tanaka, T', 'Itoh, H', 'Doi, K', 'Fukunaga, Y', 'Hosoda, K', 'Shintani, M', 'Yamashita, J', 'Chun, T H', 'Inoue, M', 'Masatsugu, K', 'Sawada, N', 'Saito, T', 'Inoue, G', 'Nishimura, H', 'Yoshimasa, Y', 'Nakao, K']","['Tanaka T', 'Itoh H', 'Doi K', 'Fukunaga Y', 'Hosoda K', 'Shintani M', 'Yamashita J', 'Chun TH', 'Inoue M', 'Masatsugu K', 'Sawada N', 'Saito T', 'Inoue G', 'Nishimura H', 'Yoshimasa Y', 'Nakao K']","['Department of Medicine and Clinical Science, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, Sakyouku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,IM,,"['Adipocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyglucose/metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monosaccharide Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Muscle Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diabetologia. 1999 Jun;42(6):702-10. doi: 10.1007/s001250051218.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 4)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Monosaccharide Transport Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Slc2a4 protein, rat)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'AA68LXK93C (2,4-thiazolidinedione)']",,,['10.1007/s001250051218 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiments described here characterize the mesencephalic progenitor cells and their cytokine-induced conversion into dopamine (DA) neurons. For all experiments, we used bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-ir cultures of (E14.5) mesencephalic progenitor cells that had been expanded at least 21 days. We first demonstrated that IL-1 induced DA neuron conversion in mesencephalic progenitors, but not in striatal progenitors (P < 0.001). Thus, these cells should be classified as lineage-restricted progenitors, and not omnipotent stem cells. To further characterize cell populations in these cultures, we used monoclonal antibodies against Hu (an early marker for neurons), growth-associated protein (GAP)-43 (a marker for neuronal process extension), TH (a marker for DA neurons), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, a marker for astrocytes). We assessed (E14.5) mesencephalic progenitor cell cultures (plated at 125,000 cells/cm2) incubated in the cytokine mixture (described above) or in complete media (CM, negative control). Following 7 days incubation, GFAP-positive cells formed a nearly confluent carpet in both types of cultures. However, numbers of Hu-ir and GAP-43-ir cells in the cytokine-incubated cultures far exceeded those in CM-incubated controls (P = 0.0003, P = 0.0001, respectively), while numbers of TH-ir cells were 58-fold greater in the cytokine-incubated cultures versus CM-incubated controls. The TH phenotype persisted for 7 days following withdrawal of the differentiation media. Numerous double-labeled cells that were BrdU-ir and also TH-ir, or Hu-ir and also TH-ir, were observed in the cytokine-incubated cultures. These data suggest that cytokines ""drive"" the conversion of progenitor cells into DA neurons.","['Potter, E D', 'Ling, Z D', 'Carvey, P M']","['Potter ED', 'Ling ZD', 'Carvey PM']","[""Department of Pharmacology and Neurological Sciences, Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Dopamine/metabolism', 'Fetus', 'GAP-43 Protein/analysis', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mesencephalon/cytology/*embryology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/analysis']",1999/06/26 00:00,1999/06/26 00:01,['1999/06/26 00:00'],"['1999/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 1999 May;296(2):235-46. doi: 10.1007/s004410051285.,"['0 (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Gdnf protein, rat)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",,,['10.1007/s004410051285 [doi]'],,,"['NS10302/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS33174/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

When a FasL-expressing cell binds a Fas-bearing immune cell, it triggers its death by apoptosis. In this study, we demonstrate that normal human endometrial epithelial but not stromal cells express FasL. Moreover, we showed that macrophage-conditioned media induced FasL expression by endometrial stromal cells in a dose-dependent manner. To elucidate which macrophage product was responsible for the up-regulation of FasL, endometrial stromal cell cultures were treated with the macrophage products platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The first two (which are known to be elevated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis) induced a dose-dependent up-regulation of FasL expression, which was specifically inhibited by the antibody. Interestingly, bFGF (which is not elevated in peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis) did not induce any response. These results suggest that the pro-inflammatory nature of the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis induces the FasL expression by regurgitated endometrial cells, and signals Fas-mediated cell death of activated immune cells. This could be a mechanism for endometrial cells to escape immune surveillance, implant and grow.","['Garcia-Velasco, J A', 'Arici, A', 'Zreik, T', 'Naftolin, F', 'Mor, G']","['Garcia-Velasco JA', 'Arici A', 'Zreik T', 'Naftolin F', 'Mor G']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Choriocarcinoma', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Endometrium/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Female', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Ligands', 'Macrophages/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Neoplasms']",1999/06/25 00:00,1999/06/25 00:01,['1999/06/25 00:00'],"['1999/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1999 Jul;5(7):642-50. doi: 10.1093/molehr/5.7.642.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)']",,,['10.1093/molehr/5.7.642 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the adult mouse, PREP1 is expressed ubiquitously, with peaks in testis and thymus. We further demonstrate the presence of murine Prep1 mRNA and protein, and of different DNA-binding PREP1-PBX complexes, in mouse embryos from at least 9.5 days p.c. Moreover, we show that PREP1 is present in all embryonic tissues from at least 7.5-17.5 days p.c with a predominantly nuclear staining. PREP1 is able to super-activate the PBX-HOXB-1 autoregulated Hoxb-1 promoter, and we show that all three proteins, PREP1, PBX and HOXB-1, are present together in the mouse rhombomere 4 domain in vivo, compatible with a role of PREP1 as a regulator of PBX and HOXB-1 proteins activity during development.","['Ferretti, E', 'Schulz, H', 'Talarico, D', 'Blasi, F', 'Berthelsen, J']","['Ferretti E', 'Schulz H', 'Talarico D', 'Blasi F', 'Berthelsen J']","['Molecular Genetics Unit, Department of Biology and Biotechnology (DIBIT), H.S.

This study investigated the role of NK cell alloreactivity in human HLA haplotype-mismatched hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and, specifically, the role of the three major NK specificities, ie, those for HLA-C group 1, HLA-C group 2, and HLA-Bw4 alleles. In 20 of 60 donor-recipient pairs, KIR epitope incompatibility and functional analyses of donor NK cell clones predicted donor NK cells could cause graft-versus-host (GVH)/graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactions. NK cell clones of donor origin were obtained from transplanted recipients and tested for lysis of recipient's cryopreserved pretransplant lymphocytes. Despite the absence of GVH disease, we detected high frequencies of NK clones which killed recipient's target cells. Lysis followed the rules of NK cell alloreactivity, being blocked only by the MHC class I KIR epitope which was missing in the recipient. The alloreactive NK clones also killed the allogeneic leukemia. Transplants from these KIR epitope incompatible donors had higher engraftment rates. Therefore, a GVL effector and engraftment facilitating mechanism, which is independent of T-cell-mediated GVH reactions, may be operational in HLA mismatched hematopoietic cell transplants.","['Ruggeri, L', 'Capanni, M', 'Casucci, M', 'Volpi, I', 'Tosti, A', 'Perruccio, K', 'Urbani, E', 'Negrin, R S', 'Martelli, M F', 'Velardi, A']","['Ruggeri L', 'Capanni M', 'Casucci M', 'Volpi I', 'Tosti A', 'Perruccio K', 'Urbani E', 'Negrin RS', 'Martelli MF', 'Velardi A']","['Division of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, the Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/06/25 00:00,1999/06/25 00:01,['1999/06/25 00:00'],"['1999/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 1;94(1):333-9.,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67514-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been shown for anonymous polymorphic markers at 11q23 in adult leukemias. To study LOH at the MLL locus, we have identified two new polymorphic microsatellite markers: a GAA repeat (mllGAAn) in intron 6 of the MLL gene and a GA (mllGAn) repeat in the 5' flanking region of the gene, approximately 2 kb upstream of the translation initiation codon. The heterozygosity index of mllGAAn is 0.54, which renders it useful for analyzing LOH. We screened two groups of leukemia patients to study LOH at the mllGAAn marker. Group A (n = 18) was selected on the basis of presentation before 18 months. Cytogenetic and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that 9 of these 18 children had translocations involving MLL. No LOH was observed. Group B (n = 36) were randomly selected children who had presented with leukemia between 1993 and 1994. Cytogenetic analysis of this group showed a variety of different chromosomal abnormalities. LOH was shown in 9 of 20 individuals (45%) who were informative. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was demonstrated in 1 of 18 individuals in group A and 5 of 36 individuals (13.9%) in group B. MSI and LOH were observed simultaneously in three individuals. Loss of an allele was confirmed in one individual by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Individuals with MSI or LOH at mllGAAn were selected for analysis at anonymous polymorphic markers D11S1364 and D11S1356, which flank the MLL gene. No LOH or MSI was observed at these markers in those individuals who were informative. These results show that LOH at the MLL gene locus is a common event during leukemogenesis. Furthermore, the presence of MSI at this locus suggests that the region is a hotspot for genetic instability.","['Webb, J C', 'Golovleva, I', 'Simpkins, A H', 'Kempski, H', 'Reeves, B', 'Sturt, N', 'Chessells, J M', 'Brickell, P M']","['Webb JC', 'Golovleva I', 'Simpkins AH', 'Kempski H', 'Reeves B', 'Sturt N', 'Chessells JM', 'Brickell PM']","[""Leukaemia Research Fund, Paul O'Gorman Centre for Childhood Leukaemia, Molecular Haematology Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Satellite/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics/physiopathology', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors']",1999/06/25 00:00,1999/06/25 00:01,['1999/06/25 00:00'],"['1999/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 1;94(1):283-90.,"['0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,['Blood. 2003 May 15;101(10):4222; author reply 4222-3.

The i(17q) hence plays a presumably important pathogenetic role both in leukemia development and progression. This notwithstanding, the molecular consequences of this abnormality have not been investigated in detail. We have analyzed 21 hematologic malignancies (8 CML in blast crisis, 8 myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS], 2 acute myeloid leukemias, 2 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, and 1 acute lymphoblastic leukemia) with i(17q) by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig, derived from the short arm of chromosome 17, all cases were shown to have a breakpoint in 17p. In 12 cases, the breaks occurred within the Smith-Magenis Syndrome (SMS) common deletion region in 17p11, a gene-rich region which is genetically unstable. In 10 of these 12 cases, we were able to further map the breakpoints to specific markers localized within a single YAC clone. Six other cases showed breakpoints located proximally to the SMS common deletion region, but still within 17p11, and yet another case had a breakpoint distal to this region. Furthermore, using chromosome 17 centromere-specific probes, it could be shown that the majority of the i(17q) chromosomes (11 of 15 investigated cases) were dicentric, ie, they contained two centromeres, strongly suggesting that i(17q) is formed through an intrachromosomal recombination event, and also implicating that the i(17q), in a formal sense, should be designated idic(17)(p11). Because i(17q) formation results in loss of 17p material, potentially uncovering the effect of a tumor suppressor on the remaining 17p, the occurrence of TP53 mutations was studied in 17 cases by sequencing the entire coding region. In 16 cases, no TP53 mutations were found, whereas one MDS displayed a homozygous deletion of TP53. Thus, our data suggest that there is no association between i(17q) and coding TP53 mutations, and that another tumor suppressor gene(s), located in proximity of the SMS common deletion region, or in a more distal location, is of pathogenetic importance in i(17q)-associated leukemia.","['Fioretos, T', 'Strombeck, B', 'Sandberg, T', 'Johansson, B', 'Billstrom, R', 'Borg, A', 'Nilsson, P G', 'Van Den Berghe, H', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Mitelman, F', 'Hoglund, M']","['Fioretos T', 'Strombeck B', 'Sandberg T', 'Johansson B', 'Billstrom R', 'Borg A', 'Nilsson PG', 'Van Den Berghe H', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Mitelman F', 'Hoglund M']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.

Much evidence indicates that K+-channel activity is required for G1 progression of the cell cycle in different cell backgrounds, suggesting that K+-channel activity is required for early-stage cell proliferation in these cells. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this phenomenon. We have shown in human myeloblastic leukemia ML-1 cells that K+ channels are activated by epidermal growth factor (EGF), whereas serum starvation deprivation suppressed their activity. In addition, voltage-gated K+ channels are required for G1/S-phase transition of the cell cycle. We report here that suppression of K+ channels prevented the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK-2) in response to EGF and serum. However, blockade of K+ channels did not prevent ERK-2 activation induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). Elimination of extracellular Ca2+ did not alter either ERK-2 activation or the effect of K+-channel blockade on ERK-2 activation. Our data demonstrate that the K+ channel is a part of the EGF-mediated mitogenic signal-transduction process and is required for initiation of the EGF-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Our findings may thus explain why an increase in K+-channel activity is associated with cell proliferation in many types of cells, including ML-1 cells.","['Xu, D', 'Wang, L', 'Dai, W', 'Lu, L']","['Xu D', 'Wang L', 'Dai W', 'Lu L']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine, Wright State University, Dayton, OH 45435, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*physiology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Potassium Channels/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/25 00:00,1999/06/25 00:01,['1999/06/25 00:00'],"['1999/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jul 1;94(1):139-45.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)67490-0 [pii]'],,,"['CA59985/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY11653/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46834/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retinoic acid forces terminal maturation of the malignant cells and this application represents the first generally accepted differentiation-based therapy in leukemia. Unfortunately, similar approaches have failed in other types of hematological malignancies suggesting that the applicability is limited to this specific subgroup of patients. This has been endorsed by the notorious lack of response in acute promyelocytic leukemia bearing the variant t(11;17) translocation. Based on the reported synergistic effects of retinoic acid and the hematopoietic growth factor granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), we studied maturation of t(11;17) positive leukemia cells using several combinations of retinoic acid and growth factors. In cultures with retinoic acid or G-CSF the leukemic cells did not differentiate into mature granulocytes, but striking granulocytic differentiation occurred with the combination of both agents. At relapse, the patient was treated with retinoic acid and G-CSF before reinduction chemotherapy. With retinoic acid and G-CSF treatment alone, complete granulocytic maturation of the leukemic cells occurred in vivo, followed by a complete cytogenetical and hematological remission. Bone marrow and blood became negative in fluorescense in situ hybridization analysis and semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed a profound reduction of promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger-retinoic acid receptor-alpha fusion transcripts.

Competitive repopulation assays were conducted where ""test"" FancC -/- or FancC +/+ BM cells (expressing CD45.2) were cotransplanted with congenic competitor cells (expressing CD45.1) into irradiated mice. In two independent experiments, we determined that FancC -/- BM cells have a profound decrease in short-term, as well as long-term, multilineage repopulating ability. To determine quantitatively the relative production of progeny cells by each test cell population, we calculated test cell contribution to chimerism as compared with 1 x 10(5) competitor cells. We determined that FancC -/- cells have a 7-fold to 12-fold decrease in repopulating ability compared with FancC +/+ cells. These data indicate that loss of FancC function results in reduced in vivo repopulating ability of pluripotential hematopoietic stem cells, which may play a role in the development of the BM failure in FA patients.

We found that (1) apoptosis, but not mitotic arrest, was inhibited in cells with constitutive expression of Bcl-2; (2) pretreatment of cells with the DNA synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea blocked the mitotic arrest but not the apoptosis mediated by okadaic acid; (3) down-regulation of c-myc gene was associated with apoptosis, but not with mitotic arrest; and (4) inhibition of protein synthesis abrogated mitotic arrest, but not apoptosis.

At the same time, thymidine incorporation and inositol lipid signaling were significantly reduced. Control (sham exposed) or non-neuronal cells (mouse leukemia, and human breast carcinoma cells) did not show any alteration following exposure. Endothelin-1 release from FNC-B4 cells was also dramatically reduced after 5 min exposure. However, PCR analysis of 12 DNA microsatellites selected as gauges of genome instability, did not reveal any alteration following exposure, thus ruling out a direct effect of the magnetic field on DNA stability.

Stretched amembraneous nuclei and mitotic figures had no features of induced chromatin dispersion and compaction. Stretched interphase amembraneous nuclei showed spatially separated individual structures (thin chromatin fibres, nucleoli, intranuclear bodies), polymorphous pattern of perinucleolar chromatin aggregation and episodically expressed beaded thick chromatin fibres and a chromocenter. The chromomeric pattern of the spread chromosomes of mitotic figures was quite similar but hardly identical with that of G-banding. The stretched prometaphase mitotic figures in all tested cell types always contained loose ""residual"" nucleoli looking like typical prophase nucleoli as concerns their shape and number per cell (mitotic figure). The majority of chromosomes of stretched mitotic figures and of prophase amembraneous nuclei were attached to the nucleolar material. All tested cell lines showed almost the same variation in number of nucleolus-attached chromosomes, per both prophase amembraneous nucleus and prometaphase mitotic figure. Some chromosomes of stretched mitotic figures were colocated with ""residual"" nucleoli and looked shortened and strongly condensed. Other chromosomes, locally associated with ""residual"" nucleoli, were straight and oriented radially to these. Mutual chromosomal arrangements in mitotic cells on smears and in stretched mitotic figures were analogous. Equatorial plates from PBS-washed SK-UT-1B cells displayed a better stretching capacity than those from untreated cells. In the former case metaphase chromosomes were seen more uniformly stretched and well identified after GTG-banding procedure. The number of interchromosomal (mainly telomere-telomeric and telomere-centromeric) connections per stretched mitotic figure (or per stretched prophase amembraneous nucleus) was minimum in late prometaphase, maximum in prophase and early prometaphase, and intermediate in metaphase.

In culture, neural crest cells can be induced to differentiate into either neuronal phenotype. Few studies have examined the differentiation of physiological properties in cultures of neural crest cells. Using whole-cell recordings, our study examined the effects of growth factors on high-voltage-activated calcium current profiles exhibited by neurons differentiating in culture. We compared these profiles with those exhibited by sensory and sympathetic neurons. Neural crest cells in culture gave rise to neurons with calcium current profiles identical to either sensory or sympathetic neurons, depending on the growth conditions. On average, the calcium current profile for sensory neurons was 23% (L), 51% (N), and 12% (P), while sympathetic neurons had a similar L-type current (20%), higher N-type (76%), and lower P-type (4%). Neural crest cells cultured with human leukemia inhibitory factor plus somite cells produced neurons with a sympathetic-like calcium current profile (L: 17%, N: 75%, and P: 4%). However, murine leukemia inhibitory factor (L: 25%, N: 52%, and P: 13%) and ciliary neurotrophic factor (L: 18%, N: 49%, and P: 9%) plus somite cells produced neurons with sensory-like calcium current profiles. These growth conditions did not modify the calcium current profiles of neurons cultured from embryonic and neonatal ganglia. Similarly, murine leukemia inhibitory factor produced a greater percentage of neurons (57%) with sensitivity to capsaicin (sensory phenotype) than human leukemia inhibitory factor (3%). Physiological traits can be a useful tool for the determination of neuronal phenotype in culture where other traits may be less stable.","['Carey, M B', 'Matsumoto, S G']","['Carey MB', 'Matsumoto SG']","['Department of Biological Structure and Function, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Neurobiol,Journal of neurobiology,0213640,IM,,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/analysis/physiology', 'Calcium Channels, L-Type', '*Calcium Channels, N-Type', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/embryology/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Homovanillic Acid/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Neural Crest/*cytology', 'Neurons, Afferent/chemistry/*cytology/*metabolism', 'POU Domain Factors', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/physiology', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/analysis/physiology', 'Somites/cytology', 'Spider Venoms/pharmacology', 'Superior Cervical Ganglion/cytology/embryology/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor Brn-3', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/biosynthesis/physiology', 'omega-Agatoxin IVA', 'omega-Conotoxin GVIA']",1999/06/24 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/24 10:00'],"['1999/06/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurobiol. 1999 Jun 15;39(4):501-14. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19990615)39:4<501::aid-neu4>3.0.co;2-9.,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Calcium Channels, L-Type)', '0 (Calcium Channels, N-Type)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (POU Domain Factors)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Spider Venoms)', '0 (Transcription Factor Brn-3)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (omega-Agatoxin IVA)', '0 (voltage-dependent calcium channel (P-Q type))', '92078-76-7 (omega-Conotoxin GVIA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'X77S6GMS36 (Homovanillic Acid)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4695(19990615)39:4<501::AID-NEU4>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-4695(19990615)39:4<501::aid-neu4>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",,,['NS29010/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cancers diagnosed in 14540 children under age 15 years from 1975 through 1995 and reported to nine population-based registries in the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program were investigated. Age-adjusted incidence was analyzed according to anatomic site and histologic categories of the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. Age-adjusted U.S. mortality rates were calculated. Trends in rates were evaluated by use of standard regression methods. RESULTS: A modest rise in the incidence of leukemia, the most common childhood cancer, was largely due to an abrupt increase from 1983 to 1984; rates have decreased slightly since 1989. For brain and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers, incidence rose modestly, although statistically significantly (two-sided P = .020), largely from 1983 through 1986. A few rare childhood cancers demonstrated upward trends (e.g., the 40% of skin cancers designated as dermatofibrosarcomas, adrenal neuroblastomas, and retinoblastomas, the latter two in infants only). In contrast, incidence decreased modestly but statistically significantly for Hodgkin's disease (two-sided P = .037). Mortality rates declined steadily for all major childhood cancer categories, although less rapidly for brain/CNS cancers. CONCLUSIONS: There was no substantial change in incidence for the major pediatric cancers, and rates have remained relatively stable since the mid-1980s. The modest increases that were observed for brain/CNS cancers, leukemia, and infant neuroblastoma were confined to the mid-1980s. The patterns suggest that the increases likely reflected diagnostic improvements or reporting changes. Dramatic declines in childhood cancer mortality represent treatment-related improvements in survival.","['Linet, M S', 'Ries, L A', 'Smith, M A', 'Tarone, R E', 'Devesa, S S']","['Linet MS', 'Ries LA', 'Smith MA', 'Tarone RE', 'Devesa SS']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-7238, USA. linetm@epndce.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'SEER Program', 'United States/epidemiology']",1999/06/24 00:00,1999/06/24 00:01,['1999/06/24 00:00'],"['1999/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Jun 16;91(12):1051-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.12.1051.,,,,['10.1093/jnci/91.12.1051 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four of eight immunized sheep showed specific proliferative responses against both of the peptide stimulations. To characterize the cells responding to the peptides, peptide-specific cells were established from the responding sheep by the continuous stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with either peptide 98 or 61 in vitro. The peptide 98-specific cells consisted of CD4-positive cells, whereas the peptide 61-specific cells consisted of CD8-positive cells and MHC class II-positive cells. In addition, cytokine profile analysis indicated that the peptide 98-stimulated cells expressed IFN-gamma but not IL-10, although the peptide 61-stimulated cells expressed IL-10 but not IFN-gamma.

With an incidence of 3-4%, the i(17q) represents the most frequent isochromosome in human cancer.

To determine the breakpoints on the molecular genetic level, we analyzed 18 neoplasms (six CML, four AML, one NHL, and seven MB) with an i(17q) and two MB with a pure del(17p) applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clones, P1-artificial chromosome (PAC) clones, and cosmids from a well-characterized contig covering more than 6 Mb of genomic DNA. We identified four different breakpoint cluster regions. One is located close to or within the centromere of chromosome 17 and a second in the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1A) region at 17(p11.2). A third breakpoint was found telomeric to the CMT1A region. The fourth, most common breakpoint was detected in MB, AML, and in CML-BC specimens and was bordered by two adjacent cosmid clones (clones D14149 and M0140) within the Smith-Magenis syndrome (SMS) region. These results indicate that the low copy number repeat gene clusters which are present in the CMT and SMS regions may be one of the factors for the increased instability that may trigger the formation of an i(17q).","['Scheurlen, W G', 'Schwabe, G C', 'Seranski, P', 'Joos, S', 'Harbott, J', 'Metzke, S', 'Dohner, H', 'Poustka, A', 'Wilgenbus, K', 'Haas, O A']","['Scheurlen WG', 'Schwabe GC', 'Seranski P', 'Joos S', 'Harbott J', 'Metzke S', 'Dohner H', 'Poustka A', 'Wilgenbus K', 'Haas OA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Mannheim, Germany. w.scheurlen@kikli.ma.uni-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Centromere/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakage/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant', 'Isochromosomes/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics']",1999/06/24 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/24 10:00'],"['1999/06/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/24 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1999 Jul;25(3):230-40. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199907)25:3<230::aid-gcc5>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199907)25:3<230::AID-GCC5>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199907)25:3<230::aid-gcc5>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also used in over-the-counter (OTC) drugs as an ingredient in skin lighteners and is a natural ingredient in many plant-derived products, including vegetables, fruits, grains, coffee, tea, beer, and wine. While there are few reports of adverse health effects associated with the production and use of HQ, a great deal of research has been conducted with HQ because it is a metabolite of benzene. Physicochemical differences between HQ and benzene play a significant role in altering the pharmacokinetics of directly administered when compared with benzene-derived HQ. HQ is only weakly positive in in vivo chromosomal assays when expected human exposure routes are used. Chromosomal effects are increased significantly when parenteral or in vitro assays are used. In cancer bioassays, HQ has reproducibly produced renal adenomas in male F344 rats. The mechanism of tumorigenesis is unclear but probably involves a species-, strain-, and sex-specific interaction between renal tubule toxicity and an interaction with the chronic progressive nephropathy that is characteristic of aged male rats. Mouse liver tumors (adenomas) and mononuclear cell leukemia (female F344 rat) have also been reported following HQ exposure, but their significance is uncertain. Various tumor initiation/promotion assays with HQ have shown generally negative results. Epidemiological studies with HQ have demonstrated lower death rates and reduced cancer rates in production workers when compared with both general and employed referent populations. Parenteral administration of HQ is associated with changes in several hematopoietic and immunologic endpoints. This toxicity is more severe when combined with parenteral administration of phenol. It is likely that oxidation of HQ within the bone marrow compartment to the semiquinone or p-benzoquinone (BQ), followed by covalent macromolecular binding, is critical to these effects. Bone marrow and hematologic effects are generally not characteristic of HQ exposures in animal studies employing routes of exposure other than parenteral. Myelotoxicity is also not associated with human exposure to HQ. These differences are likely due to significant route-dependent toxicokinetic factors. Fetotoxicity (growth retardation) accompanies repeated administration of HQ at maternally toxic dose levels in animal studies. HQ exposure has not been associated with other reproductive and developmental effects using current USEPA test guidelines. The skin pigment lightening properties of HQ appear to be due to inhibition of melanocyte tyrosinase. Adverse effects associated with OTC use of HQ in FDA-regulated products have been limited to a small number of cases of exogenous ochronosis, although higher incidences of this syndrome have been reported with inappropriate use of unregulated OTC products containing higher HQ concentrations. The most serious human health effect related to HQ is pigmentation of the eye and, in a small number of cases, permanent corneal damage. This effect has been observed in HQ production workers, but the relative contributions of HQ and BQ to this process have not been delineated.

In Mexico City, environmental benzene levels, which may be elevated because of the heavy traffic and the poor emission control devices of older vehicles, may pose a health risk to the population. To assess the potential risk, portable passive monitors and blood concentrations were used to survey three different occupational groups in Mexico City. Passive monitors measured the personal exposure of 45 workers to benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, o-xylene and m-/p-xylene during a work shift. Blood concentrations of the above volatile organic compounds (VOCs), methyl tert-butyl ether, and styrene were measured at the beginning and the end of a work shift. Passive monitors showed significantly higher (p > 0.0001) benzene exposure levels among service station attendants (median = 330 microg/m3; range 130-770) as compared to street vendors (median = 62 microg/m3; range 49-180) and office workers (median = 44 microg/m3, range 32-67). Baseline blood benzene levels (BBLs) for these groups were higher than those reported for similar populations from Western countries (median = 0.63 microg/L, n = 24 for service station attendants; median = 0.30 microg/L, n = 6 for street vendors; and median = 0.17 microgr;g/L, n = 7 for office workers). Nonsmoking office workers who were nonoccupationally exposed to VOCs had BBLs that were more than five times higher than those observed in a nonsmoking U.S. population. BBLs of participants did not increase during the work shift, suggesting that because the participants were chronically exposed to benzene, complex pharmacokinetic mechanisms were involved. Our results highlight the need for more complete studies to assess the potential benefits of setting environmental standards for benzene and other VOCs in Mexico.","['Romieu, I', 'Ramirez, M', 'Meneses, F', 'Ashley, D', 'Lemire, S', 'Colome, S', 'Fung, K', 'Hernandez-Avila, M']","['Romieu I', 'Ramirez M', 'Meneses F', 'Ashley D', 'Lemire S', 'Colome S', 'Fung K', 'Hernandez-Avila M']","['PanAmerican Health Organization, Mexico DF, Mexico.

A high expression of WT1 has been detected in a range of acute leukemias, and WT1 is downregulated during induced differentiation of some leukemic cell lines. Overexpression of WT1 in some myeloid cell lines confers resistance to differentiation induction. These observations suggest that a high WT1 expression in hematopoietic cells is incompatible with differentiation. In this study, each of the four different isoforms of WT1 was constitutively overexpressed in the leukemic cell line K562. K562 cells express endogenous WT1, which is downregulated as a response to induced differentiation along the erythroid and megakaryocytic pathways. We now demonstrate that a forced exogenous expression of the four different isoforms of WT1 in K562 does not affect the differentiation response, as judged by accumulation of hemoglobin in response to hemin or the expression of megakaryocytic cell surface markers in response to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA).

Our goal was to quantitate expansion of cells with a primitive CD34+ Thy-1+ phenotype, as well as cell cycling, division history, differentiation, and apoptosis of CD34+ cells enriched from normal donor mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) cells. The balance of these parameters determines the net number of transplantable HSC produced in ex vivo cultures. Comparing several different combinations of cytokines added to 90-hour cultures of MPB CD34 cells, thrombopoietin (TPO), flt3 ligand (FL), and c-kit ligand (KL) gave the best result, with the lowest percentage of apoptotic cells and a mean 1.2-fold increase in the number of CD34+ Thy-1+ cells. A combination of interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) gave the worst outcome, including a decrease of CD34+ Thy-1+ cell number to a mean of 30% of the starting cell number. Cell division history was tracked using the dye 5-(and 6-) carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE). Division of CD34+ Thy-1+ cells was faster and more synchronous in TPO, FL, and KL than in IL-3, IL-6, and LIF, which left a significant proportion of CD34+ cells undivided. Such detailed analyses of short-term, ex vivo cultures generated ""replication scores,"" which allowed prediction of a sixfold improvement of the efficiency of gene transduction of primitive hematopoietic progenitors from MPB, using TPO, FL, and KL to replace IL-3, IL-6, and LIF. Analysis of retroviral transduction efficiency confirmed the increase of transgene expression from MPB primitive hematopoietic progenitors assayed after stromal culture was fivefold, validating the usefulness of multiparameter analysis of short-term cultures for survival and replication of CD34+ Thy-1+ cells.","['Murray, L J', 'Young, J C', 'Osborne, L J', 'Luens, K M', 'Scollay, R', 'Hill, B L']","['Murray LJ', 'Young JC', 'Osborne LJ', 'Luens KM', 'Scollay R', 'Hill BL']","['SyStemix (a Novartis Company), Cell Therapy Research, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. lesley.murray@pharma.novartis.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Thy-1 Antigens/analysis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Jun;27(6):1019-28. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00031-4.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00031-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00031-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Southern blot analysis of primary ATL cells showed a significantly higher incidence of p16 gene alteration in acute ATL than in chronic ATL [67.7% (23/34) vs. 26.1% (6/23), respectively; p<0.003]. Similarly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of p16 exon 2 revealed a higher incidence of alteration in acute ATL than in chronic ATL [52.9% (18/34) vs. 26.1% (6/23), respectively; p<0.05]. PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis of exons 1 and 2 of p16 showed no mutations in the patients, with normal pattern by Southern blotting or PCR analysis. Notably five of six chronic ATL patients with abnormal p16 genes progressed to acute crisis within 4 months. PCR analysis of the p16 linked loci 1063.7, p15 exon 2, and cl.B found homozygous deletion in 55.9%, 20.6%, and 2.9% of acute ATL cells and 39.1%, 13.0%, and 0% of chronic ATL cells, respectively, showing no relationship of homozygous deletion in either loci with disease subtypes. In most cases, deletions were seen in multiple genes, including p16. Acute ATL cells had a higher frequency of multigene deletions than chronic ATL cells [44.1% vs. 17.4%; p<0.05]. When leukemic cells were analyzed for interleukin 2 (IL-2) responsive growth, only p16 gene alteration was directly associated with leukemic cell growth activity. Among leukemic cells showing high IL-2 responsiveness, 73.1% (19/26) had p16 gene alteration vs. 27.8% (5/18) of leukemic cells that showed low IL-2 responsiveness (p<0.005). p16 gene alteration was found in 73.3% (14/19) of leukemic cells showing high autonomous growth rates but in only 40.0% (10/25) of those leukemic cells showing low autonomous growth (p<0.03). These results suggest the following: alteration of p16-related genomic regions in ATL is usually a wide rearrangement including the p16 gene; within this region, only p16 gene alteration is associated with disease aggressiveness; and p16 gene deletion may be a proximate event in leukemogenesis.","['Fujiwara, H', 'Arima, N', 'Hashimoto-Tamaoki, T', 'Matsushita, K', 'Ohtsubo, H', 'Arimura, K', 'Hidaka, S', 'Tei, C']","['Fujiwara H', 'Arima N', 'Hashimoto-Tamaoki T', 'Matsushita K', 'Ohtsubo H', 'Arimura K', 'Hidaka S', 'Tei C']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 Jun;27(6):1004-9. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00035-1.,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00035-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00035-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In P388-bearing mice, the combination of MPBX with DOX increased the antitumor activity of DOX 1.6-fold. In contrast, in P388/DOX-bearing mice, DOX alone did not decrease the tumor weight, whereas in combination with MPBX it significantly decreased the tumor weight in the control group by 50%. The increase in DOX-induced antitumor activity caused by MPBX was correlated with the DOX concentration in the tumors. The DOX concentration in the tumors of P388- and P388/DOX-bearing mice in the MPBX combination group increased by 1.3-fold and 2.2-fold, respectively, compared to the level in the DOX-alone group. On the other hand, there was no increase in the DOX concentration in the heart or liver in both types of tumor-bearing mice treated with MPBX. In vitro, the facilitated DOX influx and suppressed efflux by MPBX in both types of tumor cells were similar, suggesting that MPBX acts on the same site in both types of cells. P388/DOX overexpressed P-glycoprotein, i.e. the inhibitory order of DOX efflux caused by the inhibitor of P-glycoprotein was P388 < P388/DOX. However, the effect of MPBX was P388 > P388/DOX.

This pursuit has focused on finding appropriate diseases in which to apply this approach, and suitable gene targets. Of the genes that we have targeted for disruption using the antisense ODN strategy (Clevenger et al., 1995; Gewirtz and Calabretta, 1988; Ratajczak et al., 1992c; Small et al., 1994) one that has been of particular interest, and one where therapeutically motivated disruptions are now in clinical trial, is the myb gene (reviewed in Lyon et al., 1994). These trials involve treatment of human leukemias. These diseases are a logical choice for developing oncogene targeted therapies because of easy access to tissues, and the abundance of knowledge about the cell and molecular biology of these diseases. Nevertheless, as will be touched on below, other malignancies have also been examined as models for Myb targeted therapy with some surprisingly encouraging results.

AMV was discovered in the 1930s as a virus that caused a disease in chickens that is similar to acute myelogenous leukemia in humans (Hall et al., 1941). This avian retrovirus played an important role in the history of cancer research for two reasons. First, AMV was used to demonstrate that all oncogenic viruses did not contain a single cancer-causing principle. In particular, although both Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) and AMV could replicate in cultures of either embryonic fibroblasts or hematopoietic cells, RSV could transform only fibroblasts whereas AMV could transform only hematopoietic cells (Baluda, 1963; Durban and Boettiger, 1981a). Second, chickens infected with AMV develop remarkably high white counts and therefore their peripheral blood contains remarkably large quantities of viral particles (Beard, 1963). For this reason AMV was often used as a prototypic retrovirus in order to study viral assembly and later to produce large amounts of reverse transcriptase for both research and commercial purposes. Following the discovery of the v-src oncogene of RSV and the demonstration that it arose from the normal c-src proto-oncogene, a number of acute leukemia viruses were analysed by similar techniques and found to also contain viral oncogenes of cellular origin (Roussel et al., 1979). In the case of AMV, it was shown that almost the entire retroviral env gene had been replaced by a sequence of cellular origin (initially called mab or amv, but later renamed v-myb) (Duesberg et al., 1980; Souza et al., 1980). Remarkably, sequences contained in this myb oncogene were shared between AMV and the avian E26 leukemia virus, but were not contained in any other acutely transforming retroviruses. In addition, the E26 virus contained a second sequence of cellular origin (ets) that was unique. The E26 leukemia virus was first described in the 1960s and causes an acute erythroblastosis in chickens, more reminiscent of the disease caused by avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) than by AMV (Ivanov et al., 1962).","['Lipsick, J S', 'Wang, D M']","['Lipsick JS', 'Wang DM']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, California 94305-5324, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*physiology']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 May 13;18(19):3047-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202745.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202745 [doi]'],,,['T32 CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],145,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of tiopronin and sodium thiosulfate (STS) on the cytotoxicity of cisplatin has been investigated on P388 leukemic cells in vitro after 3 days. The combination has also been investigated in vivo in BDF1 mice bearing a P388 s.c. tumor. In contrast to STS, tiopronin did not significantly reduce the cytotoxic activity of cisplatin in vitro and nor did it affect the uptake of platinum (cisplatin-derived), binding to DNA or the percentage of interstrand cross-links (%ISCL) formation. The co-administration of cisplatin (4 mg/kg) and tiopronin (150 and 300 mg/kg) to BDF1 female mice bearing a s.c. P388 tumor produced a significant reduction in tumor growth similar to that of a single 6 mg/kg dose of cisplatin. Interestingly, pre-incubation in vitro of either tiopronin or STS for 2 h with the species formed from cisplatin by hydrolysis demonstrated their ability in inhibiting the cytotoxicity of these reactive platinum products. These results indicate that tiopronin does not reduce the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in vitro, as STS does. This may be, at least partly, because of a different effect of the two thiol compounds on the cellular uptake and binding of platinum to DNA. Notably, tiopronin substantially reduced tumor growth in mice treated with a non-toxic dose of cisplatin (p < or = 0.0277), suggesting some positive influence of this thiol compound on the antitumor properties of cisplatin. The ability of tiopronin to protect in vitro against the cytotoxicity of the aquation products of cisplatin may be related to its nephroprotective effect.","['Viale, M', 'Zhang, J G', 'Pastrone, I', 'Mariggio, M A', 'Esposito, M', 'Lindup, W E']","['Viale M', 'Zhang JG', 'Pastrone I', 'Mariggio MA', 'Esposito M', 'Lindup WE']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Servizio di Farmacologia Tossicologica, Genova, Italy. viale@hp380.ist.unige.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antidotes/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Kidney/*drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Rats', 'Thiosulfates/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tiopronin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1999 Apr;10(4):419-28. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199904000-00011.,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Thiosulfates)', 'C5W04GO61S (Tiopronin)', 'HX1032V43M (sodium thiosulfate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,['10.1097/00001813-199904000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MDR phenotype is multifactorial. The best-studied mechanism involves the expression of a membrane protein that acts as an energy-dependent efflux pump, known as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), capable of extruding toxic materials from the cell. In this work, resistance to UVA radiation, but not to UVC nor UVB, was observed in an MDR leukemia cell line. This cell line overexpresses Pgp. To study the role of Pgp in the resistance to UVA radiation, two MDR modulators or reversing agents (verapamil and cyclosporin A) capable of blocking Pgp activity were used. Cell viability was assessed and the techniques of flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were employed to measure the extrusion of rhodamine 123 by the efflux pump. The results show that MDR modulators did not modify the resistance to UVA radiation. Furthermore, although cell viability was not significantly altered, Pgp function was impaired after UVA treatment, suggesting that this glycoprotein may be a physical target for oxidative damage, and that other factors may be responsible for the UVA resistance. In agreement with this, it was found that the resistant cell line presented a higher catalase activity than the parental (non-MDR) cell line.","['Trindade, G S', 'Capella, M A', 'Capella, L S', 'Affonso-Mitidieri, O R', 'Rumjanek, V M']","['Trindade GS', 'Capella MA', 'Capella LS', 'Affonso-Mitidieri OR', 'Rumjanek VM']","['Instituto de Biofisica Carlos Chagas Filho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Radiation Tolerance/*physiology', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1999 Jun;69(6):694-9.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions it is localized mostly in cell membranes, which may affect its photochemical reactivity. We investigated the photochemistry of MC dissolved as a hydrophobic ion pair with a hexadecyltrioctadecylammonium cation in cyclohexane, trimethylpentane and toluene as well as in propylene carbonate, CH3CN, C2H5OH and D2O. In organic solvents, the absorption and fluorescence spectra of MC were strongly red-shifted compared with aqueous solutions. The fluorescence was also more intense despite aggregation that occurred in some solvents. Aggregation strongly affects the spectral and photochemical properties of MC, especially in aliphatic hydrocarbons in which distinctive H-type aggregates are formed. Hydrophobic MC is a moderate photosensitizer of singlet molecular oxygen (1O2). The following values for 1O2 quantum yields were calculated based on 1O2 phosphorescence relative to 1O2 generation by Rose Bengal: approximately 0.12 in trimethylpenthane, approximately 0.13 in cyclohexane, 0.045 in EtOH, 0.039 in toluene, 0.007 in CH3CN and approximately 3 x 10(-4) in D2O. The H-aggregates of MC in cyclohexane and trimethylpentane are better 1O2 producers than monomeric MC. The above 1O2 quantum yields are corrected for self-quenching because MC is an efficient 1O2 quencher (17 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 in CH3CN, 6.8 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 in D2O, 5.2 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 in EtOH, and 1.4 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 in toluene). Merocyanine undergoes photodegradation, a solvent-dependent process that proceeds faster when the dye is aggregated. The initial photodegradation rate is much slower in organic solvents than in water, but photodegradation products accumulated during longer irradiation may increase the rate in most solvents. Higher photostability and better photosensitization by MC in hydrophobic nonpolar solvents suggest that the killing of leukemia cells via a photodynamic mechanism may operate mostly in cell membranes. In contrast, any cytotoxic products from photodecomposition may be important in hydrophilic cell compartments. Our data show the spectral and photochemical properties of MC in a pure hydrophobic environment.","['Bilski, P', 'McDevitt, T', 'Chignell, C F']","['Bilski P', 'McDevitt T', 'Chignell CF']","['Laboratory of Pharmacology and Chemistry, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. bilski@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,,"['Humans', 'Oxygen', 'Photochemistry', 'Pyrimidinones/*chemistry/*radiation effects', 'Solubility', 'Solvents', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Surface-Active Agents']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1999 Jun;69(6):671-6.,"['0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Solvents)', '0 (Surface-Active Agents)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now examine the effect of chelators, desferal (DFO, iron-specific) and neocupreine (NEO, copper-specific) on DNA of LY-R and LY-S cells, using the comet and micronuclei frequency tests. There is less copper and more iron in LY-R nuclei than in LY-S nuclei. Accordingly, the effect of NEO is more marked in LY-R than in LY-S cells and in both sublines it is expressed as enhanced tail moment (measure of DNA damage in the comet assay) and increased micronuclei frequency. On the contrary, the effect of DFO on the tail moment is less pronounced in LY-R than in LY-S cells. With increasing DFO concentrations, there is a gradual decrease in the tail moment values below the control level in LY-S cells. In LY-R cells the tail moment values initially increase, then gradually decrease, eventually falling below the control level. This points to a dramatic conformational change that masks the effect of DNA discontinuities. The presence of the latter is indicated by the increase in micronuclei frequency.

The encoded protein contains two functional domains: a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain (also known as pointed domain) located at the N terminus and a DNA-binding domain located at the C terminus. The HLH domain is involved in protein-protein interaction with itself and other members of the ETS family of transcription factors such as FLI1. TEL is a transcription factor, and we and others have shown that it is a repressor of gene expression. To understand further the role of TEL in the cell, we have used an in vivo interaction system to identify proteins that interact with TEL. We show that a protein, UBC9, interacts specifically with TEL in vitro and in vivo. UBC9 is a member of the family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. These enzymes usually are involved in proteosome-mediated degradation; however, our data suggest that interaction of TEL with UBC9 does not lead to TEL degradation. Our studies show that UBC9 binds to TEL exclusively through the HLH domain of TEL. We also show that TEL expressed as fusion to the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 completely represses a Gal4-responsive promoter, but that the coexpression of UBC9 in the same system restores the activity of the promoter. Targeted point mutation of conserved amino acids in UBC9 essential for enzymatic ubiquitination of proteins does not affect interaction nor transcriptional activity. Based on our data, we conclude that UBC9 physically interacts with TEL through the HLH domain and that the interaction leads to modulation of the transcription activity of TEL.","['Chakrabarti, S R', 'Sood, R', 'Ganguly, S', 'Bohlander, S', 'Shen, Z', 'Nucifora, G']","['Chakrabarti SR', 'Sood R', 'Ganguly S', 'Bohlander S', 'Shen Z', 'Nucifora G']","['Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Medical Center, 2160 South First Avenue, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Fibrosarcoma/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Ligases/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jun 22;96(13):7467-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.13.7467.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",,,['10.1073/pnas.96.13.7467 [doi]'],PMC22109,,"['CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES08353/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES008353/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 ES008353/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA067189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Et743 is presently in clinical trials for human cancers, the mechanisms of antitumor activity of Et743 have not been elucidated. Et743 can alkylate selectively guanine N2 from the DNA minor groove, and this alkylation is reversed by DNA denaturation. Thus, Et743 differs from other DNA alkylating agents presently in the clinic (by both its biochemical activities and its profile of antitumor activity in preclinical models). In this study, we investigated cellular proteins that can bind to DNA alkylated by Et743. By using an oligonucleotide containing high-affinity Et743 binding sites and nuclear extracts from human leukemia CEM cells, we purified a 100-kDa protein as a cellular target of Et743 and identified it as topoisomerase I (top1). Purified top1 was then tested and found to produce cleavage complexes in the presence of Et743, whereas topoisomerase II had no effect. DNA alkylation was essential for the formation of top1-mediated cleavage complexes by Et743, and the distribution of the drug-induced top1 sites was different for Et743 and camptothecin. top1-DNA complexes were also detected in Et743-treated CEM cells by using cesium chloride gradient centrifugation followed by top1 immunoblotting. These data indicate that DNA minor groove alkylation by Et743 induces top1-mediated protein-linked DNA breaks and that top1 is a target for Et743 in vitro and in vivo.","['Takebayashi, Y', 'Pourquier, P', 'Yoshida, A', 'Kohlhagen, G', 'Pommier, Y']","['Takebayashi Y', 'Pourquier P', 'Yoshida A', 'Kohlhagen G', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dioxoles/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Trabectedin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urochordata']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jun 22;96(13):7196-201. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.13.7196.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Dioxoles)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'ID0YZQ2TCP (Trabectedin)']",,,['10.1073/pnas.96.13.7196 [doi]'],PMC22050,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined in this study a role of gp130 in the nervous system by analyzing developmental cell death of several neuronal populations and the differentiation of astrocytes in gp130-deficient mice. A significant reduction was observed in the number of sensory neurons in L5 dorsal root ganglia and motoneurons in the facial nucleus, the nucleus ambiguus, and the lumbar spinal cord in gp130 -/- mice on embryonic day 18.5. On the other hand, no significant neuronal loss was detectable on day 14.5, suggesting a physiological role of gp130 in supporting newly generated neurons during the late phase of development when naturally occurring cell death takes place. Moreover, expression of an astrocyte marker, GFAP, was severely reduced in the brain of gp130 -/- mice. Our data demonstrate that gp130 expression is essential for survival of subgroups of differentiated motor and sensory neurons and for the differentiation of major populations of astrocytes in vivo.","['Nakashima, K', 'Wiese, S', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Arakawa, H', 'Kimura, N', 'Hisatsune, T', 'Yoshida, K', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Sendtner, M', 'Taga, T']","['Nakashima K', 'Wiese S', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Arakawa H', 'Kimura N', 'Hisatsune T', 'Yoshida K', 'Kishimoto T', 'Sendtner M', 'Taga T']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, 101-0062, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Astrocytes/chemistry/*cytology/drug effects', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System/cytology/drug effects/*embryology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dimerization', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/analysis/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Motor Neurons/*cytology/drug effects', 'Neurons, Afferent/*cytology/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology']",1999/06/23 00:00,1999/06/23 00:01,['1999/06/23 00:00'],"['1999/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 1999 Jul 1;19(13):5429-34.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,PMC6782325,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work we describe a new polymerase chain reaction-single strand confirmational analysis based protocol for TPMT specific detection which introduces a substantial technical simplification avoiding the use of restriction enzyme treatment after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Additionally, the use of this protocol allows the simultaneous detection of a T474 to C substitution, a frequent silent mutation in the North Portuguese population (TPMT*1S = 0.215). In a sample of 310 unrelated Northern Portuguese individuals, 15 were found to be heterozygous for the TPMT*3A allele (defined by the presence of two transitions, G460 to A and A719 to G) which is associated with TPMT enzymatic deficiency; the corresponding gene frequency estimate was 0.024. We also attempted to evaluate the relationship between the molecular TPMT genotype and the reaction to treatments involving thiopurine drugs by analysing a sample of 24 children submitted to curative therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Four of them were shown to be heterozygous for the TPMT*3A allele.

PML mRNA and protein, while barely detectable in quiescent HPCs, are consistently induced by growth factor stimulation through the erythroid or granulocytic lineage. Thereafter, PML is downmodulated in late granulocytic maturation, whereas it is sustainably expressed through the erythroid pathway. In functional studies, PML expression was inhibited by addition of antisense oligomers targeting PML mRNA (alpha-PML). Interestingly, early treatment (day 0 HPCs) with alpha-PML reduced the number of both erythroid and granulocytic colonies, whereas late treatment (day 5 culture) reduced erythroid, but not granulocytic, clonogenesis. These findings suggest that PML is required for early hematopoiesis and erythroid, but not granulocytic maturation. The pattern of PML expression in normal hematopoiesis mimics that of retinoblastoma pRb 105. Combined treatment of HPCs with alpha-PML and alpha-Rb oligomers inhibited both PML and Rb protein expression and completely blocked erythroid colony development. Furthermore, PML and pRb 105 were co-immunoprecipitated in cellular lysates derived from erythroid precursors indicating that this functional interaction may have a biochemical basis. These results suggest a key functional role of PML in early hematopoiesis and late erythropoiesis: the latter phenomenon may be related to the molecular and functional interaction of PML with pRb 105.","['Labbaye, C', 'Valtieri, M', 'Grignani, F', 'Puglisi, R', 'Luchetti, L', 'Masella, B', 'Alcalay, M', 'Testa, U', 'Peschle, C']","['Labbaye C', 'Valtieri M', 'Grignani F', 'Puglisi R', 'Luchetti L', 'Masella B', 'Alcalay M', 'Testa U', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Jun 10;18(23):3529-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202682.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202682 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND RESULTS: From 1991 until 1995 eighty two patients less than 18 years of age with NHL were admitted to our department. Sixty three of them were eligible for the study. The entire group consisted of 43 males and 20 females (ratio 2.1:1). Median age was 10 2/12 years. Eleven had stage I disease, 4 stage II, 29 stage III and 19 stage IV disease. Histologies represented were: large cell lymphoma 22, lymphoblastic lymphoma 19, and Burkitt lymphoma 10 patients. In 12 cases the immunophenotype was not further classified as to B-cell or T-cell subtype. Patients were stratified into the therapy groups ""B"" or ""non B"" according to histopathology, clinical stage and LDH level. Therapy for the B group consisted of 2, 4 or 6 courses of intensive 5 day pulses of 6 drugs. Patients in the non B group received the protocol for acute lymphoblastic leukemia including reinduction and CNS irradiation for advanced stages. At a median follow-up of 35 months the probability of event free survival (pEFS) at 5 years 70% and overall survival 73% for entire group. For therapy group B pEFS was 76%. The non B therapy group had a pEFS 60% (p = 0.22). There was a significantly better outcome for children classified as stage I and II. There was no statistical difference between stage III and IV. Treatment results were comparable between NHL subtypes, except for large cell lymphomas, which did significantly better (pEFS 90%). CONCLUSIONS: The use of protocols based on BFM 90 study in the Czech Republic was feasible. The pEFS are approximately 10% lower than the German study but comparable to some other studies. Outcome for large cell lymphomas was excellent. Reduction of treatment related complication and mortality rate as well as more precise classification are required.","['Kavan, P', 'Kabickova, E', 'Gajdos, P', 'Koutecky, J', 'Smelhaus, V', 'Stankova, J', 'McClain, K L']","['Kavan P', 'Kabickova E', 'Gajdos P', 'Koutecky J', 'Smelhaus V', 'Stankova J', 'McClain KL']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology/*therapy', 'Male']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 1999 Jan 18;138(2):40-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It contains hematopoietic elements at various stages of differentiation as well as a supportive stromal microenvironment. Primitive hematopoietic stem cells of mesenchymal origin, the long-term culture initiating cells proliferate and differentiate into different cell types, giving rise to the adherent stromal layer and to various hematopoietic elements attached to it or floating freely in the supernatant medium. The stromal layer keeps the hematopoietic cells aggregated, helps their mitosis, differentiation and maturation by cell-to-cell contact, produces hematopoietic growth factors (cytokines), and forms the extracellular matrix required for cell attachment. Hematopoiesis occurs without exogenous growth factors. The appearance and development of the stroma, the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and the production of cytokines differ in long-term cultures of the normal and of pathologically altered bone marrow. Long-term bone marrow culture is applied in fundamental studies of normal and pathologically altered hematopoiesis, in pharmacological research, in the purging of residual leukemia cells from bone marrow autotransplants, and in the gene transfer.

The following results were obtained: (1) Nonrandom chromosome loss (NCL), such as, -11, -14, -21, etc, which were found in the affected members of leukemia families, were found in about 30% sporadic ANLL, MDS and about 50% ALL, espedislly in 100% (5/5) CLL, but not found in ITP (P < 0.001). These results indicated that the familial nonrandom chromosome loss were associated with leukomogenesis. (2) Because most of BM cells are hypodiploed and have the same kinds of NCL in each cases of CLL, which can develop into ALL, ANLL and also cancers, ALL BM hypo- and hyper-diploid and/or polyploid cells might be origin of hypodiploid cells. (3) 28% (6/21) of pediatric patients with AL, MDS, or FA (Fanconi Anemia) have one parent, who have up to 30% BM hypodiploid cells and similar kinds of NCL and also have the rearrangement of C-erbB and abnormal proliferation of BM. The NCL were found in the three consecutive generations of a family with 5 ALL among 10 members of third generation. It indicated that the familial NCL might be inherited and be coded by a unknown gene alteration, which might be related to leukomo and carcinogenesis, because there are genes or their candidates for leukemia in the chromosomes 11, 14 and 21.

To emphasize some of its unique clinical characteristics, the authors compare B-LBL with a group of histologically similar, very aggressive lymphomas, T-lineage lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL) and the blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (BVMCL); all were evaluated concurrently. METHODS: Clinical data were obtained on 29 patients with very aggressive lymphomas (12 B-LBLs, 10 T-LBLs, and 7 BVMCLs) from whom paraffin-embedded material was available. The diagnoses were confirmed on review of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides and the immunophenotype data. RESULTS: The mean age of patients with B-LBL was 39 years. Patients presented with both lymph node and extranodal disease, although involvement of the mediastinum and bone marrow was infrequent. Four were Stage I, 3 were Stage II, 2 were Stage III, and 3 were Stage IV. B-LBL patients were treated primarily with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), and one patient underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. The mean follow-up time was 30 months. Seven of 11 had no evidence of disease at 48 months, whereas 4 patients were dead of disease at 5.6 months. The overall median survival was 24 months. The clinical characteristics of B-LBL patients differed significantly from those of T-LBL patients; there was more frequent bone marrow and mediastinal involvement in T-LBL cases (P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). T-LBL patients were also less likely to achieve a complete remission than B-LBL patients (P = 0.02). The mean age of BVMCL patients significantly exceeded that of B-LBL patients (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The authors believe that the distinction of B-LBL from its histologic mimics, T-LBL and BVMCL, has important clinical implications. Patients with B-LBL present differently from those with the other very aggressive lymphomas studied, and they achieve complete remissions more often than T-LBL patients.","['Soslow, R A', 'Baergen, R N', 'Warnke, R A']","['Soslow RA', 'Baergen RN', 'Warnke RA']","['Department of Pathology, New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical School of Cornell University, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",1999/06/22 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/22 10:00'],"['1999/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jun 15;85(12):2648-54.,,,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990615)85:12<2648::AID-CNCR22>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]'],,,['CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unusual immune-mediated side effects have been associated with rIFN-alpha therapy. The association of rIFN-alpha therapy with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has been reported infrequently. METHODS: Two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treated with rIFN-alpha-based regimens at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center developed thrombotic microangiopathy (HUS/TTP). The course of their disease is described. A third patient who developed renal failure while receiving rIFN-alpha therapy and had no other causative factor for his renal failure is also described. RESULTS: The patients were ages 24, 49, and 36 years, and they had received rIFN-alpha therapy for 37, 67, and 92 months, respectively, prior to the development of the disorder. One patient had discontinued rIFN-alpha 1 month before the event because of presumed rIFN-alpha-related cardiomyopathy. Two patients received hydroxyurea and cytarabine as part of their therapy. No patient was receiving any medication known to be associated with HUS/TTP. None had a history of diarrheal illness, but Escherichia coli OH157.H7 was grown from the stool of one patient. Two patients responded to plasmapheresis with normalization of counts and other indices, but both developed renal failure and became dependent on dialysis. One patient had evidence of disease progression and died of multiorgan failure. The third patient required dialysis for 18 months but is currently off dialysis; this patient has some residual renal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Although no definitive association between rIFN-alpha therapy and thrombotic microangiopathies can be concluded from these data, these and other previously reported cases suggest that HUS/TTP is a rare side effect of rIFN-alpha therapy that should be managed in the standard fashion. Hypotheses regarding the mechanism underlying this association are discussed in this article.","['Ravandi-Kashani, F', 'Cortes, J', 'Talpaz, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Ravandi-Kashani F', 'Cortes J', 'Talpaz M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Microcirculation', 'Middle Aged', 'Renal Insufficiency/etiology', 'Thrombosis/*etiology']",1999/06/22 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/22 10:00'],"['1999/06/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/22 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1999 Jun 15;85(12):2583-8.,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],,,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19990615)85:12<2583::AID-CNCR14>3.0.CO;2-# [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At higher concentrations, 1alpha,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 was a more potent inducer than 1alpha,24,25(OH)3-20-epi-D3 of HL-60 differentiation; 1alpha,25(OH)2-20-epi-24-oxo-D3 was exclusively pro-differentiative at all concentrations. 1alpha,25(OH)2-20-epi-D3 and 1alpha,24,25(OH)3-20-epi-D3 stimulated proliferation of KG-1a leukemia cells, but neither of these compounds nor 1alpha,25(OH)3-20-epi-24-oxo-D3 exerted pro-differentiative effects on these cells. These findings shed new light on the pro- and anti-proliferative effects of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and lead to the postulate that metabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and its 20-epi analog regulates different subsets of genes so as to co-ordinate population expansion and the differentiation process. Furthermore, 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 metabolism and/or sensitivity to the effects of metabolites may be altered in transformed cells to derive a clonal advantage.","['Campbell, M J', 'Drayson, M T', 'Durham, J', 'Wallington, L', 'Siu-Caldera, M L', 'Reddy, G S', 'Brown, G']","['Campbell MJ', 'Drayson MT', 'Durham J', 'Wallington L', 'Siu-Caldera ML', 'Reddy GS', 'Brown G']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham Medical School, Edgbaston, UK. m.j.campbell@bham.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', '*Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1999 Mar 25;149(1-2):169-83. doi: 10.1016/s0303-7207(98)00245-7.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.15.16 (Vitamin D3 24-Hydroxylase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",,,"['S0303-7207(98)00245-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0303-7207(98)00245-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although T-cell tropic in vivo, HTLV-1 can infect a wide variety of cell types in vitro. Cell-to-cell spread of HTLV-1 may require specific binding of envelope to its cellular receptor, with other cell-surface molecules facilitating fusion. Here it is shown that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or -3 (ICAM-1, ICAM-3) or vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) are required for syncytium formation of K562 with HTLV-1-infected MT2 cells but not C91-PL cells. The effect of ICAMs and VCAM-1 on MT2-induced fusion can be blocked by antibodies that bind beta-integrins. These fusion co-factor molecules are effective only when present in combination with HTLV-1 receptor-bearing cells and are not sufficient to mediate syncytium formation alone. The results suggest that engagement of HTLV-1-infected cells with susceptible target cells requires the simultaneous binding of viral envelope glycoprotein to the cellular receptor and co-factor molecules to beta-integrins. The tissue-specific expression of adhesion molecules might therefore influence HTLV-1 virus tropism and pathogenic changes associated with syncytium formation.","['Daenke, S', 'McCracken, S A', 'Booth, S']","['Daenke S', 'McCracken SA', 'Booth S']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', '*Antigens, CD', '*Antigens, Differentiation', 'CD18 Antigens/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Giant Cells/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Integrin beta Chains', 'Integrins/immunology/*physiology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology', 'Mice', 'Transfection', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1999 Jun;80 ( Pt 6):1429-1436. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-80-6-1429.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (ICAM3 protein, human)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '0 (integrin beta7)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,['10.1099/0022-1317-80-6-1429 [doi]'],,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-80-6-1429 [doi],,

We report a novel method to detect intracellular BCR-ABL messenger on single cells using in situ RT-PCR, which can be performed on blood and marrow slides, without extraction of the nucleic acid. After cellular permeabilization and fixation, the mRNA BCR-ABL was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR using digoxigenin-labelled dUTP. The reaction was revealed with the anti-digoxigenin FITC antibody. On the fluorescent microscope, a strong positive green fluorescence signal was observed in 98-99% cells in Ph1-positive cell lines. A faint signal was detected in 1.5% and 2% of negative cell lines. Likewise, a faint signal was found in 1.6-2.8% of the cells in five normal controls (mean 2.2 +/- 1.1%). The positive threshold for in situ RT-PCR was therefore determined as mean + 2 s.d. = 4.4% cells. We used in situ RT-PCR by comparison to cytogenetics (at least 30 mitoses examined), and two-step RT-PCR (10(-6) sensitivity in our hands) in bone marrow samples from 13 CML patients: two patients at diagnosis and 11 patients in hematological remission after alpha interferon (three patients), hydroxyurea (one patient) autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (one patient) and allogeneic BMT (six patients). In the two diagnostic patients, 90 and 95% cells were respectively strongly positive by in situ RT-PCR. In the six patients treated by allogeneic BMT, the median percentage of positive cells was 2.4% (range 1.8-3.2). All six patients had normal karyotype and negative two-step RT-PCR results. In the five other patients, two were treated by hydroxyurea alone or autologous BMT, and 11 and 13% of the cells were strongly positive; three were treated with interferon and 14-62% of the cells were positive, generally weakly. All five patients had persistence of Ph1 (in 9-56% mitoses), and positive RT-PCR results after one round. In conclusion, in situ RT-PCR can specifically identify cells with BCR-ABL transcript and its results are concordant with those of karyotype and RT-PCR. Because of its limited sensitivity and specificity, however, it appears to have limited value in the analysis of MRD. On the other hand, it can evaluate the presence and intensity of BCR-ABL fusion transcript at the single cell level, and this could be useful in treatment monitoring.","['Preudhomme, C', 'Chams-Eddine, L', 'Roumier, C', 'Duflos-Grardel, N', 'Denis, C', 'Cosson, A', 'Fenaux, P']","['Preudhomme C', 'Chams-Eddine L', 'Roumier C', 'Duflos-Grardel N', 'Denis C', 'Cosson A', 'Fenaux P']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):818-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401393.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401393 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the LDH isoenzyme content in serum and CSF of patients with NHL, at diagnosis and at relapse. In patients with increased serum LDH at diagnosis, the percentage of isoenzyme 2 was increased in 52% of patients and the absolute value of isoenzyme 3 was increased in 64% of patients. In relapsing patients these values were respectively 69% and 65%. Conversely in patients with increased serum LDH due to myeloid regeneration after chemotherapy, isoenzymes 4 and 5, but not isoenzymes 2 or 3, were increased. High absolute values of isoenzyme 3 were correlated with an altered performance status, advanced tumor stage, and aggressive histology whereas high isoenzyme 2 percentages were correlated with altered performance status only. Among patients with high total serum LDH, a high content of isoenzyme 2 and a high absolute value of isoenzyme 3 were correlated with high serum levels of TNFalpha and TNF receptor p75. Analysis of total LDH and LDH isoenzyme profiles in CSF did not reveal any correlation with meningeal involvement by lymphoma. High isoenzyme 2 percentages and high absolute values of isoenzyme 3 in serum were both significantly associated with a shorter freedom-from-progression and overall survival. Isoenzyme 3 remained a prognostic factor for survival even when considering only patients with high total serum LDH at diagnosis.

Of five DLBCL, only one showed trisomy. Nine of the 16 aberrant high-grade MALT lymphomas (56%) showed trisomy of more than one chromosome per case vs two of six for low-grade cases. In lymphomas with separate low- and high-grade tumour components some trisomies were detected in both components, whereas others occurred only in the high-grade tumour cells. This supports the hypothesis that high-grade MALT lymphomas can develop from a low-grade type and that this progression is accompanied by the acquisition of more genetic aberrations. However, trisomy 3 probably does not play a major role in this progression.","['Hoeve, M A', 'Gisbertz, I A', 'Schouten, H C', 'Schuuring, E', 'Bot, F J', 'Hermans, J', 'Hopman, A', 'Kluin, P M', 'Arends, J W', 'van Krieken, J H']","['Hoeve MA', 'Gisbertz IA', 'Schouten HC', 'Schuuring E', 'Bot FJ', 'Hermans J', 'Hopman A', 'Kluin PM', 'Arends JW', 'van Krieken JH']","['Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*genetics', '*Trisomy']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):799-807. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401404.,,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401404 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Monosomy at either or both RB1 and D13S319 loci was detected in 15 of 43 (35%) lymphomas (14 of 43 cases at RB1 locus and seven of 43 cases at D13S319 locus); the 13q deletion was frequently detected in the aggressive NHLs (40%; 12 of 30 cases) compared with that in indolent NHL (17%; one of six cases) and a subset of HD (29%; two of seven cases).

The subchromosomal region frequently altered in lymphoma on 13q14 is the region around RB1 locus and centromeric to D13S319 locus, which is an overlapped region frequently deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Together, our data indicate that the 13q alterations are present in a variety of types of lymphoma and occur in a significant proportion of aggressive NHLs, suggesting the possible presence of common candidate gene(s) on the 13q14 region, whose alteration may play an important role in the formation or development of a wide variety of mature lymphoid malignancies.","['Wada, M', 'Okamura, T', 'Okada, M', 'Teramura, M', 'Masuda, M', 'Motoji, T', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Wada M', 'Okamura T', 'Okada M', 'Teramura M', 'Masuda M', 'Motoji T', 'Mizoguchi H']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Japan.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'Female', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):792-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401395.,,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401395 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eighteen patients achieved CR after one course of FLAG, including five patients who had documented p-glycoprotein-induced multidrug resistance and 10 patients with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. Eight patients were consolidated with a second course of FLAG prior to transplantation and so far 16 patients have undergone allogeneic transplantation, 10 from unrelated donors and six from sibling donors (one mismatched). By the time of transplant three patients had progressed and were in early relapse and all have relapsed post BMT. Of the remaining 13 patients transplanted in remission, nine remain in CCR at a range of 4-26 months, three have died of transplant-related complications (18%) and one patient has relapsed.

The resistant KG1a and K562 sublines, which expressed high levels of Pgp, responded to low doses of the cyclosporin SDZ PSC 833, the cyclopeptolide SDZ 280-446, and the cyclopropyldibenzosuberane LY335979 with a dose-dependent growth inhibition.

Forced expression of APS in an erythropoietin (EPO)-dependent hematopoietic cell line resulted in reduced activation of STAT5 but not cell proliferation in response to EPO. APS bound to the phosphorylated tyrosine residue, Y343 of the erythropoietin receptor cytoplasmic domain. Co-expression of APS and c-Cbl, but not expression of either alone inhibited EPO-dependent STAT5 activation in 293 cells.

SCL is expressed in pluripotent haematopoietic stem cells and also following commitment to the erythroid, mast and megakaryocytic lineages. The mechanisms responsible for this pattern of expression are poorly understood, but are likely to illuminate the molecular basis for stem cell development and lineage commitment. Here we present the first description of the regulation of the SCL gene in mast cells. In this study we systematically analysed the chromatin structure of a 45 kb region of the murine SCL locus in mast cells. The pattern of DNase 1 and restriction endonuclease hypersensitive sites in mast cells was distinct from, but overlapped with, the pattern previously described in erythroid and primitive myeloid cells. Each potential regulatory element was tested using transient reporter assays to assess their functional significance in mast cells. These studies identified two potent enhancers, one of which was downstream of the SCL gene. Further characterisation of this 3' enhancer demonstrated that it required the presence of two distinct DNase 1 hypersensitive sites for full activity, and that it was capable of stimulating transcription from both promoter 1a and 1b. Since the 3' enhancer is active in both erythroid and mast cells, it will now be important to see whether it is independently activated in these lineages, or whether it is also active in haematopoietic stem cells.","['Fordham, J L', 'Gottgens, B', 'McLaughlin, F', 'Green, A R']","['Fordham JL', 'Gottgens B', 'McLaughlin F', 'Green AR']","['University of Cambridge, Department of Haematology, MRC Centre, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):750-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401420.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401420 [doi]'],,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both NB4 and NB4-R1 cells underwent rapid apoptosis in response to low doses of CD437 (10(-7)M). This apoptosis did not require the activation of classical retinoid receptors and like arsenic (As)-induced apoptosis was preceded by the rapid activation of a caspase-3-like enzymatic activity as indicated by the increase of DEVD-pNA hydrolytic activity, by the processing of procaspase-3 protein and by the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the caspase-3-like proteolytic activity is responsible for the degradation of both the PML/RARalpha oncogenic protein and the normal RARalpha proteins. In CD437-treated cells, PML proteins were not degraded and PML relocalization on PMLNBs occurred in all the cells before death. CD437-induced apoptosis and receptor degradation were proteasome independent and not influenced either by inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases (PTK), protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPases) and serine proteases or by glutathione levels. Moreover, our data suggested that as for As2O3-induced apoptosis Bc12 modulation is not significant for CD437-induced apoptosis of NB4 cells.

Thus, our data suggest that the involvement of Stat3 in oncogenic transformation could be mediated through regulation of survival signals.","['Nielsen, M', 'Kaestel, C G', 'Eriksen, K W', 'Woetmann, A', 'Stokkedal, T', 'Kaltoft, K', 'Geisler, C', 'Ropke, C', 'Odum, N']","['Nielsen M', 'Kaestel CG', 'Eriksen KW', 'Woetmann A', 'Stokkedal T', 'Kaltoft K', 'Geisler C', 'Ropke C', 'Odum N']","['Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mycosis Fungoides/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'Rabbits', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Trans-Activators/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):735-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401415.,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401415 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation of all the cell lines except KG1 was inhibited by bestatin. P39/TSU, HL60 and U937 were highly sensitive, with 50% growth inhibitory concentrations (IC50) close to the maximum serum concentration when bestatin was orally administered at 30 mg in clinical application. All cell lines except for K562 highly expressed CD13, but a clear correlation between the sensitivity to bestatin and expression of CD13 was not observed. Other aminopeptidase inhibitors such as amastatin A, arphamenine B and WM15 antibody showed no growth inhibitory effects. To confirm the growth inhibitory effects of bestatin, we quantitatively examined DNA fragmentation in five bestatin-sensitive cell lines. Bestatin dose-dependently induced DNA fragmentation in those cell lines. In case of U937, bestatin induced DNA fragmentation quantitatively and DNA ladder and enhanced caspase-3 activity. Furthermore, the growth inhibition by bestatin was reduced by the caspase inhibitor Z-Asp-CH2-DCB. These results suggested that bestatin exhibits direct antileukemic effects against human leukemic cell lines through the induction of apoptosis.","['Sekine, K', 'Fujii, H', 'Abe, F']","['Sekine K', 'Fujii H', 'Abe F']","['Anticancer Drugs Department, Nippon Kayaku Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Aminopeptidases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):729-34. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401388.,"['0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401388 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 has been shown to function upstream of the death proteases (caspases) in some, but not all, occurrences of apoptotic cell death. Using the myeloid leukemic cell line P39 we report the chemotherapy-induced caspase-dependent cleavage of endogenous Bcl-2. Etoposide treatment of these cells triggered a time-dependent activation of type II and type III caspases and cleavage of Bcl-2 yielding a 23 kDa cleavage fragment. The emergence of this cleavage product was blocked by the general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, as well as the type III caspase inhibitor IETD-fmk and the caspase-9-selective inhibitor LEHD-fmk, while the type II caspase inhibitor DEVD-fmk proved considerably less efficient. Bcl-2 cleavage preceded cleavage of the known caspase-3 substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), as well as that of the caspase-6 substrate, lamin B, indicating that Bcl-2 cleavage is a relatively early event in the apoptosis cascade in this experimental model. While evidence for cleavage of Bcl-2 in several subcellular compartments of etoposide-treated cells was obtained, this cleavage was detected predominantly in the mitochondrial fraction, thus providing further support for the central role of mitochondria in apoptosis. Caspase-mediated cleavage following etoposide treatment of these myeloid leukemic cells may represent a means for the attenuation of Bcl-2 function upon apoptosis induction.","['Fadeel, B', 'Hassan, Z', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, E', 'Henter, J I', 'Orrenius, S', 'Zhivotovsky, B']","['Fadeel B', 'Hassan Z', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E', 'Henter JI', 'Orrenius S', 'Zhivotovsky B']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Division of Toxicology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):719-28. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401411.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401411 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In four ATL derived and in all three in vitro transformed cell lines, iNOS was expressed constitutively, but it was not expressed in CEM cells. Four out of nine ATL patients also showed iNOS expression. The expression of iNOS was found in all subtypes of ATL. Three of four iNOS-positive patients had infiltration of ATL cells to organs such as skin, lung, or liver. In NOS inhibitor (NG-monomethyl-L-arginine: L-NMMA)-containing medium, an iNOS-positive ATL cell line (K3T) showed growth inhibition and DNA ladder.

A similar difference between normal and AML subpopulations was seen when the relative levels of expression of MEIS1, and to a lesser extent MLL, were compared in CD34+ and CD34- cells (P < 0.05). In contrast, while some evidence of down-regulation of PBX1a was found in comparing CD34- to CD34+ normal cells it was difficult to detect expression of this gene in any subpopulation from most AML samples.

Infants without t(4;11) and those with other 11q23 rearrangements had significantly better EFS than those with t(4;11) (P= 0.007 and P= 0.02, respectively). t(4;11) correlated with age less than 6 months and with CD10 negativity, both of which also were poor prognostic indicators. After adjustment for age, there was still a significant difference in EFS between patients with t(4;11) and those with other 1lq23 rearrangements (P=0.02), and between patients with t(4;11) and those without t(4;11) (P=0.04). Among CD10 negative patients, t(4;11) was associated with a worse EFS (P=0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that after adjusting for a variety of clinical and laboratory features, t(4;11) was the most important prognostic factor for poor outcome, and patients with other 11q23 rearrangements had as good an outcome as the remaining patients without t(4;11).","['Heerema, N A', 'Sather, H N', 'Ge, J', 'Arthur, D C', 'Hilden, J M', 'Trigg, M E', 'Reaman, G H']","['Heerema NA', 'Sather HN', 'Ge J', 'Arthur DC', 'Hilden JM', 'Trigg ME', 'Reaman GH']","['Hughes Institute, St Paul, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 May;13(5):679-86. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401413.,,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401413 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two types of pericentric chromosome rearrangements have been observed: 'classical' dicentrics with two clearly separated centromeric regions, and more unusual rearrangements with a breakpoint within the centromeric or heterochromatic area, but outside the alphoid domain. FISH analysis of partial chromosome 1 q duplications present in three Burkitt lymphoma cell lines confirmed the partial involvement of the non-alphoid centromeric domain in the duplicated chromosome segment. The incidence of centromeric and pericentromeric rearrangements in hematopoietic malignancies may be higher than hitherto admitted.

Multiparameter flow cytometric assays both of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1)-associated P-glycoprotein (PGP) using the UIC2 monoclonal antibody (MoAb), and of terminal transferase (TdT) were performed. Cytogenetic findings were obtained from 196 patients with high resolution banding. At onset, UIC2 and TdT positivities were detected in 58.5% and 24% of cases, respectively. There were strict correlations either between UIC2 negativity and FAB M3 or between TdT and FAB M0-M1 (P = 0.001 and < 0.0001, respectively). On the other hand, age was significantly associated with cytogenetic risk classes (P < 0.0001). CD34 positivity was highly correlated with TdT expression (P < 0.0001). Moreover, CD7 and CD11b were significantly represented in UIC2+ subset (P < 0.0001). Rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) efflux was significantly higher in 75 UIC2 positive patients compared to 65 UIC2 negative ones (P < 0.001). As regards to cytogenetics, TdT positivity was strongly related either to t(9;22) or single/associated anomalies of chromosome 7; on the other hand, most or all cases with t(8;21) or t(15;17) were UIC2 or TdT negative, respectively. The rate of first complete remission (CR) differed both between UIC2+ and UIC2- cases and between TdT+ and TdT- ones (40% versus 72%, P < 0.001; and 36% versus 61%, P = 0.001, respectively). The survival rates (Kaplan-Meier method) were significantly shorter either in UIC2+ or in TdT+ patients (P = 0.005 and = 0.011, respectively). UIC2 and TdT negative cases showed longer remission duration (P = 0.03 and = 0.22, respectively). The additional effect of UIC2 and TdT on prognosis allowed us to identify two subsets of patients, the first [UIC2- TdT-] at better and the second [UIC2+ TdT+] at worse clinical outcome compared to single UIC2 and TdT cases, concerning CR (P < 0.001), survival (P < 0.0001) and CR duration (P = 0.007). The combinations [UIC2+ TdT-] and [UIC2- TdT+] showed an intermediate clinical course. A strong difference was found between poor risk and intermediate/favorable risk cytogenetic classes with regard to CR rate (P < 0.0001), overall survival and CR duration (P < 0.001). Nevertheless, within the poor risk class, UIC2 positivity was able to identify patients at worst prognosis with regard to CR (P = 0.005), survival (P = 0.02) and CR duration (P = 0.015). On the other hand, UIC2 and TdT negativity allowed us to distinguish patients with longer survival (P = 0.012 and = 0.04, respectively) and CR duration (P = 0.04 and = 0.025, respectively) within the intermediate/favorable risk class. The independent prognostic value of UIC2, TdT and cytogenetic risk classes was confirmed in multivariate analysis.

The CD10(+weak) subset was predominant in all age groups, representing approximately 50% of the bone marrow (BM) lymphoid cells in children younger than 4 years. Both CD10+ subsets significantly decreased with age but their ratio did not differ significantly. Moreover, the intensity of CD10 and CD19 fluorescence in the strong and weak subsets did not vary with age. The CD19 intensity was significantly higher in CD10(+weak) than in CD10(+strong) cells. In addition, we classified as CD10(+weak) or CD10(+strong) the leukemic cells from BM aspirates of 117 patients with common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (cALL) (78 children and 39 adults). A higher frequency of cases expressing the CD19+ CD10(+strong) phenotype was observed both in children and adults. Children of the CD10(+weak) group tended to be older than those of the CD10(+strong) group (median = 7 vs. 4 years, P = 0.07), and presented a significantly higher frequency of splenomegaly (93.7 vs. 55%, P = 0.04), which was massive in about 60% of these cases. Among adults, a significantly higher frequency of cases expressing the CD10(+weak) phenotype was observed in females. No other clinical or biological difference was detected between the two groups either for children or adults. Concerning the treatment outcome, we did not observe significant differences in complete remission rate (CRR) or in disease free survival (DFS) among the 32 children and 28 adults analyzed. Finally, we compared the CD10 and CD19 intensity in normal and leukemic BM. Overexpression of either or both antigens in leukemic cells was observed in 42.4% of the cALL cases. In these cases, using cut off values of 110 afu for the CD10 FI and of 100 afu for the CD19 FI, the detection of leukemic cells was possible at levels of 0.2% based on CD10 analysis, of 0.6% based on CD19, and 0.02% when both antigens were overexpressed. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the heterogeneity of CD10 and CD19 fluorescence intensity is of no clinical relevance in cALL, although its study may be helpful for the diagnosis and the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Rego, E M', 'Tone, L G', 'Garcia, A B', 'Falcao, R P']","['Rego EM', 'Tone LG', 'Garcia AB', 'Falcao RP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD19/*chemistry', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neprilysin/*chemistry', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Reference Values', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1999 May;23(5):441-50. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00190-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,"['S0145-2126(98)00190-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(98)00190-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median survival was 22.6 months, and 25 patients (17%) progressed to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with a median interval of 6 months (range 1-45 months). Major independent variables assessed by multivariate analysis were FAB subtypes and bone marrow (BM) blast percentages for survival and BM blast percentages for AML transformation. To compare the various scoring systems in the prediction for survival and transformation to AML, FAB, Sanz and Bournemouth scoring systems were applied to all patients, while the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS), Lille and Toyama scoring systems were applied to 91 patients.

Dendritic cells are highly effective at inducing an immune response to antigens to which the host is unresponsive, while transgenic expression of the costimulator molecule CD40 ligand (gp39/CD154) and the T cell growth factor interleukin 2 (IL2) are also able to augment immune responsiveness. We therefore investigated whether a combination of these two distinctive approaches to immunostimulation could safely increase the anti-tumor immune response compared to each stimulus alone. We injected BALB/CBYJ mice with syngeneic dendritic cells (DC) exposed to A20 lymphoblastic leukemia cell-derived peptides and proteins which had been acid-eluted from the cell surface. In additional mice, the pulsed DC were mixed with genetically modified syngeneic fibroblasts that were expressing CD40 ligand or secreting interleukin 2 (IL2). Three days after their third, weekly, vaccination, they were challenged with parental A20 cells. Tumor growth was suppressed by responses to pulsed DC alone (P < 0.02). This suppression was further enhanced when pulsed DC were coinjected with fibroblasts expressing CD40 ligand and IL2 (P < 0.0005 compared to DC alone) even though CD40 ligand and IL2-expressing fibroblasts alone offered no significant protection in this model. Mice receiving the full complement of immunostimulants either failed to develop visible tumors or developed small tumors which quickly necrosed and regressed, allowing the mice to become long term tumor-free survivors. Antibody mediated depletion of either CD4+ or CD8+ T-cell subset significantly reduced the level of protection afforded by the vaccination. However, it became evident that this intensive stimulation of the immune system lead not only to tumor eradication but also to destruction of cells bearing normal self antigens. Hence, 60 days after challenge with A20 cells all mice in the DC/IL2/CD40 ligand group developed a severe, systemic autoimmune disorder that resembled graft versus host disease and manifest itself by significant peripheral blood cytotoxicity against autologous fibroblasts, blood dyscrasias, gross hepatosplenomegaly, cachexia and fur loss.

The toxin/drug combination showed dramatic synergistic toxicity with combination indices of < 0.1. Synergy was not seen with two other protein synthesis inhibiting drugs--ricin and cycloheximide nor with GMCSF alone. No changes in Ara-C incorporation into cellular DNA or cell cycle occupancy were seen. As compared to exposure to DT388-GM-CSF or Ara-C alone, co-treatment produced significant increases in cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, a higher percentage of cells with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in reactive oxygen species and morphologic changes of apoptosis, and a greater induction of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation factor 45 (DFF45) cleavage activities of caspase 3. Co-treatment did not significantly alter Bcl2, Bcl-xL, Bax or Fas receptor (FasR), but modestly increased Fas ligand (FasL) protein. These finding suggest that co-treatment with DT388-GM-CSF may lead to a lowered apoptotic threshold and clonogenic survival of human AML blasts due to Ara-C.

CD23 functions as the receptor for IgE and also appears to play a role in controlling the growth and proliferation of lymphocytes. Its level of expression among the different cells in CLL has not been examined. In this study, we show that CD23 expression is much higher in the large transformed CLL cells than in the small lymphoid population. This may provide an explanation for the observed correlation between a circulating CD23 cleavage product (soluble CD23) and prognosis in CLL.

RESULTS: By PCR-SSCP analysis, shifts in electrophoretic mobility of the p53 gene were detected in 3 of 14 patients with lymphocytic leukemia (2 ALL and 1 CLL), but none in 22 patients with myelocytic leukemia including one in blastic crisis. Direct nucleotide sequencing in one patient with ALL showed transition of CTG to CAG at codon 257 of exon 7, resulting in a change of its encoded amino acids from aspartic acid to valine.

After a short chronic phase of 6 to 9 months it rapidly transforms into an acute myelogenous leukemia. The median survival time is less than 12 months. CYTOGENETICS: The leukemic cells of peripheral blood/bone marrow and the lymphoma cells have the same acquired, clonal abnormality of chromosome band 8p11 with the translocations t(8;13)(p11;q12), t(8;9)(p11;q34), and t(6;8)(q27;p11). MOLECULAR GENETICS: The molecular cloning of these translocations has shown the fusion of three unrelated genes (ZNF198 at 13p12, FAN at 9q34 and FOP at 6q27) to the fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) gene at 8p11. The complete coding sequence of the tyrosine kinase domain of FGFR1 is retained in all three fusion genes and presumably activated by sequences of the different fusion partners by dimerization. CONCLUSION: Activation of tyrosinc kinase signal transduction pathways are of increasing interest in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders and myelodysplastic syndromes. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors could represent a promising therapeutic tool.","['Reither, A', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Reither A', 'Hehlmann R', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['III.

MTX and CSA was administered for GvHD prophylaxis. Engraftment was confirmed on day 28. Within 6 months following BMT, no complication occurred. Continuous complete remission was demonstrated by repeated bone marrow smears. On day 300 the patient complained of chest pain and dyspnea. X-ray and CT-scan showed thickening of the pleura and pleural effusion. A pleuracarcinosis was diagnosed by cytologic examination of a pleural aspirate. By an open thoracotomy a disseminated inoperable disease became apparent. Diagnosis of an adenocarcinoma was confirmed by histologic examination. The patient died 2 months later due to disseminated tumour in complete remission of AML. Solid tumours are rare as secondary malignancies after BMT. Usually the neoplasmas are late events occurring more than 10 years after BMT.

We have examined the effects of arsenic trioxide on oesophageal carcinoma cell line EC8712. Our results demonstrated that the growth and survival of tumour cells were markedly inhibited by arsenic trioxide. The half dose effect (ED50) was at the concentration of 1 microM. Electron microscopic study demonstrated that EC8712 tumour cells treated with arsenic trioxide display a typical morphological appearance of apoptosis, including chromatin condensation and fragmentation of the nuclei. In contrast, no apoptotic features were observed in tumour cells without arsenic trioxide treatment. TUNEL assay also showed the biological features of apoptosis in cells treated with arsenic trioxide. Flow cytometry analyses showed that apoptotic peak was identified in arsenic trioxide treated cells but not in the control. Apoptotic cells in arsenic trioxide treated group account for 35% of total cell populations after three days treatment at a dose of 3 microM. In short, our results suggested that the anticancer effect of arsenic trioxide is due, at least in part, to the induction of apoptosis in cancer cells.","['Shen, Z Y', 'Tan, L J', 'Cai, W J', 'Shen, J', 'Chen, C', 'Tang, X M', 'Zheng, M H']","['Shen ZY', 'Tan LJ', 'Cai WJ', 'Shen J', 'Chen C', 'Tang XM', 'Zheng MH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, Shantou University, P.

Due to activation or malignant transformation other leukocyte subpopulations including human T cells exhibit significant APN-gene and surface expression. The function of leukocyte APN is poorly understood, especially the knowledge of physiological ligands/substrates of the enzyme is limited. Abnormal expression of APN on malignant lymphocytes, the activation-dependent induction of APN expression in peripheral T cells and the strong anti-proliferative effects of aminopeptidase inhibitors lead to the interesting hypothesis of a linkage of APN expression and/or function to leukocyte growth. In support of this hypothesis we detected mutations in the APN-gene of patients suffering from leukaemia or lymphoma. This review outlines evidence for APN contributing to the regulation and realisation of lymphocyte growth and function by modulating the mRNA expression of IL-2, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and TGF-beta1 and increasing the activity of MAP kinase p42/Erk2.","['Lendeckel, U', 'Arndt, M', 'Frank, K', 'Wex, T', 'Ansorge, S']","['Lendeckel U', 'Arndt M', 'Frank K', 'Wex T', 'Ansorge S']","['Otto von Guericke University, Centre of Internal Medicine, Institute of Experimental Internal Medicine, D-39120 Magdeburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'CD13 Antigens/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/immunology', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology/*immunology']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 1999 Jul;4(1):17-27.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,88,,,,,,,,,,,,

APLs with PML-RARalpha or PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein differ only in their response to retinoic acid (RA) treatment: the t(15;17) (PML-RARalpha-positive) APL blasts are sensitive to RA in vitro, and patients enter disease remission after RA treatment, while those with t(11;17) (PLZF-RARalpha-positive) APLs do not. Recently it has been shown that complete remission can be achieved upon treatment with arsenic trioxide (As2O3) in PML-RARalpha-positive APL, even when the patient has relapsed and the disease is RA resistant. This appears to be due to apoptosis induced by As2O3 in the APL blasts by poorly defined mechanisms. Here we report that (i) As2O3 induces apoptosis only in cells expressing the PML-RARalpha, not the PLZF-RARalpha, fusion protein; (ii) PML-RARalpha is partially modified by covalent linkage with a PIC-1/SUMO-1-like protein prior to As2O3 treatment, whereas PLZF-RARalpha is not; (iii) As2O3 treatment induces a change in the modification pattern of PML-RARalpha toward highly modified forms; (iv) redistribution of PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) upon As2O3 treatment is accompanied by recruitment of PIC-1/SUMO-1 into PML-NBs, probably due to hypermodification of both PML and PML-RARalpha; (v) As2O3-induced apoptosis is independent of the DNA binding activity located in the RARalpha portion of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein; and (vi) the apoptotic process is bcl-2 and caspase 3 independent and is blocked only partially by a global caspase inhibitor. Taken together, these data provide novel insights into the mechanisms involved in As2O3-induced apoptosis in APL and predict that treatment of t(11;17) (PLZF-RARalpha-positive) APLs with As2O3 will not be successful.","['Sternsdorf, T', 'Puccetti, E', 'Jensen, K', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Will, H', 'Ottmann, O G', 'Ruthardt, M']","['Sternsdorf T', 'Puccetti E', 'Jensen K', 'Hoelzer D', 'Will H', 'Ottmann OG', 'Ruthardt M']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie und Immunologie an der Universitat, D-20251 Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'SUMO-1 Protein', 'Staining and Labeling', 'U937 Cells', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jul;19(7):5170-8. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.7.5170.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.7.5170 [doi]'],PMC84360,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pbx proteins also stably heterodimerize and bind DNA with Meis and Pknox1-Prep1, additional members of the TALE (three-amino-acid loop extension) superclass of homeodomain proteins that function on common genetic pathways with a subset of Hox proteins. In this study, we demonstrated that Pbx and Meis bind DNA as heterotrimeric complexes with Hoxb1 on a genetically defined Hoxb2 enhancer, r4, that mediates the cross-regulatory transcriptional effects of Hoxb1 in vivo. The DNA binding specificity of the heterotrimeric complex for r4 is mediated by a Pbx-Hox site in conjunction with a distal Meis site, which we showed to be required for ternary complex formation and Meis-enhanced transcription. Formation of heterotrimeric complexes in which all three homeodomains bind their cognate DNA sites is topologically facilitated by the ability of Pbx and Meis to interact through their amino termini and bind DNA without stringent half-site orientation and spacing requirements. Furthermore, Meis site mutation in the Hoxb2 enhancer phenocopies Pbx-Hox site mutation to abrogate enhancer-directed expression of a reporter transgene in the murine embryonic hindbrain, demonstrating that DNA binding by all three proteins is required for trimer function in vivo. Our data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence for the combinatorial regulation of Hox and TALE protein functions that are mediated, in part, by their interdependent DNA binding activities as ternary complexes. As a consequence, Hoxb1 employs Pbx and Meis-related proteins, as a pair of essential cofactors in a higher-order molecular complex, to mediate its transcriptional effects on an endogenous Hox response element.","['Jacobs, Y', 'Schnabel, C A', 'Cleary, M L']","['Jacobs Y', 'Schnabel CA', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rhombencephalon/metabolism', 'Solutions', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jul;19(7):5134-42. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.7.5134.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.7.5134 [doi]'],PMC84356,,"['T32 CA009151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In collaboration with LMO1 or LMO2, the thymic expression of SCL/tal leads to T-ALL at a young age with a high degree of penetrance in transgenic mice. We now show that SCL LMO1 double-transgenic mice display thymocyte developmental abnormalities in terms of proliferation, apoptosis, clonality, and immunophenotype prior to the onset of a frank malignancy. At 4 weeks of age, thymocytes from SCL LMO1 mice show 70% fewer total thymocytes, with increased rates of both proliferation and apoptosis, than control thymocytes. At this age, a clonal population of thymocytes begins to populate the thymus, as evidenced by oligoclonal T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Also, there is a dramatic increase in immature CD44(+) CD25(-) cells, a decrease in the more mature CD4(+) CD8(+) cells, and development of an abnormal CD44(+) CD8(+) population. An identical pattern of premalignant changes is seen with either a full-length SCL protein or an amino-terminal truncated protein which lacks the SCL transactivation domain, demonstrating that the amino-terminal portion of SCL is not important for leukemogenesis. Lastly, we show that the T-ALL which develop in the SCL LMO1 mice are strikingly similar to those which develop in E2A null mice, supporting the hypothesis that SCL exerts its oncogenic action through a functional inactivation of E proteins.","['Chervinsky, D S', 'Zhao, X F', 'Lam, D H', 'Ellsworth, M', 'Gross, K W', 'Aplan, P D']","['Chervinsky DS', 'Zhao XF', 'Lam DH', 'Ellsworth M', 'Gross KW', 'Aplan PD']","['Departments of Cancer Genetics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/genetics/*physiology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*etiology', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Thymus Gland/abnormalities/cytology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jul;19(7):5025-35. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.7.5025.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.7.5025 [doi]'],PMC84335,,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73773/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of expression of these cassettes revealed mosaic expression patterns reminiscent of, but clearly different from, position effect variegation. Further investigations demonstrated that these mosaic expression patterns are caused by dynamic activation and inactivation of the transcription unit, resulting in oscillations of expression. These oscillations occur once in every few cell cycles at a rate specific for the enhancer present at the locus. DNase I sensitivity studies revealed that the chromatin is accessible and that DNase-hypersensitive sites were present whether or not the transcription unit is active, suggesting that the oscillations occur between transcriptionally competent and transcriptionally active chromatin conformations, rather than between open and closed chromatin conformations. Treatment of oscillating cells with trichostatin A eliminates the oscillations only after the cells have passed through late G1 or early S, suggesting that these oscillations might be caused by changes in histone acetylation patterns.","['Feng, Y Q', 'Alami, R', 'Bouhassira, E E']","['Feng YQ', 'Alami R', 'Bouhassira EE']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Animals', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'G1 Phase', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mosaicism', 'S Phase', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jul;19(7):4907-17. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.7.4907.,"['0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.7.4907 [doi]'],PMC84294,,"['P01 HL055435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL38655/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL55435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon is reflected by the clonal selection that occurs during Ab-MLV-mediated transformation in vivo and in vitro. About 50% of all Ab-MLV-transformed pre-B cells express mutant forms of p53 as they emerge from this process, suggesting that this protein may play an important role in the transformation process. Consistent with this idea, expression of p19(Arf), a protein whose function depends on the presence of a functional p53, is required for the apoptotic crisis that characterizes primary Ab-MLV transformants. To test the role of p53 in pre-B-cell transformation directly, we examined the response of Trp53(-/-) mice to Ab-MLV. The absence of p53 shortens the latency of Abelson disease induction but does not affect the frequency of cells susceptible to Ab-MLV-induced transformation. However, primary transformants derived from the null animals bypass the apoptotic crisis that characterizes the transition from primary transformant to fully malignant cell line. These effects do not require p21(Cip-1), a major downstream target of p53; however, consistent with a role of p19(Arf), transformants expressing mutant p53 and abundant p19 retain wild-type p19 sequences.","['Unnikrishnan, I', 'Radfar, A', 'Jenab-Wolcott, J', 'Rosenberg, N']","['Unnikrishnan I', 'Radfar A', 'Jenab-Wolcott J', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*physiology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",1999/06/22 00:00,1999/06/22 00:01,['1999/06/22 00:00'],"['1999/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jul;19(7):4825-31. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.7.4825.,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.7.4825 [doi]'],PMC84281,,"['R01 CA033771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: A retrospective study of 59 children with Down's syndrome and AML presenting between 1987 and 1995. Data were obtained from hospital case notes, trial records, and by questionnaire. RESULTS: The patients were unusually young (median age, 23 months) with a predominance of megakaryoblastic AML. Two of the seven infants who presented with abnormal myelopoesis aged 2 months or younger achieved complete spontaneous remission. Most of the older children with AML (32 of 52) were treated on recognised intensive protocols but 13 received individualised treatment and seven symptomatic treatment alone. Only four received a bone marrow transplant (BMT) in first remission. For the 45 older children who received chemotherapy the overall survival was 55% (median follow up 4.5 years). Patients on individualised protocols had a similar overall survival and toxic death rate but marginally higher relapse rate than those on standard (intensive) protocols. Children with Down's syndrome treated on the national AML 10 trial had a similar overall survival (70% v 59%) at five years to children of comparable age without Down's syndrome: their improved relapse risk (12% v 38%) offset the slight increase in deaths as a result of treatment toxicity (19% v 11%). CONCLUSION: Neonates with Down's syndrome and abnormal myelopoesis may achieve spontaneous remission, and older children with Down's syndrome and AML can be treated successfully with intensive chemotherapy, without BMT.","['Craze, J L', 'Harrison, G', 'Wheatley, K', 'Hann, I M', 'Chessells, J M']","['Craze JL', 'Harrison G', 'Wheatley K', 'Hann IM', 'Chessells JM']","['Department of Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London WC1N 3JH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/06/18 00:00,1999/06/18 00:01,['1999/06/18 00:00'],"['1999/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1999 Jul;81(1):32-7. doi: 10.1136/adc.81.1.32.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,['10.1136/adc.81.1.32 [doi]'],PMC1717984,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several techniques have been reported for this purpose. PCR-based assays analyzing polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) markers are attractive because they are sensitive and can be performed rapidly. The intent of the present study was to test a novel approach for the quantification of mixed chimerism using a commercial multiplex STR assay with fluorescence-based detection for forensic purposes. The feasibility of this assay and the accuracy of quantitative results was tested using serial cell mixtures of unrelated individuals. Sample preparation was optimized to obtain information from minute amounts of starting material, eg from patients with aplasia or from sorted cell populations. Using the STR-PCR, discrimination between donor and recipient was possible in all patients analyzed (n = 25). Cell dilution experiments showed a linear correlation between the cell numbers added and the proportions found, with the limit of detection for a minor cell population being 5%. Comparison of values obtained with standard FISH analysis in patients transplanted from sex-mismatched donors showed an excellent correlation with the STR-PCR results. Taken together, this procedure allows the rapid, versatile and accurate quantification of mixed chimerism, even with minuscule numbers of cells.","['Thiede, C', 'Florek, M', 'Bornhauser, M', 'Ritter, M', 'Mohr, B', 'Brendel, C', 'Ehninger, G', 'Neubauer, A']","['Thiede C', 'Florek M', 'Bornhauser M', 'Ritter M', 'Mohr B', 'Brendel C', 'Ehninger G', 'Neubauer A']","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Amelogenin', 'Chimera/*genetics', 'Dental Enamel Proteins/genetics', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'X Chromosome/genetics', 'Y Chromosome/genetics']",1999/06/18 00:00,1999/06/18 00:01,['1999/06/18 00:00'],"['1999/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 May;23(10):1055-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701779.,"['0 (Amelogenin)', '0 (Dental Enamel Proteins)']",,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701779 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Height at transplant and at the latest follow-up examination were evaluated in 79/258 subjects who were below the age of 15 at BMT. A significant decrease in height-standard deviation score (SDS) was observed in leukemic children conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) and in those who received both cranial irradiation and TBI. The majority of these patients, however, received single-dose TBI (28/41). A significant decrease in height-SDS was also seen in children who received thoraco-abdominal irradiation suggesting that the deleterious effect of irradiation on growth after BMT is not entirely due to injury to cranial neuroendocrine structures, but also probably due to damage to bone epiphyses, thyroid and gonads. A non-significant decrease in height was observed in children transplanted using chemotherapy alone. Nutritional status, expressed as body-mass index (BMI), was found unchanged in the adult group (n = 158). A significant increase in BMI was observed in the younger patients (n = 88), which parallels the normal increase in BMI observed during childhood.

At the time of testing, transplanted patients had normal blood counts and bone marrow cellularity. By flow cytometry, BM CD34+ cells were found to be three- to four-fold decreased in transplanted patients compared to normal donors, while the number of PB CD34+ cells was the same as in normal donors. Using a methylcellulose colony assay, primary BM colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) were decreased 2.1-fold, whereas PB CFU-GM were only marginally decreased. In a long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC) assay, an eight-fold decrease of early progenitor cells was observed in the marrow of transplanted patients compared to normal donors, and a five-fold decrease was documented in peripheral blood. We found that the BM LTC-IC cell number correlated with concurrently determined BM CD34+ cells and committed progenitor cell number (measured as CFU-GM) and with PB LTC-IC number, but not with PB CFU-GM and CD34+ cells. We conclude that marrow and circulating early stem cell compartments, as measured by the LTC-IC assay, are greatly and permanently depressed following bone marrow transplant. The correlation between BM and PB LTC-IC indicates that the enumeration of circulating LTC-IC can be used as a measure of the stem cell compartment in the bone marrow after transplant. It seems that the deficiency of the most immature progenitor cells persists forever after successful bone marrow transplant; this means that a complete hematopoietic reconstitution can be sustained by a reduced stem cell pool.","['Selleri, C', 'Maciejewski, J P', 'De Rosa, G', 'Raiola, A', 'Risitano, A M', 'Picardi, M', 'Pezzullo, L', 'Luciano, L', 'Ricci, P', 'Varriale, G', 'Della Cioppa, P', 'Del Vecchio, L', 'Rotoli, B']","['Selleri C', 'Maciejewski JP', 'De Rosa G', 'Raiola A', 'Risitano AM', 'Picardi M', 'Pezzullo L', 'Luciano L', 'Ricci P', 'Varriale G', 'Della Cioppa P', 'Del Vecchio L', 'Rotoli B']","['Division of Hematology, Federico II University School of Medicine, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/06/18 00:00,1999/06/18 00:01,['1999/06/18 00:00'],"['1999/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 May;23(10):1029-37. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701759.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701759 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sibling and unrelated grafts were partially depleted of T cells. CD134 expression on CD4+ T cells peaked between 7 and 14 days after BMT, with a mean peak value of 45% of CD4+ cells (range 26-70%) over all three patient groups. The observed pattern of CD4+ CD134+ expression, an increase during the first 2 weeks post-BMT followed by a gradual decline towards values of 15-40%, was similar in all groups. No difference in the kinetics of CD134 expression by CD4+ T cells was observed between the patients that did or did not develop graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), nor did the clinical effect of any treatment given for GVHD correlate with alterations in CD134 expression by CD4+ T cells. Absolute CD4+,CD134+ T cell numbers showed a more rapid increment after autologous PBPCT than after sibling or MUD transplants.

Additionally, the influence of baseline patient and transplant characteristics on hematopoietic recovery was evaluated. From January 1994 to March 1996, 47 consecutive adult patients received VUD-BMT. GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporin A/short course methotrexate/prednisolone, and in four patients additional ATG. Post-transplantation, cohorts of patients received rhG-CSF (5 microg/kg/day) (n = 22) or no rhG-CSF (n = 25) in a non-randomized manner. The patient groups with and without rhG-CSF were rather comparable with respect to baseline patient and transplant characteristics. Median time to neutrophil counts (ANC) >500/microl was 14 days with rhG-CSF vs 16 days without rhG-CSF (P = 0.048), to ANC >1000/microl was 15 vs 18 days (P = 0.084). Neutrophil recovery was accelerated in patients receiving more than the median MNC dose of 2.54 x 10(8)/kg with a median time to ANC >1000/microl of 13 days vs 19 days (P = 0.017). RhG-CSF did not influence platelet recovery and incidence of infectious complications. Incidence of acute GVHD II-IV was 50% with rhG-CSF and 28% without rhG-CSF (P = 0.144), but death before acute GVHD II-IV occurred in 9% of patients with and 20% of patients without rhG-CSF. The median follow-up time was 38 and 36 months in patients with and without rhG-CSF, respectively. Survival at 2 years post-transplant was 39% (95% confidence interval (18%, 60%)) in patients with rhG-CSF and 24% (95% confidence interval (7%, 41%)) in patients without rhG-CSF. Administration of rhG-CSF after VUD-BMT may lead to more rapid neutrophil recovery, but did not influence the incidence of infectious complications. Patients receiving rhG-CSF showed a slightly higher incidence of acute GVHD II-IV.

METHODS: A Standardized Mortality Ratio study (SMR) using England and Wales as the comparison population was carried out for 6209 male pilots and 1153 male flight engineers employed for at least 1 yr between January 1, 1950 and December 31, 1992. Internal relative risk comparisons were made between shorthaul and longhaul operations defined broadly as flights within Europe and beyond Europe, respectively. RESULTS: The all-causes SMR for pilots of 61 (592 deaths) and 56 for flight engineers (127 deaths) confirmed the expected Healthy Worker Effect. In pilots apart from the known excess of deaths from aircraft accidents (SMR 14694), most of the comparisons showed significant deficits in mortality. The SMR's for brain/CNS cancer (143) and colon cancer (111) were no longer statistically significant. The SMR of 333 for melanoma was significantly raised in pilots but was not evident in flight engineers. Life expectancy for longhaul pilots and flight engineers was 4-5 yr better than England and Wales for ages 55-65 while the advantage for shorthaul pilots was reduced to between 2-3 yr. Cases of leukemia and aleukaemia in pilots were less than expected and less than the positive excess predicted from modeling based on radiation dose. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that flightdeck crew live longer than the England and Wales population and do not exhibit patterns of death that could be directly attributable to occupation.","['Irvine, D', 'Davies, D M']","['Irvine D', 'Davies DM']","['British Airways Health Services, Harmondsworth, Uxbridge, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Aviat Space Environ Med,"Aviation, space, and environmental medicine",7501714,IM,,"['Accidents, Aviation/*mortality', '*Aerospace Medicine', 'Aged', 'Aviation/*statistics & numerical data', '*Cause of Death', 'Healthy Worker Effect', 'Humans', '*Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1999/06/18 00:00,1999/06/18 00:01,['1999/06/18 00:00'],"['1999/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aviat Space Environ Med. 1999 Jun;70(6):548-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is now considerable evidence that in both avian and murine systems, yolk sac hematopoietic cells are largely a transient, embryonic population and the definitive stem cell, in fact, derives from a distinct region within the embryonic mesoderm, the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. In the human embryo, an analogous region has been found to contain a cluster of cells distinct from, but closely associated with, the ventral endothelium of the dorsal aorta, the appearance of which is restricted both spatially and temporally. We have used antibodies recognising hematopoietic regulatory factors to further characterise this region in the human embryo. These studies indicate that all factors examined, including vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor FLK-1, Flt-3 ligand and its receptor STK-1, and stem cell leukemia transcription factor, are expressed by both hematopoietic cells in the cluster and endothelial cells. However, there is some discontinuity in cells directly underlying the cluster. Furthermore, we have identified a morphologically distinct region of densely-packed, rounded cells in the mesenchyme directly beneath the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta, and running along its entire length. In the preumbilical AGM region, directly underlying the hematopoietic cluster, but not at more rostral and caudal levels, this region of mesenchyme expresses tenascin-C, an extracellular matrix glycoprotein known to facilitate cell-cell interactions and migration. This region of cells may therefore provide the microenvironmental support for the intraembryonic development of definitive hematopoietic stem cells, a process in which tenascin-C may play a pivotal role.","['Marshall, C J', 'Moore, R L', 'Thorogood, P', 'Brickell, P M', 'Kinnon, C', 'Thrasher, A J']","['Marshall CJ', 'Moore RL', 'Thorogood P', 'Brickell PM', 'Kinnon C', 'Thrasher AJ']","['Molecular Immunology Unit, Institute of Child Health, London, England.

RESULTS: During the initial evaluation of a 17-month-old child with epiphora, left lower eyelid swelling, and a tender left medial canthal mass, a complete blood cell count demonstrated pancytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy disclosed replacement of normal cellular architecture with a dense infiltrate of leukocyte blast forms. DNA analysis disclosed a translocation between chromosome 10 and 11, consistent with the diagnosis of nonlymphocytic leukemia. Although the adjacent lower eyelid cellulitis responded to intravenous antibiotics, lacrimal sac distention decreased only after chemotherapy was initiated.

The domain structure of Nck suggests that Nck links tyrosine kinase substrates to proteins containing proline-rich motifs. Here we show that Bcr/Abl tyrosine kinase, and three tyrosine phosphorylated proteins (115, 120 and 155 kDa) are co-immunoprecipitated with antibody against Nck from lysates of the human leukaemia cell line K562. By means of affinity purification with the Nck-binding phosphopeptide EPGPY(P)AQPSV, we could also detect the association of endogenous Nck with the proto-oncogene product Cbl. An investigation of the nature of interactions revealed that Bcr/Abl, Cbl, and the 155-kDa tyrosine phosphotyrosine bind exclusively to the SH3 domains of Nck. In addition, none of the single SH3 domains of Nck expressed as glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins is able to interact with the proline-rich ligands. However, combined first and second SH3 domains have the capacity to bind Bcr/Abl, Chl and p155. Mutations of conserved tryptophan to Lysine in either of the combined first and second SH3 domains completely abolish ligand binding.

It has been shown that both the relapse and mortality rates of undernourished children with ALL are higher during the continuation phase of the chemotherapy and are apparently related to a poor tolerance of ablative chemotherapy. No previous articles have analyzed the early mortality rate of these patients. METHODS: We carried out a case-control study, and have studied the effect of severe malnutrition on the mortality of 17 children with ALL during the initial induction-to-remission phase of the treatment. These 17 cases were compared with 76 controls who had survived at least the phases of induction and consolidation. RESULTS: It was found that the chance of dying during the initial phase of the treatment was 2.6 times higher (confidence interval 95%: 0.55-11.89) in undernourished children with ALL than in those children with normal nourishment status. The risk of death increased with the severity of undernourishment (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the prognostic value of malnutrition in children with ALL and suggest that undernourishment may also influence early mortality during the induction-to-remission phase of the treatment.","['Mejia-Arangure, J M', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez, A', 'Reyes-Ruiz, N I', 'Bernaldez-Rios, R', 'Mejia-Dominguez, A M', 'Navarrete-Navarro, S', 'Martinez-Garcia, M C']","['Mejia-Arangure JM', 'Fajardo-Gutierrez A', 'Reyes-Ruiz NI', 'Bernaldez-Rios R', 'Mejia-Dominguez AM', 'Navarrete-Navarro S', 'Martinez-Garcia MC']","['Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, D.F., Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child Nutrition Disorders/*etiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction']",1999/06/18 00:00,1999/06/18 00:01,['1999/06/18 00:00'],"['1999/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1999 Mar-Apr;30(2):150-3. doi: 10.1016/s0188-0128(98)00026-8.,,,,"['S0188-0128(98)00026-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0188-0128(98)00026-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DDT and its metabolite DDE are lipid soluble compounds that persist in the environment and bioaccumulate in the body in adipose tissue at levels far higher than those in blood and breast milk. This paper evaluates the possibility of cancer occurring in humans from DDT exposure. Some risk of lymphoma, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer was found in humans exposed to DDT. Animal studies showed a significant association between DDT administration and lymphoma, respiratory cancer, liver cancer, and estrogenic effects on mammary tissue. On the basis of on epidemiological principles, human studies were deficient in adequate sample sizes and were not exempt from such confounding factors as multiple chemical exposure, lifestyle factors, genetic, and other environmental influences. Extrapolation of data on DDT toxicity from animals to humans has limitations. With the persistence of DDT and DDE in the environment, the potential risk to the health of man, animals, and the environment remains.","['Jaga, K', 'Brosius, D']","['Jaga K', 'Brosius D']","['Graduate School of Health Sciences, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595, USA.

Fourteen donors were human leukocyte antigen (HLA) three-loci mismatches, 6 donors were two-loci and 3 donors were one-locus mismatches. For depletion of T-lymphocytes, a positive selection of the mobilized peripheral CD34+ progenitors using the method of magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) was used. The purity of the CD34+ cells after MACS-sorting was 98-99%, the average number of transplanted CD34+ cells was 14.2 x 10(6)/kg (range 5.4-3.9 x 10(6)/kg) and the average number of infused T-lymphocytes was 1.4 x 10(4)/kg. Due to this low T cell number, only a short-term or no prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was necessary and no GVHD was seen. A significant GVHD was only seen in patients after add-back of donor T-lymphocytes, which was performed in some patients for prevention of relapse or in patients who showed a transient mixed chimerism. Since the B lymphocyte contamination of the isolated CD34+ cells was low in the range of 0.2%, no Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated lymphoproliferative syndrome was observed. A primary engraftment was seen in 18 patients. Nonengraftment and rejection occurred in three and two patients, respectively. In four of these 5 patients, a second transplant using purified CD34+ cells from the same donor after an immunological reconditioning regimen resulted in a complete and sustained hematopoietic reconstitution. The speed of the immunological recovery was dependent on the number of transplanted CD34+ cells and was more rapid if this number was > 20 x 10(6)/kg. Eleven of the 23 patients are alive and disease free with a median follow-up of 12 months (range 2-30). The main cause of death was relapse (7 patients), and only one fatal infection was seen. Our data suggest that the transplantation of megadoses of haploidentical CD34+ cells is a realistic therapeutic option for patients who otherwise have no suitable donor, and an alternative to the use of unrelated cord blood.","['Handgretinger, R', 'Schumm, M', 'Lang, P', 'Greil, J', 'Reiter, A', 'Bader, P', 'Niethammer, D', 'Klingebiel, T']","['Handgretinger R', 'Schumm M', 'Lang P', 'Greil J', 'Reiter A', 'Bader P', 'Niethammer D', 'Klingebiel T']","[""Children's University Hospital, University of Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/therapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Osteopetrosis/therapy']",1999/06/18 00:00,1999/06/18 00:01,['1999/06/18 00:00'],"['1999/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1999 Apr 30;872:351-61; discussion 361-2. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08479.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers)']",,,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1999.tb08479.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although extensive T cell depletion of donor bone marrow was successful in preventing GVHD in children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID), results were disappointing in leukemic patients because the benefit of preventing GVHD was offset by graft failure. Resistance to engraftment appears to be mediated by host-derived cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors that survive supralethal conditioning. In the present paper, we review data that show that these genetic histocompatibility barriers can be overcome in stringent mouse models, employing lethally as well as sublethally irradiated recipients, by two major approaches that are synergistic to each other: escalation of hematopoietic progenitor cell dose and the use of nonalloreactive T cells.

We report here the experience of the New York Blood Center P/CB Program. Since its inception in 1992, over 400 unrelated transplants were supported between July 1993 and September 1997. Overall, event-free survival for all diagnoses and ages approached 0.45. Success and rapidity of engraftment correlated most strongly with the degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity and cell dose/kg body weight recipient. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was common in all patients but, surprisingly, did not differ between those patients who received grafts having one or more antigen mismatches. Chronic GVHD was uncommon and only rarely contributed to death. These results demonstrate the feasibility of large-scale P/CB banking for the provision of cryopreserved stem cell preparations for unrelated transplants. The degree of the program's success argues strongly for additional P/CB banks in order to increase the likelihood of finding a suitable stem cell preparation for patients for whom related matched donors do not exist.","['Rubinstein, P', 'Adamson, J W', 'Stevens, C']","['Rubinstein P', 'Adamson JW', 'Stevens C']","['Lindsley F.

We have now utilized our gene transfer protocol to assay amphotropic retrovirus transduction efficiency using HSCs from the bone marrow of mice treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor/stem cell factor (G-CSF/SCF). To extend these findings to a more clinically relevant protocol we analyzed the amphoR mRNA levels in HSCs from human cord blood and adult bone marrow.

More recently, investigators in a number of laboratories, including ours, used murine transplantation models to characterize the cytokines regulating the hematopoietic stem cells. The results are in general agreement with the cytokine interactions defined in culture. The positive cytokines may be separated into two groups: one consisting of steel factor and flt3/flt2 ligand and the other consisting of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, IL-12, leukemia inhibitory factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and thrombopoietin.

These effects did not become public knowledge until after the A-bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Here, we report that ligation of CD44 with specific anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies or with hyaluronan, its natural ligand, can reverse myeloid differentiation blockage in AML1/2 to AML5 subtypes. The differentiation of AML blasts was evidenced by the ability to produce oxidative bursts, the expression of lineage antigens and cytological modifications, all specific to normal differentiated myeloid cells.

Chronic ethanol (EtOH) consumption accentuates the severity of murine AIDS (MAIDS). Because hormone production is often suppressed by chronic EtOH intake, as well as retrovirus infection, we investigated whether hormone supplementation during chronic EtOH consumption contributes to slowing immune dysfunction caused by LP-BM5 infection and/or EtOH use. Because dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) was previously shown to have immune-enhancing properties during MAIDS, we determined whether DHEAS reduced cytokine dysregulation otherwise exacerbated by chronic EtOH intake during MAIDS. Adult female C57BL/6 mice were infected with LP-BM5 murine retrovirus. Some were fed 40% EtOH in drinking water and agar gel for 16 weeks postinfection. EtOH consumption further inhibited T- and B-cell proliferation beyond suppression due to retrovirus infection. Interleukin (IL)-2 release produced by concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes was reduced by EtOH use by infected and uninfected mice. DHEAS overcame much of the effects induced by retrovirus infection and/or EtOH use. IL-4 secretion and IL-6 secretion were enhanced. Hepatic vitamin E levels were decreased by murine retrovirus infection, as well as by EtOH use in both uninfected and infected mice. In addition, DHEAS (0.01%) supplementation during MAIDS prevented the further dysregulation of cytokines and hepatic lipid peroxidation due to EtOH intake, partially restored T- and B-cell proliferation, and maintained hepatic vitamin E levels to near normal levels.","['Lee, J', 'Sepulveda, R T', 'Jiang, S', 'Zhang, Z', 'Inserra, P', 'Zhang, Y', 'Hosseini, S', 'Watson, R R']","['Lee J', 'Sepulveda RT', 'Jiang S', 'Zhang Z', 'Inserra P', 'Zhang Y', 'Hosseini S', 'Watson RR']","['Arizona Prevention Center, University of Arizona, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",7707242,IM,,"['Adult', 'Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects/*immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Body Weight', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects/immunology', 'Liver/chemistry/immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Vitamin E/analysis']",1999/06/17 00:00,1999/06/17 00:01,['1999/06/17 00:00'],"['1999/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Alcohol Clin Exp Res. 1999 May;23(5):856-62.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '57B09Q7FJR (Dehydroepiandrosterone Sulfate)']",,,['00000374-199905000-00014 [pii]'],,,['HL-59794/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we investigated whether the rates of cholesterol esters synthesis correlate with changes of acyl-CoAcholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) mRNA levels and of other genes implied in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMGCoA) reductase and low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. The results showed that the more rapid growing CEM cells had lower levels of expression of HMGCoA-reductase and LDL receptors compared to MOLT4. By contrast, ACAT mRNA levels were higher in CEM cells, further supporting the concept of a possible involvement of cholesterol esters in the regulation of cell growth and division. In this study, high levels of cholesterol esterification and of expression of ACAT gene were also associated with a markedly increased expression of multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene, suggesting that MDR1 activity might contribute to regulate the rate of cell growth and division by modulating intracellular cholesterol ester levels.","['Batetta, B', 'Pani, A', 'Putzolu, M', 'Sanna, F', 'Bonatesta, R', 'Piras, S', 'Spano, O', 'Mulas, M F', 'Dessi, S']","['Batetta B', 'Pani A', 'Putzolu M', 'Sanna F', 'Bonatesta R', 'Piras S', 'Spano O', 'Mulas MF', 'Dessi S']","['Istituto di Patologia Sperimentale, Universita degli Studi di Cagliari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis', 'Cholesterol Esters/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/genetics/metabolism', '*Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, LDL/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sterol O-Acyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/cytology/enzymology']",1999/06/17 00:00,1999/06/17 00:01,['1999/06/17 00:00'],"['1999/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Prolif. 1999 Feb;32(1):49-61.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'EC 2.3.1.26 (Sterol O-Acyltransferase)']",,,,PMC6726313,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer chemopreventive potential was also suggested in various assays reflective of the three major stages of carcinogenesis. Anti-initiation activity was indicated by its antioxidant and antimutagenic effects, inhibition of the hydroperoxidase function of cyclooxygenase (COX), and induction of phase II drug-metabolizing enzymes. Antipromotion activity was indicated by antiinflammatory effects, inhibition of production of arachidonic acid metabolites catalyzed by either COX-1 or COX-2, and chemical carcinogen-induced neoplastic transformation of mouse embryo fibroblasts. Antiprogression activity was demonstrated by its ability to induce human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cell differentiation. Moreover, pretreatment of mouse skin with resveratrol significantly counteracted 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by numerous biochemical responses. Resveratrol reduced the generation of hydrogen peroxide, and normalized levels of myeloperoxidase and oxidized-glutathione reductase activities. It also restored glutathione levels and superoxide dismutase activity. As judged by the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, resveratrol selectively inhibited TPA-induced expression of c-fos and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), but did not affect other TPA-induced gene products including COX-1, COX-2, c-myc, c-jun, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. These data indicate that resveratrol may interfere with reactive oxidant pathways and/or modulate the expression of c-fos and TGF-beta 1 to inhibit tumorigenesis in mouse skin. As reported herein, in addition to the activities described above, resveratrol inhibited the de novo formation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in mouse macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. This finding suggests an additional mechanism by which resveratrol may function as a cancer chemopreventive agent.","['Jang, M', 'Pezzuto, J M']","['Jang M', 'Pezzuto JM']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Switzerland,Drugs Exp Clin Res,Drugs under experimental and clinical research,7802135,IM,,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzidines/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Peroxidases/*pharmacology', 'Phenylbutazone/metabolism', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/*pharmacology', 'Resveratrol', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/genetics', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology']",1999/06/17 00:00,1999/06/17 00:01,['1999/06/17 00:00'],"['1999/06/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/17 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs Exp Clin Res. 1999;25(2-3):65-77.,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Benzidines)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '2X02101HVF (benzidine)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'GN5P7K3T8S (Phenylbutazone)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",,,,,,['P01 CA48112/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate its optimal combinations, we studied the effect of 4-hydroperoxy ifosfamide (the active form of ifosfamide) in combination with other anticancer agents against two human cancer cell lines, MG-63 (an osteosarcoma cell line) and MOLT-3 cells (a T-cell leukemia cell line). The cells were incubated for 4 days and 3 days, respectively, in the presence of 4-hydroperoxy ifosfamide and the other agent. Cell growth inhibition was determined by MTT assay. The effects of these drug combinations at the concentration producing 50% inhibition (IC50) were analyzed by the isobologram method. 4-Hydroperoxy ifosfamide showed additive effects with bleomycin, cisplatin, cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and mitomycin C, while it showed a protective effect with methotrexate in both cell lines. 4-Hydroperoxy ifosfamide showed an additive effect with vincristine in the MG-63 cell line, while it showed a sub-additive effect in the MOLT-3 cell line.

CASE SUMMARY: An 11-year-old Hispanic boy with acute myeloblastic leukemia developed symptoms of pseudotumor cerebri (headache, diplopia, photophobia, nausea, vomiting) after receiving chemotherapy including cytarabine. The patient improved after a lumbar puncture and treatment with prednisone and acetazolamide, and is now asymptomatic. DISCUSSION: Pseudotumor cerebri is a condition usually associated with obese women of child-bearing age. Case reports in pediatric patients are unusual. Several medications have been implicated in causing pseudotumor cerebri, including antimicrobials (tetracycline, naladixic acid), amiodarone, lithium carbonate, vitamin A and its derivatives, growth hormone, and corticosteroids. Chemotherapy agents reported to cause pseudotumor cerebri include busulfan with cyclophosphamide, and the combination of vinblastine, cisplatin, and bleomycin. Most of the information on medication-induced pseudotumor cerebri is in the form of case reports. Different mechanisms for causing this condition have been offered for individual medications. Most of these explanations involve fluid imbalance or interference with the Na+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase pump. Controlled studies are difficult because this condition is an unpredictable and rare occurrence. Cytarabine has frequently been associated with neurologic toxicities, but few reports of pseudotumor cerebri can be found. CONCLUSIONS: The exact cause of pseudotumor cerebri in this patient is unknown, but cytarabine seems a likely cause. The mechanism by which cytarabine could cause this reaction is unclear.","['Fort, J A', 'Smith, L D']","['Fort JA', 'Smith LD']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Miami Children's Hospital, FL 33155, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,IM,,"['Acetazolamide/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Diuretics/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Pseudotumor Cerebri/*chemically induced']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1999 May;33(5):576-8. doi: 10.1345/aph.18059.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Diuretics)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'O3FX965V0I (Acetazolamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,['10.1345/aph.18059 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitivity, specificity and their respective quality indices were estimated for the IFAT relative to histology. The IFAT was shown to be unreliable, particularly with respect to sensitivity. Cohen's kappa was also calculated and revealed that the agreement between the 2 tests was no better than random. In contrast to previously published results the IFAT did not perform better than histology in the presence of bacterial kidney disease.

In this study, the composition and dynamics of ring chromosomes were analysed in eight cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia, 17 solid tumours, and five cases with constitutional rings. Chromosomal banding and fluorescence in situ hybridisation were performed to determine the content and the structural heterogeneity of the rings. Telomeric repeats were detected using peptide nucleic acid probes or primed in situ labelling, whereas centromeric activity was evaluated by detection of kinetochore proteins. Mitotic instability was assessed by the frequency of anaphase bridges. The results suggest that human ring chromosomes can be structurally and functionally divided into two categories. In the first of these, size variation is minimal and rearrangement at cell division is uncommon. The majority of such rings contain subtelomeric sequences. Constitutional ring chromosomes and most rings in leukaemias belong to this group, whereas only a few mesenchymal tumours exhibit rings of this type. The second category consists of rings with amplified sequences, primarily from chromosome 12, characteristically occurring in atypical lipomatous tumours and other subtypes of low or borderline malignant mesenchymal neoplasms. Variation in size and number is extensive, and breakage-fusion-bridge events occur at a high frequency. Abnormalities in pericentromeric sequences are common and, in some cases, kinetochores assemble in the absence of alphoid DNA. We conclude that it is not only the ring structure per se or the neoplastic nature of the host cell that determines ring instability, but probably also the functional role of the genes carried in the ring.","['Gisselsson, D', 'Hoglund, M', 'Mertens, F', 'Johansson, B', 'Dal Cin, P', 'Van den Berghe, H', 'Earnshaw, W C', 'Mitelman, F', 'Mandahl, N']","['Gisselsson D', 'Hoglund M', 'Mertens F', 'Johansson B', 'Dal Cin P', 'Van den Berghe H', 'Earnshaw WC', 'Mitelman F', 'Mandahl N']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden. david.gisselsson@klingen.lu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,IM,,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*genetics/pathology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', '*Ring Chromosomes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Genet. 1999 Apr;104(4):315-25. doi: 10.1007/s004390050960.,,,,['10.1007/s004390050960 [doi]'],,,['073915/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was conducted to analyze induction and repair of irradiation- and chemotherapy-related strand breaks in vitro. METHODS: Friend Leukemia cells were exposed to irradiation and various chemotherapeutic agents at different doses and concentrations. Occurrence of strand breaks was determined fluorometrically, measuring the rate of DNA unwinding immediately after exposure and 24 hours later. RESULTS: The amount of double-stranded DNA decreased significantly for irradiation, doxorubicin, dactinomycin and etoposide (p < or = 0.05, t-test). After 24 hours free of exposure, the persistent damage was detectable for all of these agents but not for irradiated cells, with DNA strand breaks being decreased for etoposide, unchanged for doxorubicin and increased for methotrexate as well as for dactinomycin. CONCLUSIONS: Severe DNA damage is induced by various chemotherapeutic agents and by irradiation. While repair of chemotherapy-related strand breaks may remain incomplete or prolonged for some chemotherapeutic agents, repair of radiation induced strand breaks is faster and more complete. Therefore chemotherapy-related carcinogenesis may partially be explained by prolonged persistence of DNA strand breaks.","['Froelich, J J', 'Schneller, F R', 'Zahn, R K']","['Froelich JJ', 'Schneller FR', 'Zahn RK']","['Medizinisches Zentrum fur Radiologie, Abteilung fur Strahlendiagnostik, Klinikum der Philipps-Universitat, Marburg, Germany. froehlic@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Clin Chem Lab Med,Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,9806306,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*genetics/radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Chem Lab Med. 1999 Apr;37(4):403-8. doi: 10.1515/CCLM.1999.066.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,['10.1515/CCLM.1999.066 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this pursuit two of the obstacles that have been necessary to overcome are a unique dose dependent Adriamycin-induced cardiotoxicity reported in patients treated with this chemotherapeutic agent as well as p-gp-mediated multi drug resistance (MDR) which has been found in tumor cells exposed to Adriamycin in vitro and in vivo as well as in human tumor samples. Using an in vitro cardiac cell system and MDR+ and MDR- Friend leukemia cell lines we find that a relatively new anthracycline, Annamycin, has reduced cardiotoxic activity but is more effective in inhibiting the growth of MDR+ cells than Adriamycin. The reduced cardiotoxicity of Annamycin is approximately 10 fold lower than Adriamycin whereas the increased efficacy against the MDR+ Friend leukemia tumor cell line is about 2 fold. The observation that Adriamycin preferentially accumulates in cardiac-muscle (CM) but not in cardiac non-muscle (NM) cells while Annamycin accumulates equally in both, may explain in part the reduced cardiotoxicity of Annamycin. Moreover, the cytosolic accumulation of Annamycin vs the nuclear localization of Adriamycin suggests a different target site for each drug.","['Kolonias, D', 'Podona, T', 'Savaraj, N', 'Gate, L', 'Cossum, P', 'Lampidis, T J']","['Kolonias D', 'Podona T', 'Savaraj N', 'Gate L', 'Cossum P', 'Lampidis TJ']","['University of Miami, School of Medicine, Department of Cell Biology & Anatomy, Fl. 33136, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Mar-Apr;19(2A):1277-83.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'SNU299M83Q (annamycin)']",,,,,,['R01 CA 37109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of these 11 clones, only the C/MET leads to lung metastatic tumor development when injected i.v. into mice. Furthermore, the C/MET clone colonizes the lung only.

The C/MET model therefore appears to be an interesting pharmacological tool to test new investigational agents with anti-tumor potentialities to lung metastases.","['Farinelle, S', 'Dedecker, R', 'Malonne, H', 'Werry, J', 'Darro, F', 'Kiss, R']","['Farinelle S', 'Dedecker R', 'Malonne H', 'Werry J', 'Darro F', 'Kiss R']","[""Laboratoire d'Histologie, Faculte de Medecine, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, Belgium.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Animals', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*secondary', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Ploidies']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Mar-Apr;19(2A):1171-80.,['0 (Chromatin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the effects of these modifiers on a more recently discovered efflux pump, the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP), have not yet been fully characterized. MRP is expressed in most human tissues and is overexpressed in several tumor types. For these reasons, we have investigated the effects of three prototype Pgp modifiers, which act by different modes on the function of Pgp, on the function of MRP in two MRP-overexpressing cell lines: UMCC/VP lung and MCF-7/VP breast cancer cells. Clinically optimal plasma levels of verapamil, cremophor, and PSC833 have been shown to completely block the function of Pgp in Pgp-over expressing cells. However, in the two MRP-over expressing cell lines, these modifiers only partially blocked the function of MRP and combinations of these optimal concentrations acted antagonistically. Similar antagonistic effects were seen with combinations of suboptimal concentration levels of these blockers, while these combinations resulted in synergistic effects in Pgp overexpressing cells. For two biophysical parameters measured at the plasma membrane, membrane fluidity and membrane potential, the effects of these modifiers were essentially similar in Pgp and MRP expressing cells. We suggest that the 170 kD Pgp and the 190 kD MRP glycoproteins, imbedded in the plasma membranes, respond differently to simultaneous effects of the investigated prototype resistance modifiers. These results also suggest that the identification of the specific mechanism of drug resistance is important for the selection of chemotherapeutic strategies to block the efflux pump on the cancer cell.","['Aszalos, A', 'Thompson, K', 'Yin, J J', 'Ross, D D']","['Aszalos A', 'Thompson K', 'Yin JJ', 'Ross DD']","['Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, FDA, Laurel, MD 20708, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mice', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Verapamil/*pharmacology']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Mar-Apr;19(2A):1053-64.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '39279-69-1 (cremophor)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In response to various stress factors, the parental wild-type (WT) L1210 cell line undergoes cell cycle arrest; Y8 cells become apoptotic. These responses are p53-independent. Cell cycle regulation also appears different between the two cell lines, suggesting that Y8 cells are more apoptotic because of alterations in their cell cycle compared to WT cells. In order to study the relationships between cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, the effects of 2-aminopurine (2-AP), wortmannin, and PD98059, were studied on WT and Y8 cells. 2-AP induced G2/M block in both WT and Y8 cells with differences in G0/G1 and S phase contents between the two cell lines. Wortmannin induced G0/G1 block in Y8 cells, while exhibiting no effect on WT cells. PD98059 had no effect on the cell cycle of either WT or Y8 cells. In response to each inhibitor, Y8 cells underwent apoptosis to a much greater extent than the parental WT cell line. These data suggest that the specific pathways that converge on the cell cycle are altered and may be involved in the differences between a tumor cell to block in cell cycle or to undergo apoptosis.","['Somerville, L', 'Cory, J G']","['Somerville L', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University, School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858-4354, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['2-Aminopurine/*pharmacology', 'Androstadienes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Mar-Apr;19(2A):1021-6.,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '452-06-2 (2-Aminopurine)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,,,['CA55540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 plays an important role in IL-6 cytokine family-mediated reactions. OM signals are transduced through two different OM receptor complexes: a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/OM receptor (a heterodimer of LIFR beta and gp130) and an OM specific receptor (a heterodimer of OMR beta and gp130). This study examined the expression of these two OM receptors as well as the effect of OM on the growth of prostate carcinoma cell lines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PC-3, DU 145 and LNCaP cells were used. The expression of OMR beta and LIFR beta was determined by RT-PCR. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 was analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: OM promoted the growth of DU 145 but not that of PC-3 and LNCaP. LIF had no effect on the growth of any of these cell lines. DU 145 and PC-3 expressed much higher levels of OMR beta mRNA than those of LIFR beta mRNA. Neither OMR beta nor LIFR beta mRNA was detected in LNCaP. OM, but not LIF, induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 in DU 145. PC-3 lacked STAT3 expression. CONCLUSIONS: OM has been known to be a cytostatic cytokine for tumor cells. Conversely, we show that OM promotes the growth of DU 145. Further, our findings suggest that the growth-promoting signals of OM is mediated through the OM specific receptor with subsequent activation of STAT3.","['Mori, S', 'Murakami-Mori, K', 'Bonavida, B']","['Mori S', 'Murakami-Mori K', 'Bonavida B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, UCLA School of Medicine 90095-1747, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/physiology']",1999/06/16 00:00,1999/06/16 00:01,['1999/06/16 00:00'],"['1999/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1999 Mar-Apr;19(2A):1011-5.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the experience of an 11-year-old who developed symptomatic CAHC at the start of maintenance therapy for testicular relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Significant dose reduction of maintenance therapy did not improve the tolerance of antileukemic treatment. In an effort to improve his liver disease and to deliver effective antileukemic therapy, interferon alpha and an alternative maintenance therapy regimen for ALL were initiated. The patient tolerated the combined therapy well. Interferon therapy was continued for 27 months, which was three months from the end of antineoplastic therapy. At that time serum transaminase values were normal, and no HCV viral genome was detectable. Viral genome was detected 10 months later. The combined effects of interferon and antineoplastic therapy resulted in myelosuppression requiring dose reduction of both treatments. The patient remains asymptomatic and with no evidence of recurrent leukemia more than six years from diagnosis of relapse. The effect on the status of this patient's CAHC was similar to that reported among leukemic patients who underwent an interferon course more than one year from the end of antineoplastic therapy.

HTLV-1 is a retrovirus similar to HIV-I (HTLV-III) in a number of features, such as CD4 tropism. It is responsible for several clinical entities, including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The relationship, if any, of HTLV-1 and thrombocytopenia has not been systematically studied. To determine how frequently ITP patients are commonly infected with HTLV-1, the following study was performed. Frozen serum samples from 123 randomly selected patients with ITP were thawed and tested for antibodies to HTLV-1 by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. Positives were confirmed by Western blot. Three patients were initially found to be positive for HTLV-1. One was a female of Caribbean ancestry, one was a male HIV-1+ patient, and one was an adolescent female with no known risk factors for HIV-1. The two females later tested negative for HTLV-1. As a screening program for HTLV-1 antibodies was not introduced into blood banks until November 1988, there may have been passive transfer of the virus from intravenous immunoglobulin that these patients had received. This study of a large number of ITP patients shows that it is extremely unlikely that they are infected with HTLV-1, and, therefore, it is unnecessary to screen ITP patients for seropositivity to HTLV-1.","['Calleja, E', 'Klein, R', 'Bussel, J']","['Calleja E', 'Klein R', 'Bussel J']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York/ Cornell University Medical College, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Deltaretrovirus Antibodies/*analysis', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'HIV-1', 'HTLV-I Infections/complications', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune System Diseases/*immunology', 'Male', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/complications/*immunology']",1999/06/15 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/15 10:00'],"['1999/06/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Jun;61(2):94-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199906)61:2<94::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-v.,['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antibodies)'],,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199906)61:2<94::AID-AJH3>3.0.CO;2-V [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199906)61:2<94::aid-ajh3>3.0.co;2-v [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis (Group I), six children with ALL at relapse (Group II), and 10 healthy children (controls) were included in this study. Lymphoblasts in ALL patients, and neutrophils and mononuclear cells in controls, were incubated in increasing heparin concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20 U/ml). Flow cytometric analyses were performed at 0, 1, and 2 hours of incubation in heparin for determination of the apoptotic effects of heparin. In Group I apoptosis was detected in all different levels of heparin concentration except 0 U/ml at 0, 1, and 2 hours. The apoptotic effects of heparin on blast cells peaked at the first hour in 5-, 10-, and 20-U/ml heparin concentrations (p < 0.0001). In Group II similar findings were observed only at zero hour and apoptosis was higher than those in Group I except in 5-U/ml heparin concentration (p < 0.001). Apoptosis was found to increase with heparin levels in both groups (p < 0.02). In the control group, apoptosis was detected only at the 20-U/ml heparin concentration and only at the first and second hours. Lymphoblasts are more sensitive to apoptotic effects of heparin than either neutrophils and mononuclear cells (p < 0.004). It can be suggested that low-dose heparin may cause significant apoptosis of lymphoblasts while inducing no apoptosis on neutrophils and mononuclear cells. The findings of this preliminary study indicate that further and more comprehensive research on the apoptotic effect of heparin on lymphoblasts should be done.","['Erduran, E', 'Tekelioglu, Y', 'Gedik, Y', 'Yildiran, A']","['Erduran E', 'Tekelioglu Y', 'Gedik Y', 'Yildiran A']","['Karadeniz Technical University, Medical School, Department of Pediatrics, Trabzon, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Heparin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/physiology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Time Factors']",1999/06/15 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/15 10:00'],"['1999/06/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Jun;61(2):90-3. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199906)61:2<90::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-9.,['9005-49-6 (Heparin)'],,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199906)61:2<90::AID-AJH2>3.0.CO;2-9 [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199906)61:2<90::aid-ajh2>3.0.co;2-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we followed a cohort of 81 Chinese patients who received allogeneic BMT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The donors were either relatives (65 siblings, 1 parent) or unrelated volunteers (15). BMT was performed at a median interval of 11.6 months from diagnosis of CML, and the stages of disease before BMT were: first chronic phase (60 patients), accelerated or second chronic phase in (10 patients), and blastic crisis (11 patients). Three conditioning regimens were employed: Bu-Cy, Cy-TBI, or Bu-Cy-TBI. Standard cyclosporin and short methotrexate protocol were used for acute graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. RESULTS: There were five graft failures with three after related BMT. Patients after related or unrelated BMT had a comparable rate of neutrophil recovery (median = 22 days), but significant delay in platelet recovery occurred after unrelated BMT (median = 34 vs. 20 days, P < 0.05). The latter also had higher incidence of acute GvHD (73% vs. 41%, P < 0.05), although the incidence of chronic GvHD was not different between groups. At a median follow-up of 43.5 months, patients after related BMT had a significantly better rate of disease-free survival (68% vs. 37.3%, P < 0.05) and overall survival (81% vs. 38.9%, P < 0.05) at 4 years. Subgroup analysis of patients after related BMT showed the outcome was better when they were transplanted at first chronic phase. Multivariate analysis showed that advanced disease (RR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.48-2.73) significantly worsened the outcome of BMT, whereas the presence of chronic GvHD had a protective effect against relapse and survival (RR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.02-0.38). CONCLUSION: Allogeneic BMT is a curative form of treatment for patients with CML. Treatment outcome is best for those who undergo transplants from HLA-matched siblings during the first chronic phase.","['Lee, C K', 'Lie, A K', 'Liang, R', 'Au, W Y', 'Chen, F E', 'Chim, C S', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Lee CK', 'Lie AK', 'Liang R', 'Au WY', 'Chen FE', 'Chim CS', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, China. cklee@usa.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/06/15 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/15 10:00'],"['1999/06/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/15 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1999 Jun;61(2):85-9. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199906)61:2<85::aid-ajh1>3.0.co;2-z.,,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199906)61:2<85::AID-AJH1>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1096-8652(199906)61:2<85::aid-ajh1>3.0.co;2-z [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ceramides produced by 1,25(OH)2D-induced sphingomyelin (SM) hydrolysis also contribute to the permeability barrier lipids in keratinocytes. Exogenously supplied SM is taken up by mammalian cells, including keratinocytes, and is incorporated into cellular pools. However, the effects of exogenously added SM on keratinocyte differentiation have not been studied. Therefore, in this study, we compared exogenously added SM with a cell-permeable ceramide for their ability to stimulate keratinocyte differentiation induced by 1,25(OH)2D. Both short-chain ceramide (C2-cer) and SM stimulated the differentiation and inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells. As expected, this effect was potentiated by 1,25(OH)2D. However, SM inhibited the differentiation and stimulated the proliferation of keratinocytes. While C2-cer potentiated the effects of 1,25(OH)2D, SM reversed the effects of 1,25(OH)2D on keratinocytes. The ratio of SM to ceramide was significantly different between keratinocytes and HL-60 cells. While the SM level of HL-60 cells were twice that of keratinocytes, keratinocytes contained ten times more ceramides than HL-60 cells, resulting in a ceramide/SM ratio 17 times higher in keratinocytes. Thus, we identified similarities and significant differences in the sphingolipid-mediated cell signaling pathway between keratinocytes and HL-60 cells. While SM stimulated HL-60 cell differentiation, presumably by incorporation into SMase-accessible membrane pools, it inhibited keratinocyte differentiation. In keratinocytes, SM was possibly incorporated into a different cellular pool (barrier lipid pool) or altered membrane phospholipid metabolism and membrane fluidity.","['Pillai, S', 'Mahajan, M', 'Carlomusto, M']","['Pillai S', 'Mahajan M', 'Carlomusto M']","['Unilever Research, Edgewater, New Jersey 07020, USA. kumar.pillai@unilever.com']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Arch Dermatol Res,Archives of dermatological research,8000462,IM,,"['Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Dermatologic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Sphingomyelins/*pharmacology']",1999/06/15 00:00,1999/06/15 00:01,['1999/06/15 00:00'],"['1999/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dermatol Res. 1999 May;291(5):284-9. doi: 10.1007/s004030050409.,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Dermatologic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,['10.1007/s004030050409 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, due to the immaturity of the UCB lymphoid compartment, these transplants are usually associated with a low incidence and severity of GvHD. This clinical observation and the immaturity of the UCB lymphoid compartment justify the acceptance of UCB units which differ from their recipient by 1 or 2 HLA antigens of the six HLA A, B and DRB1 antigens conventionally typed. Whether the number and type of HLA disparities affect clinical outcome of UCB transplants has not, however, been clearly demonstrated yet. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study on 14 pediatric patients with high risk leukemia transplanted with UCB from unrelated donors, evaluation of HLA compatibility was extended to HLA-C and DQB1 genes and correlated to the engraftment rate and occurrence of GvHD. Conditioning regimen and GvHD prophylaxis were identical in all cases. HLA-A and B antigens were typed by serology, whereas DNA based methods were used to define HLA-C gene groups, and HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 alleles. RESULTS: Conventional HLA-A, B and DRB1 typing demonstrated that 12 recipient/donor pairs differed at one HLA locus, while 2 pairs had 2 HLA disparities. The extended HLA-typing showed that only one out of the six pairs with a different HLA-A locus had additional mismatches at HLA-C and DQB1 loci, whereas all the remaining 8 pairs, which already differed at HLA-B and/or DRB1 loci after conventional typing, had additional HLA-C and/or DQB1 mismatches (p = 0.002). By contrast, engraftment rate and occurrence of GvHD did not significantly correlate with level of HLA-mismatches even after extended HLA-typing. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present data show that additional mismatched HLA-C and/or DQB1 antigens are significantly more frequent in pairs which after conventional HLA-typing differed at HLA-B and/or DRB1 loci, than in those showing one HLA-A mismatch. This observation provides an additional criterion for selection of UCB donors with the closest HLA-match when more than one unit are available. We did not, however, observe any correlation between engraftment rate, occurrence of GvHD and degree of HLA disparities detected either by standard or extended typing. These data support the notion that certain HLA differences do not affect the clinical outcome of UCB transplants and indicate that the expensive and time consuming molecular typing of HLA-C and DQB1 loci might be avoided for UCB donor selection.","['Elia, L', 'Arcese, W', 'Torello, M', 'Iori, A P', 'Guglielmi, C', 'Perrone, M P', 'Screnci, M', 'Sprovieri, T', 'Rapanotti, M C', 'Cimino, G']","['Elia L', 'Arcese W', 'Torello M', 'Iori AP', 'Guglielmi C', 'Perrone MP', 'Screnci M', 'Sprovieri T', 'Rapanotti MC', 'Cimino G']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Universita ""La Sapienza"", Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'HLA-C Antigens/*blood/genetics', 'HLA-DQ Antigens/*blood/genetics', 'HLA-DQ beta-Chains', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Histocompatibility/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male']",1999/06/15 00:00,1999/06/15 00:01,['1999/06/15 00:00'],"['1999/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 Jun;84(6):530-4.,"['0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DQB1 antigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remissions (CR) can be obtained with intensive regimens in 40-60% of cases, but they are short-lived. In an effort to obtain high CR rates and prolong their duration and achieve long-term survival in a substantial number of patients, we designed an intensive combination salvage regimen (RELAL-88). In this protocol, chemotherapy was to be followed by an allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplant (SCT) within three months from CR. DESIGN AND METHODS: Forty-five patients with primary refractory (n=17) or first relapsed ALL (n=28) were treated with the RELAL-88 five-day induction regimen comprising vindesine, mitoxantrone, cyclophosphamide, intermediate-dose Ara-C, prednisolone and methotrexate. Twenty-eight patients received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), 16 patients from day 6 (early G-CSF group) and 12 from day 14 of therapy (delayed G-CSF group). RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (74%) achieved CR (95% CI 60-87), two died in aplasia due to infection and nine were non-responders. No pretreatment variable analyzed was predictive of the chance of obtaining CR. Recovery of neutrophils occurred at a median of 29 days from the start of chemotherapy without G-CSF and 20 days with G-CSF (p = 0.005), without differences between the early and late G-CSF groups. Non-hematologic side effects were usually well tolerated and consisted mainly of infections and mucositis. Twenty-three of 34 patients (68%) who achieved CR reached the planned SCT (nine autologous and 14 allogeneic). The median overall survival was 5.7 months, and the median disease-free survival for those achieving CR was 4.6 months. Of the variables analyzed for their influence on overall survival among the 34 patients who achieved CR, only the availability of an HLA-compatible sibling was associated with a prolonged survival (p = 0.03). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The RELAL-88 intensive salvage regimen produces a very high rate of CR in poor-risk adult ALL. Non-hematologic toxicities were tolerable, and most eligible patients could undergo the planned SCT. G-CSF significantly shortened the period of neutropenia by about eight days, irrespective of whether it was started early or late after chemotherapy. However, as with other currently available salvage therapies, remissions were short-lived, and more effective post-remission treatment strategies are needed. In our experience, only allogeneic SCT offered the chance of long-term survival.","['Martino, R', 'Bellido, M', 'Brunet, S', 'Altes, A', 'Sureda, A', 'Guardia, R', 'Aventin, A', 'Nomdedeu, J F', 'Domingo-Albos, A', 'Sierra, J']","['Martino R', 'Bellido M', 'Brunet S', 'Altes A', 'Sureda A', 'Guardia R', 'Aventin A', 'Nomdedeu JF', 'Domingo-Albos A', 'Sierra J']","[""Servei d'Hematologia Clinica, Hospital de Sant Pau, Av.

These metabolites appear to be involved in various cellular actions including cell proliferation, migration and regulation of enzyme activities such as phospholipases and kinases. In view of the diversity of biological effects of these hydroxy fatty acids, it seems likely that multiple mechanisms are involved. Previous reports showed that 15(S)-HETE inhibited the 5-lipoxygenase in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cell homogenates and established the presence of specific cellular HETE binding sites in these and other cells. The present study used 15(S)-HETE biotin hydrazide and 15(S)-HETE biotin pentyl amide as probes to identify membrane target proteins present in RBL-1 cells that specifically interact with HETEs and HODEs. Two membrane-associated proteins, with apparent molecular weights of 43 and 58 kDa, were identified that specifically interact with these probes and competition experiments indicated that 13(S)-HODE and 15(S)-HETE were the most effective competitors for the hydrazide probe, followed in decreasing effectiveness by 5(S)-HETE, arachidonic acid, 15(R)-HETE, stearic acid and 12(S)-HHT, a cyclooxygenase product. The two proteins were isolated and microsequencing analysis established their identities as actin and the alpha-subunit of mitochondrial ATP synthase, respectively. In vitro binding studies confirmed that purified actin is a potential 15-HETE binding protein. Subcellular cytosolic fractions exhibited fewer protein-probe complexes than membrane fractions. The association of HETEs and HODEs with these cytoskeletal and mitochondrial proteins, respectively, represents a new development in the potential actions of these hydroxy fatty acids.","['Kang, L T', 'Phillips, T M', 'Vanderhoek, J Y']","['Kang LT', 'Phillips TM', 'Vanderhoek JY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The George Washington University Medical Center, 2300 Eye Street, NW, Washington, DC 20037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,,"['Actins/chemistry', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Biotin/analogs & derivatives/chemistry', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*chemistry', 'Lipoxygenase/*chemistry', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Probes/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proton-Translocating ATPases/chemistry', 'Rats', 'Subcellular Fractions/*chemistry', 'Tritium']",1999/06/15 00:00,1999/06/15 00:01,['1999/06/15 00:00'],"['1999/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1999 Jun 10;1438(3):388-98. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4838(99)00100-4.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Probes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '66640-86-6 (biotin hydrazide)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '73945-47-8 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 3.6.3.14 (Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",,,"['S0167-4838(99)00100-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4838(99)00100-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecules include both positive and negative regulators of cell death and act by selective dimerization that results in permissive or inhibitory effects on a cascade of cellular events, including mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, stimulation of cysteine protease activity and subsequent cellular deterioration. Here, we have characterized the expression of the cell death agonist, Bad, in the postnatal rat retina and forebrain. Isolation, subsequent amplification by RT-PCR and DNA sequence analysis revealed that retinal Bad was identical to Bad expressed in the developing and adult rat brain. Using a polyclonal antibody to Bad, we determined that, in the retina, on the day of birth (postnatal day-0, PND-0) Bad immunoreactivity was expressed primarily by retinal ganglion cells, some cells in the inner neuroblastic layer (NBL) and an indistinct plexus of processes in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). On PND-7, Bad immunoreactivity was observed in most cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL), numerous cells scattered throughout the inner nuclear layer (INL), a lightly stained IPL and in a distinct band of immunostained fibers in the forming outer plexiform layer (OPL). By PND-15, Bad immunoreactivity was present in cells in the GCL, in some cells in the proximal INL and in horizontal cell processes in the OPL. The IPL was only faintly labeled. In the adult retina, specific Bad immunostaining was confined to large cells in the ganglion cell layer (presumed ganglion cells), occasional lightly stained horizontal cells and their processes in the OPL and to occasional small, lightly stained cells in the proximal INL (presumed amacrine cells) and GCL (presumed displaced amacrine cells). Again, the interposed IPL was faintly labeled. In the brain, Bad immunoreactive cells were scattered throughout the forebrain parenchyma but were particularly concentrated in neurons of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and amygdala. Bad immunoreactivity was heaviest in these cells at PND-7, distinctly weaker at PND-10 and absent by PND-24. At all time points examined, Bad immunoreactivity was present in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, as previously reported in the adult rat brain. These data suggest that Bad is transiently expressed by various cell types in the perinatal retina, particularly ganglion cells, and in discrete forebrain regions. In the context of corroborative observations, Bad expression may be regulated in response to acute ischemia and may act as a control point for retinal neuronal apoptosis.","['Rickman, D W', 'Nacke, R E', 'Bowes Rickman, C']","['Rickman DW', 'Nacke RE', 'Bowes Rickman C']","['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, University of Iowa, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA 52242, USA. dennis-rickman@uiowa.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Brain research.

In the present study, we examined the synergistic effects of BDNF and CNTF on the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons cultured from postnatal 2-week-old (P2w) rats. Although BDNF is well-known to promote the survival of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in P2w culture, CNTF had little effect on the survival of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive neurons and did not increase ChAT activity in the culture. However, CNTF enhanced BDNF-mediated promotion of cell survival of cholinergic neurons when added concomitantly. BDNF alone induced only a three-fold increase in ChAT activity in control cultures, but the concomitant addition of CNTF resulted in an eight-fold increase. CNTF did not enhance BDNF-mediated cell survival of total neurons from the basal forebrain, hippocampus or cerebellum, suggesting that the synergistic effects of CNTF on the BDNF-mediated increase of viability might be strong in basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. CNTF also enhanced the neurotrophin-4/5-mediated increase of ChAT activity, but not the nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated one. Furthermore, the BDNF-mediated increase was also enhanced by leukemia inhibitory factor but not by interleukin-6. Similar synergistic pattern between neurotrophins and cytokines were also observed in the induction of ChAT activity in embryonic basal forebrain culture. These results suggest that TrkB, a functional high-affinity receptor of BDNF and NT-4/5, and LIFR beta, a receptor component contained in CNTF and LIF receptor complex, might be involved in the observed synergistic effects.","['Hashimoto, Y', 'Abiru, Y', 'Nishio, C', 'Hatanaka, H']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Abiru Y', 'Nishio C', 'Hatanaka H']","['Division of Protein Biosynthesis, Institute for Protein Research, Osaka University, 3-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,Brain research.

The first antibody to undergo ""humanisation"", CAMPATH-1H, permits treatment with limited patient anti-globulin response. It recognises the CD52 antigen which is a small glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI)-anchored protein expressed on lymphocytes and mediates cell depletion. We present the 1.9 A structure of the CAMPATH-1H Fab complexed [corrected] with an analogue of the antigenic determinant of CD52. Analysis of the CAMPATH-1H binding site reveals that in contrast to most antibodies CDR L3 plays a dominant role in antigen binding. Furthermore CDR H3, which is essential for effective antigen recognition in most antibodies, participates in only two main-chain interactions in CAMPATH-1H. The CAMPATH-1H binding site is highly basic; ionic interaction with the enthanolamine phosphate of the CD52 GPI anchor has long been hypothesised to be important in antigen binding. The structure reveals a number of important specific ionic interactions, including Lys53H but not Lys52bH as had previously been suggested. Prolonged treatment with CAMPATH-1H can lead to patient anti-idiotype responses which may be exacerbated by the unusually high number of basic residues in the antibody. This suggests that a strategy where redundant basic residues are replaced with neutral counterparts may be effective in further reducing the immunogenicity of this versatile and widely used antibody.","['James, L C', 'Hale, G', 'Waldmann, H', 'Bloomer, A C']","['James LC', 'Hale G', 'Waldmann H', 'Bloomer AC']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Hills Road, Cambridge, CB2 2QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,IM,['J Mol Biol 1999 Oct 8;292(5):1161.

Human leukemia HL60 cells exposed to 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) displayed monocytic phenotype and increased Cdk5 kinase activity. An analog of 1,25D3 which does not induce differentiation failed to upregulate Cdk5, and 1,25D3-resistant cells had reduced Cdk5 activity.

Here we provide evidence that arsenic compounds may act on mitochondria to induce apoptosis. Arsenite induces apoptosis accompanied by a loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta Psim). Inhibition of caspases prevents the arsenite-induced nuclear DNA loss, but has no effect on the Delta Psim dissipation and cytolysis induced by arsenite. In contrast, Bcl-2 expression induced by gene transfer prevents all hallmarks of arsenite-induced cell death, including the Delta Psim collapse. PK11195, a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, neutralizes this Bcl-2 effect. Mitochondria are required in a cell-free system to mediate arsenite-induced nuclear apoptosis. Arsenite causes the release of an apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. This effect is prevented by the permeability transition (PT) pore inhibitor cyclosporin A, as well as by Bcl-2, which is known to function as an endogenous PT pore antagonist. Arsenite also opens the purified, reconstituted PT pore in vitro in a cyclosporin A- and Bcl-2-inhibitible fashion. Altogether these data suggest that arsenite can induce apoptosis via a direct effect on the mitochondrial PT pore.","['Larochette, N', 'Decaudin, D', 'Jacotot, E', 'Brenner, C', 'Marzo, I', 'Susin, S A', 'Zamzami, N', 'Xie, Z', 'Reed, J', 'Kroemer, G']","['Larochette N', 'Decaudin D', 'Jacotot E', 'Brenner C', 'Marzo I', 'Susin SA', 'Zamzami N', 'Xie Z', 'Reed J', 'Kroemer G']","['Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Unite Propre de Recherche 420, 19 rue Guy Moquet, Villejuif, F-94801, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'U937 Cells']",1999/06/15 00:00,1999/06/15 00:01,['1999/06/15 00:00'],"['1999/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Jun 15;249(2):413-21. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4519.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)']",,,"['10.1006/excr.1999.4519 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(99)94519-6 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combinations of RA with 1,25-(OH)2D3 interact to produce synergistic differentiation of WEHI-3B D- cells. To determine factors involved in the synergistic interaction, expression of the 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptor (VDR) and retinoid receptors, RARalpha and RXRalpha, was measured. No VDR was detected in untreated WEHI-3B D- cells; however, RA and 1,25-(OH)2D3 when used as single agents caused a slight induction of the VDR and in combination produced a marked increase in the VDR. In contrast, no changes in RARalpha and RXRalpha were initiated by these compounds. An RAR-selective agonist combined with 1,25-(OH)2D3 produced synergistic differentiation of WEHI-3B D- cells, whereas an RXR-selective agonist did not. To gain information on the role of the VDR in the synergistic interaction, the VDR gene was transferred into WEHI-3B D+ cells, in which no VDR was detected and no synergism was produced. Expression of the VDR conferred differentiation responsiveness to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in WEHI-3B D+ cells. These findings suggest that (a) induction of VDR expression is a key component in the synergistic differentiation induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 and RA and (b) RAR and not RXR must be activated for enhanced induction of the VDR and for the synergistic differentiation produced by RA and 1, 25-(OH)2D3.","['Li, J', 'Finch, R A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Li J', 'Finch RA', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, Connecticut, 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*physiology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/15 00:00,1999/06/15 00:01,['1999/06/15 00:00'],"['1999/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1999 Jun 15;249(2):279-90. doi: 10.1006/excr.1999.4475.,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,"['10.1006/excr.1999.4475 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(99)94475-0 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cell lines expressed these transcripts at consistent levels and hLIF-M was generally the predominant LIF transcript in these cells. This expression pattern was characteristic of EC cells since variable independently regulated expression of these transcripts was evident in other cell lines. Overexpression analysis demonstrated that each alternate hLIF transcript generated different levels of extracellular LIF activity as a consequence of the translation of distinct but partially overlapping sets of proteins. Secreted LIF proteins translated from alternate initiation codons were expressed from the hLIF-D and hLIF-M transcripts. Intracellular, potentially cell-autonomous, proteins were encoded by the hLIF-M and hLIF-T transcripts.

A biopsy showed that the latter was characterized by large cells, sclerosis, and compartmentalization. The neoplastic elements expressed CD45, CD20, CD79a and, partially, CD30, whereas they were negative for CD3, epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratins. Surprisingly, they displayed a clear-cut positivity for beta-hCG. The remaining oncofetal markers applied (PLAP and alpha1-fetoprotein) were negative. Electron microscopy demonstrated the presence of numerous nuclear pockets and the lack of intercellular junctions.

OBJECTIVE: We characterize the clinical and histopathologic spectrum of specific cutaneous manifestations in acute (AML) and chronic (CML) myelogenous leukemia, ascertain further diagnostic criteria, and examine current prognosis. METHODS: Thirty-six lesions of specific cutaneous infiltrates from 26 patients with myelogenous leukemia (AML: 17 patients; M:F = 1:2.4; mean age: 52.6 years; AML-French-American-British [FAB] classification subtypes:M1 = 1, M2 = 3, M4 = 8, M5 = 5. CML = 9 patients; M:F = 4.5:1; mean age: 60.6 years) were retrospectively collected for the study. RESULTS: Cutaneous manifestations presented as solitary or multiple reddish to violaceous papules, plaques, and nodules (17 lesions), or as a generalized erythematous maculopapular eruption (9 lesions). Concurrent extramedullary involvement in other peripheral sites (eg, gums, pharynx, orbits) was observed in 10 patients. Histopathologically, lesions revealed nodular/diffuse infiltrates, often with perivascular and periadnexal accentuation, sparing of the upper papillary dermis, and prominent single arraying of neoplastic cells between collagen bundles. Extension to the subcutis was noted in all deep biopsy specimens (26 lesions). Cytomorphologically, medium to large-sized mononuclear cells (myeloblasts and atypical myelocytes) predominated in AML-M1 and M2, whereas M4 and M5 mainly showed small, medium-sized, or large mononuclear cells with slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm and indented, bi-lobular, or kidney-shaped nuclei (atypical monocytoid cells). In CML, either a variable mixture of mature and immature cells of the granulocytic series (myelocytes, metamyelocytes, eosinophilic metamyelocytes, and neutrophils) or a rather monomorphous infiltrate of mononuclear cells were found. Staining for naphthol AS-D chloroacetate-esterase (NASD) was positive in 24 of 36 lesions (66.6%; AML: 16; CML: 8). Immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin sections using a large panel of antibodies (16 lesions: AML: 13; CML: 3) showed strong reactivity for LCA (CD45), lysozyme, myeloperoxidase (MPD), LN2 (CD74), HLA-DR, and MT1 (CD43) in the majority of cases, and variable staining for monocyte/macrophage markers (KP1/CD68, PGM1/CD68, Mac387, Ki-M1p). The neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) marker CD56 was reactive in 2 cases of CML, but negative in all cases of AML. MIB1(Ki67) stained 20% to 80% of neoplastic cells. CD34, CD15, CD20, and CD3 were negative in all cases. No correlation between histochemical/immunohistochemical features with type of leukemia or FAB-subtype of AML was observed. All patients with CML and AML with adequate follow-up died within 24 months after onset of skin lesions (mean survival, AML: 7.6 months; CML: 9.4 months). CONCLUSION: Specific cutaneous lesions in AML and CML show distinctive clinicopathologic features that allow diagnosis in most cases. Immunohistochemistry on routinely fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections provides useful adjunctive information. Simultaneous expression of lysozyme, MPD, CD45, CD43, and CD74 militates in favor of a diagnosis of specific cutaneous infiltrate of myelogenous leukemia. Pitfalls in immunohistologic diagnosis mainly include lack of expression of some myeloid markers (lysozyme, MPD), and aberrant expression of T-cell markers (eg, CD45RO). Regardless of type of myelogenous leukemia, onset of specific skin manifestations correlates with an aggressive course and short survival.","['Kaddu, S', 'Zenahlik, P', 'Beham-Schmid, C', 'Kerl, H', 'Cerroni, L']","['Kaddu S', 'Zenahlik P', 'Beham-Schmid C', 'Kerl H', 'Cerroni L']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Graz, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', '*Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin/*pathology']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1999 Jun;40(6 Pt 1):966-78. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(99)70086-1.,,,,"['S0190-9622(99)70086-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(99)70086-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene analysis showed no rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain or T cell receptor beta and gamma genes. Ultrastructurally, the tumor cells exhibited a few intracytoplasmic electron-dense granules and well-developed rough endoplasmic reticulum with an occasional whorling arrangement.

In 28 of 29 examined patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in two of three patients with hybrid leukemia we found urokinase receptor (uPAR) on the cell surface, while most (7/9) samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were negative for uPAR. The plasma mean value for soluble uPAR (suPAR) was significantly elevated in patients with AML and ALL. In AML the highest values were found in patients who had residual disease after several cycles of chemotherapy. Compared to controls the uPA antigen levels in patient plasmas were elevated and decreased along with uPAR during treatment. Our results suggest that cell surface uPAR may be a useful marker for leukemia classification and in our material a high level of plasma suPAR correlated with resistance to chemotherapy in AML.","['Mustjoki, S', 'Alitalo, R', 'Stephens, R W', 'Vaheri, A']","['Mustjoki S', 'Alitalo R', 'Stephens RW', 'Vaheri A']","['Department of Virology, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Finland.

In T cells, expression of the Maloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV)-based retroviral vectors was high in activated cells but low in resting cells. Addition of the IFN-SAR sequence enhanced vector expression 2- to 10-fold, and the effect was particularly pronounced in resting T cells. In CD33+CD14+CD4+ monocyte-macrophages derived from transduced hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) in vitro, the IFN-SAR enhanced vector expression three- to sixfold. We have used the IFN-SAR-containing vectors to express the RevM10 gene, a trans-dominant mutant of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) rev gene. Compared with a standard retroviral vector, the IFN-SAR-containing vector was significantly (p < 0.01) more potent at inhibiting HIV-1 replication in infected CD4+ peripheral blood lymphocytes. In monocytes, however, addition of the IFN-SAR did not significantly improve antiviral efficacy. To understand better the reason for the strong effect of the SAR on antiviral efficacy in T cells we have studied the expression of HIV, Mo-MuLV, and Mo-MuLV + SAR vectors in resting and activated cells. While the expression of all three vectors was lower in resting compared with activated cells, the kinetics of the decrease in expression were fastest for the Mo-MuLV vector, followed by the HIV vector and then the Mo-MuLV + SAR vector. Thus, higher level expression of the Mo-MuLV + SAR vector relative to wild-type HIV at all stages of T cell activation is the most likely explanation for the strong antiviral efficacy. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of the IFN-SAR sequence for achieving high-level retroviral vector expression in lymphoid and myeloid hematopoietic cells.","['Auten, J', 'Agarwal, M', 'Chen, J', 'Sutton, R', 'Plavec, I']","['Auten J', 'Agarwal M', 'Chen J', 'Sutton R', 'Plavec I']","['SyStemix, Inc., Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', '*CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/virology', '*CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, rev/genetics', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/*genetics', 'Kinetics', '*Macrophages/cytology/virology', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Monocytes/cytology/virology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1999 May 20;10(8):1389-99. doi: 10.1089/10430349950018058.,"['0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",,,['10.1089/10430349950018058 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXEGESIS: We report the first case of Pseudallescheria boydii hip arthritis in a patient treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In vitro susceptibility testing showed that the strain was resistant to amphotericin B, fluorocytosine and nystatin, but susceptible to itraconazole. The patient received oral itraconazole (600 mg/day) and clinical symptoms initially resolved. Two months later, after a course of chemotherapy and high-dose steroids while receiving oral itraconazole treatment, the patient developed fever, skin lesions and disseminated lung infiltrates due to Pseudallescheria boydii and finally died.

Patients with HAM/TSP have a vigorous immune response to HTLV-I, and it has been widely suggested that this immune response, particularly the HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response, causes the tissue damage that is seen in HAM/TSP. In this paper we summarize recent evidence that a strong CTL response to HTLV-I does in fact protect against HAM/TSP by reducing the proviral load of HTLV-I. We conclude that HTLV-I is persistently replicating at a high level, despite the relative constancy of its genome sequence. These results imply that antiretroviral drugs could reduce the risk of HAM/TSP by reducing the viral load, and that an effective anti-HTLV-I vaccine should elicit a strong CTL response to the virus. The dynamic nature of the infection also has implications for the epidemiology and the evolution of HTLV-I.","['Bangham, C R', 'Hall, S E', 'Jeffery, K J', 'Vine, A M', 'Witkover, A', 'Nowak, M A', 'Wodarz, D', 'Usuku, K', 'Osame, M']","['Bangham CR', 'Hall SE', 'Jeffery KJ', 'Vine AM', 'Witkover A', 'Nowak MA', 'Wodarz D', 'Usuku K', 'Osame M']","['Department of Immunology, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK. c.bangham@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The aim of the study was to analyze the presenting features, the evolutive course, and the survival of older persons with Ph-positive CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four individuals > 65 years diagnosed with Ph-positive CML in a single centre were compared with 292 younger patients. RESULTS: Comparison of the presenting features of chronic phase Ph-positive CML patients yielded the following significant differences: predominance of female sex (15 males/29 females versus 155/137; p = 0.02), higher proportion of patients with anaemic syndrome (12% versus 2%; p = 0.001), lower frequency of splenomegaly (41% versus 68%; p = 0.001), and higher serum levels of uric acid (p = 0.0006) in the older group. Although the latter patients survived significantly less (median survival 36.6 months, 95% CI: 27-46.2, versus 57.6 months, 95%: 51.2-64.1; p = 0.004), 9 of the 33 deaths registered in this group (27%) occurred in the chronic phase of CML, versus 15 (9%) of the 166 deaths in the younger group (p = 0.003). When chronic phase deaths were excluded and leukaemia-related deaths only considered (i.e., those occurring in the BC or the accelerated phase of CML), old patients still had a shorter survival but the difference was no longer significant. CONCLUSIONS: Ph-positive CML features are essentially the same in older and young individuals, since most of the differences observed are attributable rather to the patients' advanced age than to the leukaemia itself.","['Hernandez-Boluda, J C', 'Cervantes, F', 'Camos, M', 'Costa, D', 'Rafel, M', 'Montserrat, E']","['Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Cervantes F', 'Camos M', 'Costa D', 'Rafel M', 'Montserrat E']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinic i Provincial, Barcelona.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']","Leucemia mieloide cronica cromosoma Filadelfia positivo en sujetos de edad avanzada: caracteristicas iniciales, historia natural y supervivencia.",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,,"['Aged', 'Catchment Area, Health', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Male', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Survival Rate']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 1999 May 1;112(15):565-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies using both molecular and cloning approaches, and in vitro systems have identified a class of highly specific proteases, termed caspases, that appear to have an important role in apoptotic execution. Caspases are synthesized as precursor molecules that require processing at specific aspartate residues to produce the active enzyme which in turn leads to the cleavage of various death substrates that lead to morphological changes typical of apoptosis. This review discusses caspases, their inhibitors and regulators. Since cytotoxic drugs used in chemotherapy of leukemia's and solid tumors cause apoptosis in target cells, elucidating the consequences of proteolytic activity occupies a central role for understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis which can help us to use the caspase inhibitors as targets of therapy.","['Khanna, N', 'Singh, N']","['Khanna N', 'Singh N']","['Department of Biochemistry, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,India,Indian J Physiol Pharmacol,Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0374707,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology/pathology']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Physiol Pharmacol. 1999 Apr;43(2):151-9.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of selenite or selenodiglutathione resulted in concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, measured by lactate dehydrogenase leakage assay, and by tetrazolium salt reduction assay. Selenodiglutathione has been shown to exert more cytotoxic effect than selenite in both assay systems. Time-course study of cellular selenium uptake suggests that the higher cytotoxicity of selenodiglutathione be largely due to faster and greater selenium uptake rate. Treatment with selenite or selenodiglutathione also induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, as detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by DNA fragmentation assay. The dose-response data of apoptosis induced by selenite or selenodiglutathione were similar to those of cytotoxicity, implicating a relationship between the induction of apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Zn, which is a well-known inhibitor of apoptosis, dose-dependently blocked not only the induction of apoptosis, but also the membrane damage induced by selenium, corroborating this hypothesis. It was noted that the inhibition of apoptosis by Zn exerted little protective effect on cytotoxicity at higher concentrations of selenium, compared with a perfect protective effect at low concentration of selenium. These results suggest that cytotoxicity induced by selenium may be partially correlated with apoptosis.","['Cho, D Y', 'Jung, U', 'Chung, A S']","['Cho DY', 'Jung U', 'Chung AS']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Organoselenium Compounds/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Selenite/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1999 May;47(5):781-93. doi: 10.1080/15216549900201873.,"['0 (Organoselenium Compounds)', '33944-90-0 (selenodiglutathione)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",,,['10.1080/15216549900201873 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of our study is to analyze the behavior of nutritional assessment parameters, the lipid metabolism, the number of days of mucositis, the number of infections, the number of days to recovery, and the number of hospitalization days when using different parenteral nutrition solutions: 22.5% and 45% branched chain amino acid solutions, and lipid solutions with long chain triglycerides (LCT), vs. medium chain triglycerides (MCT). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have carried out a prospective, randomized study in patients who underwent a BMT who received parenteral nutrition. The supply of nitrogen was 1.5 +/- 0.3 g of AA/kg/day (either in standard solution or in a 45% branched chain AA solution). The caloric supply was similar in all the groups, with a proportion of 60% coming from carbohydrates and 40% from lipids, either LCT or MCT/LCT. The nutritional assessment parameters were studied, as well as of the lipid metabolism, and also clinical evolutive data: number of days of mucositis, number of days of PN, number of days hospitalized, number of infections, rate of infection density. All the data were measured and/or quantified 4 times: pretransplant, on day--of the transplant, and after 7 and 14 days after the transplant. RESULTS: 62 patients were studied. Group A: 19 patients treated with 22.5% branched chain amino acids + 20% LCT. Group B: 26 patients (45% branched chain amino acids + 20% LCT). Group C: 17 patients, (45% branched chain amino acids + 20% MCT/LCT). There is a quicker recover of the marrow in groups B + C: 14.4 vs. 11.7 and 11.1, with a p < 0.05. The nitrogen balance improves significantly in groups B and C (p < 0.05). The retinol-binding protein increases significantly from day 0 to day 7 (p < 0.01) in the LCT group (Group B). The phospholipids decrease in group B after one day (p < 0.05), and after the 7th day (p < 0.05). The triglycerides increase in group C between 7 and 14 days. The LDL/HDL quotient increases in group B after 14 days (p < 0.05). The triglycerides increase in group C between 7 and 14 days. The LDL/HDL quotient will increase in the B group after 14 days (p < 0.05). There are no differences in the number of days of mucositis, the total number of infections, the number of infections per 100 days of hospitalization, or in the number of hospitalization days. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who are given parenteral nutrition in the period immediately after the BMT, we found an improvement in the catabolic metabolism parameters when using a solution with a high proportion of branched chain amino acids (45%) and a smaller alteration of the metabolism of the plasmatic lipoproteins when we use MCT/LCT enriched solutions.","['Jimenez Jimenez, F J', 'Ortiz Leyba, C', 'Garcia Garmendia, J L', 'Garnacho Montero, J', 'Rodriguez Fernandez, J M', 'Espigado Tocino, I']","['Jimenez Jimenez FJ', 'Ortiz Leyba C', 'Garcia Garmendia JL', 'Garnacho Montero J', 'Rodriguez Fernandez JM', 'Espigado Tocino I']","['Servicio de Medicina Intensiva, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio de Sevilla, Espana.']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Review']","Estudio prospectivo comparativo de diferentes soluciones de aminoacidos y lipidos, en la nutricion parenteral de pacientes sometidos a trasplante de medula osea.",Spain,Nutr Hosp,Nutricion hospitalaria,9100365,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Amino Acids/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Lipids/*administration & dosage', 'Lymphoma/*surgery', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*surgery', '*Parenteral Nutrition', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nutr Hosp. 1999 Mar-Apr;14(2):57-66.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Lipids)']",,,,,,,47,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two of them, which occurred in a 75-year-old man suffering from ischemic cardiopathy and in an 8-year-old girl suffering from acute leukemia, had fatal outcomes. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 6 was isolated from both patients and from hot-water samples taken at different sites in the hospital. These facts led us to consider the possibility that a single clone of L. pneumophila serogroup 6 had persisted in the hospital environment for 8 years and had caused sporadic infections. Comparison of clinical and environmental strains by monoclonal subtyping, macrorestriction analysis (MRA), and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) showed that the strains were clustered into three different epidemiological types, of which only two types caused infection. An excellent correspondence between the MRA and AP-PCR results was observed, with both techniques having high discriminatory powers. However, it was not possible to differentiate the isolates by means of ribotyping and analysis of rrn operon polymorphism. Environmental strains that antigenically and chromosomally matched the infecting organism were present at the time of infection in hot-water samples taken from the ward where the patients had stayed.

The gene encoding the RT was designed to start at its 5' end next to the last codon of the mature viral protease, namely the amino terminus of the RT matches the last 26 codons of the pro gene and is coded for by the pro reading frame. The RT sequence extends into the pol gene, utilizing the pol reading frame after overcoming the stop codon by adding an extra nucleotide (thus imitating the naturally occurring frameshift event). Hence we have generated a transframe polypeptide that is a 584-residues-long protein (see Rice, Stephens, Burny, and Gilden (1985) Virology 142, 357-377). This protein was partially purified after adding a six-histidine tag and studied biochemically testing a variety of parameters. The enzyme exhibits all activities typical of RTs, i.e., both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase as well as a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity. Unlike most RTs, the BLV RT is enzymatically active as a monomer even after binding a DNA substrate. The enzyme shows a preference for Mg2+ over Mn2+ in both its DNA polymerase and RNase H activities. BLV RT is relatively resistant to nucleoside triphosphate analogues, which are known to be potent inhibitors of other RTs such as that of HIV.","['Perach, M', 'Hizi, A']","['Perach M', 'Hizi A']","['Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, 69978, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,,"['Animals', 'Catalysis', 'Cattle', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/enzymology/*genetics', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",1999/06/12 00:00,1999/06/12 00:01,['1999/06/12 00:00'],"['1999/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1999 Jun 20;259(1):176-89. doi: 10.1006/viro.1999.9761.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,"['10.1006/viro.1999.9761 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(99)99761-1 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sequence of the primer binding site coincides with that of a negatively acting cis element that mediates transcriptional silencing of murine leukemia virus (MLV) in undifferentiated embryonic cells. In this study we test whether SL3-3 MLV can replicate stably using tRNA primers other than the cognate tRNAPro and analyze the effect of altering the primer binding site sequence to match the 3' end of tRNA1Gln, tRNA3Lys, or tRNA1,2Arg in a mouse pathogenicity model. Contrary to findings from cell culture studies of primer binding site-modified human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and avian retroviruses, our findings were that SL3-3 MLV may stably and efficiently replicate with tRNA primers other than tRNAPro. Although lymphoma induction of the SL3-3 Lys3 mutant was significantly delayed relative to that of the wild-type virus, molecular tumor analysis indicated that all the primer binding site-modified viruses induce T-cell lymphomas similar to those induced by the wild-type virus in terms of frequencies of genomic rearrangements within the T-cell receptor beta-chain, the immunoglobulin kappa light chain, and the c-myc locus. Whereas none of the mutants were found to revert to tRNAPro primer utilization, in two tumors resulting from the injection of the SL3-3 Lys3 mutant the primer binding site was altered to match that of a new primer species, tRNA1,2Lys. In addition, recombination with endogenous viruses resulting in the generation of recombinant viruses carrying a glutamine primer binding site was detected in the majority of the tumors induced by the SL3-3 Lys3 mutant as well as in two tumors induced by wild-type SL3-3 and the SL3-3 Arg1,2 mutant.","['Lund, A H', 'Schmidt, J', 'Luz, A', 'Sorensen, A B', 'Duch, M', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Lund AH', 'Schmidt J', 'Luz A', 'Sorensen AB', 'Duch M', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, DK-8000 Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', '*RNA', 'RNA, Transfer', 'RNA, Transfer, Arg', 'RNA, Transfer, Gln', 'RNA, Transfer, Lys', 'RNA, Viral', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', '*Virus Replication']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):6117-22. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.6117-6122.1999.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Arg)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Gln)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Lys)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.6117-6122.1999 [doi]'],PMC112678,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When previously established cell lines, F344-S1 and TARS-1, but not TART-1 or W7TM-1, were inoculated, systemic multiple tumor development was observed in adult nude (nu/nu) rats. FPM1 cells, newly established from a heterozygous (nu/+) rat syngeneic to nu/nu rats, caused transient tumors only at the injection site in adult nu/nu rats, but could progressively grow in newborn nu/nu rats and metastasize in lymph nodes. The derivative cell line (FPM1-V1AX) serially passed through newborn nu/nu rats acquired the potency to grow in adult nu/nu rats. These results indicated that only some with additional changes but not all of the in vitro HTLV-1-immortalized cell lines possessed in vivo tumorigenicity. Using the syngeneic system, we further showed the inhibition of tumor development by transferring splenic T cells from immunized rats, suggesting the involvement of T cells in the regression of tumors. This novel and reproducible nude rat model of human ATL would be useful for investigation of leukemogenesis and antitumor immune responses in HTLV-1 infection.","['Ohashi, T', 'Hanabuchi, S', 'Kato, H', 'Koya, Y', 'Takemura, F', 'Hirokawa, K', 'Yoshiki, T', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Fujii, M', 'Kannagi, M']","['Ohashi T', 'Hanabuchi S', 'Kato H', 'Koya Y', 'Takemura F', 'Hirokawa K', 'Yoshiki T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Fujii M', 'Kannagi M']","['Department of Immunotherapeutics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Medical Research Division, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunization', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/pathology/*therapy/virology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Rats, Nude', 'Spleen']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):6031-40. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.6031-6040.1999.,,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.6031-6040.1999 [doi]'],PMC112664,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy, it was demonstrated that the surface envelope protein (SU) gp70 of MoMuLV virions began to appear inside cells 5 min after virus binding and was colocalized with MCAT-1-GFP. However, clathrin was not colocalized with MCAT-1-GFP, suggesting that MoMuLV entry, mediated by MCAT-1, does not involve clathrin. Double immunofluorescence labeling of SU and clathrin in 293 cells expressing untagged receptor (293/MCAT-1) gave the same results, i.e., SU and clathrin did not colocalize. In addition, we examined the transduction ability of MoMuLV vector on HeLa cells overexpressing the dominant-negative GTPase mutant of dynamin (K44A). HeLa cells overexpressing mutant dynamin have a severe block in endocytosis by the clathrin-coated-pit pathway. No significant titer difference was observed when MoMuLV vector was tranduced into HeLa cells overexpressing either wild-type or mutant dynamin, while the transduction ability of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein pseudotyped vector into HeLa cells overexpressing mutant dynamin was decreased significantly.

The site(s) of MCF recombinant generation in the animal during Moloney MuLV (M-MuLV) infection is unknown, and the exact roles of MCF viruses in disease induction remain unclear. Previous comparative studies between M-MuLV and an enhancer variant, Mo+PyF101 MuLV, suggested that MCF generation or early propagation might take place in the bone marrow under conditions of efficient leukemogenesis. Moreover, M-MuLV induces disease efficiently following both intraperitoneal (i.p.) and subcutaneous (s.c.) inoculation but leukemogenicity by Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV is efficient following i.p. inoculation but attenuated upon s. c. inoculation. Time course studies of MCF recombinant appearance in the bone marrow, spleen, and thymus of wild-type and Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV i.p.- and s.c.-inoculated mice were carried out by performing focal immunofluorescence assays. Both the route of inoculation and the presence of the PyF101 enhancer sequences affected the patterns of MCF generation or early propagation. The bone marrow was a likely site of MCF recombinant generation and/or early propagation following i.p. inoculation of M-MuLV. On the other hand, when the same virus was inoculated s.c., the primary site of MCF generation appeared to be the thymus. Also, when Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV was inoculated i.p., MCF generation appeared to occur primarily in the thymus. The time course studies indicated that MCF recombinants are not involved in preleukemic changes such as splenic hyperplasia. On the other hand, MCFs were detected in tumors from Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV s. c.-inoculated mice even though they were largely undetectable at preleukemic times. These results support a role for MCF recombinants late in disease induction.","['Lander, J K', 'Chesebro, B', 'Fan, H']","['Lander JK', 'Chesebro B', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry and Cancer Research Institute, University of California, Irvine, California 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genetic Variation', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Proviruses', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):5671-80. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.5671-5680.1999.,,,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.5671-5680.1999 [doi]'],PMC112626,,"['T32 CA 09054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA032455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM 07134/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, they call into question how many mature envelope protein subunits are required to complete virus entry, suggesting that a very few molecules suffice. The failure of host cell proteases to cleave these mutant proteins, whose substitutions are distal to the actual site of cleavage, suggests that the envelope precursor is misfolded, sequestering the cleavage site. In agreement with this, all cleavage mutant proteins exhibited significant losses of receptor binding, suggesting that these residues play roles in proper envelope protein folding. We also identified a charged residue, arginine 102, whose substitution suppressed envelope cleavage and allowed precursor incorporation but resulted in virions that were virtually noninfectious and that exhibited the greatest reduction in receptor binding. Placement of these cleavage mutations into envelope proteins of targeted retroviral vectors for human gene therapy may prevent loss of the modified surface proteins from virions, improving their infectivity and storage hardiness.","['Zavorotinskaya, T', 'Albritton, L M']","['Zavorotinskaya T', 'Albritton LM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Arginine/genetics/metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Lysine/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/*metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion', 'Virus Assembly']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):5621-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.5621-5629.1999.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.5621-5629.1999 [doi]'],PMC112620,,"['R01 AI033410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33410/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutation of the core site resulted in a significant shift in disease specificity of the Moloney virus from T-cell leukemia to erythroleukemia. We and others have since determined that a protein that binds the core site, one of the core-binding factors (CBF) is highly expressed in thymus and is essential for hematopoiesis. Here we test the hypothesis that CBF plays a critical role in mediating pathogenesis of Moloney MLV in vivo. We measured the affinity of CBF for most core sites found in MLV enhancers, introduced sites with different affinities for CBF into the Moloney MLV genome, and determined the effects of these sites on viral pathogenesis. We found a correlation between CBF affinity and the latent period of disease onset, in that Moloney MLVs with high-affinity CBF binding sites induced leukemia following a shorter latent period than viruses with lower-affinity sites. The T-cell disease specificity of Moloney MLV also appeared to correlate with the affinity of CBF for its binding site. The data support a role for CBF in determining the pathogenic properties of Moloney MLV.","['Lewis, A F', 'Stacy, T', 'Green, W R', 'Taddesse-Heath, L', 'Hartley, J W', 'Speck, N A']","['Lewis AF', 'Stacy T', 'Green WR', 'Taddesse-Heath L', 'Hartley JW', 'Speck NA']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):5535-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.5535-5547.1999.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.5535-5547.1999 [doi]'],PMC112611,,"['R01CA58343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA058343/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA075611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75611/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-AI-45203/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector completely silences beta-globin reporter genes regulated by locus control region (LCR) elements 5'HS2 to 5'HS4 in seven of eight transgenic mice. Here, we show that no single known MSCV silencer element is sufficient for complete LCR beta-globin transgene silencing. However, partial silencing of high-copy transgenes is conveyed by the MSCV direct repeat and promoter elements. The CpG methylation pattern of silenced and expressed MSCV promoter transgenes is virtually identical, demonstrating that silencing does not absolutely correlate with methylation status. Combined mutations in all four MSCV silencer elements leads to expression of beta-globin in 6 of 10 transgenic mice. The same mutations incorporated into the HSC1 retrovirus vector direct neo gene expression in 71% of transduced F9 embryonic carcinoma cells. These studies demonstrate that combined mutation of four retroviral silencer elements relieves complete silencing in most transgenic mice and transduced F9 cells and suggests that novel silencer elements remain. Enhanced expression of the HSC1 vector in primitive stem cells is well suited for blood gene therapy applications.","['Osborne, C S', 'Pasceri, P', 'Singal, R', 'Sukonnik, T', 'Ginder, G D', 'Ellis, J']","['Osborne CS', 'Pasceri P', 'Singal R', 'Sukonnik T', 'Ginder GD', 'Ellis J']","['Programs in Developmental Biology and Blood and Cancer Research, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1X8.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'DNA Methylation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/*genetics', '*Locus Control Region', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):5490-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.5490-5496.1999.,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.5490-5496.1999 [doi]'],PMC112606,,"['R37 DK029902/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-DK29902/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

S. Rhee and E. Hunter, Cell 63:77-86, 1990). Here we identify a region of 18 amino acids within the MA of MPMV that is responsible for type D-specific morphogenesis. Insertion of these 18 amino acids into the MA of type C Moloney murine leukemia virus causes it to assemble an immature capsid in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, fusion of the MPMV MA to the green fluorescent protein resulted in altered intracellular targeting and a punctate accumulation of the fusion protein in the cytoplasm. These 18 amino acids, which are necessary and sufficient to target retroviral Gag polyproteins to defined sites in the cytoplasm, appear to define a novel mammalian cytoplasmic targeting/retention signal.","['Choi, G', 'Park, S', 'Choi, B', 'Hong, S', 'Lee, J', 'Hunter, E', 'Rhee, S S']","['Choi G', 'Park S', 'Choi B', 'Hong S', 'Lee J', 'Hunter E', 'Rhee SS']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'COS Cells', 'Capsid/biosynthesis', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins', 'Mason-Pfizer monkey virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Sorting Signals/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):5431-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.5431-5437.1999.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.5431-5437.1999 [doi]'],PMC112599,,"['R01 CA027834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA027834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R39 CA27834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these functions may require association with cellular factors, the HIV-1 matrix protein (MA) was used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify MA-interacting proteins. MA was found to interact with elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1alpha), an essential component of the translation machinery that delivers aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes. EF1alpha was then shown to bind the entire HIV-1 Gag polyprotein. This interaction is mediated not only by MA, but also by the nucleocapsid domain, which provides a second, independent EF1alpha-binding site on the Gag polyprotein. EF1alpha is incorporated within HIV-1 virion membranes, where it is cleaved by the viral protease and protected from digestion by exogenously added subtilisin. The specificity of the interaction is demonstrated by the fact that EF1alpha does not bind to nonlentiviral MAs and does not associate with Moloney murine leukemia virus virions. The Gag-EF1alpha interaction appears to be mediated by RNA, in that basic residues in MA and NC are required for binding to EF1alpha, RNase disrupts the interaction, and a Gag mutant with undetectable EF1alpha-binding activity is impaired in its ability to associate with tRNA in cells. Finally, the interaction between MA and EF1alpha impairs translation in vitro, a result consistent with a previously proposed model in which inhibition of translation by the accumulation of Gag serves to release viral RNA from polysomes, permitting the RNA to be packaged into nascent virions.","['Cimarelli, A', 'Luban, J']","['Cimarelli A', 'Luban J']","['Departments of Microbiology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Capsid/genetics/*metabolism', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'HIV Protease/metabolism', 'HIV-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Primates', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proviruses', 'RNA, Transfer/metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic/metabolism', 'Subtilisins/metabolism', '*Viral Proteins', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1999 Jul;73(7):5388-401. doi: 10.1128/JVI.73.7.5388-5401.1999.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (HIV Antigens)', '0 (NCP7 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (p17 protein, Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1)', '9014-25-9 (RNA, Transfer)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Subtilisins)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (HIV Protease)']",,,['10.1128/JVI.73.7.5388-5401.1999 [doi]'],PMC112595,,"['P30 AI042848/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI041857/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI41857/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI42848/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletion analysis of the DBP protein was carried out in an effort to define the function of the conserved PAR domain. Internal deletions of the protein, i.e. removing portions of the PAR domain, resulted in a substantial loss in transactivation of a high affinity DBP reporter construct when assayed in Hep G2 cells. These same sequences conferred significant transactivation to GAL4 DNA binding domain fusion proteins, indicating that this region acts as part of an independent activation domain comprised of sequences in both the amino terminus and in the PAR domain of DBP. The coexpression of full-length expression constructs for both DBP and hepatic leukemia factor resulted in a dramatic increase in activation mediated by the GAL4-DBP fusion proteins, suggesting the involvement of a regulated coactivator in this process. DBP transactivation appears to be a p300-dependent process, as a 12 S E1A expression construct disrupted DBP-mediated transactivation, and a p300 expression vector, but not a CREB binding protein vector, was able to restore DBP transactivation. These results suggest that the PAR domain is required for DBP activation, which occurs through a regulated, p300-dependent process.","['Lamprecht, C', 'Mueller, C R']","['Lamprecht C', 'Mueller CR']","[""Department of Biochemistry and the Cancer Research Laboratories, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jun 18;274(25):17643-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.25.17643.,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DBP protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (GAL4 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.25.17643 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)72752-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The indolocarbazole compound 6-N-formylamino-12,13-dihydro-1,11-dihydroxy-13-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl)- 5H-indolo[2,3-alpha]pyrrolo-[3,4-c]carbazole-5,7(6H)-dione (NB-506) is a potent inhibitor of the religation step of topo I reaction, like camptothecin (CPT). We established a NB-506-resistant cell line from murine leukemia cell line P388. This resistant cell line, P388/F11, exhibited 73-fold higher resistance to NB-506 and 3.5-fold higher cross-resistance to CPT than the parental cell line. No induction of cleavable complex formations induced by NB-506 and CPT were detected by K-SDS precipitation assays in P388/F11 cells. Analysis of nuclear extracts from P388/F11 cells revealed that the relaxation activity of topo I was one-quarter of that of the parental cells, and that the activity was resistant to induction of DNA cleavage by these drugs. Furthermore, Western blot and Northern blot analyses showed the expression of an abnormal-sized 170-kDa topo I protein and its 6.0-kb transcript and the absence of the normal topo I protein and transcript in P388/F11 cells. Analyses of the structure of the abnormal topo I transcript by reverse transcription-PCR and direct sequencing methods revealed that a large portion of the gene from codon 21 to codon 609 was duplicated in its coding region. This internal duplication resulted in in-frame fusion and, thus, production of a partially duplicated protein of 1357 amino acids. Finally, we expressed and purified the recombinant P388/F11 topo I in a baculovirus system. P388/F11 topo I showed similar catalytic activity to wild-type topo I, but reduced sensitivities to NB-506 and CPT. These results show that the altered sensitivity of duplicated topo I is involved in the NB-506 resistance of P388/F11 cells and indicate a novel resistant mechanism which involves duplication of the topo I gene.","['Komatani, H', 'Morita, M', 'Sakaizumi, N', 'Fukasawa, K', 'Yoshida, E', 'Okura, A', 'Yoshinari, T', 'Nishimura, S']","['Komatani H', 'Morita M', 'Sakaizumi N', 'Fukasawa K', 'Yoshida E', 'Okura A', 'Yoshinari T', 'Nishimura S']","['Banyu Tsukuba Research Institute in collaboration with Merck Research Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jun 1;59(11):2701-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (NB 506)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clave et al., J. Immunother., 22: 1-6, 1999; J. Molldrem et al., Blood, 88: 2450-2457, 1996) that PR1, a human-lymphocyte-antigen (HLA)-A2.1-restricted peptide from proteinase 3, could be used to elicit CTLs from normal individuals. These CTLs showed HLA-restricted cytotoxicity and colony inhibition of myeloid leukemia cells that overexpress proteinase 3. In this study, we constructed a phycoerythrin-labeled PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer to identify PR1-specific CTLs by flow cytometry. No peripheral blood lymphocytes from three HLA-2.1+ donors stained with the tetramer, but, after 20 days in culture with weekly PR1 stimulation, 2-8% became tetramer+. Tetramer staining identified up to 40-fold more PR1-specific CTLs than were identified by limiting dilution analysis and correlated better with lysis of PR1-coated T2 cells (R2 = 0.95 versus R2 = 0.76). Tetramer+ CTLs were memory phenotype (91% CD45RO+), and most (58% CD95+) were activated. Tetramer-sorted allogeneic CTLs produced 83% lysis of HLA-A2.1+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blasts at an E:T ratio of 2.5:1, compared with 23% lysis by nonsorted CTLs, with no background lysis of HLA-A2.1+ normal cells. Cytoplasmic proteinase-3 expression was one log greater in CML blasts than in normal granulocytes. These results show that a PR1-HLA-A2 tetramer can be used to identify and select CTLs from normal donors that preferentially lyse CML cells, which could be used for leukemia-specific adoptive immunotherapy.","['Molldrem, J J', 'Lee, P P', 'Wang, C', 'Champlin, R E', 'Davis, M M']","['Molldrem JJ', 'Lee PP', 'Wang C', 'Champlin RE', 'Davis MM']","['Blood and Marrow Transplant Department, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030-4095, USA. jmolldre@notes.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Myeloblastin', 'Peptide Fragments/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Serine Endopeptidases/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 Jun 1;59(11):2675-81.,"['0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.76 (Myeloblastin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The observations were carried out in 21 patients with AML and in 53 healthy volunteers. The influence of disease on phenazone kinetics was studied before chemotherapy and the effect of anticancer drugs administration after the first cycle of chemotherapy. RESULTS: The mean phenazone half-life time was significantly shorter in patients with AML (8.79 (3.01) h) than in control group (11.08 (3.61) h) (p < 0.012). Treatment with anticancer drugs, especially with epirubicine, inhibited phenazone elimination. The mean phenazone half-life time was significantly longer (18.08 (8.80) h) and the mean metabolic clearance rate was significantly smaller (33.92 (15.40) ml/min) after chemotherapy in comparison with the initial value, before treatment (10.22 (2.90) h), (p < 0.01) (50.33 (20.29) ml/min) (p < 0.008). CONCLUSION: Our results lead to the conclusion that phenazone is an important index of hepatic metabolic capacity in patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. The evaluation of its kinetics allowed to early recognition of the presence and the degree of drug oxidizing modification. Acceleration of phenazone elimination before treatment and its inhibition after chemotherapy, particulary epirubicine, may suggest that in patients with AML elimination of the other drugs metabolized by the pathway similar to phenazone also may be changed. It should be considered in individualization of their dosage regimen.","['Wiela-Hojenska, A', 'Orzechowska-Juzwenko, K', 'Usnarska-Zubkiewicz, L', 'Kotlarek-Haus, S', 'Hurkacz, M']","['Wiela-Hojenska A', 'Orzechowska-Juzwenko K', 'Usnarska-Zubkiewicz L', 'Kotlarek-Haus S', 'Hurkacz M']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Wroclaw University of Medicine, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,IM,,"['Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antipyrine/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biomarkers', 'Biotransformation/drug effects', 'Epirubicin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Liver/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/*enzymology']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 1999 May;37(5):234-7.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', 'T3CHA1B51H (Antipyrine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A molecular analysis using laser capture microdissection.,1857-66,"Low grade B-cell lymphomas comprise several well defined, clinically and immunophenotypically distinct disease entities. Composite lymphomas showing phenotypic characteristics of more than one of these tumor subtypes in the same site are rare, and both common and separate clonal origins of the two tumor parts have been reported for cases studied by molecular methods. We describe the detailed immunohistochemical and molecular findings in three cases with features of composite low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL). All three neoplasms contained morphologically distinct but interwoven compartments of different cell types, which exhibited discordant expression of several markers, including CD5, CD10, CD43, and cyclin D1. According to their morphology and phenotypes, they were classified as mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma (Case 1), follicular lymphoma and small lymphocytic lymphoma (Case 2), and mantle cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (Case 3). PCR analysis of DNA obtained from whole tissue sections failed to reveal evidence for biclonality in any of the cases. We therefore isolated cell populations with different antigen expression patterns by laser capture microdissection and analyzed them by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangements and oncogene rearrangements. Sequence analysis revealed unrelated clonal rearrangements in each of the two tumor parts in all three cases, suggesting distinct clonal origins. In addition, Case 1 showed a bcl-2 rearrangement present only in the follicular lymphoma part. Our findings suggest that low grade B-NHL with two distinct morphological and immunophenotypic patterns in the same anatomical site are frequently biclonal. This is in keeping with current classification schemes, which recognize subtypes of low grade B-NHL as separate disease entities. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates the power of laser capture microdissection in revealing molecular microheterogeneity in complex neoplasms.","['Fend, F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, L', 'Kumar, S', 'Beaty, M W', 'Blum, L', 'Sorbara, L', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Raffeld, M']","['Fend F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L', 'Kumar S', 'Beaty MW', 'Blum L', 'Sorbara L', 'Jaffe ES', 'Raffeld M']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Clone Cells/immunology', '*Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Dissection', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1999 Jun;154(6):1857-66. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65443-0.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin alpha-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",,,"['S0002-9440(10)65443-0 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)65443-0 [doi]']",PMC1866627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete remission was achieved in 31 patients (81.6%) after a median time of 49 days of ATRA (to which chemotherapy was added at entry in 10 patients with leukocytosis). Thirty patients received the planned consolidation course. After a median follow-up of 36 months, four of these patients have relapsed and 24 are still in first complete remission, for an estimated disease-free survival of 75% at 60 months.

In that year, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) began a phase II trial to determine its activity in patients with breast cancer who had previously received one course of chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer. Between April 1993 and June 1994, 53 patients of performance status 0-2 entered the study, of whom 47 were eligible and 40 were evaluable. Topotecan was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/m2 over 30 minutes daily for 5 days every 21 days. In the absence of progression or withdrawal of consent, therapy was continued indefinitely. The median age was 58 years (range 30-79). There were no complete responses and four partial responses, resulting in an objective response rate of 10% (95% CI: 3-24%). Responses were noted in lymph nodes, liver, and skin. The median duration of response was 5 months. The median survival was 12 months. Life-threatening toxicities were almost exclusively hematologic. However, myelosuppression was not cumulative. It was concluded that topotecan has only modest activity among women with advanced breast cancer who have previously received one course of chemotherapy. Given its modest activity and predominant hematologic toxicity, it does not appear to be a promising drug for either single-agent or combination chemotherapy in the salvage setting of advanced breast cancer.","['Levine, E G', 'Cirrincione, C T', 'Szatrowski, T P', 'Canellos, G', 'Norton, L', 'Henderson, I C']","['Levine EG', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Szatrowski TP', 'Canellos G', 'Norton L', 'Henderson IC']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263-0001, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Topotecan/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 1999 Jun;22(3):218-22. doi: 10.1097/00000421-199906000-00002.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7M7YKX2N15 (Topotecan)']",,,['10.1097/00000421-199906000-00002 [doi]'],,,"['CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is strong evidence that after nerve injury leukemia inhibitor factor is a key molecule in the control of peptide expression both in sympathetic neurons and in dorsal root ganglion neurons, although the cells of origin of endogenous leukemia inhibitory factor remain to be established. We have therefore studied the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor on galanin expression in 72 h cultured dorsal root ganglion neurons from normal mice, leukemia inhibitory factor-deficient and heterozygous mice with immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. In cultures of leukemia inhibitory factor-deficient (-/-) mice only 13% of the dorsal root ganglion neurons expressed galanin message-associated peptide and in cultures from heterozygous (+/-) and wild-type (+/+) mice the corresponding figures were, respectively, 24 and 40%. After addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (10 or 50 ng/ml) to the culture medium, the number of neurons expressing galanin message-associated peptide was increased (up to 41%) in cultures from (-/-) animals after the high concentration and reached similar values in cultures from heterozygous animals incubated with the low concentration. These findings were supported by parallel analysis of prepro-galanin messenger RNA levels, where similar transcript levels and effects in the various cultures were observed in the non-radioactive in situ hybridization experiments. These results support the hypothesis that leukemia inhibitory factor is an important regulator of galanin/galanin message-associated peptide expression following axotomy, and may therefore be involved in the defence mechanisms against neuropathic pain at the level of dorsal root ganglion neurons.","['Kerekes, N', 'Landry, M', 'Hokfelt, T']","['Kerekes N', 'Landry M', 'Hokfelt T']","['Department of Neurosciences, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Galanin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Heterozygote', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1999;89(4):1123-34. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00405-9.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '88813-36-9 (Galanin)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,,"['S0306-4522(98)00405-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00405-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nerve growth factor administered into cerebral ventricles at the time of axotomy can prevent these changes, while ciliary neurotrophic factor can prevent the loss of p75NGFR immunostaining. Leukaemia inhibitory factor shares structural homologies with ciliary neurotrophic factor and has similar actions in the nervous system. Both proteins share the same signalling pathways, which involve the interleukin-6 transducing receptor components leukaemia inhibitory factor receptor beta and gp130. In this study, we compared the effects of leukaemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor, administered into cerebral ventricles, on p75NGFR and choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity in septal neurons after fimbria-fornix transection. We found that leukaemia inhibitory factor, like ciliary neurotrophic factor, prevents the loss of p75NGFR-stained medial septal neurons after fimbria-fornix axotomy, without maintaining choline acetyltransferase expression in these neurons. In addition, p75NGFR-immunostained neurons had significantly smaller mean diameter after axotomy in leukaemia inhibitory factor- and ciliary neurotrophic factor-treated animals as compared with either nerve growth factor-treated or unlesioned animals. These findings suggest that both leukaemia inhibitory factor and ciliary neurotrophic factor can prevent the axotomy-induced cell death of septal cholinergic neurons, but that, in contrast to nerve growth factor, these growth factors do not maintain the expression of choline acetyltransferase or the normal neuronal size of these injured neurons.","['Panni, M K', 'Atkinson, J', 'Sofroniew, M V']","['Panni MK', 'Atkinson J', 'Sofroniew MV']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,IM,,"['Animals', 'Axotomy', 'Brain/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Ventricles/drug effects/physiology', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Injections, Intraventricular', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*metabolism']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1999;89(4):1113-21. doi: 10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00385-6.,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,"['S0306-4522(98)00385-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0306-4522(98)00385-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P-gp is encoded by a small group of related genes termed MDR; only MDR1 is known to confer drug resistance. To overcome P-gp-mediated drug resistance, we have developed two anti-MDR1 hammerhead ribozymes driven by the beta-actin promoter. Upon transduction of the ribozymes into MDR cells, vincristine resistance was decreased. These two ribozymes were constructed, which showed different cleavage activities. In this study, to determine suitable target sites for the anti-MDR1 ribozyme, the exon 1b-intron 1 boundary, the translation-initiation site, the intron 1-exon 2 boundary and the exon 2-intron 2 boundary, codons 179 and 196 of the MDR1 gene were selected as candidates. To improve the ribozyme activity, a retroviral vector containing RNA polymerase III promoter was used. Stable retrovirus producer cells were generated by transfecting the retroviral vector plasmids carrying the ribozyme into the packaging cell line. Retroviral vector transduction of human leukemia cell lines expressing MDR1 was accomplished by co-culturing these with virus producer cells. Stably transduced cells were selected by G418 and pooled to determine the efficacy of each ribozyme. These ribozyme-transduced cells became vincristine-sensitive concomitant with the decreases in MDR1 expression, P-gp amount and drug efflux pump function.

A decline in telomerase activity was also observed in HL-60 cells treated with berberine. A stable clone of nucleophosmin/B23 overexpressed in HL-60 cells was selected and found to be less responsive to berberine-induced apoptosis. About 35% to 63% of control vector-transfected cells (pCR3) exhibited morphological characteristics of apoptosis, while about 8% to 45% of nucleophosmin/B23-over-expressed cells (pCR3-B23) became apoptotic after incubation with 15 microg/ml berberine for 48 to 96 hr. DNA extracted from pCR3 cells contained more fragmented DNA than pCR3-B23 cells during treatment with 15 microg/ml berberine for 24 to 48 hr. Our results indicate that berberine-induced apoptosis is associated with down-regulation of nucleophosmin/B23 and telomerase activity.

To determine whether the FHIT gene is involved in the development of leukaemia, we examined the FHIT transcript in 65 leukaemia cell lines, 5 fresh acute leukaemia patients at diagnosis and in complete remission, normal peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 14 healthy volunteers and Epstein-Barr (EB) virus transformed 5 B-cell lines (EB-lines), using nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The transcripts were classified into 4 patterns: pattern I revealed the normal transcripts only, pattern II the altered transcripts in addition to the normal transcripts, pattern III the altered transcripts without the normal transcripts and pattern IV an absence of normal and altered FHIT transcripts. Nineteen cell lines were classified as pattern I, 32 as pattern II, 2 as pattern III and 12 as pattern IV. The frequency of loss of FHIT expression (pattern III or IV) varied in each type of leukaemia cell line; the order ranked from the highest incidence was acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL), B-precursor ALL, B-ALL, and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). No genomic rearrangement was found in any samples examined. All of 5 patients showed same pattern II FHIT transcripts at 2 different stages of the disease.

With this method, provirus loads could be measured within 6 hr, and the results obtained correlated well with those obtained by other methods. Samples from 256 blood donors, who were positive for antibodies against HTLV-I, were analyzed, showing that provirus load ranged from less than 0.1% to 56% among carriers. We analyzed the association between provirus load and the biomarkers age and sex and found that it was not influenced by either. Provirus load was better correlated with soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels than with antibody titer against the virus. Among 18 blood donors with high provirus load (more than 10%), Southern blotting detected monoclonal integration of HTLV-I in infected cells in 2 cases, both of them showing high sIL-2R levels (more than 900 U/ml). Sequential analyses of provirus load showed stable levels of provirus in the same carriers, suggesting that some factors other than age or sex determined provirus load in infected individuals.

The onset and progression of apoptosis were monitored by assessing caspase activation, mitochondrial transmembrane potential, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA fragmentation and cell morphology. In parallel, 31P magnetic resonance (MR) spectra of cell extracts were recorded. In L1210 cells, caspase activation was detected at 4 h. By 3 h, the MR spectra showed a steady decrease in NTP and NAD, and a significant build-up of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P) dihydroxyacetonephosphate and glycerol-3-phosphate, indicating modulation of glycolysis. Treatment with iodoacetate also induced a build-up of F-1,6-P, while preincubation with two poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors, 3-aminobenzamide and nicotinamide, prevented the drop in NAD and the build-up of glycolytic intermediates. This suggested that our results were due to inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, possibly as a consequence of NAD depletion following poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation. Doxorubicin treatment of the adherent SW620 cells caused cells committed to apoptosis to detach. F-1,6-P was observed in detached cells, but not in treated cells that remained attached. This indicated that our observations were not cell line- or treatment-specific, but were correlated with the appearance of apoptotic cells following drug treatment.

Agents that increase intracellular levels of cAMP induce apoptosis in thymocytes and mature B cells, prompting us to investigate the role of cAMP signaling in human CD10+ B-precursor cells. We show for the first time that forskolin (which increases intracellular levels of cAMP) increases apoptosis in the CD10- cells in a dose-dependent manner (19%-94% with 0-1,000 microM forskolin after 48 hours incubation, IC50 = 150 microM). High levels of apoptosis were also obtained by exposing the cells to the cAMP analogue 8-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (8-CPT-cAMP). Specific involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was demonstrated by the ability of a cAMP antagonist, Rp-isomer of 8-bromo-adenosine- 3', 5'- monophosphorothioate (Rp-8-Br-cAMPS), to reverse the apoptosis increasing effect of the complementary cAMP agonist, Sp-8-Br-cAMPS. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins. We found that treatment of the cells with forskolin or 8-CPT-cAMP for 48 hours resulted in a fourfold decline in the expression of Mcl-1 (n = 6, P = 0.002) compared to control cells. The expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Bax was largely unaffected. Mature peripheral blood B cells showed a smaller increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in response to 8-CPT-cAMP (1.3-fold, n = 6, P = 0.045) compared to B-precursor cells, and a smaller decrease in Mcl-1 levels (1.5-fold, n = 4, P = 0.014). Taken together, these findings show that cAMP is important in the regulation of apoptosis in B-progenitor and mature B cells and suggest that cAMP-increased apoptosis could be mediated, at least in part, by a decrease in Mcl-1 levels.","['Myklebust, J H', 'Josefsen, D', 'Blomhoff, H K', 'Levy, F O', 'Naderi, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Smeland, E B']","['Myklebust JH', 'Josefsen D', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Levy FO', 'Naderi S', 'Reed JC', 'Smeland EB']","['Department of Immunology, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo. junehm@ulrik.uio.no']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Ilium/cytology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Thionucleotides/pharmacology']",1999/06/11 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/11 10:00'],"['1999/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 Jul;180(1):71-80. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199907)180:1<71::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-N.,"[""0 (8-bromoadenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate)"", '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', ""41941-66-6 (8-((4-chlorophenyl)thio)cyclic-3',5'-AMP)"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199907)180:1<71::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-N [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199907)180:1<71::AID-JCP8>3.0.CO;2-N [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, almost all reports concerning TGF-beta1 activation delineated that release of mature TGF-beta1 from latency associated protein (LAP) is required for its activation. We report that latent TGF-beta1 (LTGF-beta1) released from TGF-beta1 genetically modified keratinocytes grown in the top chamber of a co-culture system functions as a fibrogenic factor through interaction with insulin-like growth factor-II/mannose-6-phosphate (IGF-II/M6P) receptors of human dermal fibroblasts grown in the lower chamber of this system. Following successful transduction, the pLin-LTGF-beta1 vector was amplified in PA31 7 packaging cells which possess viral structural proteins for vector in the presence of neomycin. Conditioned medium derived from packaging cells containing competent viral particles was then used to transduce either keratinocytes or fibroblasts grown in the upper chamber of a co-culture system, in which a 0.4 microm porous membrane separates the two chambers. In this way, LTGF-beta1 produced by transduced cells in the upper chamber is released and diffuses into the lower chambers where dermal fibroblasts are grown. Conditioned medium from the lower chamber was removed 3 days later and used to evaluate the latency and bioactivity of TGF-beta1 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and mink lung (Mv1 Lu) epithelial growth inhibition assay. Cells were also harvested and used for RNA extraction. The results of these experiments showed that 1) the TGF-beta1-LAP complex, which was latent in traditionally used mink lung growth inhibition assay, directly modulated the expression of collagenase, type I, and type III collagen mRNA by dermal fibroblasts; 2) this stimulation was inhibited by M6P in a dose-dependent manner; 3) the TGF-beta1-LAP inhibits Mv1Lu epithelial cells only when this complex was incubated with cell membranes isolated from dermal fibroblasts; and 4) LTGF-beta1 activation seems to occur through a conformational alteration rather than by release of the mature TGF-beta1 from LAP in our co-cultured system. This conformational alteration seems to occur through the interaction of the TGF-beta1-LAP complex with the IGF-II/M6P receptors. Thus, the quantity of IGF-II/M6P receptors is important in cellular response to LTGF-beta1 in any physiological and pathological conditions.","['Ghahary, A', 'Tredget, E E', 'Shen, Q']","['Ghahary A', 'Tredget EE', 'Shen Q']","['Department of Surgery, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,,"['Autocrine Communication/physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor II/*genetics', 'Keratinocytes/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Paracrine Communication/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, IGF Type 2/*genetics', 'Skin/cytology', 'Transfection', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*genetics']",1999/06/11 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/11 10:00'],"['1999/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1999 Jul;180(1):61-70. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199907)180:1<61::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-R.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, IGF Type 2)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '67763-97-7 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor II)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199907)180:1<61::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-R [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199907)180:1<61::AID-JCP7>3.0.CO;2-R [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phloretin was suggested to induce apoptosis in B16 cells mainly through the inhibition of glucose transmembrane transport. The phloretin-induced apoptosis in B16 cells was inhibited by actinomycin D, Ac-YVAD-CHO caspase-1-like inhibitor, and Ac-DEVD-CHO caspase-3-like inhibitor. During the induction of apoptosis by phloretin, the expression of Bax protein in B16 cells increased and the levels of p53, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL proteins did not change. Our results suggested that phloretin induced apoptosis through the promotion of Bax protein expression and caspases activation. On the other hand, phloretin may induce apoptosis in HL60 cells through the inhibition of protein kinase C activity because phloretin inhibited protein kinase C activity in HL60 cells more than that in B16 cells. The phloretin induced-apoptosis in HL60 cells was not inhibited by actinomycin D and the caspase-1-like inhibitor, but slightly inhibited by the caspase-3-like inhibitor. Phloretin reduced the level of caspase 3 protein in HL60 cells, but not the level of the Bcl-2 protein. Phloretin did not increase the level of Bax protein.

The findings presented here relate to an analysis of 381,915 cancers in women registered in England and Wales over the 20-year period 1971-1990. METHODS: To explore the value of the data for epidemiological research, five sites (pleura, bladder, stomach, lung, and breast) and two occupations (agriculture and textile) were selected. Associations between cancer and occupation were evaluated using age and social class adjusted proportional registration ratios (PRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Pleural cancer risk was increased in a range of occupations with a potential for asbestos exposure (e.g., PRR 608, 95% CI 381-921 for craft and other production process workers), and the well-established link between bladder cancer and employment in the rubber industry was confirmed (PRR 303, 95% CI 188-464). Associations between ""dusty"" occupations and stomach cancer were noted (e.g., PRR 198, 95% CI 126-298 for ceramic decorators and finishers), and possible links with lung cancer and smoke in the work environment were highlighted (e.g., PRR 167, 95% CI 147-189 for publicans). As a group, agricultural workers were found to be at increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (PRR 164, 95% CI 126-211), and textile workers at increased risk of pleural cancer (PRR 145, 95% CI 111-185). No evidence for an occupational aetiology for breast cancer was found within these data. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational information collected at cancer registration in the United Kingdom can be reliably used to identify groups that may be at increased risk of disease.","['Simpson, J', 'Roman, E', 'Law, G', 'Pannett, B']","['Simpson J', 'Roman E', 'Law G', 'Pannett B']","['Leukaemia Research Fund, Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', ""Agricultural Workers' Diseases/epidemiology"", 'Confidence Intervals', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Occupations/classification/*statistics & numerical data', 'Odds Ratio', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Textile Industry/statistics & numerical data', 'Wales/epidemiology', ""*Women's Health"", 'Women, Working/*statistics & numerical data']",1999/06/11 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/11 10:00'],"['1999/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1999 Jul;36(1):172-85. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199907)36:1<172::aid-ajim25>3.0.co;2-x.,,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199907)36:1<172::AID-AJIM25>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199907)36:1<172::aid-ajim25>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies among women in this field have focused on white nurses; however, workers in many health care occupations share exposures experienced by nurses. METHODS: Cancer mortality was examined among female health care workers using death certificate data collected in 24 U.S. states from 1984 through 1993. Cancer mortality odds ratios (MORs) were calculated by race (white, black) and age group. RESULTS: White nurses had a 30% elevation of mortality due to liver cancer and myeloid leukemia. White registered nurses (RNs) had a small excess and white licensed practical nurses (LPNs) had a small deficit of mortality due to breast cancer. Ovarian cancer was in excess among RNs, but decreased among LPNs. Among black nurses, excesses of death due to kidney cancer (MOR = 1.7) and multiple myeloma (MOR = 1.3), and a significant 50% deficit in mortality due to cancer of the esophagus were found. Black RNs, but not LPNs, had an excess of breast cancer (MOR = 1.3; 95% CI = 1.0-1.5). Ovarian cancer was elevated by 30% in both RNs and LPNs. Excess deaths due to cancers of the breast, ovary, and uterus occurred among white physicians. Among black physicians, lung cancer was significantly elevated (MOR = 2.8). White pharmacists had significant excesses of breast (MOR = 1.5) and ovarian (MOR = 2.4) cancers, and myeloid leukemia (MOR = 2.0). White clinical laboratory technicians had excess deaths from several cancers. The greatest excess was for myeloid leukemia (MOR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.5-3.4). Excesses among radiologic technologists included cancers of the lung, pancreas, breast, uterus, and ovary. CONCLUSION: Several findings reported here warrant further investigation. In particular, excesses of myeloid leukemia among nurses, pharmacists, and clinical laboratory technicians and liver cancer among nurses should be investigated in studies with data on occupational and other exposures. Patterns of mortality from breast and ovarian cancer found in this study must be evaluated further in studies with data on reproductive history.","['Petralia, S A', 'Dosemeci, M', 'Adams, E E', 'Zahm, S H']","['Petralia SA', 'Dosemeci M', 'Adams EE', 'Zahm SH']","['Occupational Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20892, USA. sp126i@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,,"['Adult', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Caregivers/*statistics & numerical data', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Death Certificates', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Odds Ratio', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data', ""Women's Health""]",1999/06/11 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/11 10:00'],"['1999/06/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/11 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1999 Jul;36(1):159-65. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199907)36:1<159::aid-ajim23>3.0.co;2-k.,,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0274(199907)36:1<159::AID-AJIM23>3.0.CO;2-K [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0274(199907)36:1<159::aid-ajim23>3.0.co;2-k [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Teachers were at increased risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas + chronic lymphocytic leukemia, leukemias, and Hodgkin's disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm previous associations and may provide additional clues to some determinants of hematolymphopoietic malignancies in women.","['Miligi, L', 'Seniori Costantini, A', 'Crosignani, P', 'Fontana, A', 'Masala, G', 'Nanni, O', 'Ramazzotti, V', 'Rodella, S', 'Stagnaro, E', 'Tumino, R', 'Vigano, C', 'Vindigni, C', 'Vineis, P']","['Miligi L', 'Seniori Costantini A', 'Crosignani P', 'Fontana A', 'Masala G', 'Nanni O', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Stagnaro E', 'Tumino R', 'Vigano C', 'Vindigni C', 'Vineis P']","['Epidemiology Unit, Center for Study and Prevention of Cancer, Az.

Value of polymerase chain reaction and limitations of flow cytometry.,759-66,"Flow cytometric immunophenotypic analysis is critical in diagnosis and classification of acute leukemia and has been used after therapy to monitor for minimal residual disease. However, the presence of normal B-cell precursors, hematogones, particularly in the context of treated pediatric B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BP-ALL), may confound such evaluation. In this study, the value of more specific genotypic markers (polymerase chain reaction evaluation of 2 antigen receptor genes) was assessed to resolve this issue. Flow cytometric analysis of enriched mononuclear cells revealed 1% to 20% precursor B cells (PBCs), based on expression of 1 or more pan-B cell antigens in addition to CD10, CD34, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in all 14 patients studied. Inasmuch as this mimicked the immunophenotype of the original leukemic clone, PBCs, in isolation, were considered suspicious for minimal residual disease. However, 11 of the 14 posttherapy specimens (79%) revealed no monoclonally rearranged antigen receptor genes, and 7 of these 11 patients had trackable genotypic markers at presentation. Accordingly, by PCR these 7 patients had complete molecular remission, supported by clinical follow up of 16 to 73 months. Among the remaining 4 patients with PCR-negative disease, 3 continue in remission, confirming the interpretation of false-positive flow cytometric analysis. In conclusion, flow cytometric monitoring of posttherapy bone marrow specimens from patients with BP-ALL may be misleading, if considered in isolation, in falsely suggesting the presence of minimal residual disease. Rather, PCR for antigen receptor gene rearrangements is a valuable and specific tool, helpful in differentiating hematogones from minimal residual disease in patients with treated BP-ALL whose bone marrow harbors increased PBCs.","['Kallakury, B V', 'Hartmann, D P', 'Cossman, J', 'Gootenberg, J E', 'Bagg, A']","['Kallakury BV', 'Hartmann DP', 'Cossman J', 'Gootenberg JE', 'Bagg A']","['Department of Pathology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocyte Subsets/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1999 Jun;111(6):759-66. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/111.6.759.,,,['Am J Clin Pathol. 2000 Apr;113(4):596-8.

Significant (P <.05) determinants of CL/F by linear regression were: actual body weight (BW; r2 = 0.300), body surface area (BSA; r2 = 0.277), adjusted ideal body weight (AIBW; r2 = 0.265), and ideal body weight (IBW; r2 = 0.173); whereas body mass index (BMI), height, age, gender, and disease were less important predictors. CL/F (mL/min) for normal weight patients (BMI, 18 to 27 kg/m2) was 16.2% lower (P <.001) than for obese patients (BMI, 27 to 35 kg/m2). Thus, expressing CL/F relative to BW did not eliminate statistically significant differences between normal and obese patients. However, busulfan CL/F expressed relative to BSA (110 +/- 24 v 110 +/- 24 mL/min/m2, P = 1.0) or AIBW (3.04 +/- 0.65 v 3.19 +/- 0.67 mL/min/kg, P =.597) were similar in normal and obese patients. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients (n = 10) had approximately 32% lower mean busulfan CL/F expressed relative to BW, BSA, or AIBW compared with patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 73). Routine dosing on the basis of BSA or AIBW in adults and adolescents does not require a specific accommodation for the obese. However, dosing based on BSA may be improved by considering CL/F differences in certain diseases. Adjusting dose for body size or disease does not diminish interpatient variability sufficiently to obviate plasma level monitoring in many indications.","['Gibbs, J P', 'Gooley, T', 'Corneau, B', 'Murray, G', 'Stewart, P', 'Appelbaum, F R', 'Slattery, J T']","['Gibbs JP', 'Gooley T', 'Corneau B', 'Murray G', 'Stewart P', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Slattery JT']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Body Surface Area', 'Body Weight', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Linear Models', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/metabolism', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Obesity/*metabolism', 'Sex Characteristics']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4436-40.,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],,,['S0006-4971(20)59474-3 [pii]'],,,['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because calcium stored in the endoplasmic reticulum is essential for cell growth, differentiation, calcium signaling, and apoptosis and because different SERCA enzymes possess distinct functional characteristics, in the present report we explored SERCA expression during in vitro differentiation of the human myeloid/promyelocytic cell lines HL-60 and NB4 and of freshly isolated acute promyelocytic leukemia cells. Two SERCA species have been found to be coexpressed in these cells: SERCA 2b and another isoform, SERCAPLIM, which is recognized by the PLIM430 monoclonal antibody. Induction of differentiation along the neutrophil granulocytic lineage by all-trans retinoic acid or cyclic AMP analogs led to an increased expression of SERCAPLIM, whereas the expression of the SERCA 2b isoform was decreased. The modulation of SERCA expression was manifest also on the mRNA level. Experiments with retinoic acid receptor isoform-specific retinoids indicated that SERCA expression is modulated by retinoic acid receptor alpha-dependent signaling. SERCA expression of retinoic acid-resistant cell variants was refractory to treatment. Differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage lineage by phorbol ester resulted in an increased expression of both SERCA isoforms. In addition, when cells were treated by phorbol ester in the presence of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone, a known inhibitor of monocyte differentiation, a selective blockage of the induction of SERCAPLIM was observed. Altered SERCA expression modified the functional characteristics of calcium transport into the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations show for the first time that the modulation of calcium pump expression is an integral component of the differentiation program of myeloid precursors and indicate that a lineage-specific remodelling of the endoplasmic reticulum occurs during cell maturation. In addition, these data show that SERCA isoforms may serve as useful markers for the study of myeloid differentiation.","['Launay, S', 'Gianni, M', 'Kovacs, T', 'Bredoux, R', 'Bruel, A', 'Gelebart, P', 'Zassadowski, F', 'Chomienne, C', 'Enouf, J', 'Papp, B']","['Launay S', 'Gianni M', 'Kovacs T', 'Bredoux R', 'Bruel A', 'Gelebart P', 'Zassadowski F', 'Chomienne C', 'Enouf J', 'Papp B']","['U. 348 INSERM, IFR Circulation Lariboisiere, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/*genetics', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macrophages', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4395-405.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59470-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now describe that this T-cell-mediated therapy is dependent on host macrophages expressing the lymphocyte adhesion molecule sialoadhesin (Sn). Depletion of Kupffer cells in tumor-bearing mice during adoptive immunotherapy (ADI) or the treatment of these animals with anti-Sn monoclonal antibodies led to complete or partial inhibition of the immune T-cell-mediated therapeutic effect. Furthermore, Sn+ host macrophages in livers formed clusters during ADI with donor CD8 T cells. To test for a possible antigen presentation function of these macrophages, we used as an in vitro model the antigen beta-galactosidase for which a dominant major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I Ld-restricted peptide epitope is known to be recognized by specific CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). We demonstrate that purified Sn+ macrophages can process exogenous beta-galactosidase and stimulate MHC class I peptide-restricted CTL responses. Thus, Sn+ macrophages, which are significantly increased in the liver after ADI, may process tumor-derived proteins via the MHC class I pathway as well as via the MHC class II pathway, as shown previously, and present respective peptide epitopes to CD8 as well as to CD4 immune T cells, respectively. The synergistic interactions observed before between immune CD4 and CD8 T cells during ADI could thus occur in the observed clusters with Sn+ host macrophages.","['Muerkoster, S', 'Rocha, M', 'Crocker, P R', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Umansky, V']","['Muerkoster S', 'Rocha M', 'Crocker PR', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Umansky V']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Count', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Kupffer Cells/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/*chemistry/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology/pathology']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4375-86.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 1)', '0 (Siglec1 protein, mouse)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59468-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, none of the T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma samples and 15% or less of leukemia samples examined had hypermethylated DAP-Kinase alleles. U937, an unmethylated, DAP-Kinase-expressing leukemia cell line, was treated with gamma interferon and underwent apoptosis; however, Raji, a fully methylated, DAP-Kinase nonexpressing Burkitt's lymphoma cell line, only did so when treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine followed by gamma interferon. Our findings in cell lines and primary tumors suggest that hypermethylation of the DAP-Kinase gene and loss of gamma interferon-mediated apoptosis may be important in the development of B-cell malignancies and may provide a promising biomarker for B-cell-lineage lymphomas.","['Katzenellenbogen, R A', 'Baylin, S B', 'Herman, J G']","['Katzenellenbogen RA', 'Baylin SB', 'Herman JG']","['The Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Death-Associated Protein Kinases', 'Decitabine', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/enzymology/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4347-53.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Death-Associated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,['Blood. 2000 May 1;95(9):2997-9.

Discrepancies exist in human concerning the existence of PsiL+mu- proB cells and the biochemical structure of such a proB-cell complex remains elusive. Among new antihuman VpreB monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), 5 of the gamma kappa isotype bound to recombinant and native VpreB protein with high affinity. They recognized 4 discrete epitopes, upon which 2 were in the extra-loop fragment. Such MoAbs detected the PsiL at the cell surface of either preB or on both proB and preB cells. The previously reported SLC1/SLC2 MoAbs recognize a conformational epitope specific for the mu/PsiL association in accordance with their preB-cell reactivity. Using the proB/preB 4G7 MoAb, PsiL cell surface expression was detected on normal bone marrow, not only on CD34(-)CD19(+) preB but also on CD34(+)CD19(+) proB cells. Futhermore, this MoAb identified PsiL+mu- fresh proB leukemic cells of the TEL/AML1 type. Biochemical studies showed that, at the proB stage, the PsiL is associated noncovalently with two proteins of 105 and 130 kD. Triggering of this complex induces intracellular Ca2+ flux, suggesting that the PsiL may be involved in a new receptor at this early step of the B-cell differentiation.","['Lemmers, B', 'Gauthier, L', 'Guelpa-Fonlupt, V', 'Fougereau, M', 'Schiff, C']","['Lemmers B', 'Gauthier L', 'Guelpa-Fonlupt V', 'Fougereau M', 'Schiff C']","[""Centre d'Immunologie de Marseille-Luminy, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/immunology', 'Stem Cells/immunology']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4336-46.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains, Surrogate)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59464-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that mixtures of irradiated cells expressing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plus those expressing interleukin-4 (IL-4) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) protected mice against WEHI-3B-induced leukemias. When bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) obtained from mice that had been injected with irradiated, cytokine-expressing tumor cells were injected into tumor-bearing mice, the survival of the latter was significantly prolonged; the longest survival was observed in mice receiving BMMNCs containing an increased number of DCs from animals injected with a mixture of tumor cells expressing GM-CSF with those expressing IL-4.

Results were compared with those in a prior group of patients treated with IFN-alpha-based therapy between 1982 and 1990. Ninety-two percent of patients achieved CHR with HHT; CG responses were observed in 60% and were major in 27%. Both CHR and CG response rates were significantly higher than those seen in historical control patients after 6 months of IFN-alpha therapy. After receiving HHT, patients required lower doses of IFN-alpha to maintain a CHR. The median dose delivered was 2.4 MU/m2. This reduction in IFN-alpha dose was associated with a lower incidence of myalgia and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances than that seen in patients treated at the 5 MU/m2 dose. Overall, CG responses were seen in 66% of the patients who received HHT and IFN-alpha compared with 61% of the historical control patients.

Molecular characterization of this disease can refine the diagnosis and could be potentially useful in monitoring response to treatment. Patients defined morphologically to have APL were randomized to receive a 5-day course of ATRA before commencing chemotherapy or to receive daily ATRA commencing with chemotherapy and continuing until complete remission (CR). The chemotherapy was that used in current MRC Leukaemia Trials. Outcome comparisons were by intention to treat with additional analysis for relevant risk factors. Patients were characterized by molecular techniques for the fusion products of the t(15;17) and monitored by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) during and after treatment. Two hundred thirty-nine patients were randomized. Treatment with extended ATRA resulted in a superior remission rate (87% v 70%, P <.001), due to fewer early and induction deaths (12% v 23%, P =.02), and less resistant disease (2% v 7%, P =.03), which was associated with a significantly more rapid recovery of neutrophils and platelets. Extended ATRA reduced relapse risk (20% v 36% at 4 years, P =.04) and resulted in superior survival (71% v 52% at 4 years, P =.005). Presenting white blood cell count (WBC) was a key determinant of outcome. The 70% of patients who presented with a WBC less than 10 x 10(9)/L had a better CR (85% v 62%, P =.0001) and reduced relapse risk (22% v 42%, P =.002) and superior survival (69% v 43%, P <. 0001). Within the low count group, extended ATRA resulted in a better CR (94% v 76%, P =.001), reduced relapse risk (13% v 35%, P =. 04), and improved survival (80% v 57%, P =.0009). There was no evidence of benefit in patients presenting with a higher WBC (>10 x 10(9)/L). Molecular monitoring after the third chemotherapy course had a correlation with risk of relapse. The relapse risk was 57% if the RT-PCR was positive versus 27% if the RT-PCR was negative (P =. 006). APL patients who present with a low WBC derive substantial benefit from combining ATRA with induction chemotherapy until remission is achieved, whereas patients with a higher WBC did not benefit. Molecular characterization of disease can improve diagnostic precision and a positive RT-PCR after consolidation identifies patients at a higher risk of relapse.","['Burnett, A K', 'Grimwade, D', 'Solomon, E', 'Wheatley, K', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Burnett AK', 'Grimwade D', 'Solomon E', 'Wheatley K', 'Goldstone AH']","['Department of Haematology, University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK. burnettAK@Cardiff.ac.UK']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4131-43.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,['S0006-4971(20)59442-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparable results have been produced with the double induction strategy. The present trial evaluated the contribution of high-dose versus standard-dose cytarabine to this strategy. Between March 1985 and November 1992, 725 eligible patients 16 to 60 years of age with newly diagnosed primary AML entered the trial. Before treatment started, patients were randomized between two versions of double induction: 2 courses of standard-dose cytarabine (ara-C) with daunorubicin and 6-thioguanine (TAD) were compared with 1 course of TAD followed by high-dose cytarabine (3 g/m2 every 12 hours for 6 times) with mitoxantrone (HAM). Second courses started on day 21 before remission criteria were reached, regardless of the presence or absence of blast cells in the bone marrow. Patients in remission received consolidation by TAD and monthly maintenance with reduced TAD courses for 3 years. The complete remission (CR) rate in the TAD-TAD compared with the TAD-HAM arm was 65% versus 71% (not significant [NS]), and the early and hypoplastic death rate was 18% versus 14% (NS). The corresponding RFS after 5 years was 29% versus 35% (NS). An explorative analysis identified a subgroup of 286 patients with a poor prognosis representing 39% of the entire population; they included patients with more than 40% residual blasts in the day-16 bone marrow, patients with unfavorable karyotype, and those with high levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase. Their CR rate was 65% versus 49% (p =.004) in favor of TAD-HAM and was associated with a superior event-free survival (median, 7 v 3 months; 5 years, 17% v 12%; P =.012) and overall survival (median, 13 v 8 months; 5 years, 24% v 18%; P =.009). This suggests that the incorporation of high-dose cytarabine with mitoxantrone may contribute a specific benefit to poor-risk patients that, however, requires further substantiation. Double induction, followed by consolidation and maintenance, proved a safe and effective strategy and a new way of delivering early intensification treatment for AML.","['Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B', 'Loffler, H', 'Gassmann, W', 'Haferlach, T', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Haase, D', 'Schoch, C', 'Hossfeld, D', 'Lengfelder, E', 'Aul, C', 'Heyll, A', 'Maschmeyer, G', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Sauerland, M C', 'Heinecke, A']","['Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B', 'Loffler H', 'Gassmann W', 'Haferlach T', 'Fonatsch C', 'Haase D', 'Schoch C', 'Hossfeld D', 'Lengfelder E', 'Aul C', 'Heyll A', 'Maschmeyer G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Sauerland MC', 'Heinecke A']","['Departments of Hematology/Oncology and of Biostatistics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Thioguanine/*administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4116-24.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59440-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Girls did better than boys, and the younger in age the person was at time of BMT, the greater the loss in height. Previous cranial irradiation + single-dose total body irradiation (TBI) caused the greatest negative effect on final height achievement (P < 10(4)). Fractionation of TBI reduces this effect significantly and conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide seems to eliminate it.

We have shown that photoactivated merocyanine 540 (pMC540) triggers caspase-mediated apoptosis in HL60 leukemia and M14 melanoma cells. Because pMC540 is a mixture of photoproducts, we set out to purify the biologically active component(s) from this mixture and to investigate their ability to directly activate intracellular caspases and/or trigger mitochondrial events associated with apoptosis. Two photoproducts, namely C1 and C2, purified and characterized by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis, effectively induced apoptosis in HL60 and M14 cells. Interestingly, both C1 and C2 induced non-receptor-dependent activation of caspase 8, which was responsible for the downstream activation of caspase 3 and cell death. Both compounds induced the release of cytochrome C from mitochondria of tumor cells and from purified rat liver mitochondria; however, different mechanisms were operative in cytochrome C translocation in response to C1 or C2. C1-induced cytochrome C release was mediated by the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore and accompanied by a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (triangle uppsim), whereas cytochrome C release in response to C2 was independent of MPT pore opening. These findings do not exclude the possibility that changes in mitochondrial triangle uppsim are critical for apoptosis in some instances, but support the notion that this may not be a universal step in the apoptotic process. Thus, identification of two novel anticancer agents that directly activate effector components of the apoptotic pathway could have potential implications for the development of newer chemotherapeutic drugs.","['Pervaiz, S', 'Seyed, M A', 'Hirpara, J L', 'Clement, M V', 'Loh, K W']","['Pervaiz S', 'Seyed MA', 'Hirpara JL', 'Clement MV', 'Loh KW']","['Department of Physiology, National University of Singapore, Singapore; and the Oncology Research Institute, NUMI, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Photochemistry', 'Pyrimidinones/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4096-108.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp8 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp9 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59438-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known of the regulation of Pgp expression by cytotoxics in AML. We examined whether Pgp expression and function in leukemic blasts was altered after a short exposure to cytotoxics. Blasts were isolated from 19 patients with AML (15 patients) or chronic myeloid leukemia in blastic transformation (BT-CML, 4 patients). Pgp expression and function were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis of MRK 16 binding and Rhodamine 123 retention, respectively. At equitoxic concentrations, ex vivo exposure for 16 hours to the anthracyclines epirubicin (EPI), daunomycin (DAU), idarubicin (IDA), or MX2 or the nucleoside analogue cytosine arabinoside (AraC) differentially upregulated MDR1/Pgp expression in Pgp-negative and Pgp-positive blast cells. In Pgp-negative blasts, all four anthracyclines and AraC significantly increased Pgp expression (P =.01) and Pgp function (P =.03). In contrast, MX2, DAU, and AraC were the most potent in inducing Pgp expression and function in Pgp positive blasts (P <.05). A good correlation between increased Pgp expression and function was observed in Pgp-negative (r =.90, P =.0001) and Pgp-positive blasts (r =.77, P =.0002). This increase in Pgp expression and function was inhibited by the addition of 1 micromol/L PSC 833 to blast cells at the time of their exposure to these cytotoxics. In 1 patient with AML, an increase in Pgp levels was observed in vivo at 4 and 16 hours after the administration of standard chemotherapy with DAU/AraC. Upregulation of Pgp expression was also demonstrated ex vivo in blasts harvested from this patient before the commencement of treatment. In 3 other cases (1 patient with AML and 2 with BT-CML) in which blasts were Pgp negative at the time of initial clinical presentation, serial samples at 1 to 5 months after chemotherapy showed the presence of Pgp-positive blasts. All 3 patients had refractory disease. Interestingly, in all 3 cases, upregulation of Pgp by cytotoxics was demonstrated ex vivo in blasts harvested at the time of presentation. These data suggest that upregulation of the MDR1 gene may represent a normal response of leukemic cells to cytotoxic stress and may contribute to clinical drug resistance.","['Hu, X F', 'Slater, A', 'Kantharidis, P', 'Rischin, D', 'Juneja, S', 'Rossi, R', 'Lee, G', 'Parkin, J D', 'Zalcberg, J R']","['Hu XF', 'Slater A', 'Kantharidis P', 'Rischin D', 'Juneja S', 'Rossi R', 'Lee G', 'Parkin JD', 'Zalcberg JR']","['Trescowthick Laboratory, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics', 'Anthracyclines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4086-95.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59437-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IGH gene rearrangements were found in 19% (13/69) of CD3(-) T-ALL and in 50% of TCRgammadelta+ T-ALL (12/24), whereas only a single TCRalpha beta+ T-ALL (1/25) displayed a monoallelic IGH gene rearrangement. The association with the T-cell receptor (TCR) phenotype was further supported by the striking relationship between IGH and TCR delta (TCRD) gene rearrangements, ie, 32% of T-ALL (23/72) with monoallelic or biallelic TCRD gene rearrangements had IGH gene rearrangements, whereas only 1 of 26 T-ALL with biallelic TCRD gene deletions contained a monoallelic IGH gene rearrangement. Heteroduplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with VH and DH family-specific primers in combination with a JH consensus primer showed a total of 39 clonal products, representing 7 (18%) VH-(DH-)JH joinings and 32 (82%) DH-JH rearrangements. Whereas the usage of VH gene segments was seemingly random, preferential usage of DH6-19 (45%) and DH7-27 (21%) gene segments was observed. Although the JH4 and JH6 gene segments were used most frequently (33% and 21%, respectively), a significant proportion of joinings (28%) used the most upstream JH1 and JH2 gene segments, which are rarely used in precursor-B-ALL and normal B cells (1% to 4%). In conclusion, the high frequency of incomplete DH-JH rearrangements, the frequent usage of the more downstream DH6-19 and DH7-27 gene segments, and the most upstream JH1 and JH2 gene segments suggests a predominance of immature IGH rearrangements in immature (non-TCRalpha beta+) T-ALL as a result of continuing V(D)J recombinase activity. More mature alpha beta-lineage T-ALL with biallelic TCRD gene deletions apparently have switched off their recombination machinery and are less prone to cross-lineage IGH gene rearrangements. The combined results indicate that IGH gene rearrangements in T-ALL are postoncogenic processes, which are absent in T-ALL with deleted TCRD genes and completed TCR alpha (TCRA) gene rearrangements.","['Szczepanski, T', 'Pongers-Willemse, M J', 'Langerak, A W', 'Harts, W A', 'Wijkhuijs, A J', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Szczepanski T', 'Pongers-Willemse MJ', 'Langerak AW', 'Harts WA', 'Wijkhuijs AJ', 'van Wering ER', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', 'Child', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/genetics']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4079-85.,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59436-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and other investigators have shown that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-mobilized allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) reduces the severity of acute GVHD in murine models. In this study, we investigated whether G-CSF-mobilized PBSC maintain their GVL effect in a murine allogeneic transplant model (B6 --> B6D2F1). B6 mice (H-2(b)) were injected subcutaneously with human G-CSF (100 micrograms/kg/d) for 6 days and their splenocytes were harvested on day 7 as a source of PBSC. G-CSF mobilization dramatically improved transplant survival compared with nonmobilized controls (95% v 0%, P <.001). Systemic levels of lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were markedly reduced in recipients of allogeneic G-CSF-mobilized donors, but cytolytic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity against host tumor target cells p815 was retained in those recipients. When leukemia was induced in recipients by coinjection of p815 tumor cells (H-2(d)) at the time of transplantation, all surviving recipients of G-CSF-mobilized B6 donors were leukemia-free at day 70 after transplant, whereas all mice who received T-cell-depleted (TCD) splenocytes from G-CSF-mobilized B6 donors died of leukemia. When splenocytes from G-CSF-mobilized perforin-deficient (pfp-/-) mice were used for transplantation, 90% of recipients died of leukemia, demonstrating that perforin is a crucial pathway mediating GVL effects after G-CSF-mobilized PBSCT. These data illustrate that G-CSF-mobilized allogeneic PBSCT separate GVL from GVHD by preserving perforin-dependent donor CTL activity while reducing systemic inflammation.","['Pan, L', 'Teshima, T', 'Hill, G R', 'Bungard, D', 'Brinson, Y S', 'Reddy, V S', 'Cooke, K R', 'Ferrara, J L']","['Pan L', 'Teshima T', 'Hill GR', 'Bungard D', 'Brinson YS', 'Reddy VS', 'Cooke KR', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', '*Graft vs Tumor Effect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Lipopolysaccharides/blood', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis']",1999/06/11 00:00,1999/06/11 00:01,['1999/06/11 00:00'],"['1999/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 15;93(12):4071-8.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59435-4 [pii]'],,,"['CA 29542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 55709/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of this hemopoietic suppression resulting in pancytopenia and especially anemia has not been elucidated. Gangliosides can be shed by cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated the effects of exogenously added gangliosides on erythropoiesis in a human and murine in vitro system. A dose-dependent inhibition of murine colony-forming-unit-erythroid (CFU-E) and burst-forming-unit-erythroid (BFU-E) colony growth was observed. Furthermore the maturation of BFU-Es into CFU-Es was inhibited. The inhibition by gangliosides was not abolished by increasing the dose of erythropoietin (10 U/ml). FACS-analysis studies with human CD34+ cells cultured with gangliosides (GM3), erythropoietin (EPO) and stem cell factor (SCF) demonstrated a strong inhibition on cell growth. This resulted in a significantly higher percentage of immature cells (CD34+/GpA-, 24% vs. 3%), and a lower percentage of mature erythroid cells (CD34-/GpA+, 36% vs. 89%). Under these circumstances the effects on erythroid cell growth were much higher than on other cell lineages. The inhibitory effect of gangliosides isolated from acute lymphoblastic leukemic patients on in vitro erythropoiesis suggests that in vivo hemopoietic suppression might have its origin in the gangliosides present and probably shed by the malignant cells in the microenvironment and plasma. Our results show that gangliosides inhibit erythropoiesis in vitro at several stages of development, by a mechanism involving modulation of the maturation of erythroid cells.","['Sietsma, H', 'Kamps, W A', 'Dontje, B', 'Hendriks, D', 'Kok, J W', 'Vellenga, E', 'Nijhof, W']","['Sietsma H', 'Kamps WA', 'Dontje B', 'Hendriks D', 'Kok JW', 'Vellenga E', 'Nijhof W']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*physiopathology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gangliosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",1999/06/09 10:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/06/09 10:00'],"['1999/06/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/09 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1999 Jul 2;82(1):92-7. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990702)82:1<92::aid-ijc16>3.0.co;2-j.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0215(19990702)82:1<92::AID-IJC16>3.0.CO;2-J [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1097-0215(19990702)82:1<92::aid-ijc16>3.0.co;2-j [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To understand the mechanism that underlies the emergence of cells with such gene alterations in human leukemia, we performed clonal analysis of the gene expression of mutant dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and mdr1 in trimetrexate-resistant human leukemia MOLT-3 cells. Trimetrexate-resistant (70- and 60-fold) sublines were developed in the presence or absence of an exogenous supply of thymidine (MOLT-3/TMQ70/Th+, MOLT-3/TMQ60/Th-, respectively). Ten clonal lines were isolated by methyl cellulose cloning from each of the 2 trimetrexate-resistant MOLT-3 sublines. All the clonal lines from the 2 sublines expressed mutated DHFR mRNA, with a base change (T --> C) at the second position of codon 31, as well as the wild-type mRNA, in accordance with cross-resistance to methotrexate. On the other hand, mdr1 mRNA expression was demonstrated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction only in clonal lines from MOLT-3/TMQ70/Th+ cells. mdr1 mRNA expression in clonal lines from MOLT-3/TMQ70/Th+ cells and subclonal lines subsequently obtained from the 3 clonal lines with different mdr1 mRNA expression levels was heterogeneous, and its high expression levels were correlated with acquisition of the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. Polymerase chain reaction-based assay for separate microsatellites, mfd27 and mfd41, demonstrated genomic instability among clonal and subclonal lines of MOLT-3. The clonal analysis of polymorphic microsatellites also suggested that emergence of MDR in trimetrexate-resistant MOLT-3 cells in thymidine was not only heterogeneous but also progressively expanding among clones.

The results from these experiments demonstrate that concomitant exposure of HL60 cells to caffeine (2 mM) during irradiation inhibited radiation-induced tyrosine 15 phosphorylation of the G2/M-phase transition checkpoint protein CDC2/p34 kinase and reduced G2/M-phase arrest by 40-46% compared to cells irradiated without caffeine. Radiation-induced apoptosis also decreased by 36-50% in cells treated with caffeine and radiation compared to cells treated with radiation alone. Radiation survival was significantly increased by exposure to caffeine. In contrast, prolongation of G2/M-phase arrest by pre-incubation with nocodazole enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis and overall radiation-induced cell killing. To further study the role of cell death by apoptosis in the response to exponentially decreasing low-dose-rate irradiation, HL60 cells were transfected with the BCL2 proto-oncogene. The extent of G2/M-phase arrest was similar for parental, neomycin-transfected control and BCL2-transfected cells during and after exponentially decreasing low-dose-rate irradiation. However, there were significant differences (P < 0.01) in the extent of radiation-induced apoptosis of parental and neomycin- and BCL2-transfected cells after irradiation, with significantly less radiation-induced apoptosis and higher overall survival in BCL2-transfected cells than similarly irradiated control cells. These data demonstrate that radiation-induced G2/M-phase arrest and subsequent induction of apoptosis play an important role in the response of HL60 cells to low-dose-rate irradiation and suggest that it may be possible to increase radiation-induced apoptosis by altering the extent of G2/M-phase arrest. These findings are clinically relevant and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for increasing the efficacy of brachytherapy and radioimmunotherapy.","['Ning, S', 'Knox, S J']","['Ning S', 'Knox SJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Stanford University Medical Center, California 94305-5105, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Caffeine/pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Genes, bcl-2/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Transfection']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1999 Jun;151(6):659-69.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '3G6A5W338E (Caffeine)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",,,,,,['CA68149/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mathematical modelling of leukaemogenesis suggests that any such patient would be especially prone to multiple independent leukaemogenic events leading to multiclonality in terms of cell of origin (analogous to bilaterality in familial retinoblastoma). To test this hypothesis we have carried out a search for multiclonal leukaemogenesis in infant and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We used a polymerase chain reaction-based analysis of the X-linked monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene locus to study the clonality of marrow samples obtained from female paediatric ALL patients at the time of disease presentation. We obtained presentation samples from 102 patients of whom 72 were found to be informative at the MAOA locus. These included 20 infant leukaemias (< 1 year at diagnosis). Sixty-six samples were found to be unequivocally monoclonal while the remaining six could not, with certainty, be assigned a clonal origin. We also obtained bone marrow aspirates at first relapse as well as at presentation from eight patients. In each case the same pattern of X-linked allelic inactivation was observed at both time points of the course of the disease. No evidence was found for leukaemic multiclonality in any age group at presentation or for leukaemic 'clone-switching' in relapse. These findings suggest that both infant and childhood ALL is of single-cell origin and implies that leukaemic predisposition resulting from germ cell mutation is unlikely to have a major role in their pathogenesis.","['Rinaldi, F', 'Mairs, R J', 'Wheldon, T E', 'Katz, F', 'Chessells, J M', 'Gibson, B E']","['Rinaldi F', 'Mairs RJ', 'Wheldon TE', 'Katz F', 'Chessells JM', 'Gibson BE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alleles', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Monoamine Oxidase/genetics', '*Parents', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*pathology', 'X Chromosome']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1999 May;80(5-6):909-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6690440.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.4.3.4 (Monoamine Oxidase)']",,,['10.1038/sj.bjc.6690440 [doi]'],PMC2362299,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of such serological blank antigens in bone marrow donor selection is unknown. METHODS: HLA-A serological blank antigens detected in two leukemic patients were cloned and sequenced from genomic DNA. mRNA expression and exon 3 splicing were determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Two patients typed A2/x and A3/x by serology were revealed to be A*01/A*0201 and A*03/A*24 by DNA typing. The HLA-A*O1 blank antigen was identified as the A*0104N allele with a C insertion in exon 4, which results in a stop codon. The HLA-A*24 blank antigen was identified as the A*2402102L allele characterized by a mutation in intron 2 leading to impaired splicing of mainly exon 3. As a consequence, functional A24 mRNA was reduced to less than 5% compared with the other HLA-A allele. For both patients, a search for an unrelated donor was initiated on the basis of the functional absence of the serologically blank allele. The second patient with the A*24 blank antigen could undergo transplantation with marrow from a ""fully A/B/C/DRB1/DRB5/DQB1-compatible"" donor, homozygous for the A antigen. Donor T cells did not react against the patient in a pretransplantation cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursor frequency test known to detect all class I incompatibilities. However, despite this functional pretransplantation compatibility, the patient died 44 days after bone marrow transplantation, suffering from graft-versus-host disease grade IV. The presence of potentially functional A*2402 mRNA could be demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR and sequencing: 50% of the A24 mRNA molecules were estimated to contain exon 3 with a correct splice site. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that serological blank antigens with low mRNA expression might still be recognized after bone marrow transplantation. The determination of such alleles by molecular methods and the assessment of mRNA expression should therefore be included in the unrelated bone marrow donor search protocol.","['Zanone-Ramseier, R', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Gmur, J', 'Roosnek, E', 'Tiercy, J M']","['Zanone-Ramseier R', 'Gratwohl A', 'Gmur J', 'Roosnek E', 'Tiercy JM']","['Transplantation Immunology Unit, Division of Immunology and Allergology, Hopital Cantonal, Geneva, Switerzland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/physiology', 'HLA-A Antigens/chemistry/*genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1999 May 27;67(10):1336-41. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199905270-00008.,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,['10.1097/00007890-199905270-00008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HOX11, a member of the homeobox family of genes, has been shown to play a role in T-ALL. The activation of the HOX11 gene by translocations to the TCR locus results in the inappropriate expression of a 2.3 kb transcript. In this paper we describe a t(10;14)(q24;q11) breakpoint from a T-ALL patient specimen. The breakpoint appears to be mediated by errors in the TCR/V(D)J recombination system, but is more complex than commonly described reciprocal translocations between the HOX11 and TCR genes, since it involves an inversion event of the TCRdelta genes. In addition, the breakpoint was characterised to a previously unsequenced area of the 10q24 locus, 3.4 kb upstream of the HOX11 gene. This breakpoint is more centromeric than the breakpoint cluster region previously shown to be involved in the majority of reported t(10;14)(q24;q11) translocations. Hence, our investigations of the translocation breakpoint in this patient identify another breakpoint region in the 10q24 locus and may define a novel recombination 'hot spot'. Surprisingly, our studies provide a mechanism for a previously unexplained complex translocation described by another group which involves the same region of the HOX11 promoter.","['Salvati, P D', 'Watt, P M', 'Thomas, W R', 'Kees, U R']","['Salvati PD', 'Watt PM', 'Thomas WR', 'Kees UR']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, West Perth, Western Australia, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):975-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401421.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401421 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since no appropriate Southern blot probes were available, we developed a new set of optimized TCRB gene probes. The TCRBJ1 and TCRBJ2 probes are positioned just downstream of the Jbeta1 and Jbeta2 gene segments, respectively, and can be used for detection of both incomplete Dbeta-Jbeta and complete Vbeta-Jbeta rearrangements, whereas the TCRBD1U and TCRBD2U probes upstream of the Dbeta segments can be used to confirm incomplete Dbeta-Jbeta rearrangements. Less frequently occurring Vbeta-Dbeta rearrangements can easily be detected via the downstream TCRBD1 and TCRBD2 probes. Although both EcoRI and HindIII are appropriate restriction enzymes to be used in combination with all these probes, false-positivity due to partial digestion of the EcoRI site in the Jbeta2-Cbeta intron has to be excluded via the TCRBC probe. Application of the TCRB probes in a large series of nearly 200 T cell malignancies revealed clonal rearrangements in all immature and mature TCR alphabeta+ T cell malignancies, in the vast majority of TCR gammadelta+ T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) (approximately 95%) and even in most CD3- T-ALL (approximately 80%). TCRB gene rearrangement patterns differed between the various categories of T cell malignancies. An increased frequency of complete Vbeta-Jbeta1 rearrangements was observed in TCR alphabeta+ T-ALL as compared to CD3- and TCR gammadelta+ T-ALL (33% vs 16% and 11%, respectively), and also incompletely rearranged V-D, D-D, or D-J alleles in the beta2 region occurred more frequently in TCR alphabeta+ cases than in CD3- and TCR gammadelta+ T-ALL (27% vs 15% and 18%, respectively). Furthermore, in comparison to TCR alphabeta+ T-ALL, less Vbeta-Jbeta1 and more Vbeta-Jbeta2 rearrangements were detected in mature TCR alphabeta+ T cell malignancies. The occurrence of the different types of TCRB rearrangement patterns has implications for PCR-based clonality assessment and for PCR-based detection of minimal residual disease via TCRB gene analysis. For instance, focussing on the beta2 region of T-ALL will allow detection of rearrangements in 70%, 75%, and 90% of CD3-, TCR gammadelta+, and TCR alphabeta+ cases, respectively. Therefore the here-described results will facilitate the design of the most appropriate primer sets for PCR analysis of TCRB gene rearrangements at the DNA level.","['Langerak, A W', 'Wolvers-Tettero, I L', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Langerak AW', 'Wolvers-Tettero IL', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Dept of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Blotting, Southern/*methods', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor beta', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):965-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401427.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401427 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we have developed BCR-ABL quantification by real time RT-PCR using the ABI PRISM 7700 (Perkin Elmer), a new technique which allows simple and rapid quantification of a target sequence during the extension phase of PCR amplifications. A fluorogenic probe labeled with both a reporter dye at the 5' end and a quencher-dye at the 3' end hybridizes to the target sequence on the third exon of the ABL gene. The exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the probe and releases the reporter dye, resulting in an increase in the fluorescence signal. The absolute copy number of the target sequence (BCR-ABL) or a control gene (ABL) in an unknown sample can then be calculated using a calibration curve prepared from a set of BCR-ABL RNA standards, and results are expressed as a BCR-ABL/ABL ratio. In our hands, the sensitivity of a serial dilution of total RNA from a positive cell line (K562) in a negative cell line (HL60) was 10(-4). Fifteen CML patients in cytogenetic CR, including 11 allografted patients, two autografted patients and two patients treated by IFN were studied sequentially by this new real time quantitative RT-PCR technique in parallel with conventional qualitative two round nested RT-PCR. The two autografted patients showed high BCR-ABL/ABL ratio in all samples. The two patients treated by IFN showed a progressive decrease in the ratio. In the 11 allografted patients, four were sequentially studied 2 years or more after allo-BMT, and all ratios were below 10(-4). The four patients remained in clinical and cytogenetic CR. The seven other allografted patients were studied immediately after the procedure. Three of them showed a progressive decrease in the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio which reached 10(-4) 7 months after allo-BMT. The three patients remained in hematologic and cytogenetic CR. The remaining four allografted patients had progressive increase of BCR-ABL ratio; three developed cytogenetic relapse 9, 11, 28 months after allo-BMT, and the last patient remained in cytogenetic CR in the bone marrow but developed granulocytic sarcoma. Results of real-time quantitative RT-PCR were in agreement with those of qualitative two round nested PCR. However, evolution changes in the results of real-time quantitative RT-PCR often preceded those of the conventional technique: a decrease of the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio preceded progression from first round to second round positivity and then negativity with the classical technique; conversely, an increase in the ratio preceded evolution with the classical technique. Thus, real-time quantitative RT-PCR may show better correlation with clinical and cytogenetic evolution than conventional qualitative techniques and may help in making early therapeutic decisions in CML, especially after molecular relapse.","['Preudhomme, C', 'Revillion, F', 'Merlat, A', 'Hornez, L', 'Roumier, C', 'Duflos-Grardel, N', 'Jouet, J P', 'Cosson, A', 'Peyrat, J P', 'Fenaux, P']","['Preudhomme C', 'Revillion F', 'Merlat A', 'Hornez L', 'Roumier C', 'Duflos-Grardel N', 'Jouet JP', 'Cosson A', 'Peyrat JP', 'Fenaux P']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, Hopital Calmette, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Unite Inserm U524, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Interferons/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):957-64. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401426.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401426 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To validate these results on a large cohort of patients, we designed a new and oligocentric study. After a COP (cyclophosphamide (Cy), vincristine (Vcr), prednisone (Pred) debulking, patients received four courses of high-dose CHOP (Cy, doxorubicin (Doxo), Ver, Pred), with the addition of etoposide and cisplatin during the two last courses. G-CSF was delivered after each cycle, and peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were used to support the two last cycles. Total duration of chemotherapy was 13 weeks, with a planned dose-intensity (DI) of 1420 mg/m2/week and 23 mg/m2/week for Cy and Doxo, respectively. Radiotherapy (involved fields) was then delivered for patients with node size > or = 5 cm at diagnosis. Forty-two patients were enrolled in this study; 36 completed the treatment and received 75% or more of the planned DI for both Cy and Doxo. Median duration of grade 4 neutropenia was 14 days (range, 2 to 28) for the regimen as a whole, and median duration of rehospitalization for febrile neutropenia was 18 days (range, 4 to 41). Overall response rate was 83%, with 29 patients (69%) in complete response (CR). Six patients failed to respond and one died of toxicity. With a median follow-up of 22.5 months (range, 10 to 42), the 3-year event-free survival (EFS) is 55% (95% CI, 39-71), while disease-free survival (DFS) is 79% (95% CI, 63-95). Ambulatory ISC is accessible and feasible in an oligocentric study.

PBSC harvests are assessed for CD34-positive cell numbers, which serve as an indicator of engraftment potential, and are also analysed cytogenetically to ascertain tumour cell contamination. However, a more accurate assessment of PBSC harvest contamination requires investigation of the Philadelphia (Ph) status of the CD34pos population, in which the cells that provide long-term engraftment are contained. In this study, we have analysed these levels in mobilised PBSC and also in bone marrow (BM) harvests, taken several weeks prior to mobilising chemotherapy. Using fluorescent in situ hybridisation for the bcr/abl gene fusion, we have shown that the median number of Ph negative cells in CD34pos isolated populations was 14.95% in BM compared to 79.05% in PBSC harvests and that in all PBSC samples tested, Ph positivity in CD34pos populations was always detectable either by FISH or one round PCR methods. In paired assessments of both PBSC and BM harvests, higher levels of Ph negative CD34pos cells (> or = 14%) isolated from BM harvests, taken prior to intensive chemotherapy, correlated with higher levels of Ph negative CD34pos cells (> or = 78.5%) in PBSC harvests. These data may aid in the selection of patients for whom PBSC harvesting, after mobilisation, is more likely to achieve an autograft product containing predominantly Ph negative CD34pos cells and may exclude those patients for whom the risk, morbidity and expense of stem cell harvesting may have no apparent benefit over a chronic phase BM harvest.","['Irving, J A', 'Lennard, A', 'Storey, N', 'Conn, J', 'Dunn, J', 'Oliver, K', 'Proctor, S J', 'Dickinson, A M']","['Irving JA', 'Lennard A', 'Storey N', 'Conn J', 'Dunn J', 'Oliver K', 'Proctor SJ', 'Dickinson AM']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Stem Cells/immunology']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):944-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401435.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401435 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that direct interaction between stroma or stroma-derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and human progenitor cells (HPC) may modulate megakaryocytopoiesis. For that purpose, we studied megakaryocytic development of HPC, obtained from patients with hematological malignancies in complete remission or solid tumors without bone marrow involvement, under the influence of megakaryocyte growth and development factor (MGDF, a pegylated, truncated molecule related to the endogenous Mpl ligand). The megakaryocytic development of HPC cultured in contact with a stromal layer (contact cultures) was compared with cultures in which HPC were grown separated from a stromal layer by a microporous membrane (non-contact cultures). A significantly lower number of megakaryocytes (CD41- and CD61-positive cells) was obtained from contact cultures compared to non-contact cultures. Furthermore, the expression of CD42b was higher in non-contact cultures, as compared to contact cultures, indicating an increase in megakaryocyte maturation in non-contact cultures. In contrast, no difference in clonogenic capacity was observed (CFU-GM, BFU-E, CFU-Mk). The possibility that direct contact between HPC and stroma induces the production of a soluble inhibitory cytokine as an explanation for the diminished megakaryocytic development in contact cultures, was excluded by performing transwell experiments in which HPC were cultured in direct contact and in a transwell simultaneously. The percentage of megakaryocytes raised from HPC present in the transwell did not decrease, irrespective of the presence of HPC simultaneous below the transwell in direct contact with stroma. It is concluded that both megakaryocytic development out of HPC and megakaryocytic differentiation is reduced in contact cultures, as compared to non-contact cultures. This is due to modulation by adhesive interactions with stroma, stroma-derived ECM or cytokines bound to the membrane of stromal cells, rather than resulting from the production of diffusible cytokines by stromal cells.","['Zweegman, S', 'Veenhof, M A', 'Debili, N', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Huijgens, P C', 'Drager, A M']","['Zweegman S', 'Veenhof MA', 'Debili N', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Huijgens PC', 'Drager AM']","['University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Department of Haematology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/*physiology']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):935-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401422.,"['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401422 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the cells treated with CdA and MAF, we observed loss in ATP and hallmarks of apoptosis, as evidenced by cellular morphology and high molecular weight DNA fragmentation.

A CpG-rich domain, approximately 1 kb in size, encompasses the promoter region, exon I, and intron I. This domain was found to be relatively unmethylated in five out of six primary and cultured human hematopoietic cells, as well as five out of six AML patient samples, independent of the MDR1 phenotype. The data suggest that the methylation status of the CpG-rich domain does not act as a 'switch' to regulate expression of the MDR1 gene. In addition, we found an upstream Alu repeat sequence to be unmethylated in three out of five cultured hematopoietic cell lines, both MDR1 expressing and non-expressing.

Cytotoxic effects of TZM associated with PADPRP inhibitors are evident shortly after treatment, suggesting that completion of cell division is not required for the lethal effect of the drug combination. Increase of PADPRP or MPG transcripts was found after treatment with TZM alone or combined with PADPRP inhibitor. XRCC1 transcript was positively modulated only in the case of drug combination.

HIC1 is a putative tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 17p13.3 and is hypermethylated in a number of cancers including leukaemia. In this study, using bisulphite genomic sequencing, we have identified a 'boundary' sequence within the HIC1 CpG island that shows a marked junction between methylated and unmethylated DNA in normal haematopoietic cells. Surprisingly, this boundary of differential methylation lies exactly between the intron 2 and exon 3 junction. In contrast to normal haematopoietic cells, hypermethylation extends past this boundary at a high frequency (83%) in newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemias (AML). Identification of the hypermethylated boundary sequence not only provides the first step in understanding the mechanisms that normally protect CpG islands from de novo methylation but also may prove to be a useful cancer-specific marker.","['Melki, J R', 'Vincent, P C', 'Clark, S J']","['Melki JR', 'Vincent PC', 'Clark SJ']","['Kanematsu Laboratories, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, NSW Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'CpG Islands/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):877-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401401.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Hic1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401401 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional cytogenetics suggested that both 17q arms were translocated to chromosomes 1q and 14p, respectively, whereas both 17p arms were not identified. In addition, a Burkitt's-like variant translocation t(2;8) was found. Study of loss of heterozygosity at 17p13 and p53 direct sequencing demonstrated the presence of only one copy of the p53 gene. A 27 bp deletion in exon 8 that resulted in the expression of a p53 protein lacking nine amino acids from the DNA binding region was also found. To confirm the presence of one copy of the p53 gene and localize it, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using a p53 gene probe was performed. Only one signal of p53 was visualized. Moreover, the DAPI profile of the chromosome containing the hybridization spot for the p53 probe did correspond to the cytogenetic marker identified as der(14)t(14;17). Whole chromosome 14 paint, centromere-specific for chromosome 17 and p53 gene probes were cohybridized to the preparations. This demonstrated that the der(14) contained the 17 centromere and distally the p53 gene suggesting that the der(14) contained the short arm of chromosome 17 with the breakpoint occurring in the long arm. FISH studies confirmed the involvement of c-MYC and KAPPA in the t(2;8) translocation. To our knowledge, this is the first case of B-PLL with inactivation of the p53 gene by mutation together with a Burkitt's-like t(2;8) translocation involving the c-MYC gene.

Their occurrence and significance in adult acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is not well described. The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence, associations and implications of chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities in adult ALL. Patients with newly diagnosed ALL referred to MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1980 and 1996 were analyzed. Characteristics and outcome of patients with or without chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities were compared by standard statistical methods. Thirty-one of 468 patients (6.6%) had chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities. Loss of chromosome 5 occurred in six cases, three of them had both chromosome 5 and 7 abnormalities. Deletion or loss of chromosome 7 occurred as a single abnormality in three patients; in 28 patients it was associated with other abnormalities. The most significant cytogenetic association was with the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) abnormality occurring in nine patients (29%). Compared with patients without the abnormalities, patients with chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities tended to express CD34 more frequently (74% vs 54% P = 0.07), to be older (age >60 years 29% vs 18% P = 0.14), and to be associated with Ph (29% vs 11% P = 0.004). With therapy, the complete response (CR) rate with chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities was lower (64% vs 79% P = 0.038) but the survival rate was similar (3-year survival rate 32% vs 36% P = 0.14). When the 22 patients without Ph were considered separately, the CR and survival rates were similar among patients with or without chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities. Abnormalities in chromosome 5 or 7 are not specific for AML, and may occur in ALL. Unlike in AML, chromosome 5 or 7 abnormalities in ALL were not predictive of worse prognosis, which is accounted for mostly by the association with Ph.","['Dabaja, B S', 'Faderl, S', 'Thomas, D', 'Cortes, J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Nasr, F', 'Pierce, S', 'Hayes, K', 'Glassman, A', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H M']","['Dabaja BS', 'Faderl S', 'Thomas D', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Nasr F', 'Pierce S', 'Hayes K', 'Glassman A', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):869-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401430.,,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401430 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients aged < 70 years had 67% CR, while patients aged > or = 70 years had 49% (P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in the duration of aplasia between the two arms. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 22 days in patients who received G-CSF following induction and 27 days in patients who did not (P = 0.006). Severe extrahematologic toxicities of induction did not differ between the two arms and included sepsis (39%), diarrhea (13%), hyperbilirubinemia (8%), hemorrhage (6%) and vomiting (6%). Overall, 14 patients (9%), died from toxicity of induction. First consolidation was administered in 74 patients of whom seven (9%) died from toxicity. Nineteen patients have received transplantation. Median time to recovery of neutrophils > 0.5 x 10(9)/l was 13 days and of platelets > 50 x 10(9)/l 43 days following consolidation. There were two toxic deaths. Median disease-free survival and survival from time of achieving CR of non transplanted patients are 6 and 7 months respectively without difference between the two arms. Fourteen transplanted patients relapsed at a median of 5 months post-transplant. We conclude that this regimen is well tolerated and has a good efficacy to induce CR, without a significant difference in efficacy and toxicity between idarubicin and mitoxantrone. Intensive postinduction, including transplantation, is feasible; however, this procedure did not seem to prevent early relapse in the majority of patients. Neither the high rate of CR nor consolidation nor transplant procedure in a selected group of patients did translate into improved DFS and/or survival.","['Archimbaud, E', 'Jehn, U', 'Thomas, X', 'De Cataldo, F', 'Fillet, G', 'Belhabri, A', 'Peaud, P Y', 'Martin, C', 'Amadori, S', 'Willemze, R']","['Archimbaud E', 'Jehn U', 'Thomas X', 'De Cataldo F', 'Fillet G', 'Belhabri A', 'Peaud PY', 'Martin C', 'Amadori S', 'Willemze R']","['Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Pilot Projects', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):843-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401445.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401445 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over the last 35 years several hundred cell lines spanning almost the whole spectrum of hematopoietic cell lineages have been described. The cardinal features of MH cell lines are their monoclonal origin, arrest of differentiation, genetic alterations, and unlimited proliferation; the major advantages of cell lines are the unlimited supply of cell material and the infinite storability and recoverability at will of the cells. Categorization of cell lines usually follows the physiological stages of hematopoietic differentiation in the various cell lineages. For an adequate classification, a detailed and comparative characterization of both primary and cultured cells is absolutely necessary. New cell lines, in particular, must be adequately characterized. While clinical and cell culture data and immunological and cytogenetic features are the most important data, cell lines should be described in as much additional detail as possible allowing any singular features to be pointed out. In addition to detailed characterization, immortality of the culture, proof of neoplasticity, authentication of the true origin of the cells, scientific significance and availability of the cell line for other investigators are of paramount importance. In summary, MH cell lines have the potential to greatly facilitate diverse studies of normal and malignant hematopoiesis; to that end, these cell lines must be extensively characterized and adequately described.","['Drexler, H G', 'Matsuo, Y']","['Drexler HG', 'Matsuo Y']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Forecasting', 'Guidelines as Topic', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/classification/pathology', 'Humans', 'Publishing', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/classification/pathology']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):835-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401428.,,,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401428 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In granulocytopenic patients, the ulcerations which accompany mucositis are frequent portals of entry for indigenous oral bacteria often leading to bacteremias or sepsis. The complexity of mucositis as a biological process has only recently been appreciated. The condition appears to represent a sequential interaction of the oral mucosal cells and tissues, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and local environmental factors in the mouth such as microorganisms and saliva. The recognition that the pathophysiology of mucositis is a multifactorial process has presented opportunities for intervention based on biological attenuation. Interleukin-11, a pleotropic cytokine, has a range of activities which is potentially relevant to mucositis. Consequently, it has been used successfully to modify the development, severity and course of mucositis in an animal model which closely mimics the equivalent human condition.","['Sonis, S', 'Edwards, L', 'Lucey, C']","['Sonis S', 'Edwards L', 'Lucey C']","[""Division of Oral Medicine, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Dentistry, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/*therapeutic use', 'Mouth Mucosa', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Stomatitis/*drug therapy/etiology']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1999 Jun;13(6):831-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2401441.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-11)']",,,['10.1038/sj.leu.2401441 [doi]'],,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now demonstrate in corticotroph AtT-20 cells that LIF-stimulated endogenous SOCS-3 mRNA expression is blocked in stable transfectants of SOCS-3 wild type or in dominant negative STAT-3 mutants, respectively. We characterized approximately 3.8-kb genomic 5' sequence of murine SOCS-3, including approximately 2.9-kb sequence upstream of the transcription start site (+1), which was determined by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends and RNase protection assay. Different 5' constructs were cloned into the pGL3Basic vector, and luciferase activity was assayed in transiently transfected ACTH-secreting corticotroph AtT-20 cells. A STAT-1/STAT-3 binding element, located at nucleotides -72 to -64, was essential for LIF stimulation of SOCS-3 promoter activity. LIF induced 10-fold increased luciferase activity in a wild-type construct spanning -2757 to +929 bases. However, deletion or point mutation of the STAT-1/STAT-3 binding element abrogated LIF action (2- to 3-fold). Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay analysis confirmed specific binding of STAT-1 and STAT-3 to this region. These results characterize the genomic 5' region of murine SOCS-3 and identify an important STAT-1/STAT-3 binding element therein. Thus, LIF-stimulated SOCS-3 gene expression is at least in part mediated by STAT-3 and STAT-1. The cytokine inhibitor SOCS-3 acts in a negative loop to autoregulate its own gene expression, thus limiting its accumulation in the corticotroph cell. These results demonstrate a mechanism for corticotroph plasticity with rapid ""on"" and ""off"" ACTH induction in response to neuro-immuno-endocrine stimuli, such as LIF.","['Auernhammer, C J', 'Bousquet, C', 'Melmed, S']","['Auernhammer CJ', 'Bousquet C', 'Melmed S']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pituitary Gland/*physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/06/09 00:00,1999/06/09 00:01,['1999/06/09 00:00'],"['1999/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 Jun 8;96(12):6964-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.12.6964.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['10.1073/pnas.96.12.6964 [doi]'],PMC22025,,['DK 50238/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/AF117732'],,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to determine whether the mechanism by which Tax protein induces transformation in HTLV- or BLV-infected cells involves DNA damage. METHODS: We used a micronucleus assay to measure chromosomal damage and alkali denaturation analysis to test host-cell DNA integrity in cells infected with HTLV, BLV, or simian T-lymphotropic virus or in cells transfected with the tax gene of HTLV or BLV. Controls included uninfected cells and cells infected with other oncogenic retroviruses or oncogenic DNA viruses. We used a plasmid reactivation assay to examine whether the damage might be due to the inhibition of DNA repair. To ascertain which of several repair pathways might be inhibited, chemical methods were used to selectively introduce lesions repaired by specific pathways into the reporter plasmid. RESULTS: The presence of Tax was associated with DNA damage. HTLV- or BLV-infected or tax-transfected cells showed normal ability to repair damage induced by deoxyribonuclease I or psoralen but markedly decreased ability to repair damage induced by UV light, quercetin, or hydrogen peroxide. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that the DNA repair pathway most inhibited by Tax is base-excision repair of oxidative damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating inhibition of DNA repair by any retrovirus and suggests that this inhibition of DNA repair may contribute to the mechanism of cell transformation by the HTLV/BLV group of viruses.","['Philpott, S M', 'Buehring, G C']","['Philpott SM', 'Buehring GC']","['Program in Infectious Diseases, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA Repair/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Gene Products, tax/*genetics', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*virology', 'Plasmids', 'Transfection']",1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:01,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Jun 2;91(11):933-42. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.11.933.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 Jun 2;91(11):903-4.

Differentiation is mediated by the APL-specific transforming protein PML/RAR alpha and involves its activity as ligand-dependent enhancer factor on RA-target genes. We report here the identification of p21 as a transcriptional target of PML/RAR alpha during RA-induced differentiation of APL cells. We found that RA-treated APL cells undergo two rounds of cell division before entering post mitotic G1, that progression through the G1-S is indispensable for differentiation and coincides with the duration of commitment. RA-treatment induced two peaks of p21 synthesis: early (from the 2nd to the 6th hour), dependent on PML/RAR alpha expression and associated with G1-S transition and high CDK activity; late (from 3rd to the 4th day), independent from PML/RAR alpha and associated with G1 block and low CDK activity. Increased p21 in PML/RAR alpha cells during G1-S had no effect on the cell cycle while an antisense p21 prevented RA-induced differentiation without altering G1-S transition and the late G1 block. These results demonstrate that p21 is an effector of the activity of PML/RAR alpha on differentiation and suggest that p21 exerts a function in G1-S connected to differentiation-commitment and uncoupled from cell cycle and CDK inhibition.","['Casini, T', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Casini T', 'Pelicci PG']","['European Institute of Oncology, Department of Experimental Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'S Phase', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:01,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 May 27;18(21):3235-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202630.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202630 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Pure HFRPE cells were isolated and cultured. Normal and interferon (IFN)-gamma-activated HFRPE from early and late in vitro passages were incubated with cells from the human T-cell leukemia line Jurkat (Jkt). Cultures were pulsed with [3H]-thymidine to measure Jkt cell proliferation. Jkt cells were evaluated for apoptosis either by staining with an ethidium bromide/acridine orange mixture (AO/EB) or with Annexin V-phycoerythrin. The role of Fas ligand (FasL) molecule in HFRPE-mediated apoptosis was assessed by using a mutant Jkt cell line (DD3), which is deficient in Fas-mediated signaling. The involvement of the antiapoptotic human gene bcl-xL was determined by using Jkt cells that were stably transfected with bcl-x(L). The role of cell- cell contact in the induction of apoptosis was evaluated in a transwell system in the presence or absence of neutralizing antibodies against IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. RESULTS: HFRPE cells inhibited the proliferation of Jkt cells by inducing apoptosis through a FasL-independent pathway. Passaging and IFN-gamma activation strengthened the inhibitory effect of HFRPE cells on the proliferation of Jkt cells. At lower HFRPE passages (P2), bcl-alphaL, overexpression rescued the HFRPE cell-mediated apoptosis. The separation of the cells by the transwell system did not affect the HFRPE cell-mediated suppression. This suppressive effect was not mediated by the secretion of IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha molecules. CONCLUSIONS: HFRPE cells suppressed the proliferation of Jkt cells by inducing apoptosis. HFRPE cells induced a stronger inhibitory effect on Jkt cells at higher in vitro passages. The HFRPE-induced apoptosis was not mediated through the FasL/Fas pathway or through the secretion of the apoptosis-inducing cytokines IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The bcl-xL gene may play a role in preventing HFRPE cell-induced apoptosis in Jkt cells. These combined results suggest that the HFRPE-mediated suppression of primary T cells may also be mediated by the induction of apoptosis.

The pyrimidine nucleoside analogue cytarabine (AraC) has an important place in the treatment of acute leukemia, and gemcitabine is a new pyrimidin antimetabolite which has shown clinical activity against solid tumors. We have used the semiautomated fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay (FMCA), based on the measurement of fluorescence generated from cellular hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate (FDA), to study these drugs. Eighty samples from 60 patients with low-grade NHL were studied. Fifty samples from patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) and 118 samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were included for comparison. The results indicate that the purine- and pyrimidine nucleoside analogues tested may be as active against low-grade NHL as against acute leukemia. In low-grade NHL, AraC seems to be even more active in comparison to CdA (p=<0.0001) and fludarabine (p=0.001). Untreated patients were more drug sensitive than previously treated patients. Gemcitabine showed the highest correlation with AraC (0.90) whereas CdA showed the highest correlation with fludarabine (0.84). Based on these results we propose that AraC and gemcitabine may have a role in the treatment of low-grade NHL.","['Aleskog, A', 'Larsson, R', 'Hoglund, M', 'Sundstrom, C', 'Kristensen, J']","['Aleskog A', 'Larsson R', 'Hoglund M', 'Sundstrom C', 'Kristensen J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. anna.aleskog@medicin.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/metabolism', 'Cladribine/*analysis/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*analysis/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*metabolism/mortality/physiopathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism']",1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:01,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1999 May;62(5):293-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01905.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1999.tb01905.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Longitudinal data on pubertal development and gonadal function in these patients are limited. Twenty-one ALL patients (15 males, 6 females) who had successfully undergone allogeneic BMT before puberty (age at BMT: 3.4-12.3 yr) were followed up in University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany over 2 (minimum) to 14 (maximum) years. Tanner development scores, serum testosterone and estradiol, basal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were analyzed. During pubertal age, the levels of FSH and LH rose consecutively, resulting in noticeably elevated serum concentrations in 100% and 89%, respectively, of boys older than 14 years and in 75% and 75%, respectively, of girls older than 13 years. Nevertheless, pubertal development has been normal in all patients except in one boy and two girls who required substitution with sexual steroids, as timely puberty (i.e. boys < 14 years, girls < 13 years) did not start. In males with normal puberty, testosterone levels, however, were found to be low-normal. In conclusion, after BMT preceded by total body irradiation for childhood ALL, gonadal function is impaired. Even if normal pubertal development occurs, deficiencies in long-term endocrine function cannot be ruled out. In view of the high FSH levels, the prognosis for fertility is doubtful.","['Mayer, E I', 'Dopfer, R E', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Scheel-Walter, H', 'Ranke, M B', 'Niethammer, D']","['Mayer EI', 'Dopfer RE', 'Klingebiel T', 'Scheel-Walter H', 'Ranke MB', 'Niethammer D']","[""University Children's Hospital, Tubingen, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Estradiol/blood', 'Female', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gonads/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', '*Puberty/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Testosterone/blood', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:01,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 1999 Feb;3(1):38-44. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-3046.1999.00006.x.,"['3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",,['Pediatr Transplant. 1999 Feb;3(1):1-4.

Upon TPA treatment, the activity of ERK1 and ERK2 rapidly increased, with maximal induction between 1 and 3 h, while ERK2 protein levels remained constant. The activity of JNK1 was also significantly induced, with JNK1 protein levels increasing moderately during exposure to TPA. Treatment of cells with PD98059, a specific inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), inhibited TPA-induced ERK2 activity. Furthermore, PD98059 completely blocked the TPA-induced differentiation of ML-1 cells, as assessed by a number of features associated with mononuclear differentiation including changes in morphology, nonspecific esterase activity, phagocytic ability, NADPH oxidase activity, mitochondrial respiration, and c-jun mRNA inducibility.

The morbidity of further chemotherapy is considerable, as most patients have already been exposed to intensive multiagent chemotherapy. The FLAG (fludarabine, high-dose cytarabine, and G-CSF) regimen is as intensive but less cardiotoxic because of the avoidance of anthracyclines. PROCEDURE: Nineteen children were treated in two U.K. centers with the FLAG regimen for relapsed and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). There were 13 males and 6 females, with an age range of 1.9 to 14.2 years. AML was the diagnosis in 12 children, ALL in 4, biphenotypic leukemia in 3. Eight patients had refractory disease, 11 were in relapse (5 in first relapse, 4 in second, and 2 in third). RESULTS: Complete remission was obtained in 13 patients, partial remission was obtained in 4, and 2 patients were considered nonresponders. There were seven patients alive at 12 months (mean) posttherapy; one of these is awaiting bone marrow transplantation (BMT). All patients experienced grade 4 hematological toxicity; no patient died of infection. Thirteen patients received BMT as consolidation (seven unrelated donor; six sibling allografts). Six of these have died, four due to pneumonitis. CONCLUSIONS: FLAG can be regarded as an effective protocol for inducing remission in a group of heavily pretreated children. Its toxicity is acceptable due to the avoidance of anthracyclines.","['McCarthy, A J', 'Pitcher, L A', 'Hann, I M', 'Oakhill, A']","['McCarthy AJ', 'Pitcher LA', 'Hann IM', 'Oakhill A']","['Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Bristol, United Kingdom. amcc@nildram.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1999/06/08 10:00,2000/05/08 09:00,['1999/06/08 10:00'],"['1999/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/08 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1999 Jun;32(6):411-5. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1096-911x(199906)32:6<411::aid-mpo3>3.0.co;2-k.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLAG protocol']",,['Med Pediatr Oncol. 2000 Feb;34(2):163.

In tumor cells the expression of the gene may vary and there is experimental evidence that it can be induced by exposure to MDR-unrelated agents. We investigated if the therapeutic exposure to Arabinosyl Cytosine (AC) could affect the level of P170 expression in the blast cells of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). The reactivity to the P170-directed MRK 16 monoclonal antibody of the marrow blast cells from 27 patients with ANLL prior and after treatment with standard dose AC was evaluated by flow cytometry. After treatment with AC the MRK 16 mean fluorescence index (MFI) was increased in 5/18 cases of primary and previously untreated ANLL and in 7/9 cases of relapsed or secondary leukemia. Overall, the mean value of the MFI was 6.8+/-3.6 before and 9.0+/-3.8 after AC (P=0.001, Wilkoxon matched pairs test). Therapeutic exposure to AC in vivo may increase P170 expression in leukemic cells. This may influence the definition and the quantitation of resistance and may have therapeutic implications, concerning the association with other cytotoxics and the use of MDR modifiers.","['Grimaz', 'Damiani', 'Michieli', 'Sperotto', 'Masolini', 'Baccarani']","['Grimaz S', 'Damiani D', 'Michieli M', 'Sperotto A', 'Masolini P', 'Baccarani M']","['Division of Hematology, University of Udine, Udine, 33100, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Italy,Adv Clin Path,Advances in clinical pathology : the official journal of Adriatic Society of Pathology,9709997,,,,1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:00,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Clin Path. 1998 Jan;2(1):59-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response to this complement split product must be tightly regulated in situations with sustained complement activation to avoid deleterious effects caused by overactivated inflammatory cells. Receptor internalization, an important control mechanism described for G protein-coupled receptors, was investigated. Using rabbit polyclonal anti-serum directed against the C3aR second extracellular loop, a flow cytometry-based receptor internalization assay was developed. Within minutes of C3a addition to human granulocytes, C3aR almost completely disappeared from the cell surface. C3aR internalization could also be induced by PMA, an activator of protein kinase C. Similarly, monocytes, the human mast cell line HMC-1, and differentiated monocyte/macrophage-like U937-cells exhibited rapid agonist-dependent receptor internalization. Neither C5a nor FMLP stimulated any cross-internalization of the C3aR. On the contrary, costimulation of granulocytes with C5a, but not FMLP, drastically decreased C3aR internalization. This effect could be blocked by a C5aR-neutralizing mAb.

Recent studies have shown that the gene product, ELL, functions as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor that increases the rate of transcription by RNA polymerase II by suppressing transient pausing. Using yeast two-hybrid screening with ELL as bait, we isolated the p53 tumor suppressor protein as a specific interactor of ELL. The interaction involves respectively the transcription elongation activation domain of ELL and the C-terminal tail of p53. Through this interaction, ELL inhibits both sequence-specific transactivation and sequence-independent transrepression by p53. Thus, ELL acts as a negative regulator of p53 in transcription. Conversely, p53 inhibits the transcription elongation activity of ELL, suggesting that p53 is capable of regulating general transcription by RNA polymerase II through controlling the ELL activity. Elevated levels of ELL in cells resulted in the inhibition of p53-dependent induction of endogenous p21 and substantially protected cells from p53-mediated apoptosis that is induced by genotoxic stress. Our observations indicate the existence of a mutually inhibitory interaction between p53 and a general transcription elongation factor ELL and raise the possibility that an aberrant interaction between p53 and ELL may play a role in the genesis of leukemias carrying MLL-ELL gene translocations.","['Shinobu, N', 'Maeda, T', 'Aso, T', 'Ito, T', 'Kondo, T', 'Koike, K', 'Hatakeyama, M']","['Shinobu N', 'Maeda T', 'Aso T', 'Ito T', 'Kondo T', 'Koike K', 'Hatakeyama M']","['Departments of Viral Oncology, Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 1-37-1 Kami-Ikebukuro, Toshima-ku, Tokyo 170-8455, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Elongation Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*RNA Polymerase II', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",1999/06/08 00:00,1999/06/08 00:01,['1999/06/08 00:00'],"['1999/06/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/08 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 Jun 11;274(24):17003-10. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.24.17003.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELL protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.24.17003 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)72871-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence suggests that, like other members of this family, CT-1 may possess anti-inflammatory properties. We hypothesized that in vivo CT-1 administration would attenuate endotoxin (ETX)-induced acute lung injury. We studied the effects of CT-1 (100 microgram/kg ip, 10 min prior to ETX) in a rat model of ETX-induced acute lung injury (Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide, 20 mg/kg ip). Six hours after ETX, lungs were harvested for determination of neutrophil accumulation (myeloperoxidase, MPO, assay) and lung edema (wet-to-dry weight ratio). Mechanisms of pulmonary vasorelaxation were examined in isolated pulmonary artery rings at 6 h by interrogating endothelium-dependent (response to acetylcholine) and endothelium-independent (response to sodium nitroprusside) relaxation following alpha-adrenergic (phenylephrine)-stimulated preconstriction. CT-1 abrogated the endotoxin-induced lung neutrophil accumulation: 2.3 +/- 0.2 units MPO/g wet lung (gwl) vs 6. 3 +/- 0.3 units MPO/gwl in the ETX group (P < 0.05 vs ETX, P > 0.05 vs control). Similarly, CT-1 prevented ETX-induced lung edema: wet-to-dry-weight ratio, 4.473 +/- 0.039 vs 4.747 +/- 0.039 in the ETX group (P < 0.05 vs ETX, P > 0.05 vs control). Endotoxin caused significant impairment of both endothelium-dependent and -independent pulmonary vasorelaxation, and CT-1 attenuated this injury. Thus, cardiotrophin-1 possesses significant anti-inflammatory properties in a model of endotoxin-induced acute lung injury.","['Pulido, E J', 'Shames, B D', 'Pennica, D', ""O'leary, R M"", 'Bensard, D D', 'Cain, B S', 'McIntyre, R C Jr']","['Pulido EJ', 'Shames BD', 'Pennica D', ""O'leary RM"", 'Bensard DD', 'Cain BS', 'McIntyre RC Jr']","['Department of Surgery, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado, 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cyclic GMP/physiology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Edema/*chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Endotoxemia/pathology', '*Endotoxins', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*chemically induced/pathology/physiopathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Pulmonary Circulation/drug effects/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Vasodilation/drug effects/physiology']",1999/06/08 10:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/06/08 10:00'],"['1999/06/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/06/08 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 1999 Jun 15;84(2):240-6. doi: 10.1006/jsre.1999.5655.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Endotoxins)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)']",,,"['10.1006/jsre.1999.5655 [doi]', 'S0022-4804(99)95655-X [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],"['GM49222/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HD36256-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Register-based retrospective cohort study in New South Wales, Australia. Age-, sex-, and period-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated for individual cancers occurring in 1980-1993 in people with AIDS registered before 1996. RESULTS: During the study period, 3616 people were registered with AIDS; 716 cases of AIDS-defining cancer and 62 cases of non-AIDS-defining cancer were identified. People with AIDS had a significantly increased incidence of Hodgkin's disease [SIR 18.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.39-34.8], multiple myeloma (SIR 12.1; 95% CI 2.50-35.4), leukaemia (SIR 5.76; 95% CI 1.57-14.7), lip cancer (SIR 5.94; 95% CI 1.92-13.8) and lung cancer (SIR 3.80; 95% CI 1.39-8.29). The incidence of Hodgkin's disease increased significantly around the time of AIDS diagnosis (P = 0.008 for trend with time), suggesting an association with immunodeficiency. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides strong support for the hypothesis that Hodgkin's disease is an AIDS-associated condition. There was an increased incidence of several other forms of cancer, some of which are known to occur at increased rates in transplant recipients who have received immunosuppressive therapy. Improved survival in people with HIV infection may lead to increases in the number that develop these forms of cancer.","['Grulich, A E', 'Wan, X', 'Law, M G', 'Coates, M', 'Kaldor, J M']","['Grulich AE', 'Wan X', 'Law MG', 'Coates M', 'Kaldor JM']","['National Centre in HIV Epidemiology and Clinical Research, New South Wales Cancer Council, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,AIDS,"AIDS (London, England)",8710219,IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1999/06/05 00:00,1999/06/05 00:01,['1999/06/05 00:00'],"['1999/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS. 1999 May 7;13(7):839-43. doi: 10.1097/00002030-199905070-00014.,,,,['10.1097/00002030-199905070-00014 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonmyeloablative preparative regimens and induction of graft-vs-malignancy effect.,"621-8; discussion 631, 635-8, 641","The therapeutic benefit of allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation is due largely to an immune graft-vs-malignancy effect. Most of the evidence for such an effect has come from studies of allogeneic transplantation in leukemia. In patients with susceptible malignancies who relapse following an allogeneic transplant, infusion of donor lymphocytes can induce durable remissions. Use of less toxic, nonmyeloablative preparative regimens permits engraftment and generation of graft-vs-malignancy effects. This strategy permits allogeneic transplantation to be used in older patients and those with comorbidities who cannot tolerate conventional high-dose preparative regimens. The long-term efficacy of nonmyeloablative preparative regimens and induction of graft-vs-malignancy effects remains to be determined. Also, further clinical trials are required to address various unresolved issues and to compare this strategy with standard, myeloablative transplantation regimens.","['Champlin, R', 'Khouri, I', 'Komblau, S', 'Molidrem, J', 'Giralt, S']","['Champlin R', 'Khouri I', 'Komblau S', 'Molidrem J', 'Giralt S']","['Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Texas M.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A combination of lateral and anterior-posterior fields was used in 8 fractions and on 4 consecutive days. Doses were preliminarily calculated and then measured in vivo by thermoluminescent, semiconductor and ionization dosimeters attached to the body in 10 representative transverse cross-sections. Calculations and measurements were carried out for the beam at the body entry and exit. The error in dose calculations was estimated for each reference point. Dose deviations between calculations and measurements were analysed using the Student's t-test. RESULTS: The error in preliminary dose calculations ranged from 3% to 15% (Table 1). Standard deviations of the measurements and percent deviations from the calculations exceeded 10% only for the lung and neck exits (Table 3). Average thermoluminescent readings were 6% higher than the corresponding semiconductor readings. The measured doses fitted the calculated values within the limit of error, except for the lung, head and neck exits for the whole group, depending on the type of fields used (Table 4).","['Malicki, J']",['Malicki J'],"['Greatpoland Cancer Centre, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

M1/WT cells differentiated in response to CSF-1, with a reduction in their proliferative capacity. CSF-1-mediated differentiation was partially abrogated in the M1/Y559F cells, with a less marked reduction in proliferative capacity. The Src tyrosine kinases c-Src, c-Yes, c-Fyn, and c-Hck were tyrosine phosphorylated in the M1/WT cells in response to CSF-1 and bound to the WT CSF-1R through their SH2 domains. Binding of the Src kinases to the CSF-1 receptor was greatly reduced in the M1/Y559F cells. CSF-1-mediated activation of STAT3 was also abrogated in the M1/Y559F cell line. Treatment of M1/WT cells with the Src family inhibitor PP2 resulted in an inhibition of CSF-1-mediated differentiation, equivalent to that observed in the M1/Y559F cells.

Treatment of APL cells with retinoic acid (RA) leads to complete remission by inducing growth arrest and differentiation of these cells into granulocytes. The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 may be involved in terminal differentiation associated growth arrest. We showed in this study that PML/RARalpha increased the transcription of p21WAF1/CIP1 gene and the activation was further induced by RA treatment. Deletion analysis revealed a region upstream of the p21WAF1/CIP1 promoter that is required for transactivation by PML/RARalpha. Transient transfection of PML/RARalpha in cells increased the endogenous p21WAF1/CIP1 protein levels. These results suggest that the induction of APL cells differentiation by RA may be a result of the activation of p21WAF1/CIP1 by PML/RARalpha.,"['Yang, W L', 'Zeng, Y X', 'El-Deiry, W S', 'Nason-Burchenal, K', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Chin, K V']","['Yang WL', 'Zeng YX', 'El-Deiry WS', 'Nason-Burchenal K', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Chin KV']","['Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick 08901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol Res Commun,Molecular cell biology research communications : MCBRC,100889076,IM,,"['Cell Extracts', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/genetics/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism/*physiology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/11/30 09:00,2000/09/02 11:01,['1999/11/30 09:00'],"['1999/11/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2000/09/02 11:01 [medline]', '1999/11/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol Res Commun. 1999 May;1(2):125-31. doi: 10.1006/mcbr.1999.0121.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,"['10.1006/mcbr.1999.0121 [doi]', 'S1522472499901216 [pii]']",,,['CA67722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently described that OSM inhibits growth and changes cell morphology of human glioma cell lines. Although leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor components are also expressed by these cells, the response to LIF was significantly weaker compared to OSM. We have therefore analyzed the signal transduction pathways induced by these cytokines. While OSM induces a number of strong tyrosine phosphorylations, including Janus tyrosine kinases (Jak) and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins, LIF induces only minor tyrosine phosphorylation of Tyk2 and Stat3. Specific activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 as well as the mitogen-activated kinase 2 (MAPK2) was found in glioma cells upon OSM treatment. MAPK2 turns out to be a crucial mediator of the OSM effect in glioma cells since inhibition of MAPK activity by the Mek1 inhibitor PD98059 blocks the OSM-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis by about 70%.","['Halfter, H', 'Friedrich, M', 'Postert, C', 'Ringelstein, E B', 'Stogbauer, F']","['Halfter H', 'Friedrich M', 'Postert C', 'Ringelstein EB', 'Stogbauer F']","['Clinic of Neurology, Westf.

An unexpected band with SDS-PAGE electrophoretic mobility indicating a protein of about 47 kDa was apparent on the 24-hour western blots that were developed using antibodies that recognize MYC protein C terminal epitopes. No inhibition of the approximately 2400 nt c-myc mRNA expression was observed by northern hybridization, a result of the inability of morpholino analogs to direct the activity of ribonuclease H. In fact, high molecular weight c-myc RNA species were found to have accumulated in antisense-treated KYO1 cells. Control sense and scrambled antisense morpholino analogs did not inhibit MYC protein expression or induce the appearance of the anomalous RNA and protein bands. Molecular analyses by RT-PCR and sequencing revealed that the morpholino antisense effector had (1) inhibited splicing of the c-myc pre-mRNA, (2) induced missplicing of the pre-mRNA, and (3) inhibited translation of normal spliced c-myc mRNA.

Retinoids such as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) have been shown to increase the sensitivity of acute myelogenous leukemic (AML) blast cells to ara-C. To investigate the mechanism of this sensitisation, the hypothesis was tested that ATRA augments cellular ara-CTP levels in human-derived myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of ATRA and 13-cis-retinoic acid on ara-CTP accumulation and ara-C-induced apoptosis was studied. Ara-CTP levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), cytotoxicity by the tetrazolium (MTT) assay, and apoptosis by occurrence of DNA fragmentation (gel electrophoresis), cell shrinkage and DNA loss (flow cytometry). RESULTS: Pretreatment of HL-60 cells with ATRA (0.01-1 microM) caused a significant decrease in intracellular ara-CTP levels; e.g., incubation for 72 hours with ATRA 1 microM prior to one hour ara-C 10 microM reduced ara-CTP levels to 41% +/- 4% of control. Similar results were obtained after preincubation with 13-cis-retinoic acid. In spite of decreased ara-CTP levels, the cytotoxicity of the combination was supraadditive and ATRA augmented ara-C-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: At therapeutically relevant concentrations ATRA increased ara-C cytotoxicity and ara-C induced apoptosis but this augmentation is not the corollary of elevated ara-CTP levels. The feasibility of ara-C treatment optimisation via strategies other than those involving elevation of ara-CTP levels should be investigated further.","['Freund, A', 'Rossig, C', 'Lanvers, C', 'Gescher, A', 'Hohenlochter, B', 'Jurgens, H', 'Boos, J']","['Freund A', 'Rossig C', 'Lanvers C', 'Gescher A', 'Hohenlochter B', 'Jurgens H', 'Boos J']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1999/06/04 00:00,1999/06/04 00:01,['1999/06/04 00:00'],"['1999/06/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1999 Mar;10(3):335-8. doi: 10.1023/a:1008365714942.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,"['10.1023/a:1008365714942 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)57120-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A diagnosis of accelerated phase CML was made. Administration of prednisolone, vincristine, hydroxyurea, and Ara-C and irradiation of the lumbar spine were started. Two months later, the patients achieved hematologic response and the size of his tumors decreased. Thereafter, we started IFN-alpha treatment (3-6 x 10(6) units daily) by intramuscular injection. After 8 weeks of this treatment, the patient complained of worsening dysesthesia in his feet. An axonal form of peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed by electrophysiological examination. Immunological studies revealed decreased complement levels and type III mixed cryoglobulinemia. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy alleviated the neurological symptoms and lowered the cryoglobulin levels. The clinical course suggested that mixed cryoglobulinemia was associated with CML and that the increase in cryoglobulin levels was caused by IFN-alpha and played a causative role in the worsening peripheral neuropathy.

In common with all other haemopoietic cells, stem cells are mobile, and it is this property of mobility that has allowed bone marrow transplantation to become a routine clinical option. Successful transplantation requires haemopoietic stem cells to home to the bone marrow, leave the peripheral circulation and become stabilized in regulatory niches in the extravascular space of the bone marrow cavity. This homing and tethering process is reversible - haemopoietic stem cells can be released from their bone marrow tethering through changes in molecular interactions, which are also important in homing following transplantation. The molecular mechanisms regulating this two-way flow of stem cells are beginning to be elucidated, and much recent data has emerged that sheds light on the processes and molecules involved in these complex physiological events.

The complete remission (CR) rate was comparable to classic inductions (68% after ICE; 84% after ICE-FLAN I). To mobilize PBSC, 19 patients received 10 microg/kg/d of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) starting at day 13 after FLAN, 13 (69%) of whom were found to be nonmobilizers. When a second G-CSF administration was performed in 10/13 patients mobilization was either not achieved (8/10) or was considered insufficient (<1 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg) (2/10) and all 13 were subsequently submitted to bone marrow harvest. The harvest was considered adequate in 12/13 (92%) patients and autologous BMT (ABMT) has so far been performed in 10/12 cases with a mean of 8.6 x 108/kg nucleated reinfused cells. The median times to neutrophil and platelet recovery after ABMT did not significantly differ from those of two previous series of patients treated with ABMT without fludarabine-containing regimens. Adequate amounts of PBSC were obtained in 6/19 (31%) patients, who were then reinfused. Median times for platelet recovery were significantly longer than in a previous series of 26 AML cases reinfused with PBSC after treatment with the ICE-NOVIA induction/consolidation regimen (125 v 20 d to 20 x 109 plt/l, P < 0.02; 218 v 37 d to 50 x 109 plt/l, P < 0.02).

This control is altered in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), compared to that of normal human lymphocytes which mainly showed high apoptotic values after irradiation, but in some cases no sensitivity was observed. Interestingly, lactacystin activated the apoptotic pathway in both radio-resistant and sensitive CLL cells, at doses which had no effect in normal cells where significantly higher concentrations were required. Therefore the resistance of some CLL cells to apoptosis initiation by radiation does not correlate to observed increased sensitivity to lactacystin. The nuclear level of the transcription factor NF-kappaB or the cytoplasmic level of IkappaBalpha remained unaltered upon irradiation or lactacystin CLL cells treatment, suggesting that the activity of the other factors involved in apoptotic death control were altered through proteasomal inhibition. These results strongly suggest an essential role of the ubiquitin system in apoptotic cell death control in CLL lymphocytes. The inhibition of proteasome-ubiquitin-dependent processing could be a discriminatory apoptotic stimulus between normal versus malignant lymphocytes and therefore might potentially be of use in this specific human pathology.","['Masdehors, P', 'Omura, S', 'Merle-Beral, H', 'Mentz, F', 'Cosset, J M', 'Dumont, J', 'Magdelenat, H', 'Delic, J']","['Masdehors P', 'Omura S', 'Merle-Beral H', 'Mentz F', 'Cosset JM', 'Dumont J', 'Magdelenat H', 'Delic J']","['Laboratoire de Recherche Correspondant no. 2 du CEA (DSV/DRR FAR), Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jun;105(3):752-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01388.x.,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,"['bjh1388 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01388.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Knowing the clonality pattern of residual tumourous clones during treatment could help understand disease evolution and aid therapeutic decisions. We developed a sensitive and semi-quantitative molecular analysis of these clones in ATLL patients. DNA samples from PBMCs derived from eight ATLL patients were studied over time by quadruplicate linker mediated PCR (LMPCR) amplification of HTLV-1 integration sites. Patients were treated with combination chemotherapy, zidovudine-interferon-alpha and/or by peripheral stem cell transplantation or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Persistence of tumourous clones at a high frequency (>1/300 PBMCs) was frequently observed, even in complete responders, and was invariably correlated with relapse and/or poor outcome. Fluctuation in the frequency of some tumourous clones was observed with evidence for clonal change under treatment in one patient, indicating that treatment of ATLL can result in the selection of resistant clones. Finally, allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using an HTLV-1 infected sibling as donor was found to be associated with long-lasting disappearance of tumourous clones and a possible cure of the disease. Long-term persistent clonal expansion of circulating HTLV-1 bearing T cells which derived from the donor bone marrow was evidenced in this patient. In conclusion, variable success in treatment of ATLL is probably due to the clonal heterogeneity which results in the selection of resistant clones. Semi-quantitative assessment of residual disease (RD) through LMPCR may predict treatment failure. Accordingly, additional therapy may be tailored to the clonality pattern observed after first-line therapy.","['Leclercq, I', 'Mortreux, F', 'Morschhauser, F', 'Duthilleul, P', 'Desgranges, C', 'Gessain, A', 'Cavrois, M', 'Vernant, J P', 'Hermine, O', 'Wattel, E']","['Leclercq I', 'Mortreux F', 'Morschhauser F', 'Duthilleul P', 'Desgranges C', 'Gessain A', 'Cavrois M', 'Vernant JP', 'Hermine O', 'Wattel E']","['Unite 124 INSERM, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology/therapy']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jun;105(3):743-51. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01389.x.,,,,"['bjh1389 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01389.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of IL-3 to culture containing MS-10 cells enhanced the survival of pre-B ALL cells in all cases, whereas addition of IL-7 augmented the survival of pre-B ALL cells of some cases of stage III and all cases of stage IV. The survival of pre-B ALL cells was also supported by the conditioned media of MS-10 cells. Stromal-cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1) supported the survival of pre-B ALL cells. Effects of the conditioned media of MS-10 cells were abrogated by an anti-SDF-1 neutralizing antibody. The extent of survival of pre-B ALL cells supported by stromal cells and IL-3 and IL-7, correlated with the expression level of bcl-2 protein.

However, the efficacy of 6MP is significantly influenced by inactivation by the polymorphic enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). In the general population 89-94% have high TPMT activity, 6-11% have intermediate activity, and approximately 0.3% have low activity. Individuals with low-activity experience severe or fatal toxicity with standard 6MP doses. Prospective identification of this group of patients might prevent this problem. Recent identification of the molecular basis for low TPMT activity enabled rapid assessment of altered 6MP metabolism by PCR methods. This study evaluated the frequency of mutant TPMT alleles in 147 children with ALL. One patient was homozygous mutant (0.7%), and 16 patients were heterozygous for variant TPMT alleles (10.9%). The majority of mutant alleles were TPMT*3A. Both the allele frequency and the pattern of TPMT mutations were similar to that observed in an adult British population. The number of weeks when 6MP therapy was administered at full dose was determined in patients on MRC UKALL X and XI. The 94 patients spent a median 11% of the maintenance period receiving no therapy as a result of haematological toxicity. There was no significant difference in the number of weeks when no therapy could be administered among patients with a wild-type or heterozygous genotype. However, the one patient with a homozygous mutant genotype had severe haematological toxicity and no therapy could be administered for 53% of the maintenance period. This study demonstrates that 11.6% of the children had variant TPMT alleles. Prospective identification of TPMT genotype may be a promising tool for decreasing excessive haematological toxicity in individuals with low activity.","['McLeod, H L', 'Coulthard, S', 'Thomas, A E', 'Pritchard, S C', 'King, D J', 'Richards, S M', 'Eden, O B', 'Hall, A G', 'Gibson, B E']","['McLeod HL', 'Coulthard S', 'Thomas AE', 'Pritchard SC', 'King DJ', 'Richards SM', 'Eden OB', 'Hall AG', 'Gibson BE']","['Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Foresterhill, Aberdeen. h.l.mcleod@abdn.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jun;105(3):696-700. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01416.x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",,,"['bjh1416 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01416.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since immature B-cell precursors (BCP) are assumed to correspond to some extent to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) cells with respect to patterns of phenotypic differentiation, we wondered whether the particular maturation-associated expression patterns of CD99 in the normal BCP stages were conserved also in malignant cells. Therefore we compared malignant and physiological B cells from paediatric ALL/NHL and normal BM samples with respect to CD99 expression using selective gating and semi-quantitative flow cytometry. Common-ALLs (n = 45) were similar to their corresponding, very immature BCPs (stage 1) in expressing very high levels of CD99. Most pre-B ALLs (n = 16) were also CD99hi and thus differed from the patterns found in normal cytoplasmic mu-chain+ (cmu+) pre-B cells (stage 2, CD99lo). In particular, we found that those pre-B-ALL cases which were CD34+ also showed higher CD99 expression than the CD34- cases. This prompted us to investigate the levels of CD99 in those rare normal BCPs which also coexpress CD34 and cmu; these cells, which are transitory from stage 1 to stage 2, were found also CD99hi, thus precisely reflecting the patterns of CD34+ pre-B ALLs. The blasts of Burkitt-type B-cell ALL/NHL samples (n = 13) expressed considerably less CD99, similarly to the more differentiated BCP stages 2 (cmu+) and 3 (surface mu-chain+). In summary, we found that paediatric B-lineage malignancies display remarkable synchrony regarding the levels of CD99 expression compared to their putative normal counterparts.","['Dworzak, M N', 'Fritsch, G', 'Fleischer, C', 'Printz, D', 'Froschl, G', 'Buchinger, P', 'Mann, G', 'Gadner, H']","['Dworzak MN', 'Fritsch G', 'Fleischer C', 'Printz D', 'Froschl G', 'Buchinger P', 'Mann G', 'Gadner H']","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St Anna Kinderspital, Vienna, Austria. dworzak@ccri.univie.ac.at""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/*metabolism', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*metabolism']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1999 Jun;105(3):690-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01426.x.,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)']",,,"['bjh1426 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.1999.01426.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The incidence of leukemic transformation was significantly high in patients with shortened TRF length (P < 0.05). In addition, patients with shortened TRF length were frequently seen in the IPSS high-risk group (P < 0.01). Most of the MDS patients had normal-to-low levels of telomerase activity, suggesting that changes in TRF length rather than telomerase activity may more accurately reflect the pathophysiology of MDS. MDS patients with shortened TRF length had a very poor prognosis (P < 0.01), suggesting that telomere dynamics may be linked to clinical outcome in MDS patients. Thus, an abnormal mechanism of telomere maintenance in subgroups of MDS patients may be an early indication of genomic instability. This study demonstrates that telomere stability is frequently impaired in a high-risk group of MDS patients and suggests that, in combination with the IPSS classification system, measurement of TRFs may be useful in the future to stratify MDS patients according to risk and manage the care of MDS patients.","['Ohyashiki, J H', 'Iwama, H', 'Yahata, N', 'Ando, K', 'Hayashi, S', 'Shay, J W', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Ohyashiki JH', 'Iwama H', 'Yahata N', 'Ando K', 'Hayashi S', 'Shay JW', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/enzymology/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precancerous Conditions/enzymology/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Telomerase/analysis', 'Telomere/*ultrastructure']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 May;5(5):1155-60.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the production of these two enzymes as well as the membrane-type MMP (MT1-MMP) and the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 in the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 24), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; n = 17), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS; n = 8), and healthy donors (n = 5). Zymographic analysis of BM-MNC-conditioned medium showed that a Mr 92,000 gelatinolytic activity, identified as MMP-9 by Western blotting, was constitutively released from cells of all patients and healthy individuals examined in this study. In contrast, MMP-2 secretion was found to be absent in all samples from healthy donors but present in 8 of 11 (73%) of the samples from patients with primary AML, 7 of 8 (88%) with secondary AML, and only 1 of 5 (20%) cases with AML in remission, indicating MMP-2 to be produced by the leukemic blasts. MMP-2 release was not detected in CML cell-conditioned medium with the exception of two cases, both patients either being in or preceding blast crisis. In MDS, MMP-2 was found in three of eight (38%) of the patients, two of them undergoing progression of disease within 12 months. Quantitative Northern blot analysis in freshly isolated BM-MNCs showed a relatively low constitutive expression of TIMP-1 in all samples, whereas MMP-9 gene transcription was higher in healthy donors and CML samples, than in AML and MDS. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis revealed the presence of TIMP-2 mRNA in the majority of MMP-2-releasing BM-MNCs. MT1-MMP expression was present in most samples of patients with MDS or AML but absent in those with secondary AML and CML. Thus, we have shown that BM-MNCs continuously produce MMP-9 and TIMP-1 and demonstrated that leukemic blast cells additionally secrete MMP-2 representing a potential marker for dissemination in myeloproliferative malignancies.","['Ries, C', 'Loher, F', 'Zang, C', 'Ismair, M G', 'Petrides, P E']","['Ries C', 'Loher F', 'Zang C', 'Ismair MG', 'Petrides PE']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Munich Medical School Grosshadern, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blast Crisis/enzymology/pathology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagenases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases, Membrane-Associated', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*enzymology/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/enzymology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 1999 May;5(5):1115-24.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '127497-59-0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-2)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Collagenases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases, Membrane-Associated)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we sought to determine the clinical characteristics and prognostic significance of ERM in AML. ERM was determined for 268 patients who had leukemic blasts available for molecular analysis. ERM was measured by Southern blot analysis, and results were obtained for 261 patients (ages 17-69). ERM ranged from 0-99.1%, with a median of 25%. One hundred sixty patients (61%) had ERM values over 15% and were considered ERM+. In a subset of patients analyzed, ERM+ samples had markedly lower ER gene expression compared with ERM- samples. In multiple regression analyses of patient and disease characteristics at diagnosis, two factors had significant independent association with ERM: ERM decreased with increasing age (P = 0.0001) and was significantly lower in patients with French-American-British classification M4 or M5 (P = 0.0019). In regression analyses of outcome measures, ERM had no significant impact on complete remission rate after initial induction therapy. However, ERM+ patients had significantly better overall survival [OS; 18% at 6 years; 95% confidence interval (CI), 12-24% versus 9%; CI, 3-14% for ERM- patients; P = 0.022]. In multiple regression analyses, OS increased with increasing ERM (P = 0.0044). Similar results were seen for relapse-free survival (23% at 6 years; CI, 15-32% for ERM+ versus 10%; CI, 2-19% for ERM-), although the effect of ERM was not statistically significant (P = 0.15 in multiple regression analysis).

These specialized cytotoxic granules also contain calreticulin, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein. The calcium-independent association of perforin and calreticulin prompted our evaluation of calreticulin's potential to function as a regulatory molecule that protects cytotoxic lymphocytes from their own perforin. We report here that 10(-7) M calreticulin blocked perforin-mediated lysis in the hemolytic model system using erythrocytes as targets. Previously, we found that millimolar levels of calcium in the hemolytic assays dissociate high-affinity perforin-calreticulin complexes, which makes it unlikely that perforin associates with calreticulin in solution when hemolysis is blocked. Calreticulin may affect perforin at the erythrocyte membrane. We observed calcium-dependent binding of calreticulin to erythrocyte membranes with a Kd of 2.7 x 10(-7) M and a saturation average of 10(5) molecules calreticulin per erythrocyte. At concentrations that blocked hemolysis, calreticulin occupied many of the calreticulin membrane-binding sites and was in molar excess of perforin. These observations open the possibilities that membrane-bound calreticulin prevents hydrophobic entry of perforin into membranes and (or) prevents perforin from assembling into polyperforin pores.","['Fraser, S A', 'Michalak, M', 'Welch, W H', 'Hudig, D']","['Fraser SA', 'Michalak M', 'Welch WH', 'Hudig D']","['Cell and Molecular Biology Program, University of Nevada, Reno 89557-0046, USA. saf@scs.unr.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,IM,,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Calreticulin', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*physiology', 'Hemolysis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1998;76(5):881-7. doi: 10.1139/bcb-76-5-881.,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)']",,,['10.1139/bcb-76-5-881 [doi]'],,,"['R01 CA38942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09563/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of the concentrative nucleoside transporters has been hampered by the presence in most cells and tissues of multiple transporters with overlapping permeant specificities. With the recent cloning of cDNAs encoding rat and human members of the concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) family, it is now possible to study the concentrative transporters in isolation by use of functional expression systems. We report here the isolation of a nucleoside transport-deficient subline of L1210 mouse leukemia (L1210/DNC3) that is a suitable recipient for stable expression of cloned nucleoside transporter cDNAs. We have used L1210/DNC3 as the recipient in gene transfer studies to develop a stable cell line (L1210/DU5) that produces the recombinant concentrative nucleoside transporter with selectivity for pyrimidine nucleosides (CNT1) that was initially identified in rat intestine (Q.Q. Huang, S.Y. Yao, M.W. Ritzel, A.R.P. Paterson, C.E. Cass, and J.D. Young. 1994. J. Biol. Chem. 269: 17,757-17,760). L1210/DU5 was used to examine the permeant selectivity of recombinant rat CNT1 by comparing a series of nucleoside analogs with respect to (i) inhibition of inward fluxes of [3H]thymidine, (ii) initial rates of transport of 3H-analog, and (iii) cytotoxicity to L1210/DU5 versus the parental transport-deficient cell line. By all three criteria, recombinant CNT1 transported 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and 5-fluorouridine well and cytosine arabinoside poorly. Although some purine nucleosides (2'-deoxyadenosinedeoxyadeno-2'-deoxyadenosine, 7-deazaadenosine) were potent inhibitors of CNT1, they were poor permeants when uptake was measured directly by analysis of isotopic fluxes or indirectly by comparison of cytotoxicity ratios. We conclude that comparison of analog cytotoxicity to L1210/DU5 versus L1210/DNC3 is a reliable indirect predictor of transportability, suggesting that cytotoxicity assays with a panel of such cell lines, each with a different recombinant nucleoside transporter, would be a valuable tool in the development of antiviral and antitumor nucleoside analogs.","['Crawford, C R', 'Cass, C E', 'Young, J D', 'Belt, J A']","['Crawford CR', 'Cass CE', 'Young JD', 'Belt JA']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Canada,Biochem Cell Biol,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,8606068,IM,,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Ion Transport', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Cell Biol. 1998;76(5):843-51. doi: 10.1139/bcb-76-5-843.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)']",,,['10.1139/bcb-76-5-843 [doi]'],,,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Eight patients had acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia, being de novo in five of them. The median value of hemoglobin was 87 g/l (range: 51-148), white blood cells count 5.8 x 10(9)/l (1.2-47.1) and platelet count 34 x 10(9)/l (5-182).

Lesions may be non-specific and even regress spontaneously, misleading diagnosis and delaying care. CASE REPORT: A infant in good health had diffuse ecchymotic maculae at birth which totally regressed within 10 days. On day 20, a macular rash and three violet nodules developed. The physical examination found enlarged nodes, liver enlargement and poor general status. Blood cell counts and the myelogram led to the diagnosis of type 5 acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML 5). Search for extension revealed cutaneous leukemia and meningeal and renal involvement. DISCUSSION: The predominance of myelocyte forms is specific for neonatal leukemia (AML 5 and 4). Specific skin lesions are frequent (25 to 30 p. 100 of cases) and sometimes precede (7 p. 100) anomalies in peripheral and medullary smears. Skin biopsy with direct smear can provide rapid diagnosis. Classically subcutaneous nodules or bluish macropapulae give the blueberry muffin baby aspect. The polymorphous features and the remarkably fluctuating skin lesions in our case are unusual, especially since the infant did not have spontaneously reversible neonatal leukemia, a rare unpredictable phenomenon described in newborns with a normal phenotype which can mislead therapeutic management.","['Rybojad, M', 'Bredoux, H', 'Vignon-Pennamen, M D', 'Prigent, F', 'Morel, P', 'Bourrat, E']","['Rybojad M', 'Bredoux H', 'Vignon-Pennamen MD', 'Prigent F', 'Morel P', 'Bourrat E']","['Policlinique du Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Leucemie monoblastique neonatale revelee par des lesions cutanees specifiques transitoires.,France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*congenital/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 1999 Feb;126(2):157-9.,,,,['MDOI-AD-02-1999-126-2-0151-9638-101019-ART11 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypes of 33 samples from patients with acute leukemia were analyzed using a panel of these monoclonal antibodies: anti-immature/stem cell (HLA-DR, CD34); anti-mature myeloid (CD33, CD15); anti-T lymphoid (CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD8), and anti-B lymphoid (CD10, CD19, CD20). Of the 63 samples, 33 (52%) contained germline C mu transcripts: 2/2 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia; 17/26 (65.4%) patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia; all 4 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis and 1 in accelerated phase; 9/12 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia. A clear correlation between germline transcripts and HLA-DR expression was observed among germline-positive cases (p < 0. 01). C mu expression and response to therapy clearly indicated that germline-mu-positive leukemia patients responded poorly to chemotherapy and had a worse clinical prognosis compared with C mu-negative patients (p < 0.01). After two courses of chemotherapy, 7/9 C mu-negative patients achieved complete remission compared to only 7/29 C mu-positive patients (p < 0.01). We conclude that the gene-regulating immunoglobulin germline C mu may be amplified in myeloid and B-lymphoid cells during leukemogenesis. Such genetic changes may be correlated with cellular terminal differentiation injury, resistance to chemotherapy and uncontrolled malignant cell proliferation.","['Dong, L', 'Guo, M', 'Huang, S M', 'Jia, S Q', 'Wang, H']","['Dong L', 'Guo M', 'Huang SM', 'Jia SQ', 'Wang H']","[""Department of Hematology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics/immunology', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1999/06/03 10:00,2000/08/16 11:00,['1999/06/03 10:00'],"['1999/06/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/08/16 11:00 [medline]', '1999/06/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1999;101(3):119-23. doi: 10.1159/000040936.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,"['40936 [pii]', '10.1159/000040936 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because IL-2 may be produced in the vicinity of CD8+ CTLs when Ag is limiting at the end of an immune response, we have examined the effect of culturing viral-specific CTL clones in IL-2 in the absence of antigenic stimulation. Limiting dilution analysis revealed a high precursor frequency for CTL clones derived from IL-2 propagation (termed CTL-factor dependent (FD)) that are dependent upon exogenous IL-2 for growth and survival and no longer require TCR stimulation to proliferate. Culturing CTL-FDs with infected splenocytes presenting Ag and IL-2 did not revert the clones but did lead to a TCR-induced inhibition of proliferation. The derived CTL-FDs have lost the ability to kill via the perforin/granule exocytosis mechanism of killing, although they express similar levels of TCR, CD3epsilon, CD8alphabeta, CD45, and LFA-1 compared with the parental clones. The CTL-FDs retain Fas ligand/Fas-mediated cytotoxicity, and IFN-gamma production and regulate the expression of CD69 and IL-2Ralpha when triggered through the TCR. A parental CTL protected BALB/c mice from a lethal challenge of influenza virus, whereas a CTL-FD did not. These findings represent a novel regulatory function of IL-2 in vitro that, if functional in vivo, may serve to down-regulate cellular immune responses.","['Gullo, C A', 'Esser, M T', 'Fuller, C L', 'Lam Braciale, V']","['Gullo CA', 'Esser MT', 'Fuller CL', 'Lam Braciale V']","['Department of Microbiology, Beirne B.

Clonal analysis and sensitization with reversed phase-HPLC fractions revealed that there were Dd- and Ld-binding peptides recognized by RM2-1 CTLs. Lysis by bulk CTLs stimulated against RLmale symbol1 and limiting dilution analysis suggested that the pRL1a peptide was dominantly recognized to the RM2-1 peptides by CTLs on RLmale symbol1 cells. The rejection response against the parental RLmale symbol1 tumor was much less than that against RM2-1 cells in either CB6F1 or BALB/c mice, suggesting that the presence of altered Akt molecules from which the dominant pRL1a peptide was derived inhibited the rejection response against RLmale symbol1. Depletion of CD4 T cells caused the regression of RLmale symbol1 at the doses in which the tumor grew in untreated mice. The generation of pRL1a CTLs was inhibited in RLmale symbol1-bearing mice. Thus, immunoregulatory CD4 T cells were most likely activated by the altered Akt molecules and inhibited the efficient generation of CTLs against the dominant pRL1a Ag in RLmale symbol1.","['Matsuo, M', 'Wada, H', 'Honda, S', 'Tawara, I', 'Uenaka, A', 'Kanematsu, T', 'Nakayama, E']","['Matsuo M', 'Wada H', 'Honda S', 'Tawara I', 'Uenaka A', 'Kanematsu T', 'Nakayama E']","['Department of Parasitology and Immunology, Okayama University Medical School, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Clone Cells', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Genes, Dominant/immunology', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Injections, Intradermal', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peptides/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/immunology/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Escape/*immunology']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jun 1;162(11):6420-5.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cells from the same clone are frequently detected in several lymphoid compartments of the same mouse. We now report the phenotype of all ten stable B cell clonal populations detected in five 20-month-old C57BL/6 mice. These clonal B cells appear to develop in the periphery and nine of the ten B cell clonal populations expressed the CD5 cell surface marker. Stable B cell expansions may be dominated by cells at two stages of differentiation. Some B cell populations were detected with DNA as well as RNA and represent large clonal populations of B cells, detectable in several lymphoid compartments. These populations are found predominantly in B cell populations expressing CD45R/B220 and the mRNA coding for the membrane-bound form of the mu Ig heavy chain, which suggests a predominance of B lymphocytes in these populations.

We have examined the roles of CD28:B7 and CTLA-4:B7 on in vivo alloresponses. A critical role of B7:CD28 was demonstrated by markedly compromised expansion of CD28-deficient T cells and diminished graft-versus-host disease lethality of limited numbers of purified CD4+ or CD8+ T cells. When high numbers of T cells were infused, the requirement for CD28:B7 interaction was lessened. In lethally irradiated recipients, anti-CTLA-4 mAb enhanced in vivo donor T cell expansion, but did not affect, on a per cell basis, anti-host proliferative or CTL responses of donor T cells. Graft-versus-host lethality was accelerated by anti-CTLA-4 mAb infusion given early post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT), mostly in a CD28-dependent fashion. Donor T cells obtained from anti-CTLA-4 mAb-treated recipients were skewed toward a Th2 phenotype. Enhanced T cell expansion in mAb-treated recipients was strikingly advantageous in the graft-versus-leukemia effects of delayed donor lymphocyte infusion. In two different systems, anti-CTLA-4 mAb enhanced the rejection of allogeneic T cell-depleted marrow infused into sublethally irradiated recipients. We conclude that blockade of the selective CD28-B7 interactions early post-BMT, which preserve CTLA-4:B7 interactions, would be preferable to blocking both pathways. For later post-BMT, the selective blockade of CTLA-4:B7 interactions provides a potent and previously unidentified means for augmenting the GVL effect of delayed donor lymphocyte infusion.","['Blazar, B R', 'Taylor, P A', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A', 'Sharpe, A H', 'Vallera, D A']","['Blazar BR', 'Taylor PA', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Sharpe AH', 'Vallera DA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,,"['Abatacept', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Blocking/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/immunology/*physiology', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology/*physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology/mortality', 'CD28 Antigens/genetics/*physiology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality', 'Graft vs Tumor Effect/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens/administration & dosage/*immunology', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Postoperative Period', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*immunology', 'Spleen/transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1999 Jun 1;162(11):6368-77.,"['0 (Antibodies, Blocking)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (Ctla4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",,,,,,"['R01 AI-43395/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-56067/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the induction of anergy can inactivate specific sets of alloreactive T cells in the donor marrow. Previous work has shown that anergy can be induced by blocking the interaction of the B7 molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells with the CD28 molecule on the surface of T cells, thus preventing key signaling events essential for the activation of T cells. To investigate the feasibility of this approach with respect to transplantation of histoincompatible bone marrow, we undertook a clinical trial of ex vivo induction of anergy in T cells present in donor marrow to recipient alloantigens. METHODS: Outcomes in 12 transplant recipients were evaluated. The recipients' peripheral-blood lymphocytes were collected before myeloablation and served as alloantigen-presenting cells. To induce alloantigen-specific anergy, bone marrow from a donor mismatched with the recipient for one HLA haplotype was cocultured with irradiated cells from the recipient for 36 hours in the presence of CTLA-4-Ig, an agent that inhibits B7:CD28-mediated costimulation. After conventional myeloablation and immunoprophylaxis, the treated donor cells were transfused into the recipient. RESULTS: After the induction of anergy, the frequency of T cells capable of recognizing alloantigens of the recipient in donor marrow was sharply reduced (P<0.001), whereas the responsiveness to alloantigens from persons unrelated to the recipient or the donor was unaffected (P=0.51). In the 11 patients who could be evaluated, the haploidentical bone marrow cells engrafted. Of these 11 patients, 3 had acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) confined to the gastrointestinal tract. No deaths were attributable to GVHD. Five of the 12 patients were alive and in remission 4.5 to 29 months after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Donor bone marrow treated ex vivo to induce anergy to alloantigens from the recipient can reconstitute hematopoiesis in vivo with a relatively low risk of GVHD.","['Guinan, E C', 'Boussiotis, V A', 'Neuberg, D', 'Brennan, L L', 'Hirano, N', 'Nadler, L M', 'Gribben, J G']","['Guinan EC', 'Boussiotis VA', 'Neuberg D', 'Brennan LL', 'Hirano N', 'Nadler LM', 'Gribben JG']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. evavguinan@dfci.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,,"['Abatacept', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Histocompatibility/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Immunoconjugates', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*drug effects/immunology', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1999/06/03 10:00,2000/05/20 09:00,['1999/06/03 10:00'],"['1999/06/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2000/05/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/06/03 10:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1999 Jun 3;340(22):1704-14. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199906033402202.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",,"['N Engl J Med. 1999 Jun 3;340(22):1754-6.

Both direct costs (e.g. costs for medication and hospitalisation) and indirect costs (e.g. lost productivity costs and reduced quality of life) are important parameters to assess, as are the costs of chronic adverse effects, research and development costs for new agents, and costs of procedure-related deaths. Complete remission, cure and survival are the 'success' response criteria for acute leukaemia treatments, in addition to prolonged life with acceptable quality of life for patients with incurable acute leukaemia. Death is 'failure', caused either by resistant disease (relapse and progressive disease) inspite of optimal chemotherapy or, sometimes, by insufficient treatment. All of these parameters should be taken into account when a pharmacoeconomic evaluation is performed (either for administrative or scientific purposes) in order to ensure a comprehensive and reliable background for the evaluation in question. Treatment of acute leukaemia is expensive with a total cost of about $US3000 per patient per day during the induction. Although 80% of children with acute leukaemia are cured, only less than 50% of adults are cured. Thus, a great cost is associated with death during treatment and only optimal medical treatment with full-scale combination chemotherapy and full supportive treatment can keep the number of deaths to a minimum.","['Jonsson, V', 'Hansen, M M', 'Ljungman, P', 'Kaasa, S']","['Jonsson V', 'Hansen MM', 'Ljungman P', 'Kaasa S']","['Department of Haematology, Finsen Center, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. viggojrh@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Economics, Pharmaceutical', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*economics/epidemiology']",1999/06/03 00:00,1999/06/03 00:01,['1999/06/03 00:00'],"['1999/06/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/03 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1999 Feb;15(2):167-78. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199915020-00005.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,['10.2165/00019053-199915020-00005 [doi]'],,,,48,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with other European countries, the incidence of lung cancer and leukemia in Spain are one of the lowest, but it is rapidly increasing. The incidence of urinary bladder and larynx cancer, on the contrary, are one of the highest. Few studies on occupational cancer have been conducted in Spain. The main problems are the availability of death certificates and the quality of the information on occupation in mortality of statistics.

Ex vivo tests were correlated with disease stage and prior treatment, and were repeated as patients became resistant to alkylating agents, fludarabine and VAD chemotherapy (infusion of vincristine, dox, and oral dexamethasone). The majority of patients (64.4%) were in early stage and were untreated (62.2%). P-glycoprotein (p-gp 170) was detected most frequently by the monoclonal antibody MRK-16 (48%) and by functional modulation of dox retention by PSC-833 (40.6%) and by functional modulation of the MTT assay with vincristine (0.29) and dox (0.39) with PSC-833 at 1.0 microg/mL. Functional modulation of dox retention with PSC-833 was significantly associated with stage, but not with either the MTT assay or any of the monoclonal antibodies. None of the tests correlated with prior chlorambucil treatment. Correlation of dox retention with the monoclonal antibodies was mild to moderate and became stronger following chlorambucil treatment. Three patients who became resistant to VAD were found to express p-gp 170. We conclude that MDR can frequently be detected in patients with CLL. Furthermore, the expression of p-gp 170 increases with advancing stage, but not prior alkylating agent therapy. The functional expression of p-gp 170 increases with advancing stage and prior treatment and correlates well with monoclonal antibody detection (especially MRK-16). Patients who become resistant to VAD more frequently express p-gp 170 by a variety of techniques. PSC-833 is a more potent modulator of MDR than cyclosporin-A (CsA) ex vivo, and correlates better with stage of disease.","['Friedenberg, W R', 'Spencer, S K', 'Musser, C', 'Hogan, T F', 'Rodvold, K A', 'Rushing, D A', 'Mazza, J J', 'Tewksbury, D A', 'Marx, J J']","['Friedenberg WR', 'Spencer SK', 'Musser C', 'Hogan TF', 'Rodvold KA', 'Rushing DA', 'Mazza JJ', 'Tewksbury DA', 'Marx JJ']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Marshfield Clinic, WI, USA. wfriedenberg@clinic.guthrie.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1999/06/01 00:00,1999/06/01 00:01,['1999/06/01 00:00'],"['1999/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jun;34(1-2):171-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199909083394.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,['10.3109/10428199909083394 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty three patients aged 70 years and older received 1 to 6 courses of 2-CdA (median 3) in a dose of 0.12 mg/kg daily for 5 consecutive days. Thirty three of them were untreated and 10 had relapsed or refractory to disease after prior therapy with chlorambucil, COP and CHOP. Complete response (CR) was achieved in 13 (30.2%) and partial response (PR) in 17 (39.6%) patients, giving an overall response rate of 69.8%. The difference in overall response rate between both groups were not statistically significant (69.8% and 50%, respectively). The most frequent side effects of 2-CdA treatment were thrombocytopenia observed in 18 (41.9%) and infections in 7 (16.3%) patients. Drug related neutropenia was observed in 6 (13.9%) and allergic dermatitis in 2 patients. Six (13.9%) patients died, one because of drug related thrombocytopenia resulting in a central nervous system hemorrhage, two because of pneumonia and two of cardiovascular complications. In conclusion, our results suggest that 2-CdA is also effective treatment for elderly patients with CLL.

Expression of the c-kit receptor was present in 63% of all AML investigated. Among these an immature immunophenotype was more frequent and 30% had a CD34+/CD15- and 37% a CD34+/CD14- phenotype, whereas only 9% and 10% showed these phenotypes in the c-kit receptor negative group, respectively. C-kit receptor expression ranged average in M0 and M1 subtypes (69% versus 70%) but was less pronounced among M5 subtypes (21%). Results of karyotyping were available in 280 patients. C-kit receptor expression occurred in 37 of 42 (88%) patients with favorable cytogenetic abnormalities such as t(8;21), t(15;17) or inv(16) which exceeded the expression rate in patients with intermediate risk, poor risk or other abnormalities. Information about the clinical outcome was available in 228 patients treated according to the protocols of two German multicenter trials (AML-BFM, AMLCG). We found no difference of CR-rate or event-free survival (EFS) in adults with or without c-kit receptor expression. Children with c-kit receptor negative AML had a lower CR-rate and EFS, but also a lower median age and a higher frequency of M5 subtype as compared to children with c-kit receptor expression. In conclusion, analysis of c-kit receptor expression may help to identify phenotypically immature AML but fails to identify myeloid differentiation of leukemic blasts in approximately one third of patients. We found no evidence of an adverse prognosis in AML patients with c-kit receptor expression. Analysis for c-kit receptor expression does not appear to add information to established prognostic parameters in AML.","['Schwartz, S', 'Heinecke, A', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Creutzig, U', 'Schoch, C', 'Harbott, J', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Loffler, H', 'Buchner, T', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Thiel, E']","['Schwartz S', 'Heinecke A', 'Zimmermann M', 'Creutzig U', 'Schoch C', 'Harbott J', 'Fonatsch C', 'Loffler H', 'Buchner T', 'Ludwig WD', 'Thiel E']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Hamatologie, Onkologie und Transfusionsmedizin, Klinikum Benjamin Franklin, Freie Universitat, Berlin, Germany. schwart2@zedat.fu-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors']",1999/06/01 00:00,1999/06/01 00:01,['1999/06/01 00:00'],"['1999/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jun;34(1-2):85-94. doi: 10.3109/10428199909083383.,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)'],,,['10.3109/10428199909083383 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in molecular biology have provided us new insights into the pathogenesis of this neoplasm at the genetic level, such as the deregulation of the protooncogenes adjoining the immunoglobulin gene (Ig) loci, which is a specific event in mature B-cell tumors. Moreover, involvement of certain protooncogenes corresponds to certain subtypes of NHL. Recently, we found that t(9;14)(p13;q32) chromosomal translocation associated with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) juxtaposes PAX-5 gene encoding for an essential transcription factor (BSAP: B-cell specific activator protein) for B-cell proliferation and differentiation to the Ig heavy chain gene (IgH) locus. This results in deregulated expression of the PAX-5 mRNA. We also developed a diagnostic FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) procedure which is able to detect 80% of the widely scattering 9p13 breakpoints involved in this translocation. Thus, an understanding of the PAX-5 gene's physiological role in B-cell development and the pathological role in tumorigenesis may lead to the optimal clinical treatment strategy for LPL and LPL-derived diffuse large cell lymphoma (DLCL).","['Iida, S', 'Rao, P H', 'Ueda, R', 'Chaganti, R S', 'Dalla-Favera, R']","['Iida S', 'Rao PH', 'Ueda R', 'Chaganti RS', 'Dalla-Favera R']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA. iida@med.nagoya-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Animals', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/06/01 00:00,1999/06/01 00:01,['1999/06/01 00:00'],"['1999/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 Jun;34(1-2):25-33. doi: 10.3109/10428199909083377.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['10.3109/10428199909083377 [doi]'],,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,

A typical cytogenetic alteration known as Philadelphia Chromosome (Ph1), a 9:22 chromosomic translocation which produces a hybrid gene BCR/ABL, is present in 95% of the patients. Nineteen CML patients (9 female and 10 male) underwent Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT). Median age was 32 years (range 9 to 47); 15 of them were in chronic phase (CP), and 4 in accelerated phase (AP). At diagnosis, all patients were Ph1+, BCR/ABL+. The conditioning regimen consisted of busulphan and cyclophosphamide while patients in AP received etoposide as well. Seventeen patients received cyclosporine A, methotrexate and methylprednisone as prophylaxis for Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD) while 2 patients received only the first two drugs. The 9.22 translocation was determined by means of RT-PCT technique using the primers NB1+, Abl3, B2A, CA3 and A2. The sensitivity of the method was 1 x 10(-6). Among the 19 patients who entered the protocol, 14 are alive and in clinical, hematological and cytogenetic remission (Ph1-) and 3 patients died due to acute GVHD, 1 due to graft failure and 1 due to Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome. Of the 4 transplanted patients in AP, 3 are alive and in complete remission. The patients had a 74% survival, with a median follow-up of 655 days. Complete hematopoietic chimerism was demonstrated in 16 patients, with the study of 3 loci, D1S80, APO B and D17S30. No relationship was found between post BMT hybrid BCR/ABL (RT.PCR) persistence and disease relapse; the presence of acute and/or chronic GVHD did not influence the BCR/ABL positivity. In our experience, BMT has proved to be the only therapeutic alternative for CML with complete clinical, hematological and cytogenetic remission and a mean survival of 74%, comparable to the international experience.","['Milone, J H', 'Bordone, J', 'Etchegoyen, O', 'Napal, J', 'Prates, M V', 'Morales, V H']","['Milone JH', 'Bordone J', 'Etchegoyen O', 'Napal J', 'Prates MV', 'Morales VH']","['Instituto de Transplante de Medula Osea (ITMO), Fundacion Dr. Jose M.

We previously reported the isolation of EC cell lines that express a neomycin resistance (neo) gene introduced by a recombinant transducing Moloney murine leukemia virus from specific integration sites, Minta, Mintb, Mintc, or Mintd. In some of these clones, the entire 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) was deleted, and the neo gene was expressed by read-through transcription from upstream cellular promoters in a ""promoter-trap"" fashion. One such promoter (""promoter B"" at the Mintb locus) was found in a CpG island, associated with an upstream enhancer (""enhancer B""). Although enhancer B caused expression of the neo gene in the transductant EC cell line, no endogenous transcription from promoter B was detected in the parental EC or NIH3T3 cells. In contrast, we found a strong counter-flow endogenous transcription unit (""R"" for reverse), which apparently interfered with transcription from promoter B. Promoter R turned out to have a bidirectional activity in transfection assays. In normal tissues, promoter R activates gene R, which encodes an 800-residue protein that is highly homologous to the rat and human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U). Northern and in situ hybridization analyses revealed that gene R was abundantly expressed in the testis, especially in the pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids.","['Matsui, M', 'Breau, W C', 'Iwasaki, S', 'Hagiwara, S', 'Tamai, Y', 'Mori, C', 'Bloom, M L', 'Jerry, M B', 'Eddy, E M', 'Taketo, M M']","['Matsui M', 'Breau WC', 'Iwasaki S', 'Hagiwara S', 'Tamai Y', 'Mori C', 'Bloom ML', 'Jerry MB', 'Eddy EM', 'Taketo MM']","['Laboratory of Biomedical Genetics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Ribonucleoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Testis/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1999/06/01 00:00,1999/06/01 00:01,['1999/06/01 00:00'],"['1999/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1999/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 1999 Jun;125(6):1104-14. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022392.,"['0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoprotein U)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a022392 [doi]'],,,['CA39652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['GENBANK/X51436', 'GENBANK/X51437']",,,,,,,,,,,

Evolution of the CML to the more agressive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is accompanied by increased cellular proliferation and genomic instability at the cytogenetic level. We hypothezised that genomic instability at the nucleotide level and spontaneous error in DNA replication may also contribute to the evolution of CML to AML. Murine Ba/F3 cell line was transfected with the p190 and p210-encoding BCR-ABL oncogenes, and spontaneous mutation frequency at the Na-K-ATPase and the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) loci were measured. A significant 3-5-fold increase in mutation frequency for the transfected cells relative to the untransfected control cells was found. Furthermore, we observed that BCR-ABL transfection induced an overexpression of DNA polymerase beta, the most inaccurate of the mammalian DNA polymerases, as well as an increase in its activity, suggesting that inaccuracy of DNA replication may account for the observed mutator phenotype. These data suggest that the Philadelphia abnormality confers a mutator phenotype and may have implications for the potential role of DNA polymerase beta in this process.","['Canitrot, Y', 'Lautier, D', 'Laurent, G', 'Frechet, M', 'Ahmed, A', 'Turhan, A G', 'Salles, B', 'Cazaux, C', 'Hoffmann, J S']","['Canitrot Y', 'Lautier D', 'Laurent G', 'Frechet M', 'Ahmed A', 'Turhan AG', 'Salles B', 'Cazaux C', 'Hoffmann JS']","['Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, UPR CNRS 9062, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Polymerase beta/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Apr 29;18(17):2676-80. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202619.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase beta)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202619 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1-transformed T-cell lines expressed higher amounts of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 RNA and proteins than virus-negative T cells. The expression of STAT1 and STAT5 in a human T-cell line was induced by Tax. IL-2 induced the DNA binding activity of STAT3 and STAT5 of a HTLV-1-transformed cell line and then stimulated its proliferation. In contrast, IL-2 did neither in a cell line lacking STAT3 and STAT5. The expression of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 mRNAs were also induced by a T-cell mitogen in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our results suggest that the induction of STAT1 and STAT5 by Tax enhances cytokine-induced functions of virus-infected T-cells, hence the induction may play a role in IL-2-dependent transformation steps of T-cells by HTLV-1.","['Nakamura, N', 'Fujii, M', 'Tsukahara, T', 'Arai, M', 'Ohashi, T', 'Wakao, H', 'Kannagi, M', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Nakamura N', 'Fujii M', 'Tsukahara T', 'Arai M', 'Ohashi T', 'Wakao H', 'Kannagi M', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Apr 29;18(17):2667-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202608.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202608 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since ascorbic acid represents a major antioxidant in CSF, we have now determined this parameter in CSF of two patients with the infantile form of NCL (Santavuori-Haltia disease).

This results in multiple exposures to anesthetic agents over a short period of time. We report a consecutive series of children anesthetized for external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). METHODS: Five hundred twelve children < or = 16 years old received EBRT from January 1983 to February 1996. Patient demographics, diagnosis, anesthesia techniques, monitoring, airway management, complications, and outcome were recorded for the patients requiring anesthesia. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-three of the 512 children (24%) required 141 courses of EBRT with anesthesia. Anesthetized patients ranged in age from 20 days to 11 years (mean 2.6 +/- 1.8 ). The frequency of a child receiving EBRT and requiring anesthesia by age cohort was: < or = 1 year (96%), 1-2 years (93%), 2-3 years (80%), 3-4 years (51%), 4-5 years (36%), 5-6 years (13%), 6-7 years (11%), and 7-16 years (0.7%). Diagnoses included: primary CNS tumor (28%), retinoblastoma (27%), neuroblastoma (20%), acute leukemia (9%), rhabdomyosarcoma (6%), and Wilms' tumor (4%). Sixty-three percent of the patients had been exposed to chemotherapy prior to EBRT. The mean number of anesthesia sessions per patient was 22 +/- 16. Seventy-eight percent of the treatment courses were once daily and 22% were twice daily. Anesthesia techniques included: short-acting barbiturate induction + inhalation maintenance (21%), inhalation only (20%), ketamine (19%), propofol only (12%), propofol induction + inhalation maintenance (7%), ketamine induction + inhalation maintenance (6%), ketamine or short-acting barbiturate induction + inhalation maintenance (6%). Monitoring techniques included: EKG (95%), O2 saturation (93%), fraction of inspired O2 (57%), and end-tidal CO2 (55%). Sixty-four percent of patients had central venous access. Eleven of the 74 children with a central line developed sepsis (15%): 6 of the 11 were anesthetized with propofol (55%), 4 with a short-acting barbiturate induction plus inhalation maintenance (36%), and 1 with inhalation alone (9%). Eight of the 11 (73%) received prior chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Anesthesia was generally necessary at < or = 3 years, and rarely required at > 5 years of age. Sepsis associated with frequent use of the central venous access line was seen in 15% of the patients with these lines.","['Fortney, J T', 'Halperin, E C', 'Hertz, C M', 'Schulman, S R']","['Fortney JT', 'Halperin EC', 'Hertz CM', 'Schulman SR']","['Department of Anesthesiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,,"['Anesthesia Recovery Period', 'Anesthesia, General/adverse effects/*statistics & numerical data', 'Anesthesia, Inhalation/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1999 Jun 1;44(3):587-91. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(99)00058-9.,,,,"['S0360-3016(99)00058-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(99)00058-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In autologous stem cell transplantation, the risk of reinfusion of clonogenic tumor cells is a remarkable biologic obstacle that can be at least partly overcome by ex vivo graft purging to reduce residual tumor. Mafosfamide and 4-hydroxyperoxycyclophosphamide, active metabolites of cyclophosphamide, are the most widely used pharmacologic agents for ex vivo bone marrow purging. However, in addition to killing tumor cells, they are toxic to normal bone marrow as measured by reduced colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM). Thus, the therapeutic index of these alkylating agents is narrow, and parameters for dose selection must include toxicity to normal bone marrow progenitor cells that can delay bone marrow engraftment and increase risk of infections, bleeding complications, hospitalization, and the need for a costly transplantation procedure. Amifostine (WR-2771, Ethyol; Alza Pharmaceuticals, Palo Alto, CA/US Bioscience, West Conshohocken, PA) selectively protects human CFU-GM progenitor cells from the cytotoxicities of active metabolites of cyclophosphamide without altering its cytotoxic effect on malignant cells. This has been demonstrated both in preclinical and clinical studies in patients with breast cancer, malignant lymphomas, and acute leukemia. Amifostine use during the ex vivo procedure significantly shortened the time to bone marrow engraftment with decreased incidence of infections and need for red blood cell transfusions.","['Balzarotti, M', 'Grisanti, S', 'Granzow, K', 'Saladini, A', 'Sala, A', 'Nozza, A', 'Molteni, A', 'Passamonti, F', 'Carlo-Stella, C', 'Santoro, A', 'Siena, S']","['Balzarotti M', 'Grisanti S', 'Granzow K', 'Saladini A', 'Sala A', 'Nozza A', 'Molteni A', 'Passamonti F', 'Carlo-Stella C', 'Santoro A', 'Siena S']","['Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Istituto Clinico Humanitas, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,IM,,"['Amifostine/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Cytoprotection', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Protective Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1999 Apr;26(2 Suppl 7):66-71.,"['0 (Protective Agents)', 'M487QF2F4V (Amifostine)']",,,,,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent investigations have given rise to new potential applications of amifostine in hematologic malignancies. Amifostine appears to exert a sustained mitogenic effect in primitive hematopoietic progenitors that results in a significant increase in colony-forming capacity. Amifostine also retards cell loss and delays commitment to apoptosis initiated by cytokine deprivation, suggesting that amifostine has trophic effects similar to the hematopoietic cytokines. The abilities to prolong progenitor survival and to delay apoptosis under conditions of cellular stress make amifostine an attractive agent for investigation in bone marrow failure states. Amifostine promotes more effective hematopoiesis in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, although additional investigation is needed to further define the optimal dose and schedule of administration. Furthermore, amifostine may selectively enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in leukemia progenitors. When the sensitivity of leukemic and normal progenitors to mafosfamide was evaluated with and without amifostine pretreatment, amifostine effectively protected normal myeloid and erythroid progenitors while increasing leukemic cell kill. Thus, amifostine represents a unique agent with promising potential for therapeutic application in hematologic malignancies.

Characterizing DCs from ten CML patients by flow cytometry, we found that these cells are highly positive for HLA-DR, CD1a, CD23, and CD80 and negative for CD14, CD15, and CD16. The yield of DCs ranged from 19.5 to 68%. In addition, we used a functional test of FITC-dextran uptake to verify that early DCs take up large particles (0.5-3 microm) by macropinocytosis while monocytes do not. FITC-dextran uptake was detected by flow cytometry, showing that DCs had accumulated these fluorescent particles. Electron-microscopic analysis showed no major morphological differences between normal and CML-derived DCs. Furthermore, cultured DCs were isolated by FAC sorting for CD1a and HLA-DR expression. In these highly purified cells the Ph chromosome was detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and by fluorescence immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics as a tool for the investigation of neoplasms (FICTION); 30-85% of DCs generated were Ph-chromosome positive. It might therefore be possible not only to prime T-cells with bcr/abl-specific synthetic peptides, but also to stimulate T-cells directly with Ph-positive DCs. Use of DCs might serve as a novel therapeutic approach in CML patients, due to their ability to induce highly specific T-cell responses in an autologous system.","['Heinzinger, M', 'Waller, C F', 'von den Berg, A', 'Rosenstiel, A', 'Lange, W']","['Heinzinger M', 'Waller CF', 'von den Berg A', 'Rosenstiel A', 'Lange W']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division', 'Dendritic Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Dextrans', 'Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Apr;78(4):181-6. doi: 10.1007/s002770050497.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",,,['10.1007/s002770050497 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proliferation responses of eight autonomously growing AML cell lines and eight primary AML blast cell samples were compared with their IL-6 and sIL-6R expression. Only three of the 16 AML samples were influenced by IL-6, two of them being stimulated and one inhibited by it. The sIL-6R-induced responses were more frequent, however, and, in contrast to those by IL-6, always stimulatory: clonogenic cell growth in six of the 16 AML samples was stimulated by sIL-6R treatment. All the cell lines and four of the seven primary blast cell samples analyzed expressed IL-6, and the expression was associated with unresponsiveness to exogenous IL-6. sIL-6R was also frequently expressed by AML cells: only one of the samples was negative for it. However, there was no correlation between sIL-6R expression and the responsiveness of cells to exogenous sIL-6R. The work presented here shows that sIL-6R is able to stimulate blast cell growth in AML. As AML blast cells are provided by exogenous IL-6 and sIL-6R in a bone marrow environment, and as many of them also express IL-6 and sIL-6R themselves in vitro, it is possible that signaling through the IL-6/sIL-6R system plays a role in maintaining their growth also in vivo.","['Saily, M', 'Koistinen, P', 'Savolainen, E R']","['Saily M', 'Koistinen P', 'Savolainen ER']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology', 'Solubility', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Apr;78(4):173-9. doi: 10.1007/s002770050496.,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)']",,,['10.1007/s002770050496 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferation was assessed with the methyl-thiazole-tetrazolium (MTT) assay and other parameters. Cellular resistance to cytarabine, thioguanine, and prednisolone was measured using the MTT assay. In 19 samples containing >90% leukemic cells the proliferative response and the modulation of drug resistance was markedly heterogeneous between patient samples and between growth factors. All growth factors were able to stimulate proliferation significantly after 5 days of culture. lmw-BCGF was the most potent growth factor in this respect. Cytotoxicity of cytarabine and thioguanine was significantly increased by IL-7, that of thioguanine by IL-3 as well. IL-7 enhanced the cytotoxicity of thioguanine significantly more than IL-3 and lmw-BCGF and that of cytarabine more than IL-3. Cytotoxicity of prednisolone was not significantly influenced by any growth factor. In individual cases, growth factors reduced the cytotoxicity of the drugs. IL-3 + 7 did not add activity to the most potent single growth factor in both proliferation and drug resistance measurements.

For rapid and easy detection of the clinically most important gene rearrangements, a nested multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (multiplex PCR) was developed. This multiplex PCR enables the detection of M-BCR/ABL, m-BCR/ABL, TEL/ AML1, and MLL/AF4 fusion transcripts in one PCR reaction. However, the existence of splicing variants and different breakpoints on the DNA level hampers the discrimination of the rearrangements by their fragment size on an agarose gel. Therefore, one of the internal primers of each translocation (ABL-2, TEL-2, AF4-2) was labeled with a characteristic fluorescent dye, and an automatic fluorescence-based DNA fragment analysis was performed. The sensitivity of this multiplex PCR is in the same range as that of the corresponding single PCR reaction and allows a fast screening for the detection of therapy-relevant rearrangements, with a high turnover of samples.","['Viehmann, S', 'Borkhardt, A', 'Lampert, F', 'Harbott, J']","['Viehmann S', 'Borkhardt A', 'Lampert F', 'Harbott J']","[""Oncogenetic Laboratory, Children's Hospital, University of Giessen, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1999 Apr;78(4):157-62. doi: 10.1007/s002770050494.,['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,['10.1007/s002770050494 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the 1alpha,25-lactone analogues (23S)-25-dehydro-1alpha-hydroxyvitamin-D3-26,23-lactone (TEI-9647), and (23R)-25-dehydro-1alpha-hydroxyvitamin-D3-26,23-lactone (TEI-9648) bound much more strongly to the VDR than the natural (23S, 25R)-1alpha,25(OH)2D3-26,23-lactone, but did not induce cell differentiation even at high concentrations (10(-6) M). Intriguingly, the differentiation of HL-60 cells induced by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 was inhibited by either TEI-9647 or TEI-9648 but not by the natural lactone. In contrast, retinoic acid or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced HL-60 cell differentiation was not blocked by TEI-9647 or TEI-9648. In separate studies, TEI-9647 (10(-7) M) was found to be an effective antagonist of both 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 (10(-8) M) mediated induction of p21(WAF1, CIP1) in HL-60 cells and activation of the luciferase reporter assay in COS-7 cells transfected with cDNA containing the DRE of the rat 25(OH)D3-24-hydroxylase gene and cDNA of the human VDR. Collectively the results strongly suggest that our novel 1alpha,25-lactone analogues, TEI-9647 and TEI-9648, are specific antagonists of 1alpha, 25(OH)2D3 action, specifically VDR/DRE-mediated genomic action.

Neonatal rat/murine cardiomyocytes were cultured on malleable silicone dishes and were stretched by 20%. Mechanical stretch induced rapid phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, Tyk2, STAT1, STAT3, and glycoprotein 130 as early as 2 minutes and peaked at 5 to 15 minutes. It also caused gel mobility shift of sis-inducing element, which was supershifted by preincubation with anti-STAT3 antibody. Preincubation with CV11974 (AT1 blocker) partially inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1, but not that of STAT3. Preincubation with TAK044 (endothelin-1-type A/B-receptor blocker) did not attenuate this pathway. RX435 (anti-glycoprotein 130 blocking antibody) inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT3 and partially inhibited that of STAT1. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 was strongly inhibited by HOE642 (Na+/H+ exchanger inhibitor) and BAPTA-AM (intracellular calcium chelator), but not by gadolinium (stretch-activated ion channel inhibitor), EGTA (extracellular Ca2+ chelator), or KN62 (Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II inhibitor). Chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) partially inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3. Mechanical stretch also augmented the mRNA expression of cardiotrophin-1, interleukin-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor at 60 to 120 minutes. These results indicated that the JAK/STAT pathway was activated by mechanical stretch, and that this activation was partially dependent on autocrine/paracrine-secreted angiotensin II and was mainly dependent on the interleukin-6 family of cytokines but was independent of endothelin-1. Moreover, certain levels of intracellular Ca2+ were necessary for stretch-induced activation of this pathway, and protein kinase C was also partially involved in this activation.","['Pan, J', 'Fukuda, K', 'Saito, M', 'Matsuzaki, J', 'Kodama, H', 'Sano, M', 'Takahashi, T', 'Kato, T', 'Ogawa, S']","['Pan J', 'Fukuda K', 'Saito M', 'Matsuzaki J', 'Kodama H', 'Sano M', 'Takahashi T', 'Kato T', 'Ogawa S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Circ Res,Circulation research,0047103,IM,,"['Angiotensin II/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Autocrine Communication/physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cardiomegaly/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Endothelin-1/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Muscle Fibers, Skeletal/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Myocardial Contraction/*physiology', 'Myocardium/cytology/*enzymology', 'Paracrine Communication/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase/metabolism', 'Stress, Mechanical', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Circ Res. 1999 May 28;84(10):1127-36. doi: 10.1161/01.res.84.10.1127.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11128-99-7 (Angiotensin II)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 7.2.2.13 (Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,['10.1161/01.res.84.10.1127 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The titres of IL-1beta IL-6, TNF-alpha and IL-3 were measured in the supernatants of these cultures with ELISA tests. Comparing the percentage of cells in S-phases of control cultures and cultures with IL-3, the leukaemias were divided into two growth pattern groups: IL-3-insensitive (n=19) and IL-3-sensitive (n=34) leukaemias. The IL-3-insensitive AML cells show a greater ability for autonomous growth, first by the increase of S-phase in the control culture compared with the S-phase in vivo (P=0.0486) and second, by the higher constitutive secretion (control culture) of IL-1beta P =0.0004), IL-6 ( P =0.0395) and TNF-alpha P=0.0005). The IL-3-induced secondary cytokine secretion is also different in the two growth pattern groups. Whereas in the IL-3-insensitive AML cells a moderate increase of IL-1beta (1.48-fold increase) was present, in the IL-3-sensitive AML cells a 4.72-fold increase of IL-1beta 2.71-fold increase of IL-6 and 11.81-fold increase of the TNF-alpha titre could be detected. Overall, the data show an inverse correlation between the ability of AML cells to respond to IL-3 with increase of an S-phase and the constitutive secretion of IL-1beta, II-6 and TNF-alpha. A further effect of IL-3 is the induction of secondary cytokine secretion in the bone marrow of IL-3-sensitive growing AML cells.","['Nowak, R', 'Oelschlagel, U', 'Gurth, H', 'Range, U', 'Albrecht, S', 'Krebs, U', 'Hietschold, V', 'Ehninger, G']","['Nowak R', 'Oelschlagel U', 'Gurth H', 'Range U', 'Albrecht S', 'Krebs U', 'Hietschold V', 'Ehninger G']","['Medical Clinic I, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-3/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Linear Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1999 Jun;11(6):435-42. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1998.0445.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,"['S1043-4666(98)90445-8 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1998.0445 [doi]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, this compound exhibits limited toxicity toward tumor cells in vitro because it does not readily diffuse across cell membranes. We describe an efficient method for indirectly delivering the enzyme inhibitor into murine leukemia L1210 cells via acyl interchange between intracellular glutathione and the cell-permeable prodrug S-(N-p-chlorophenyl-N-hydroxycarbamoyl)ethylsulfoxide. The second-order rate constant for the acyl-interchange reaction in a cell-free system is 1.84 mM-1 min-1 (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 5% ethanol, pH 7.5, 25 degrees C). Incubation of L1210 cells with the sulfoxide in vitro results in a rapid increase in the intracellular concentration of the glyoxalase I inhibitor (kapp = 1. 41 +/- 0.03 min-1 (37 degrees C)) and inhibition of cell growth (GI50 = 0.5 +/- 0.1 microM). This represents an improvement in both efficiency and potency over the dialkyl ester prodrug strategy in which the inhibitor is indirectly delivered into tumor cells as the [glycyl,glutamyl] diethyl or dicyclopentyl esters. The fact that pi-glutathione transferase catalyzes the acyl-interchange reaction between GSH and the sulfoxide suggests that the sulfoxide, or related compounds, might exhibit greater selective toxicity toward tumor cells that overexpress the transferase.","['Hamilton, D S', 'Kavarana, M J', 'Sharkey, E M', 'Eiseman, J L', 'Creighton, D J']","['Hamilton DS', 'Kavarana MJ', 'Sharkey EM', 'Eiseman JL', 'Creighton DJ']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Placenta/chemistry', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/29 00:00,1999/05/29 00:01,['1999/05/29 00:00'],"['1999/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1999 May 20;42(10):1823-7. doi: 10.1021/jm980712o.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (S-(N-4-chlorophenyl-N--hydroxycarbamoyl)glutathione dicyclopentyl ester)', '0 (S-(N-4-chlorophenyl-N-hydroxycarbamoyl)glutathione)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,"['10.1021/jm980712o [doi]', 'jm980712o [pii]']",,,['CA 59612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Cohort study of children of nuclear industry employees. SETTING: Nuclear establishments operated by the Atomic Energy Authority, Atomic Weapons Establishment, and British Nuclear Fuels. SUBJECTS: 39 557 children of male employees and 8883 children of female employees. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cancer incidence in offspring reported by parents. Employment and radiation monitoring data (including annual external dose) supplied by the nuclear authorities. RESULTS: 111 cancers were reported, of which 28 were leukaemia. The estimated standardised incidence ratios for children of male and female employees who were born in 1965 or later were 98 (95% confidence interval 73 to 129) and 96 (50 to 168) for all malignancies and 109 (61 to 180) and 95 (20 to 277) for leukaemia. The leukaemia rate in children whose fathers had accumulated a preconceptual dose of >/=100 mSv was 5.8 times that in children conceived before their fathers' employment in the nuclear industry (95% confidence interval 1.3 to 24.8) but this was based on only three exposed cases. Two of these cases were included in the west Cumbrian (""Gardner"") case-control study. No significant trends were found between increasing dose and leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer in young people is rare, and our results are based on small numbers of events. Overall, the findings suggest that the incidence of cancer and leukaemia among children of nuclear industry employees is similar to that in the general population. The possibility that exposure of fathers to relatively high doses of ionising radiation before their child's conception might be related to an increased risk of leukaemia in their offspring could not be disproved, but this result was based on only three cases, two of which have been previously reported.

For this reason, fever is treated as soon as possible with broad spectrum antibacterial therapy. The objective of this study was to conduct a cost analysis in Italy comparing 2 empiric glycoprotein-containing antibacterial regimens for the treatment of febrile neutropenia in patients with acute leukaemia. DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective cost analysis was conducted, using the records of 527 febrile neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia who participated in an 18-month multicentre (29 Italian haematological units) randomised trial during 1991. All patients received either of the following 2 empiric intravenous regimens, each containing 3 antibacterial agents: ceftazidime (2 g, 3 times daily) and amikacin (15 mg/kg/day, in 3 separate doses) plus teicoplanin (6 mg/kg, in a single dose) or vancomycin (30 mg/kg/day, in 2 separate doses). Economic analyses were carried out from a hospital perspective. Only the direct costs per patient, i.e. mean antibacterial treatment and management cost, mean overall treatment failure cost and mean cost of adverse effects, were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES AND RESULTS: No differences were found in the clinical response, defined as the improvement in the rate of fever or infection (if documented), between the 2 regimens. However, tolerability, defined as the incidence of adverse effects probably or definitely related to the assigned treatment, was reported to be better with the teicoplanin-rather than the vancomycin-containing regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Thus retrospective cost analysis showed that despite the higher acquisition cost of teicoplanin relative to vancomycin, the lower incidence of adverse effects associated with teicoplanin and its ease of administration (single daily dose) resulted in equivalent overall treatment costs between teicoplanin- and vancomycin containing regimens.","['Bucaneve, G', 'Menichetti, F', 'Del Favero, A']","['Bucaneve G', 'Menichetti F', 'Del Favero A']","['Istituto di Medicina Interna e Scienze Oncologiche, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy. clime@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,New Zealand,Pharmacoeconomics,PharmacoEconomics,9212404,,,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', '*Glycopeptides', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*economics', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy/*economics/etiology', 'Treatment Outcome']",1999/05/27 00:00,1999/05/27 00:01,['1999/05/27 00:00'],"['1999/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pharmacoeconomics. 1999 Jan;15(1):85-95. doi: 10.2165/00019053-199915010-00006.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glycopeptides)']",,,['10.2165/00019053-199915010-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although their precise mechanism of action is unknown, ALPs primarily act on the cell membrane, where they inhibit signaling through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Because stimulation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway is essential for radiation-induced apoptosis in certain cell types, we tested the effect of ALPs in combination with ionizing radiation on MAPK/SAPK signaling and apoptosis induction. Here, we present data showing that three ALPs, 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine, hexadecylphosphocholine, and the novel compound octadecyl-(1,1-dimethyl-piperidinio-4-yl)-phosphate (D-21266) induce time- and dose-dependent apoptosis in the human leukemia cell lines U937 and Jurkat T but not in normal vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, in combination with radiation, ALPs strongly enhance the induction of apoptosis in both leukemic cell lines. All tested ALPs not only prevented MAPK activation, but, like radiation, stimulated the SAPK/JNK cascade within minutes. A dominant-negative mutant of c-Jun inhibited radiation- and ALP-induced apoptosis, indicating a requirement for the SAPK/JNK pathway. Our data support the view that ALPs and ionizing radiation cause an enhanced apoptotic effect by modulating the balance between the mitogenic, antiapoptotic MAPK, and the apoptotic SAPK/JNK pathways. This type of modulation of specific signal transduction pathways in tumor cells may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.","['Ruiter, G A', 'Zerp, S F', 'Bartelink, H', 'van Blitterswijk, W J', 'Verheij, M']","['Ruiter GA', 'Zerp SF', 'Bartelink H', 'van Blitterswijk WJ', 'Verheij M']","['Department of Radiotherapy, Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Ziekenhuis/The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 12', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', '*Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Phospholipid Ethers/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/radiation effects']",1999/05/27 00:00,1999/05/27 00:01,['1999/05/27 00:00'],"['1999/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1999 May 15;59(10):2457-63.,"['0 (Phospholipid Ethers)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '1Y6SNA8L5S (edelfosine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', '53EY29W7EC (miltefosine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 12)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The breakpoints of the different rearrangements segregate into two clusters: inversion on the centromeric side and simple balanced translocations on the telomeric side. If the target gene activated by these different types of chromosomal rearrangements is the same, the gene must reside between the two clusters of breakpoints in a region of approximately 160 kb. By screening of a placenta cDNA library using genomic probes derived from the vicinity of TCL1 locus, we have identified a gene coding for a 1.7-kb transcript that is expressed in leukemic cells carrying a t(14;14)(q11;q32) chromosome translocation.

In order to avoid graft failure and increased risk of relapse associated with this approach, we initiated a pilot study of T-cell depletion of the marrow graft combined with reinfusion of a fixed quantity of CD2+ peripheral blood T-cells. Depletion technique consisted in negative purging using CD2 and CD7 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) followed by rabbit complement cytolysis.

We report here the development of a novel centrifugal assay for fluorescence-based cell adhesion (CAFCA) that offers a number of advantages over the currently available assays. CAFCA is based on two centrifugation steps: one to allow for the synchronization of the initial cell-substratum contact and one to enable both a defined removal force to be exerted onto the cells for displacement of unbound cells and determination of the relative binding strengths of adhering cells. The fluorescently tagged cells are monitored in specifically devised, disposable microplate assemblies by a two-sided fluorescence detection through the computer-interfaced SPECTRAFLUOR microplate fluorometer. The assay is rapid, accurate, reproducible and adaptable to small numbers of delicate primary cells that can ideally be labeled with the fluorochrome calcein AM (or analogous vital fluorescent dyes). Most uniquely, CAFCA provides (i) means of assessing the precise number of cells bound to a given substratum out of the total amount of cells contained within the population to be analyzed and (ii) a means of establishing the attachment strengths (i.e., dynes/cell) in a high number of samples/conditions simultaneously. CAFCA is therefore expected to make a substantial methodological and conceptual contribution to the range of available assays aimed at examining cellular interactions in vitro and promises the potential of being able to transpose automated versions of these tests for routine use in laboratories.","['Giacomello, E', 'Neumayer, J', 'Colombatti, A', 'Perris, R']","['Giacomello E', 'Neumayer J', 'Colombatti A', 'Perris R']","['Centro di Riferimento Oncologico Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,IM,,"['Animals', 'Biotechnology', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation/instrumentation/*methods', 'Culture Media', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Mice']",1999/05/27 00:00,1999/05/27 00:01,['1999/05/27 00:00'],"['1999/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Biotechniques. 1999 Apr;26(4):758-62, 764-6. doi: 10.2144/99264pf01.",['0 (Culture Media)'],,,['10.2144/99264pf01 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies were conducted in multiple cell lines to identify the specific phosphorylated serines as a prelude to functional analysis. The phosphorylation pattern of Tax was found to be different in 293T and COS-7 cells in comparison with MT-4 and Px-1 cells. However, one tryptic fragment remained consistent in comigration analyses among all cell lines. Using selected Tax serine mutants a tryptic fragment containing a serine at residue 113 believed to be the site of phosphorylation of Tax did not comigrate with the common phosphorylated tryptic fragment. Analysis of selected Tax mutants for ability to trans-activate the cytomegalovirus promoter demonstrated mutation of serine 77 to alanine reduced trans-activation by 90% compared to wild-type Tax. However, examination of the phosphorylation pattern of the serine 77 mutant demonstrated that it is not the site of phosphorylation.

The increase of CD15 expression on myeloid cells, together with the steady expression of CD34 and CD117 antigens in Casel(AML M1) , is suggestive of aberrant CD34 + CD117 + CD15 + cells, which may indicate the leukemic origin of the maturing myeloid cells.

Because idarubicin is less vulnerable to MDR1-mediated transport and could thereby represent a better companion to MDR1 inhibitors, we assessed the ability of the anti-MDR1 agent cyclosporin A to modulate this function in multidrug resistant T-lymphoblastic CEM cells challenged in vitro with either daunorubicin or idarubicin. In order to obtain information of potential interest for the design of a clinical trial, we adopted drug plus metabolite concentrations and exposure times close to the in vivo pharmacokinetics of equimyelotoxic doses of intravenous daunorubicin 45 mg/m2 or idarubicin 10-12 mg/m2, respectively, plus infusional cyclosporin A 16 mg/kg/d. Study methods were cytofluorimetry for the detection of intracellular drug uptake, retention and pro-apoptotic effects (binding of fluoresceinated annexin V), and the standard MTT assay as growth inhibition test. The results showed significantly greater drug uptake (at 30'), retention (at 12 hours), and apoptotic cell rates with idarubicin+/-idarubicinol than daunorubicin+/-daunorubicinol (p<0.05), and a further potentiation of these effects by cyclosporin A. Differing from daunorubicin, idarubicin intracellular accumulation and, by inference, related apoptotic changes were increased by cyclosporin A only in the early phase of drug-cell interaction; a potential advantage towards a reduced toxicity by CsA delivered as short rather than prolonged infusion in the in vivo setting. MTT assay results were also in favour of idarubicin but greatly influenced by cyclosporin A itself. Altogether, study results in MDR1+ cells incubated with CsA 1500 ng/ml plus idarubicin+idarubicinol 100+20 ng/ml, that are peak levels achievable in vivo with an idarubicin dose > or = 12 mg/m2 plus cyclosporin A 16 mg/kg/d, were in the range of those obtained with standard-dose daunorubicin in MDR1- cells (p=n.s.). In summary, an idarubicin plus short-course cyclosporin A combination could be considered for the management of MDR1+ leukemias, where it may represent a more effective and less toxic option than daunorubicin plus continuous infusion cyclosporin A.","['Chiodini, B', 'Bassan, R', 'Barbui, T']","['Chiodini B', 'Bassan R', 'Barbui T']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 May;33(5-6):485-97. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058453.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,['10.3109/10428199909058453 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study is to evaluate, on the basis of intention to treat, the feasibility and efficacy of high-dose cytarabine/anthracycline consolidation chemotherapy followed by autologous transplantation of chemotherapy/rHuG-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells for seventeen adult patients (median age 63, range 27 to 68) with secondary acute myelogenous leukemia in first remission. Ten eligible patients underwent autologous transplantation of peripheral blood progenitor cells procured following high-dose cytarabine/mitoxantrone consolidation chemotherapy used as a method of in vivo purging. A median of 5 collections (range 2 to 13) were required to procure a median of 9.27 x 10(8) total mononuclear cells/kg (range 2.35 to 21.44 x 10(8) per kg). The median number of CD34-positive progenitor cells was 1.18 x 10(6) kg (range 0.34 to 30.9 x 10(6) kg). After preparative conditioning with 11.25 Gy total body radiation and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and autologous transplantation, the median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery were 18 days (range 12 to 29 days) and 25 days (range 8 to 158+ days), respectively. After a median follow-up for surviving patients of 33.4 months (range 7.5 to 54 months), 9 of 17 patients (53%) remain alive with 7 in continued first remission. The median remission duration is 13 months (3 to 53 months) and actuarial leukemia-free survival at 3 years is 51+/-25%. Toxicity of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplant included serious liver and pulmonary toxicity in 2 and 1 patient, respectively.

Since then, EBV has also been associated with infectious mononucleosis, AIDS and transplant-related B cell lymphomas, and nasopharyngeal cancer. The virus has further been linked with T cell lymphomas, Hodgkin disease, and NK leukemia or LGL leukemia, establishing a concept of a wide spectrum of EBV associated malignant disorders. EBV DNA encodes several proteins such as EBNA1-6, LMP 1, 2 and others. Recent studies have demonstrated that EBNA2, EBNA5, EBNA3A, EBNA 3C are essential for transformation, and that any gene product is not sufficient to transform cells by itself. Further there are different mechanisms of virus-associated transformation or carcinogenesis among EBV-associated malignant disorders. On the other hand, human T lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) is known as a causative virus of adult T cell leukemia (ATL). However, precise molecular mechanisms of leukemogenesis in ATL still remains unclear. Some additional factors to HTLV-I infection are supposed to be involved in complete leukemogenesis. We demonstrated that HTLV-I infected T cells and primary ATL cells express EBV receptor/CD21 on the cell surface. Therefore, it is possible that EBV infection is one of the factors. We further investigated this possibility in 6 HTLV-I infected T cell lines and primary ATL cells from 18 patients with ATL. However, no EBV genome was detected in both T cell lines and primary ATL cells. EBV involved T-cell lymphoma has unique clinical manifestations as compared to non-EBV involved T-cell lymphoma. Therefore, it is still possible that a small group of ATL patients with unique clinical manifestations is associated with EBV.","['Ohtsubo, H', 'Arima, N', 'Tei, C']","['Ohtsubo H', 'Arima N', 'Tei C']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', '*Herpesviridae Infections/pathology/virology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/pathology/*virology', '*Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/virology']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1999 May;33(5-6):451-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199909058450.,,,,['10.3109/10428199909058450 [doi]'],,,,71,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of this prognostic impact, detection of these four specific abnormalities has to be accurate and rapid at diagnosis. In order to reliably analyze ALL patients, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). We selected specific probes enabling the detection of the structural rearrangements [t(9;22), t(12;21) and 11q23 rearrangements] directly on interphase cells. Detection of hyperdiploidy was performed using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). This technique enables to characterize chromosomal gains and losses without requiring metaphase obtention.

All of the drugs used in the treatment of CLL induce apoptosis in the cells, and in vitro responses to glucocorticoid or analogs correlate with in vivo sensitivity to these agents. Since CLL lymphocytes accumulate rather than proliferate, the idea that CLL is a disease involving defective apoptosis is particularly attractive. Recent studies have identified many of the central components of the apoptotic pathway that appear to be conserved from one cell type to another. Thus, investigation into the functionality of these molecules should reveal where the defect(s) in apoptosis may lie in CLL cells. Protease activation is a central event during apoptosis. and leads to many of the familiar characteristics of apoptosis.

This cytokine also has anti-tumor activity. Although IL-12 has been shown to be an important pathogenic cytokine in the induction of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), injection of exogenous IL-12 to murine allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) recipients paradoxically leads to a significant delay in the onset of GVHD mortality in fully MHC plus multiple minor antigen-mismatched strain combinations, and to complete inhibition of GVHD in a single haplotype-mismatched murine BMT model. IL-12-induced inhibition of GVHD is associated with reduced donor T cell activation and expansion, in part through an interferon (IFN)-gamma-mediated mechanism. Fas-mediated apoptosis of donor T cells also plays a significant role in IL-12-induced GVHD protection. Importantly, IL-12 preserves the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect of allogeneic CD8 T cells against EL4, a host-type leukemia/lymphoma, while inhibiting GVHD. Like the protective effect against GVHD, the GVL effect in IL-12-treated mice is dependent on IFN-gamma.

The exposure of these retroviruses and packaging cell lines to adult human serum (AS) inactivates them by complement and anti-alpha-galactosyl natural antibody-mediated mechanisms. We show that virus stability and infection efficiency of CRIP/BAG, a murine packaging cell line derived amphotropic retrovirus vector is reduced > 95% following a 30-min incubation in AS. This inactivation is prevented by replacing AS with umbilical cord serum (CS), wherein full retroviral transduction efficiency is maintained after 30 min of incubation. The loss of retrovirus transduction efficiency in AS was smaller upon blockage of anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies with galactose alpha 1-3-galactose. Serum levels of CH 100, as well as C1q complement which inactivates retroviruses by an antibody-independent mechanism were similar in AS and CS. The high stability of CRIP/BAG retrovirus vector in CS is likely due to its lower levels of maternally derived anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies.

On performing autologous transplantation studies using immunoselected CD34+ cells transduced with the GaLV envelope (env) retroviral vector, less than 1% of peripheral blood (PB) contained provirus. This was true whether bone marrow (BM) or cytokine-mobilized PB immunoselected CD34+ cells were reinfused. This level of marking was evident in two animals whose platelet counts never fell below 50,000/microliter and whose leukocyte counts had recovered by days 8 and 10 after having received 1.7 x 10(7) or greater of cytokine-mobilized CD34+ PB cells/kg. Reverse transcriptase(RT)-PCR analysis of CD34+ subsets for both the GaLV and amphotropic receptor were performed. The expression of the GaLV receptor was determined to be restricted to CD34+ Thy-1+ cells, and both CD34+ CD38+ and CD34+ CD38dim cells, while the amphotropic receptor was present on all CD34+ cell subsets examined.

The method was used for the treatment of LDL receptor deficiency in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits. We demonstrate an increase in hepatocyte proliferation index by thymidine kinase and ganciclovir treatment from 0.9 to 1.35% and a maximum of 35% decrease in total plasma cholesterol level 2-3 months after the gene transfer. A 20% decline was still present after a 52-week follow-up period. A 50% decrease was also observed in plasma triglycerides. Liver function tests indicated a transient increase in plasma alkaline phosphatase level up to 12 weeks after the gene transfer.

It has been shown for example that cytokines are able to stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. In addition, some studies present evidence that endothelin is able to modulate the activity of several hypothalamic-pituitary axes, e.g. by inducing the ACTH production. DESIGN: We investigated the effects of interleukin-2 on endothelin levels and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. We determined the interleukin-6, big-endothelin, endothelin-1, ACTH, cortisol and AVP responses to intravenously and subcutaneously administered interleukin-2 in 8 cancer patients in a randomized placebo controlled trial. PATIENTS: 8 Patients (2 female and 6 male), age 44 +/- 4.8 years, were enrolled. All patients had a World Health Organization performance status of 1 or less and a Karnofsky Index of at least 80%. MEASUREMENTS: Blood-samples were taken before and 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 min after interleukin-2 injection. Cytokine serum levels and the plasma levels of big-endothelin, endothelin, ACTH and AVP were analysed using radioimmuno-assays. Cortisol was assayed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Interleukin-2 treatment significantly increased plasma big-endothelin levels (P < 0.01 vs basal) and endothelin-1 levels (P < 0.05 vs basal) within two hours and this was followed by an increase in ACTH (P < 0.01 vs basal) and cortisol (P < 0.05 vs basal) within three hours. Interleukin-6 levels increased two hours after interleukin-2 administration (P < 0.01 vs basal). Interleukin-2 had no detectable effect on AVP, blood pressure or heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that cytokines are able to activate the human hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in vivo. On the basis of the observed time kinetics and in connection with previous findings from in vitro and animal models, we conclude that endothelin may be a link between cytokines and corticotrophin-releasing hormone, most probably functioning as a cytokine-induced neuromodulator controlling pituitary functions.","['Raab, C', 'Weidmann, E', 'Schmidt, A', 'Bergmann, L', 'Badenhoop, K', 'Usadel, K H', 'Haak, T']","['Raab C', 'Weidmann E', 'Schmidt A', 'Bergmann L', 'Badenhoop K', 'Usadel KH', 'Haak T']","['Medical Department I, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,England,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf),Clinical endocrinology,0346653,IM,,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Adult', 'Arginine Vasopressin/blood', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelins/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/blood', 'Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Kidney Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Pituitary-Adrenal System/*drug effects/physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/therapy', 'Protein Precursors/blood', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1999 Jan;50(1):37-44. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00592.x.,"['0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Endothelins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '113-79-1 (Arginine Vasopressin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,['10.1046/j.1365-2265.1999.00592.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously mapped the fit-1 locus to feline Chromosome (Chr) B2. We have now identified conserved sequences that allow the mapping of the murine homolog using the European Interspecific Backcross (EUCIB). This shows that fit-1 is located on mouse Chr 10, 1cM proximal to Ahi-1, a murine retroviral integration locus that is closely linked to Myb. Moreover, the physical linkage to MYB is maintained in the human genome, as shown by cloning of the human homolog of fit-1 from a Chr 6 cosmid library and a series of overlapping PAC clones. Generation of a contig map around the human homolog of fit-1 reveals that it is approximately 100-kb upstream of MYB. In addition to fit-1 and Ahi-1, two other common insertion sites, Mis-2 and Mml-1, have also been mapped adjacent to Myb on mouse Chr 10. Previous analysis of tumors carrying insertions at fit-1, Mml-1, Mis-2 and Ahi-1 showed no obvious abnormalities in Myb expression. However, the cluster of viral insertion loci in this region suggests either the presence of a closely linked activation target or that subtle effects on Myb have been overlooked.","['Barr, N I', 'Stewart, M', 'Tsatsanis, C', 'Fulton, R', 'Hu, M', 'Tsujimoto, H', 'Neil, J C']","['Barr NI', 'Stewart M', 'Tsatsanis C', 'Fulton R', 'Hu M', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Neil JC']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden Road, Glasgow, G61 1QH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mamm Genome,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,9100916,IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins v-myb', '*Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Interleukin', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mamm Genome. 1999 Jun;10(6):556-9. doi: 10.1007/s003359901043.,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (IL1RL1 protein, human)', '0 (Il1rl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-myb)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",,,['10.1007/s003359901043 [doi]'],,,,,"['GENBANK/AF113885', 'GENBANK/AF113886']",,,,,,,,,,,

In women with unexplained infertility reduced uterine concentrations of LIF have been reported. Studies with mice lacking a functional LIF gene have shown that the LIF protein is essential for implantation of the embryo. We have developed a method for screening of gene mutations in the coding region and critical regulatory regions of the LIF gene. Thus we could screen nulligravid infertile women (n = 74), fertile controls (n = 75) and as a second unrelated control group, neurological patients (n = 131) for LIF gene mutations. In infertile women, three heterozygous point mutations have been identified: one in close proximity to the start codon of exon 1 and two mutations in exon 3. These correspond to regions of the LIF protein which are thought to be highly important for interaction with the LIF receptor and thus lead to reduced biological activity of the LIF protein. Only one point mutation/polymorphism in the non-coding region between exon 2 and 3 was found in the control groups. Our results suggest that heterozygosity for a LIF gene mutation could give rise to decreased availability or biological activity of LIF in the uterus and cause implantation failure. Thus the mutations identified in our study could be responsible for infertility in a subgroup of nulligravid women.","['Giess, R', 'Tanasescu, I', 'Steck, T', 'Sendtner, M']","['Giess R', 'Tanasescu I', 'Steck T', 'Sendtner M']","['Department of Neurology (Clinical Research Group), Julius-Maximilians-University of Wurzburg, Josef Schneider Strabetae 11, 97080 Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mol Hum Reprod,Molecular human reproduction,9513710,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*genetics', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/*genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Hum Reprod. 1999 Jun;5(6):581-6. doi: 10.1093/molehr/5.6.581.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",,,['10.1093/molehr/5.6.581 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL Trialists' Collaborative Group.,861-8,"BACKGROUND: The randomized trials that evaluate the timing and intensity of initial chemotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have, in general, been too small to provide separately reliable results. We compared the effects on survival of the following: a) immediate versus deferred chemotherapy for early-stage CLL and b) combination chemotherapy (e.g., cyclophosphamide and vincristine plus prednisone/prednisolone [COP] or COP plus doxorubicin [CHOP]) versus single-agent chlorambucil as first-line treatment for more advanced disease. METHODS: All relevant randomized trials, whether published or not, were sought for a collaborative meta-analysis involving centralized review of the data for each patient. RESULTS: There were 2048 patients with early disease in six trials of immediate versus deferred chemotherapy (chlorambucil or chlorambucil plus prednisone/prednisolone). The 10-year survival was slightly worse (but not statistically significantly so) with immediate chemotherapy (44% versus 47% survival; difference = -3%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -10% to 4%). There were another 2022 patients in 10 trials of combination chemotherapy versus chlorambucil, with or without prednisone/prednisolone. The 5-year survival was 48 % in both cases (difference = 0%; 95% CI = -6% to 5%). A subgroup of six of these 10 trials involved an anthracycline-containing regimen but again overall survival appeared no better than with chlorambucil (anthracycline-based regimen: 325 deaths among 627 patients; chlorambucil: 306 deaths among 636 patients; death rate ratio = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.91-1.25; not statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS: In terms of survival, these trials support a conservative treatment strategy for CLL, i.e., no chemotherapy for most patients with early-stage disease, and single-agent chlorambucil as the first line of treatment for most patients with advanced disease, with no evidence of benefit from early inclusion of an anthracycline. This strategy will, however, need to be reconsidered as mature results become available from trials of other agents.",,,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Chlorambucil/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Epirubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 May 19;91(10):861-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.10.861.,"['18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '3Z8479ZZ5X (Epirubicin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",,,['10.1093/jnci/91.10.861 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether these pseudotyped, pantropic vectors can mediate gene transfer and expression in E. histolytica, we constructed a retroviral vector, in which a hygromycin phosphotransferase is expressed from the E. histolytica actin promoter. Data confirm the infection, integration, and expression of a foreign gene mediated by the provirus.

Normally, proliferation and differentiation of myeloid cells are regulated by cytokines such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Abnormal signaling of the signal transduction pathway from the cytokine receptors via Janus kinases (JAKs) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) might be involved in the pathogenesis of AML. We examined whether an abnormal expression of one of the four JAKs, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, or the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1, a negative regulator of this pathway, is associated with malignant transformation in AML. Analysis of the expression of proteins of the JAK/STAT pathway in normal myeloid cells at three stages of maturation revealed a strong expression of all proteins in CD34+ cells, whereas the level of the proteins was significantly lower in granulocytic precursors and mature neutrophils. Furthermore, during maturation the relation of the isoforms of STAT1 and STAT3 changed from predominantly alpha to predominantly beta. Leukemic blast cells from 25 patients and 12 cell lines showed a high level of STAT proteins and SHP-1, whereas a deficiency of at least one of the four JAKs was found in 10 of 25 patients. In primary AML blast cells a deficiency of three JAKs was more common in patients with an abnormal karyotype. In addition, a lack of JAK2 and Tyk2 protein was strongly associated with the FAB M2 phenotype. The proliferation rate in response to GM-CSF available in a small number of patients appears to be related to the JAK2 expression. Our data suggest that the degree of expression of G-CSF/GM-CSF receptor-associated proteins of the JAK/STAT pathway in normal myeloid cells is related with their clonogenic potential. STAT3 appears to be involved in early differentiation. Similar to CD34+ cells, it is likely that the high levels of STATs and SHP-1 found in leukemic cells reflects their proliferative activity, whereas a lack of members of the JAK family might lead to an inability to proliferate in response to G-CSF/GM-CSF described in a considerable percentage of AML blasts.","['Biethahn, S', 'Alves, F', 'Wilde, S', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Spiekermann, K']","['Biethahn S', 'Alves F', 'Wilde S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Lineage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 May;27(5):885-94. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00017-x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00017-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00017-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine if As2O3 might be useful for the treatment of other lineages, we investigated the effects of As2O3 on viability, proliferation, and induction of apoptosis in the megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines HEL, Meg-01, UT7, and M07e. Our results showed that As2O3, at concentrations of 0.1-2.0 microM, causes a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of survival and growth in all four megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines studied. In contrast, As2O3 at similar concentrations had no effects on either viability or growth of the nonmegakaryocytic leukemia cell line HL60 and two human breast cancer cell lines, ZR75 and MCF7. In situ end-labeling of DNA fragments (TUNEL assay) indicated that As2O3, at concentrations of 0.5-2 microM, could significantly induce apoptosis in the aforementioned four megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines, but not in the nonmegakaryocytic HL60, ZR75, and MCF7 cell lines. These results were confirmed using conventional morphologic assessment and the DNA ladder assay. Induction of apoptosis in arsenic-treated Meg-01 and UT7 cells was accompanied by a dose-response decrease of Bcl-2 protein, whereas As2O3 had no effect on this measurement in HL60, ZR75, and MCF7 cell lines. Pertinently, these concentrations of As2O3 produced identical changes in the characteristics of the APL cell line NB4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that As2O3 can selectively inhibit growth and induce apoptosis in megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines. The use of As2O3 for the treatment of malignant megakaryocytic disorders should be considered.","['Lu, M', 'Levin, J', 'Sulpice, E', 'Sequeira-Le Grand, A', 'Alemany, M', 'Caen, J P', 'Han, Z C']","['Lu M', 'Levin J', 'Sulpice E', 'Sequeira-Le Grand A', 'Alemany M', 'Caen JP', 'Han ZC']","['Institut des Vaisseaux et du Sang, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 May;27(5):845-52. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00014-4.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,"['S0301472X99000144 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00014-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we attempted to induce a lineage switch in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) with monosomy 7, whose lineage had switched from acute T-lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) during chemotherapy, in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Although the transplanted myeloid cells were engrafted in SCID mice without cytokine administration, T-ALL developed in SCID mice treated with recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or recombinant human interleukin 3. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of the rearranged T-cell receptor gamma-chain (TCR-gamma) gene revealed that this lineage switch resulted from the selection of the T-lineage subclone in SCID mice, which had expanded at onset. In addition, we found that the T-lineage and myeloid cells belonged to the distinct subclones, which were different in TCR-gamma gene rearrangements, but were derived from a common clone with an identical N-ras gene mutation for both subclones. In in vitro cultures, only the myeloid subclone grew; the T-lineage subclone failed to grow even in the presence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor or recombinant human interleukin 3. These results suggested that the initial diagnostic T-lymphoid subclone, whose growth was dependent on these cytokines and the hematopoietic microenvironment, emerged from a bipotential T-lymphoid/myeloid leukemic stem cell, and further genetic event(s) induced the myeloid subclone, which grew independently of these cytokines and the microenvironment.","['Fujisaki, H', 'Hara, J', 'Takai, K', 'Nakanishi, K', 'Matsuda, Y', 'Ohta, H', 'Osugi, Y', 'Tokimasa, S', 'Taniike, M', 'Hosoi, G', 'Sako, M', 'Okada, S']","['Fujisaki H', 'Hara J', 'Takai K', 'Nakanishi K', 'Matsuda Y', 'Ohta H', 'Osugi Y', 'Tokimasa S', 'Taniike M', 'Hosoi G', 'Sako M', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Osaka University, Suita, Japan. fujisaki@ped.med.osaka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Lineage', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Monosomy', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 May;27(5):826-33. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00008-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00008-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00008-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this, we first compared the kinetics of entry into division of single human CD34+CD38- cord blood (CB) cells exposed in vitro to three different flt3-ligand (FL)-containing cytokine combinations. Of the three combinations tested, FL + hyperinterleukin 6 (HIL-6) yielded the least clones and these developed at a slow rate. With either FL + Steel factor (SF) + HIL-6 + thrombopoietin (TPO) or FL + SF + interleukin 3 (IL-3) + IL-6 + granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), >90% of the cells that formed clones within 6 days undertook their first division within 4 days, although not until after 24 hours. These latter two, more stimulatory, cytokine combinations then were used to assess the effect of duration of cytokine exposure on the efficiency of transducing primitive CB cells with a gibbon ape leukemia virus-pseudotyped murine retroviral vector containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA and the neomycin resistance gene. Fresh lin- CB cells exposed once to medium containing this virus plus cytokines on fibronectin-coated dishes yielded 23% GFP+ CD34+ cells and 52-57% G418-resistant CFC when assessed after 2 days. Prestimulation of the target cells (before exposing them to virus) with either the four or five cytokine combination increased their susceptibility. In both cases, the effect of prestimulation assessed using the same infection protocol was maximal with 2 days of prestimulation and resulted in 47-54% GFP+ CD34+ cells and 67-69% G418-resistant CFC. Repeated daily addition of new virus (up to three times), with assessment of the cells 2 days after the last addition of fresh virus, gave only a marginal improvement in the proportion of transduced CD34+ cells and CFC, but greatly increased the proportion of transduced LTC-IC (from 40% to >99%). Transplantation of lin- CB cells transduced using this latter 6-day protocol into NOD/SCID mice yielded readily detectable GFP+ cells in 10 of 11 mice that were engrafted with human cells. The proportion of the regenerated human cells that were GFP+ ranged from 0.2-72% in individual mice and included both human lymphoid and myeloid cells in all cases. High-level reconstitution with transduced human cells was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. These findings demonstrate that transplantable hematopoietic stem cells in human CB can be reproducibly transduced at high efficiency using a 6-day period of culture in a retrovirus-containing medium with either FL + SF + HIL-6 + TPO or FL + SF + IL-3 + IL-6 + G-CSF in which virus is added on the third, fourth, and fifth day.","['Hennemann, B', 'Conneally, E', 'Pawliuk, R', 'Leboulch, P', 'Rose-John, S', 'Reid, D', 'Chuo, J Y', 'Humphries, R K', 'Eaves, C J']","['Hennemann B', 'Conneally E', 'Pawliuk R', 'Leboulch P', 'Rose-John S', 'Reid D', 'Chuo JY', 'Humphries RK', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, BC Cancer Agency and the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology/immunology', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/analysis', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1999 May;27(5):817-25. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00021-1.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",,,"['S0301-472X(99)00021-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(99)00021-1 [doi]']",,,['P0I55435/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current report, the Restriction Landmark Genomic Scanning (RLGS) method was used to detect aberrant DNA methylation (M) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RLGS-M profiles were initially performed using DNA from diagnostic, remission, and relapse samples from a patient with AML. Rp18, one of the eight spots found that was absent in the relapse sample, was cloned. Sequence analysis showed that the spot represented a portion of the WIT-1 gene on human chromosome 11p13. Rp18 was missing in the relapse sample due to a distinct DNA methylation pattern of the WIT-1 gene. Twenty-seven AML patients that entered CR after therapy (i.e., chemosensitive) were studied and only 10 (37%) of the diagnostic bone marrow (BM) samples showed methylation of WIT-1. However, seven of eight (87.5%) diagnostic BM samples from primary refractory AML (chemosensitive) showed methylation of WIT-1. The incidence of WIT-1 methylation in primary refractory AML was significantly higher than that noted in chemosensitive AML (P=0.018). Together, these results indicate that RLGS-M can be used to find novel epigenetic alterations in human cancer that are undetectable by standard methods.

The IL-6 receptor system consists of an IL-6 specific binding molecule, IL-6R and a signal transducer, gp130. Following gp130 dimerization, IL-6 activates multiple signaling pathways (Ras dependent MAPk cascade, STAT1-STAT3 heterodimer pathway, and STAT3 homodimer pathway). Several other cytokines including oncostatin M, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and cardiotropin-1 (CT-1) use gp130 as a common signal transducing molecule and therefore have similar biological activities. Two major in vivo functions of IL-6 are reported. Firstly, IL-6 acts as a growth factor of some malignant and non-malignant cells such as malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma, mesangial cells in the kidney, and keratinocytes. Secondly, IL-6 mediates inflammatory and immune responses in rheumatoid arthritis, Castleman disease, psoriasis, cardiac myxoma, cachexia, and other inflammatory conditions. Recently, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody was developed. Neutralization of IL-6 activity by the humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody may be a new therapeutic approach for IL-6 related diseases such as multiple myeloma, Castleman disease and rheumatoid arthritis.","['Ogata, A', 'Nishimoto, N', 'Yoshizaki, K']","['Ogata A', 'Nishimoto N', 'Yoshizaki K']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

In this study, we have identified a fusion partner of MLL in a 10-year-old female who developed therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia 17 months after treatment for Hodgkin's disease. Leukemia cells of this patient had a t(11;17)(q23;q25), which involved MLL as demonstrated by Southern blot analysis. The partner gene was cloned from cDNA of the leukemia cells by use of a combination of adapter reverse transcriptase-PCR, rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends, and BLAST database analysis to identify expressed sequence tags. The full-length cDNA of 2.8 kb was found to be an additional member of the septin family, therefore it was named MSF (MLL septin-like fusion). Members of the septin family conserve the GTP binding domain, localize in the cytoplasm, and interact with cytoskeletal filaments. A major 4-kb transcript of MSF was expressed ubiquitously; a 1.7-kb transcript was found in most tissues. An additional 3-kb transcript was found only in hematopoietic tissues. By amplification with MLL exon 5 forward primer and reverse primers in MSF, the appropriately sized products were obtained. MSF is highly homologous to hCDCrel-1, which is a partner gene of MLL in leukemias with a t(11;22)(q23;q11.2). Further analysis of MSF may help to delineate the function of MLL partner genes in leukemia, particularly in therapy-related leukemia.","['Osaka, M', 'Rowley, J D', 'Zeleznik-Le, N J']","['Osaka M', 'Rowley JD', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ']","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila/genetics', 'Female', '*GTP Phosphohydrolases', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Organ Specificity', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Septins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Zinc Fingers']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 May 25;96(11):6428-33. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.11.6428.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COPP protocol']",,,['10.1073/pnas.96.11.6428 [doi]'],PMC26898,,"['P01 CA040046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/AF123052'],,,,,,,,,,,

PLZF-RARalpha transgenic animals developed chronic myeloid leukemia-like phenotypes at an early stage of life (within 3 months in five of six mice), whereas three NPM-RARalpha transgenic mice showed a spectrum of phenotypes from typical APL to chronic myeloid leukemia relatively late in life (from 12 to 15 months). In contrast to bone marrow cells from PLZF-RARalpha transgenic mice, those from NPM-RARalpha transgenic mice could be induced to differentiate by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA).

This nuclear export is directed by nuclear export signals (NESs), typically characterized by hydrophobic, primarily leucine, amino acid residues. Moreover, it has been shown that CRM1/exportin 1 is an export receptor for leucine-rich NESs. However, additional NES-interacting proteins have been described. In particular, eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) has been shown to be a critical cellular cofactor for the nuclear export of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) Rev trans-activator protein. In this study we compared the nuclear export activity of NESs of different origin. Microinjection of export substrates into the nucleus of somatic cells in combination with specific inhibitors indicated that specific nuclear export pathways exist for different NES-containing proteins. In particular, inhibition of eIF-5A blocked the nuclear export of NESs derived from the HIV-1 Rev and human T cell leukemia virus type I Rex trans-activators, whereas nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the protein kinase inhibitor-NES was unaffected. In contrast, however, inhibition of CRM1/exportin 1 blocked the nuclear export of all NES-containing proteins investigated. Our data confirm that CRM1/exportin 1 is a general export receptor for leucine-rich NESs and suggest that eIF-5A acts either upstream of CRM1/exportin 1 or forms a complex with the NES and CRM1/exportin 1 in the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of the HIV-1 Rev and human T cell leukemia virus type I Rex RNA export factors.","['Elfgang, C', 'Rosorius, O', 'Hofer, L', 'Jaksche, H', 'Hauber, J', 'Bevec, D']","['Elfgang C', 'Rosorius O', 'Hofer L', 'Jaksche H', 'Hauber J', 'Bevec D']","['Novartis Research Institute, Department of Immunology, Brunner Strasse 59, A-1235 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Products, rev/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HIV-1/physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/physiology', 'Humans', '*Karyopherins', '*Leucine', 'Microinjections', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*metabolism', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 May 25;96(11):6229-34. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.11.6229.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",,,['10.1073/pnas.96.11.6229 [doi]'],PMC26864,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear proteins are also subject to oxidation, and the nucleus of mammalian cells contains proteasome. In human beings, tumor cells frequently are subjected to oxidation as a consequence of antitumor chemotherapy, and K562 human myelogenous leukemia cells have a higher nuclear proteasome activity than do nonmalignant cells. Adaptation to oxidative stress appears to be one element in the development of long-term resistance to many chemotherapeutic drugs and the mechanisms of inducible tumor resistance to oxidation are of obvious importance. After hydrogen peroxide treatment of K562 cells, degradation of the model proteasome peptide substrate suc-LLVY-MCA and degradation of oxidized histones in nuclei increases significantly within minutes. Both increased proteolytic susceptibility of the histone substrates (caused by modification by oxidation) and activation of the proteasome enzyme complex occur independently during oxidative stress. This rapid up-regulation of 20S proteasome activity is accompanied by, and depends on, poly-ADP ribosylation of the proteasome, as shown by inhibitor experiments, 14C-ADP ribose incorporation assays, immunoblotting, in vitro reconstitution experiments, and immunoprecipitation of (activated) proteasome with anti-poly-ADP ribose polymerase antibodies. The poly-ADP ribosylation-mediated activated nuclear 20S proteasome is able to remove oxidatively damaged histones more efficiently and therefore is proposed as an oxidant-stimulatable defense or repair system of the nucleus in K562 leukemia cells.","['Ullrich, O', 'Reinheckel, T', 'Sitte, N', 'Hass, R', 'Grune, T', 'Davies, K J']","['Ullrich O', 'Reinheckel T', 'Sitte N', 'Hass R', 'Grune T', 'Davies KJ']","['Clinics of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphatases/metabolism', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Coumarins/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Histones/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Substrate Specificity']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1999 May 25;96(11):6223-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.96.11.6223.,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Coumarins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '94367-21-2 (succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-methylcoumarinamide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)']",,,['10.1073/pnas.96.11.6223 [doi]'],PMC26863,,"['R01 ES003598/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 ES003598/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 03598/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, 10(-7) mol/L jaspamide induced maturation of HL-60 cells as indicated by the appearance of a lobulated nucleus in 55% +/- 5% of the cells and immunophenotypic maturation of the leukemia cells (upregulation of CD16 and CD14 B antigens). Further characterization has shown that F-actin is aggregated both in HL-60 cells and in human monocytes exposed to 10(-7) mol/L jaspamide. Well-spread cultured human monocytes contracted and adopted round shapes after treatment with jaspamide. Moreover, a dose-dependent increase in both total actin and de novo synthesized portions of the soluble actin was observed in jaspamide-treated HL-60 cells. Jaspamide treatment inhibits ruffling and intracellular movement in HL-60 cells and monocytes, but does not affect phagocytic activity or respiratory burst activity. The consequential effects of jaspamide-induced actin reorganization on ruffling, versus its negligible effect on phagocytosis and oxidative burst, may shed light on molecular mechanisms of actin involvement in these processes. Jaspamide disrupts the actin cytoskeleton of normal and malignant mammalian cells with no significant effect on phagocytic activity and may, therefore, be considered as a novel therapeutic agent.","['Fabian, I', 'Halperin, D', 'Lefter, S', 'Mittelman, L', 'Altstock, R T', 'Seaon, O', 'Tsarfaty, I']","['Fabian I', 'Halperin D', 'Lefter S', 'Mittelman L', 'Altstock RT', 'Seaon O', 'Tsarfaty I']","['Departments of Cell Biology and Histology, Physiology, and Human Microbiology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Actins/*drug effects/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Depsipeptides', 'Dimerization', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Peptides, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Phagocytosis/*drug effects', 'Respiratory Burst/*drug effects']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3994-4005.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '102396-24-7 (jasplakinolide)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59533-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These protocols underwent a significant change in 1988 when a new intensive chemotherapy program was introduced (CALGB 8811). We asked whether karyotype continued to represent a significant prognostic factor in adult ALL patients after the change. A total of 256 patients had adequate pretreatment cytogenetic analyses: 67 before 1988 and 189 subsequently. The complete remission (CR) rate for the whole group was 80%. Patients with t(9;22), t(4;11), -7, or +8 had significantly lower probabilities of continuous CR and survival at 5 years (.11 and.12) than patients with a normal karyotype (.38 and.37) and patients with miscellaneous cytogenetic abnormalities (.52 and.49; P <.001 for each comparison). When analyzed by treatment period, the CR rate before CALGB 8811 was 63%; subsequently, it was 86% (P <.001). Patients with cytogenetic abnormalities other than t(9;22), t(4;11), -7, or +8 had better CR rates, disease-free survival (DFS), and survivals (P =.001, P =.04, and P =.004, respectively) after the change to the more intensive chemotherapy regimens. Patients with normal cytogenetics had improved CR rate but no improved DFS or survival, whereas no significant benefit for patients with t(9;22), t(4;11), -7, or +8 was seen. In a multivariate analysis, karyotype retained its prognostic significance for DFS but not for survival; it remained the most important factor for DFS.

BCR/ABL fusion proteins have a dysregulated protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity exerting a key role in malignant transformation. Targeting the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR/ABL or using agents capable of triggering apoptosis might represent attractive therapeutic approaches for ex vivo purging. AG957, a member of the tyrphostin compounds, exerts a selective inhibition of p210(BCR/ABL) tyrosine phosphorylation. We report here that preincubation of CML or normal CD34(+) cells with graded concentration of AG957 (1 to 100 micromol/L) resulted in a statistically significant, dose-dependent suppression of colony growth from multipotent, erythroid, and granulocyte-macrophage progenitors as well as the more primitive long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC). However, AG957 doses causing 50% inhibition (ID50) of CML and normal progenitors were significantly different for multilineage colony-forming units (CFU-Mix; 12 v 64 micromol/L; P =.008), burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E; 29 v 89 micromol/L; P =.004), colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM; 34 v 85 micromol/L; P =.004), and LTC-IC (43 v 181 micromol/L; P =.004). In 5 of 10 patients, analysis of BCR/ABL mRNA on single progenitors by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed that AG957 at 50 micromol/L significantly reduced the mean (+/-SD) percentage of BCR/ABL-positive progenitors (92% +/- 10% v 33 +/- 5%; P =.001). Because AG957 treatment resulted in significantly higher percentages of apoptotic cells (30% v 9%) in the BCR/ABL-transfected 32DLG7 cells as compared with 32D-T2/93 cells (BCR/ABL-negative), we investigated the combined effects of AG957 with the anti-Fas receptor (Fas-R) monoclonal antibody CH11 that triggers apoptosis. As compared with AG957 alone, the sequential treatment of CML CD34(+) cells with AG957 (1 micromol/L) and CH11 (1 microgram/mL) increased CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM growth inhibition by 1.6-fold, 3-fold, and 4-fold, respectively. In contrast, the treatment of normal CD34(+) cells with AG957 and CH11 failed to enhance AG957-induced colony growth inhibition. We conclude that (1) AG957 inhibits in a dose-dependent manner CML CD34-derived colony formation by both primitive LTC-IC as well as committed CFU-Mix, BFU-E, and CFU-GM; (2) this growth inhibition is associated with the selection of a substantial amount of BCR/ABL-negative progenitors; and (3) the antiproliferative effect of AG957 is dramatically increased by combining this compound with the anti-Fas-R antibody CH11. These data may have significant therapeutic applications.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Regazzi, E', 'Sammarelli, G', 'Colla, S', 'Garau, D', 'Gazit, A', 'Savoldo, B', 'Cilloni, D', 'Tabilio, A', 'Levitzki, A', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Regazzi E', 'Sammarelli G', 'Colla S', 'Garau D', 'Gazit A', 'Savoldo B', 'Cilloni D', 'Tabilio A', 'Levitzki A', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Hematology, University of Parma, Parma, Italy. ccs@ipruniv.cce.unipr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3973-82.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (tyrphostin AG957)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59531-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From April 1991 to September 1996, samples of leukemic marrow or blood from 259 eligible and evaluable adult ALL patients entering dose-intensive Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) front-line treatment protocols were prospectively studied for immunophenotypic classification by multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) in a central laboratory. A B-lineage (B-LIN) phenotype was expressed in 79% of cases, with one third coexpressing myeloid antigens. A T-lineage (T-LIN) phenotype was expressed in 17% of cases, with one quarter coexpressing myeloid antigens. Since the advent of more intensive CALGB therapy which incorporated cyclophosphamide and the early use of L-asparaginase into the backbone of daunorubicin, vincristine and prednisone, together with central nervous system prophylaxis for adult ALL, no significant differences in response rates, remission duration, or survival have been seen in those patients coexpressing myeloid antigens. The T-LIN phenotype was associated with younger age (P =.01), a higher male to female ratio (P =.01), higher white blood cell count (P =.001) and hemoglobin (P <.001) levels, presence of a mediastinal mass (P <. 001), and longer survival (P =.01) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P =.01) when compared to patients with a B-LIN phenotype. The 3-year probability of survival and DFS (95% confidence interval [CI]) of T-LIN adult ALL was 0.62 (0.46 to 0.76) and 0.62 (0.44 to 0. 77), respectively. Comparatively, the 3-year probability of survival and DFS (95% CI) of B-LIN adult ALL was 0.42 (0.35 to 0.50) and 0.39 (0.31 to 0.47), respectively. The number of T markers expressed in T-LIN ALL cases was shown to have prognostic significance. In particular, patients expressing six or more markers compared with patients expressing three or fewer markers had longer DFS (P =.003) and survival (P =.004). The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome was significantly associated with B-LIN ALL cases which coexpressed CD19(+), CD34(+), and CD10(+) (49%; P =.003), whereas the majority of t(4;11) cases were CD19(+), CD34(+) but CD10(-). The knowledge gained from this study of MFC of a large number of patients will permit a reduction in the number of antigens to be evaluated in future studies. Overall, this should lead to cost savings without loss of valuable information. A rational approach for future studies would be to use four-color flow cytometry (instead of the current three-color) to help further streamline the study of immunophenotype of adult ALL by MFC.","['Czuczman, M S', 'Dodge, R K', 'Stewart, C C', 'Frankel, S R', 'Davey, F R', 'Powell, B L', 'Szatrowski, T P', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Larson, R A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Czuczman MS', 'Dodge RK', 'Stewart CC', 'Frankel SR', 'Davey FR', 'Powell BL', 'Szatrowski TP', 'Schiffer CA', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/immunology', 'Cell Lineage/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3931-9.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59526-8 [pii]'],,,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought to play a pivotal role in integrating and transmitting transmembrane signals required for growth and differentiation. Constitutive activation of ERK in fibroblasts elicits oncogenic transformation, and recently, constitutive activation of ERK has been observed in some human malignancies, including acute leukemia. However, mechanisms underlying constitutive activation of ERK have not been well characterized. In this study, we examined the activation of ERK in 79 human acute leukemia samples and attempted to find factors contributing to constitutive ERK activation. First, we showed that ERK and MEK were constitutively activated in acute leukemias by in vitro kinase assay and immunoblot analysis. However, in only one half of the studied samples, the pattern of ERK activation was similar to that of MEK activation. Next, by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblot analysis, we showed hyperexpression of ERK in a majority of acute leukemias. In 17 of 26 cases (65.4%) analyzed by immunoblot, the pattern of ERK expression was similar to that of ERK activation. The fact of constitutive activation of ERK in acute leukemias suggested to us the possibility of an abnormal downregulation mechanism of ERK. Therefore, we examined PAC1, a specific ERK phosphatase predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissue and known to be upregulated at the transcription level in response to ERK activation. Interestingly, in our study, PAC1 gene expression in acute leukemias showing constitutive ERK activation was significantly lower than that in unstimulated, normal bone marrow (BM) samples showing minimal or no ERK activation (P =.002). Also, a significant correlation was observed between PAC1 downregulation and phosphorylation of ERK in acute leukemias (P =.002). Finally, by further analysis of 26 cases, we showed that a complementary role of MEK activation, ERK hyperexpression, and PAC1 downregulation could contribute to determining the constitutive activation of ERK in acute leukemia. Our results suggest that ERK is constitutively activated in a majority of acute leukemias, and in addition to the activation of MEK, the hyperexpression of ERK and downregulation of PAC1 also contribute to constitutive ERK activation in acute leukemias.","['Kim, S C', 'Hahn, J S', 'Min, Y H', 'Yoo, N C', 'Ko, Y W', 'Lee, W J']","['Kim SC', 'Hahn JS', 'Min YH', 'Yoo NC', 'Ko YW', 'Lee WJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Immunology, Medical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dual Specificity Phosphatase 2', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3893-9.,"['EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (DUSP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Dual Specificity Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59522-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the EBMT.,3863-5,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the chromosomal translocation t(9;22) resulting in the chimeric bcr-abl oncogene that encodes the P210 fusion protein, which contains a unique amino acid sequence. If peptides derived from the leukemia-specific part of P210 are expressed in HLA molecules on the cell membrane of leukemic cells, an immunological response may occur. Recent studies using synthetic peptides identical to the bcr-abl fusion region showed that some peptides are capable of binding to HLA-A3, -A11, and -B8 molecules. Cytotoxic T-cell responses have been induced against bcr-abl-derived synthetic peptides bound to HLA-A3 and -B8. We hypothesized that if antigen processing of the P210 fusion protein leads to presentation of peptides from the fusion region by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in vivo, this may be reflected in a diminished incidence of CML in individuals expressing HLA-A3, -A11, or -B8. Consequently, lower frequencies of these antigens would be expected in patients with CML compared with unaffected individuals. A case-control study and a meta-analysis were performed to test this hypothesis. The multicenter case-control study compared patients with CML from the data base of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) with unaffected individuals from the registry of Bone Marrow Donors Worldwide. Patients and controls were matched per country. The meta-analysis consisted of five studies reported in the literature. The multicenter case-control study consisting of 1,899 patients and 512, 363 bone marrow donors as controls yielded odds ratios (ORs) of 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.80 to 1.00) for HLA-A3, 1.16 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.33) for HLA-A11, and an OR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0. 82) for HLA-B8. Coexpression of HLA-A3 and HLA-B8 gave an OR of 0.51 (95% CI, 0.40 to 0.67). This can be translated in a protective effect of 27% for HLA-B8, 10% for HLA-A3, and 49% protection for the combination of HLA-A3 and HLA-B8. The meta-analysis comprising 463 CML patients and 4,912 controls showed a 29% risk reduction for individuals expressing HLA-B8 (OR of 0.71; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.97), but an OR of 1.19 (95% CI, 0.90 to 1.56) for HLA-A3 and an OR of 1. 09 (95% CI, 0.80 to 1.50) for HLA-A11. In conclusion, these results indicate that HLA-B8 expression, in particular when HLA-A3 is coexpressed, is associated with a diminished incidence of CML. A biological mechanism may be that presentation of bcr-abl breakpoint peptides in these HLA molecules can induce a protective immune response.","['Posthuma, E F', 'Falkenburg, J H', 'Apperley, J F', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Roosnek, E', 'Hertenstein, B', 'Schipper, R F', 'Schreuder, G M', ""D'Amaro, J"", 'Oudshoorn, M', 'van Biezen, J H', 'Hermans, J', 'Willemze, R', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Posthuma EF', 'Falkenburg JH', 'Apperley JF', 'Gratwohl A', 'Roosnek E', 'Hertenstein B', 'Schipper RF', 'Schreuder GM', ""D'Amaro J"", 'Oudshoorn M', 'van Biezen JH', 'Hermans J', 'Willemze R', 'Niederwieser D']","['Departments of Hematology, Immunohematology, and Medical Statistics, Leiden University Medical Center and Europdonor Foundation, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Multicenter Study']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'HLA-A3 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-B8 Antigen/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*immunology', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3863-5.,"['0 (HLA-A3 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B8 Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59518-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, E-selectin is also expressed in proliferating endothelial cells under noninflammatory conditions in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that E-selectin is also regulated by growth signals. To investigate E-selectin expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated versus nonstimulated proliferating cells, we analyzed the distribution of E-selectin-positive human microvascular endothelial cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases of the cell cycle under both conditions. Lipopolysaccharide treatment resulted in uniformly increased E-selectin expression in cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M. In contrast, levels of E-selectin in nonstimulated proliferating cells showed a linear correlation with the percentage of cells in G2/M. E-selectin in proliferating endothelial cells was not reduced by addition of soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha-receptor or soluble interleukin-1-receptor indicating that its expression was not due to endogenous production of either cytokine. In addition, E-selectin was increased in cells stimulated with basic fibroblast growth factor, a well-known mitogen for endothelial cells. E-selectin in proliferating endothelial cells is functional, as shown by E-selectin-dependent adhesion of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 to subconfluent human microvascular endothelial cells. In summary, these studies indicate that E-selectin can be regulated by a non-inflammatory pathway that is related to the proliferative state of the endothelium.","['Luo, J', 'Paranya, G', 'Bischoff, J']","['Luo J', 'Paranya G', 'Bischoff J']","[""Surgical Research Laboratory, Children's Hospital and the Department of Surgery, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle', 'E-Selectin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3785-91.,['0 (E-Selectin)'],,,['S0006-4971(20)59508-6 [pii]'],,,"['F32 HL09390/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA 45548/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 GM46757/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of WEHI-3B D+ myelomonocytic leukemia and myeloid LGM-1 cells overexpressing the G-CSFR to G-CSF resulted in induction of differentiation as measured by (1) the ability to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), (2) the expression of Mac-I antigen, and (3) the expression of FcgammaII/III receptor. Mutational analyses indicated that distinct regions of the cytoplasmic domain were critical for efficient induction of each functional marker. The membrane proximal region containing homology sequences of boxes 1 and 2 was important for the activation of all three functional markers of mature neutrophils. Induction of the capacities to express Mac-I antigen or FcgammaII/III receptor also required additional sequences in the membrane proximal region between amino acids 70 and 100 and may be dependent on the phosphorylation of Tyr703. The findings suggest that distinct sequences within the amino-terminal region of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor are sufficient to induce these functional markers of differentiation, and receptor tyrosine phosphorylation may be necessary.","['Koay, D C', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Koay DC', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/biosynthesis', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3774-84.,"['0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59507-4 [pii]'],,,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

CrkL is most abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cells and has been implicated in pathogenesis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, its function has not been precisely defined. Here, we show that overexpression of CrkL enhances the adhesion of hematopoietic 32D cells to fibronectin. The CrkL-induced increase in cell adhesion was blocked by antibodies against VLA-4 (alpha4beta1) and VLA-5 (alpha5beta1) but was observed without changes in surface expression levels of these integrins. Studies using CrkL mutants demonstrated that the SH2 domain is partially required for enhancing cell adhesion, whereas the C-terminal SH3 domain as well as the tyrosine phosphorylation site (Y207) is dispensable. In contrast, the N-terminal SH3 domain, involved in binding C3G and other signaling molecules, was showed to play a crucial role, because a mutant defective of this domain showed an inhibitory effect on the cell adhesion to fibronectin. Furthermore, overexpression of C3G also increased the adhesion of hematopoietic cells to fibronectin, whereas a C3G mutant lacking the guanine nucleotide exchange domain abrogated the CrkL-induced increase in cell adhesion. On the other hand, a dominant negative mutant of H-Ras or that of Raf-1 enhanced the basal and CrkL-induced cell adhesion and that of R-Ras modestly decreased the adhesion. Taken together, these results indicate that the CrkL-C3G complex activates VLA-4 and VLA-5 in hematopoietic cells, possibly by activating the small GTP binding proteins, including R-Ras, through the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of C3G.","['Arai, A', 'Nosaka, Y', 'Kohsaka, H', 'Miyasaka, N', 'Miura, O']","['Arai A', 'Nosaka Y', 'Kohsaka H', 'Miyasaka N', 'Miura O']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Fibronectins', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*physiology', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'src Homology Domains']",1999/05/26 00:00,1999/05/26 00:01,['1999/05/26 00:00'],"['1999/05/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/26 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1999 Jun 1;93(11):3713-22.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (ras Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)']",,,['S0006-4971(20)59502-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a dose escalation study, 40 patients with relapsed or refractory CD33(+) AML were treated with an immunoconjugate (CMA-676) consisting of humanized anti-CD33 antibody linked to the potent antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. The capacity of leukemic cells to efflux 3, 3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC2) was used to estimate pretreatment functional drug resistance. Leukemia was eliminated from the blood and marrow of 8 (20%) of the 40 patients; blood counts returned to normal in three (8%) patients. A high rate of clinical response was observed in leukemias characterized by low dye efflux in vitro. Infusions of CMA-676 were generally well tolerated, and a postinfusion syndrome of fever and chills was the most common toxic effect. Two patients who were treated at the highest dose level (9 mg/m2) were neutropenic >5 weeks after the last dose of CMA-676.

HCV antibody tests were performed by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and positive tests confirmed by the recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA). HCV RNA levels were measured by the branched DNA (bDNA) assay. Seventy-five leukemia survivors with 25 or more blood donor exposures were identified. Nine (12%) were anti-HCV positive.

Mean HCV RNA levels were 10.3 x10(6) eq/mL versus 3.2 x 10(6) eq/mL (P =.056) in a control group of 20 anti-HCV positive immunocompetent individuals of comparable age who were infected twice as long (17.8 +/- 6.5 years v 9.0 +/- 4.4 years in leukemia survivors, P =.001). Liver biopsies were performed on six of the nine anti-HCV positive leukemia survivors. All showed at least moderate portal inflammation and half had evidence of bridging fibrosis.

Seventy patients with acute lymphoblastic and 32 with acute myeloid leukemia were given either a related (n = 42) or an unrelated (n = 60) CBT. Children given CBT during first or second complete remission were considered as belonging to the good-risk group (n = 66), whereas those who received a transplant in a more advanced stage of disease were assigned to the poor-risk group (n = 36). In the related group (RCBT), 12 of 42 patients received transplantation from an HLA-disparate donor, whereas in the unrelated group (UCBT) 54 of 60 received an HLA mismatched CBT. Kaplan-Meier estimates for neutrophil recovery at day 60 were 84% +/- 7% in RCBT and 79 +/- 6% in UCBT (P =.16). In multivariate analysis, the most important factor influencing neutrophil engraftment in UCBT was a nucleated cell dose infused greater than 3.7 x 10(7)/kg (P =.05, relative risk [RR] of 1.85, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.98-3.4). The incidence of grade II through IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 41% +/- 8% in the RCBT group and 37% +/- 6% in the UCBT group (P =.59). Kaplan-Meier estimates of 2-year event-free survival (EFS) after RCBT or UCBT were 39% +/- 8% and 30% +/- 7%, respectively (P =.19). In multivariate analysis, the most important factor influencing EFS was disease status at time of transplantation: good-risk patients had a 2-year EFS of 49% +/- 7% as compared to 8% +/- 5% in patients with more advanced disease (P =.0003, RR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0. 65).

To test this hypothesis, we administered cyclophosphamide or etoposide to cohorts of wild-type and heterozygous Nf1 knockout mice. Cyclophosphamide exposure cooperated strongly with heterozygous inactivation of Nf1 in myeloid leukemogenesis, while etoposide did not. Somatic loss of the normal Nf1 allele correlated with clinical disease and was more common in 129/Sv mice than in 129/Sv x C57BL/6 animals.

We characterized the clinical features and outcomes of patients with concurrent IBD and MDS. Using a diagnostic index, we identified all patients with both IBD and MDS at our center between 1976 and 1997. We also calculated an incidence rate of MDS in IBD using population-based data from Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 1950 and 1993. Among approximately 15,000 IBD patients seen, 25 (approximately 0.17%) were diagnosed with MDS. Fourteen had Crohn's disease and 11 had ulcerative colitis. The median age at diagnosis of IBD, particularly Crohn's disease, was higher than expected. Median age at diagnosis of MDS was typical. All but one ulcerative colitis patient was diagnosed before the diagnosis of MDS, while one-half of Crohn's disease patients were diagnosed with both ailments simultaneously. Five patients who had been diagnosed with IBD first were persistently anemic for at least 1 year prior to diagnosis of MDS. Two Crohn's disease patients had received purine analogs in the past. Median follow-up after MDS diagnosis was 1 year. Seven patients died, including two who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia. The incidence rate of MDS in IBD based on Olmsted County data was 0 cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 0-55.2). The seemingly high frequency of myelodysplastic syndromes in a large referral-based group of patients with IBD suggests an association; however, an increased risk of MDS was not observed in a small regional cohort of IBD patients. Patients with MDS are diagnosed with concurrent IBD at an age older than expected. Simultaneous diagnoses were made in one-half of Crohn's disease patients. MDS should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia in IBD patients.","['Harewood, G C', 'Loftus, E V Jr', 'Tefferi, A', 'Tremaine, W J', 'Sandborn, W J']","['Harewood GC', 'Loftus EV Jr', 'Tefferi A', 'Tremaine WJ', 'Sandborn WJ']","['Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Inflamm Bowel Dis,Inflammatory bowel diseases,9508162,IM,,"['Aged', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/*complications/epidemiology', 'Crohn Disease/*complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1999/05/25 06:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/05/25 06:00'],"['1999/05/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/05/25 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Inflamm Bowel Dis. 1999 May;5(2):98-103. doi: 10.1097/00054725-199905000-00005.,,,,['10.1097/00054725-199905000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to evaluate enteral and parenteral glutamine in patients undergoing BMT. METHODS: For evaluation of GLN in BMT, 66 patients with 43 hematologic and 23 solid malignancies (21 breast carcinomas), were randomized, double-blinded, to either oral GLN (n = 35) or glycine-control (GLY) (n = 31), 10 g three times daily. When TPN became necessary, patients who received GLN orally were given TPN with GLN (0.57 g/kg). Those who received GLY received standard TPN, isocaloric and isonitrogenous. Patients with hematologic malignancies received high-dose chemotherapy, total body irradiation, and either allogeneic (ALLO) BMT (n = 18) or autologous (AUTO) stem cell transplantation (n = 25). Patients with solid malignancies (n = 23) received AUTO. RESULTS: There were 14 in-hospital deaths without relationship to GLN administration. For respective comparisons of ALLO and AUTO transplants in the GLN and GLY hematologic groups and AUTO in the solid tumor groups, there were no significant differences in hospital stay, duration of stay after BMT, TPN days, neutrophil recovery >500/mm3, incidence of positive blood cultures, sepsis, mucositis, and diarrhea. Acute graft us host disease occurred in 1 of 10 hematologic patients receiving GLN and in 3 of 8 patients receiving GLY placebo (p > .05). Possible reduction in need for TPN and a suggestion of improved long-term survival were associated with GLN. CONCLUSIONS: Oral and parenteral GLN seemed to be of limited benefit for patients having AUTO or ALLO BMT for hematologic or solid malignancies. Further study of long-term effects of GLN in BMT seems warranted.","['Schloerb, P R', 'Skikne, B S']","['Schloerb PR', 'Skikne BS']","['Department of Surgery, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City 66160, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,JPEN J Parenter Enteral Nutr,JPEN.

In this study, we compared the NK-92-mediated cytolysis (NK-92-lysis) with the killing of healthy volunteers' NK cells and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. The NK-92-lysis was partially different from the NK- and LAK-lysis. 1) The NK-92 could kill most of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigen-positive tumor cells. 2) The NK cells killed a myeloid leukemia cell line K562, but the NK-92 showed low killer activity against it. 3) The LAK cells could not kill a CD58-deficient cell line OKM-2T, whereas the NK-92 could kill it sufficiently. 4) The NK-92 could not kill CD54-, CD102-deficient cell lines T98G and U373MG; however, the LAK cells could kill them. Blocking tests using specific antibodies revealed the reason for these differences. The K562 expressed relatively low levels of CD54 and CD102. When the K562 was pretreated with anti-CD54 and anti-CD102, the NK-92 could not kill it at all, whereas the NK cells could still kill it, although the killing level decreased. The NK-92 could not kill the anti-CD54- and anti-CD102-treated OKM-2T. The LAK cells could not kill anti-CD58-treated U373MG and T98G. These findings suggest that NK-92-lysis may require the CD54 and CD102 but that NK-lysis does not require them as much, whereas the LAK-lysis may be rather in relation with the CD58. The NK-92 has high killer activity, and may be applicable for clinical use. However, it should be considered that the NK-92 cannnot kill CD54-, CD102-deficient tumor cells.","['Komatsu, F', 'Kajiwara, M']","['Komatsu F', 'Kajiwara M']","['Blood Transfusion Service, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,IM,,"['Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1999/05/25 00:00,1999/05/25 00:01,['1999/05/25 00:00'],"['1999/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Res. 1998;10(10):483-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recipient mice become long survivors (LS mice) and tolerant to host mHAgs. However, a GVL effect is preserved and mediated by CD8+ CTL able to kill P815 tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. To explain why a GVL exists without GVHD, we compared the CTL activity of LS and B10.D2 donor mice after immunization with DBA/2 spleen cells or with P815 cells. Experimental results indicated that: (1) the level of cytotoxicity for H-2b incompatible cells was similar in LS and B10.D2 mice; (2) CTL recognizing host DBA/2 mHAgs, whose expression is restricted to the spleen or is shared between spleen and P815 cells, were partially unresponsive in LS mice; (3) P815 injection into LS mice predominantly generated CTL specific for antigens restricted to P815 cells, the repertoire of which was not tolerized. Characterization of TCR beta chain showed that the diversity of Vbeta and Jbeta usage by CD8+ T cells activated after P815 injection is considerably restricted in LS mice, compared to B10.D2 donor mice. These results indicated that the GVL effect in LS mice involved mainly T cells specific for tissue-restricted antigens expressed on P815 cells and not on normal DBA/2 spleen cells. In addition, the absence of GVHD may be attributed to the unresponsiveness of CD8+ CTL specific for host mHAgs expressed on DBA/2 spleen cells.","['de La Selle, V', 'Riche, N', 'Dorothe, G', 'Bruley-Rosset, M']","['de La Selle V', 'Riche N', 'Dorothe G', 'Bruley-Rosset M']","['Unite INSERM 267, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Immunization', 'Mice', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/25 00:00,1999/05/25 00:01,['1999/05/25 00:00'],"['1999/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1999 May;23(9):951-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1701750.,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],,,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1701750 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This sequence was found to be most similar to the murine leukemia C-type retroviruses and to murine defective endogenous retrovirus-like families MuRRS and MuRVY, although MuERVC-C105 has a novel LTR. MuERVC-C105, like MuRRS and MuRVY, represents a family of retrovirus-like sequences characterized by many defects in its reading frames. Phylogenetic analyses, in particular analysis of nonsynonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitutions in the descent of these sequences, revealed that the MuERVC-C105, MuRRS, and MuRVY families were each derived from a different nondefective retroviral ancestor, thus justifying the new family name MuERVC. These nondefective ancestors cluster together with Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus, but were nearly as distinct from each other as are other subgroups of murine leukemia virus (MoMLV, BaEV, GALV). The analysis further indicated that, in spite of the high density of defects in these three families, most of their divergence from their common ancestor was as nondefective retroviruses.","['Zhao, Y', 'Jacobs, C P', 'Wang, L', 'Hardies, S C']","['Zhao Y', 'Jacobs CP', 'Wang L', 'Hardies SC']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio 78284-7760, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mamm Genome,Mammalian genome : official journal of the International Mammalian Genome Society,9100916,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', 'Genes, env', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1999/05/25 00:00,1999/05/25 00:01,['1999/05/25 00:00'],"['1999/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mamm Genome. 1999 May;10(5):477-81. doi: 10.1007/s003359901026.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,['10.1007/s003359901026 [doi]'],,,"['GM51847/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HG00190/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/AF049340'],,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer mortality among the study population was basically compared with that of whole Japanese men. The significant low SMRs were obtained for all cancers, stomach and lung cancer partly due to Healthy Worker Effect, unlike the results of the early reports with some inappropriateness in the methods. Apparent high risks of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers were observed, although none of site-specific cancers revealed the statistically significant increase. For these cancers, the SMRs among old sub-cohort were somewhat higher than those of young sub-cohort, whereas similar SMRs for solid cancer were obtained between the two sub-cohorts. The SMR for leukemia reached statistically significant level of 1.75 (95% CI: 1.07-2.71) when using whole professional and technical workers as a standard population.

In cases with longer survival time shrinkage and deformation of neurons, especially Purkinje and dentate nuclei cells were observed.

Using human K562 erythroleukemia cells capable of differentiating along erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages, we explore the differentiation-related role of heat shock transcription factor 2 (HSF2), which belongs to a family of transcription factors generally known to regulate heat shock gene expression. We demonstrate that enhanced HSF2 expression and the acquisition of HSF2 DNA binding activity are strictly specific for erythroid characteristics of K562 cells. Our results reveal a multistep regulatory process of HSF2 gene expression. In K562 cells undergoing hemin-mediated erythroid differentiation, the increase in HSF2 protein levels is preceded by transcriptional induction of the HSF2 gene, accompanied by increased HSF2 mRNA stability. In contrast, during megakaryocytic differentiation induced by the phorbol ester TPA, expression of HSF2 is rapidly down-regulated, leading to a complete loss of the HSF2 protein. These results indicate that the determination of HSF2 expression occurs at the early stages of lineage commitment. Taken together, our data suggest that HSF2 could function as a lineage-restricted transcription factor during differentiation of K562 cells along either the erythroid or the megakaryocytic pathway.","['Pirkkala, L', 'Alastalo, T P', 'Nykanen, P', 'Seppa, L', 'Sistonen, L']","['Pirkkala L', 'Alastalo TP', 'Nykanen P', 'Seppa L', 'Sistonen L']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, Department of Biology, Anatomy, and Biochemistry and Pharmacy, Abo Akademi University, University of Turku, FIN-20521 Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', '*Erythropoiesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/25 00:00,1999/05/25 00:01,['1999/05/25 00:00'],"['1999/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 1999 Jun;13(9):1089-98. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.13.9.1089.,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '142297-91-4 (HSF2 protein, human)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['10.1096/fasebj.13.9.1089 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of determination of nucleotide sequence, this envelope protein had the CKS-17 peptide sequence having immunosuppressive activity. To investigate the role of our cloned transmembrane envelope protein in the pathogenesis of autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) as an autoantigen or immunosuppressive modulator, a high amount of transmembrane envelope protein was essentially required. Therefore, the expression of our cloned retroviral transmembrane envelope gene was tried in Escherichia coli by a pET vector. However, the expression rate was very low (less than 2%) and most of the expressed protein was insoluble. To improve solubility, the hydrophobic transmembrane anchor domain of our envelope gene was deleted and then the expression of the hydrophilic transmembrane envelope protein was carried out by using the same pET expression system. The expressed protein was completely soluble and the expression yield was dramatically improved by around 25-fold increase. The hydrophilic transmembrane envelope protein was purified by one-step Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and then the fusion tag consisting of the six-histidine peptide and S peptide was removed by cleavage with enterokinase. The processed hydrophilic retroviral transmembrane envelope protein was still immune reactive with NOD sera and also showed immunosuppressive activity by down-regulating the Th1-type cytokine (interferon-gamma) and up-regulating the Th2-type cytokine (interleukin 10).","['Kim, K S', 'Kim, K H', 'Choi, S E', 'Yoon, J W', 'Kang, Y']","['Kim KS', 'Kim KH', 'Choi SE', 'Yoon JW', 'Kang Y']","['Laboratory of Endocrinology, Institute for Medical Sciences, Suwon, Kyunggi-Do, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Protein Expr Purif,Protein expression and purification,9101496,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Autoantigens/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/etiology/immunology', 'Escherichia coli/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/isolation & purification', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-10/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification']",1999/05/25 00:00,1999/05/25 00:01,['1999/05/25 00:00'],"['1999/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Protein Expr Purif. 1999 Jun;16(1):19-26. doi: 10.1006/prep.1999.1042.,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,"['S1046-5928(99)91042-2 [pii]', '10.1006/prep.1999.1042 [doi]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To trigger this signaling cascade, Tax associates stably with and persistently activates a cellular IkappaB kinase (IKK) containing both catalytic (IKKalpha and IKKbeta) and noncatalytic (IKKgamma) subunits. We now demonstrate that IKKgamma enables Tax to dock with the IKKbeta catalytic subunit, resulting in chronic IkappaB kinase activation. Mutations in either IKKgamma or Tax that prevent formation of these higher order Tax.IKK complexes also interfere with the ability of Tax to induce IKKbeta catalytic function in vivo. Deletion mapping studies indicate that amino acids 1-100 of IKKgamma are required for this Tax targeting function. Together, these findings identify IKKgamma as an adaptor protein that directs the stable formation of pathologic Tax.IKK complexes in virally infected T cells.","['Chu, Z L', 'Shin, Y A', 'Yang, J M', 'DiDonato, J A', 'Ballard, D W']","['Chu ZL', 'Shin YA', 'Yang JM', 'DiDonato JA', 'Ballard DW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-0295, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,,"['Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1999 May 28;274(22):15297-300. doi: 10.1074/jbc.274.22.15297.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)']",,,"['10.1074/jbc.274.22.15297 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)73022-1 [pii]']",,,"['R01AI33839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

No expression of mRNA for three muscle-type Nc receptor subunits (alpha1, beta1 and epsilon) was observed in the MNLs and cell lines.

Thus, the utility of counting CD34+ cells and white cells (WBCs) in the peripheral blood was evaluated as a predictor of CD34+ cell yield in the apheresis component. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The WBC and CD34+ cell counts in the peripheral blood and the apheresis components from 216 collections were assessed. Sixty-three patients underwent mobilization with chemotherapy plus filgrastim, and 17 patients and 14 allogeneic PBPC donors did so with filgrastim alone. The relationship between the number of WBC and CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood and in the apheresis component was analyzed by using rank correlation and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The correlation coefficient for CD34+ cells per liter of peripheral blood with CD34+ cell yield (x 10(6)/kg) was 0.87 (n = 216 collections). This correlation existed for many patient and collection variables. However, patients with acute myeloid leukemia had fewer CD34+ cells in the apheresis component at any level of peripheral blood CD34+ cell count. Components collected from patients with CD34+ cell counts below 10 x 10(6) per L in the peripheral blood contained a median of 0.75 x 10(6) CD34+ cells per kg. When the WBC count in the blood was below 5.0 x 10(9) per L, the median number of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood was 5.6 x 10(6) per L (range, 1.0-15.5 x 10(6)/L). A very poor correlation was found between the WBC count in the blood and the CD34+ cell yield (p = 0.12, n = 158 collections). CONCLUSION: The number of CD34+ cells, but not WBCs, in the peripheral blood can be used as a predictor for timing of apheresis and estimating PBPC yield. This is a robust relationship not affected by a variety of patient and collection factors except the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia. Patients who undergo mobilization with chemotherapy and filgrastim also should undergo monitoring of peripheral blood CD34+ cell counts, beginning when the WBC count in the blood exceeds 1.0 to 5.0 x 10(9) per L.","['Yu, J', 'Leisenring, W', 'Bensinger, W I', 'Holmberg, L A', 'Rowley, S D']","['Yu J', 'Leisenring W', 'Bensinger WI', 'Holmberg LA', 'Rowley SD']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/*blood', '*Blood Component Removal', 'Blood Specimen Collection', 'Body Weight/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Leukocyte Count', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 1999 May;39(5):442-50. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39050442.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1999.39050442.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potential cutaneous marker for B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A report of unusual case with immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence correlation and review of the literature.",206-12,"Reactive cutaneous vascular proliferation or angiomatosis is associated with various conditions, but is rarely seen secondary to vascular occlusion. We report an unusual case of a 79-year-old female who presented with 8 month history of purpuric facial plaques, with painful crusted ulceration of the nose, later developing similar eruptions on hands, thighs and trunk. Biopsies showed marked angioproliferation, with intravascular (IV) hyaline deposits (PAS+, fibrin+/-; IgM+, fibrinogen+, and C3+), associated with endothelial hyperplasia (Factor VIII+, Vimentin+). Immunofluorescence showed IV IgM, fibrinogen, and granular C3 deposits within vessel walls. Initially, extensive investigations only showed minimal monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and repeatedly negative cryoglobulins. After a 3-year follow-up, the patient developed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). This case illustrates a difficult diagnostic challenge. Although this condition resembles other forms of reactive angiomatosis, it shows distinct features and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of unusual vascular proliferations of the skin. The cutaneous lesions are also considered a potential marker for an underlying systemic condition, which may require prolonged clinical follow-up. We believe this condition to be related to other rare cutaneous vascular proliferations associated with plasma cell and lymphoproliferative disorders. Furthermore, we suggest a common pathogenetic pathway resulting from the IV immunoglobulin deposits causing vascular injury, finally leading to the angiomatosis.","['Salama, S S', 'Jenkin, P']","['Salama SS', 'Jenkin P']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine (Pathology), St. Joseph's Hospital and McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,,"['Aged', 'Angiomatosis/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Complement C3/analysis', 'Factor VIII/analysis', 'Female', 'Fibrin/analysis', 'Fibrinogen/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/analysis', 'Immunoglobulins/*analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/metabolism/pathology', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/complications/metabolism/*pathology', 'Skin/chemistry/immunology/pathology', 'Skin Diseases, Vascular/immunology/metabolism/*pathology']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 1999 Apr;26(4):206-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0560.1999.tb01830.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)']",,,['10.1111/j.1600-0560.1999.tb01830.x [doi]'],,,,32,,,,,,,,,,,,

The magnitude of the behaviour problems correlated positively to CNS treatment intensity. The parents rated their children's school competence as lower than did parents of a normative sample.

In addition, the relation between the susceptibility to these immunotherapies and the expression levels of HLA class 1 and ICAM-1 as well as CD20 on the cell surface was analyzed. Three of six VCR-resistant cell lines were less susceptible to PBL cytotoxicity compared with wild-type cells, whereas the susceptibility was kept in the other three VCR-resistant cell lines. Four of six VCR-resistant cell lines were less susceptible to LAK activity and the other two cell lines were as sensitive to LAK cells as their wild-type counterparts. There was no correlation between the susceptibility for PBL cytotoxicity and the expression of HLA class 1 in both wild and VCR-resistant cells. In contrast, ICAM-1 in the two cell lines that showed decreased susceptibility for LAK cytotoxicity disappeared, although that in one cell line increased. IDEC-C2B8 was effective only against B-cell lines expressing CD20. One cell line in which the expression of CD20 increased was nearly six times more sensitive to IDEC-C2B8 than wild type. Thus, we concluded that the resistance to VCR in some tumor cell lines is associated with modified susceptibility for immunotherapies by the different expression of target molecules from those of wild-type counterparts.","['Hirose, M', 'Hamano, S', 'Tobinai, K', 'Kuroda, Y']","['Hirose M', 'Hamano S', 'Tobinai K', 'Kuroda Y']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, School of Dentistry, University of Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/analysis/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunother. 1999 May;22(3):237-44. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199905000-00006.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,['10.1097/00002371-199905000-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous work has shown that, for para-aniline mustards, a propyl linker is optimal for cytotoxicity. Alkaline cleavage assays using a variety of different labelled oligonucleotides showed that the preferred sequences for adenine alkylation were 5'-TTTANANAANN and 5'-ATTANANAANN (underlined bases show the drug alkylation sites), with AT-rich sequences required on both the 5' and 3' sides of the alkylated adenine. The different aniline mustards showed little variation in alkylation pattern and similar efficiencies of DNA cross-link formation despite the changes in orientation and positioning of the mustard, suggesting that the propyl linker has some flexibility. The imidazole- and pyrrolebis(hydroxymethyl) alkylators showed no DNA strand cleavage following base treatment, indicating that no guanine or adenine N3 or N7 adducts were formed. Using the PCR-based polymerase stop assay, these alkylators showed PCR blocks at 5'-C*G sites (the * nucleotide indicates the blocked site), particularly at 5'-TAC*GA 5'-AGC*GGA, and 5'-AGCC*GGT sequences, caused by guanine 2-NH2 lesions on the opposite strand. Only the (more reactive) imidazolebis(methylcarbamoyl) and pyrrolebis(hydroxymethyl) alkylators demonstrated interstrand cross-linking ability. All of the bifunctional mustards showed large (approximately 100-fold) increases in cytotoxicity over chlorambucil, with the corresponding monofunctional mustards being 20- to 60-fold less cytotoxic. These results suggest that in the mustards the propyl linker provides sufficient flexibility to achieve delivery of the alkylator to favoured (adenine N3) sites in the minor groove, regardless of its exact geometry with respect to the bisbenzimidazole carrier. The 'targeted' bisbenzimidazole bis(hydroxymethyl)pyrrole- and imidazole analogues showed very similar patterns of alkylation to the corresponding 'untargeted' compounds, with little evidence of additional selectivity imposed by this AT-preferring carrier.","['Smaill, J B', 'Fan, J Y', 'Denny, W A']","['Smaill JB', 'Fan JY', 'Denny WA']","['Auckland Cancer Society Research Centre, Faculty of Medicine and Health Science, University of Auckland, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzimidazoles/*chemistry', 'Cattle', 'DNA Adducts/chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mustard Compounds/*chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1998 Dec;13(8):857-80.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (Mustard Compounds)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The interindividual difference in the hepatic expression of CYP3A4 is considerable. In order to investigate possible genetic factor(s) causing this variation, the rate of 6beta-hydroxylation of testosterone in human liver microsomes prepared from 46 different human liver samples was determined and the 5'upstream region (+10 to -490 bp) was sequenced from genomic DNA isolated from 39 of these livers. We found a 31-fold variation of the testosterone hydroxylase activity between the samples. However, a very high sequence homology between the CYP3A4 5'-upstream regions sequenced from the 78 different alleles was found. In fact, only three variant nucleotide exchanges were identified, all causing a -290 A-->G mutation (CYP3A4-V) in a so called nifedipine specific element (NFSE). The importance of this element and the polymorphism was evaluated by gel shift analysis. Competition experiments revealed that the binding of nuclear proteins, although having lower affinity to the CYP3A4-V form of the element, was unspecific in nature. In accordance, no influence of this polymorphism was seen on the microsomal testosterone hydroxylase activity in vitro. It is concluded that the promoter region of CYP3A4 is highly conserved, the only polymorphism being in the NFSE, which however does not influence the enzyme expression in liver to a significant degree. This casts doubt of a previously described relationship between the CYP3A4-V allele and cancer in the prostate and leukaemia.","['Westlind, A', 'Lofberg, L', 'Tindberg, N', 'Andersson, T B', 'Ingelman-Sundberg, M']","['Westlind A', 'Lofberg L', 'Tindberg N', 'Andersson TB', 'Ingelman-Sundberg M']","['Institute of Environmental Medicine, Division of Molecular Toxicology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, 171 77, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA Probes/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hydroxytestosterones/analysis', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/*genetics', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Steroid Hydroxylases/metabolism', 'Testosterone/metabolism']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 May 27;259(1):201-5. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0752.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Hydroxytestosterones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'EC 1.14.- (Steroid Hydroxylases)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (steroid hormone 6-beta-hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.14.14.55 (CYP3A4 protein, human)']",,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.0752 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)90752-0 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to recent findings in HL-60 cells (Fang et al., Cancer Res. 58, 3202, 1998), U937 cells overexpressing Bcl-2Delta32-80 were significantly more resistant than those overexpressing full-length protein to caspase-3 and -9 activation, PARP degradation, and apoptosis induced by paclitaxel (500 nM; 18 h). Bcl-2Delta32-80 was also more effective than its full-length counterpart in opposing paclitaxel-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, e.g., loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim) and cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm. Enhanced resistance of U937/Bcl-2Delta32-80 cells to paclitaxel was observed primarily in the G2M population. Together, these findings demonstrate that deletion of the Bcl-2 phosphorylation loop domain increases resistance of U937 leukemia cells to paclitaxel-mediated mitochondrial damage and apoptosis and suggest that factors other than, or in addition to, phosphorylation contribute to Bcl-2-related cytoprotectivity against paclitaxel in this model system.","['Wang, S', 'Wang, Z', 'Boise, L', 'Dent, P', 'Grant, S']","['Wang S', 'Wang Z', 'Boise L', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia, 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",1999/05/21 00:00,1999/05/21 00:01,['1999/05/21 00:00'],"['1999/05/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/21 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1999 May 27;259(1):67-72. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1999.0669.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,,"['10.1006/bbrc.1999.0669 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(99)90669-1 [pii]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],"['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72955/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77141/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data on all deliveries (248,701 births) in two counties in Sweden 1955-90 were extracted from two birth registries. The follow-up period closed at the end of 1994 and the subjects were followed up to early middle-age at most (39 years). Incidence rates of malignancy were obtained from the Cancer Register 1958-1994. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and relative risks (RR) were calculated. RESULTS: Overall, few associations were detected. A significantly increased standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 50.00 (95% CI = 13.45-99.99) was found for the relationship between Down's syndrome and lymphatic leukaemia. Elder maternal age (> or =35 years) and lymphatic leukaemia were associated with a significantly enhanced risk (SIR = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.16-3.20). Maternal age 25-34 years, compared to younger age, was associated with a reduced risk of cervical cancer (RR = 0.47; 95% CI = 0.26-0.86).

METHODS: Mortality and cancer incidence were investigated among 2553 female and male laboratory workers employed at the Karolinska Institute and Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm between 1950 and 1989. Mortality was followed from 1952-1993 and cancer incidence from 1958-1992. Expected numbers were based on the general population in Stockholm, standardizing for age, gender, and calendar period. RESULTS: The overall mortality and cancer incidence in the cohort was lower than expected. There were in all 10 cases of hemato-lymphatic malignancies (three acute myeloid leukemias, four non-Hodgkin lymphomas, two Hodgkin's lymphomas, and one multiple myeloma) in the cohort. The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for hematolymphatic tumors was increased among workers who had ever been employed in laboratories with a high probability for chemical exposure, SIR 224 (95% CI 108-412). The risk of breast cancer among women was increased after more than 10 years of work in high-exposure laboratories, SIR 225 (128-365). The number of malignant melanomas exceeded those expected.

A marked increase in incidence in non-Hodgkin's disease (NHL) and the pre-leukemia group of myeloid dysplasias (MDS) was found. CONCLUSIONS: The rise in MDS and decline in AML and related conditions are most likely to reflect diagnostic changes. Changes in NHL may reflect, in part, a similar phenomena, but an underlying upward trend cannot be excluded. The decline in HD is in one gender only and the significance of this remains to be investigated.","['McNally, R J', 'Roman, E', 'Cartwright, R A']","['McNally RJ', 'Roman E', 'Cartwright RA']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Leeds, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Registries', 'Sex Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1999 Feb;10(1):35-42. doi: 10.1023/a:1008859730818.,,,,['10.1023/a:1008859730818 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Oral F-AMP was incorporated into the ""conventional"" treatment schedule. Single oral trial doses of 50, 70, and 90 mg of F-AMP were given on the first day of three cycles of treatment; a comparative 50-mg intravenous trial dose was given on the first day of the fourth cycle. Intravenous F-AMP (25 mg/m2) was given on days 2 to 5 at 4-week intervals. Pharmacokinetic samples taken after each trial dose were analyzed for plasma 2-fluoro-arabinofuranosyladenine (2F-ara-A) concentration (its main metabolite); area under the curve 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24h)) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were calculated. Eighteen patients received all three oral trial doses, and bioavailability was determined in 15 patients who completed four courses of therapy. RESULTS: Oral administration of F-AMP resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Cmax and AUC(0-24h) of 2F-ara-A and achieved an AUC(0-24h) similar to intravenous administration, although at a lower Cm. The linear increase in mean AUC(0-24h) by factors of 1.36 +/- 0.22 (mean +/- SD) and 1.72 +/- 0.31 corresponded well with the increase in oral dose from 50 to 70 mg (factor of 1.4) and 90 mg (factor of 1.8), respectively. Bioavailability (approximately 55%, with low intraindividual variation) and time to Cmax were dose independent. CONCLUSION: Oral doses of F-AMP can achieve an AUC(0-24h) of 2F-ara-A similar to intravenous administration, with dose-independent bioavailability. The tablet will greatly enhance the use of F-AMP in a palliative setting.","['Foran, J M', 'Oscier, D', 'Orchard, J', 'Johnson, S A', 'Tighe, M', 'Cullen, M H', 'de Takats, P G', 'Kraus, C', 'Klein, M', 'Lister, T A']","['Foran JM', 'Oscier D', 'Orchard J', 'Johnson SA', 'Tighe M', 'Cullen MH', 'de Takats PG', 'Kraus C', 'Klein M', 'Lister TA']","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom. foran@icrf.icnet.uk""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biological Availability', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 May;17(5):1574-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1574.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1574 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CSF asparagine concentration reflects asparaginase systemic pharmacodynamics. We evaluated the time course of CSF asparagine depletion in children with ALL during and after a course of Escherichia coli asparaginase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-one children (24 newly diagnosed and seven at relapse) received E coli asparaginase 10,000 IU/m2 intramuscularly three times weekly for six and nine doses, respectively, as part of multiagent induction chemotherapy. CSF asparagine levels were measured before, during, and after asparaginase dosing. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with undetectable (< 0.04 micromol/L) CSF asparagine was 3.2% (one of 31 patients) at baseline, 73.9% (17 of 23) during asparaginase therapy, and 56.3% (nine of 16) 1 to 5 days, 43.8% (seven of 16) 6 to 10 days, 20.0% (two of 10) 11 to 30 days and 0% (zero of 21) more than 30 days after asparaginase therapy. The proportion of patients with depleted CSF asparagine was higher during asparaginase therapy than at baseline (P < .001), 11 to 30 days (P = .003), and more than 30 days after asparaginase therapy (P < .001). Median CSF asparagine concentrations were 4.42 micromol/L before, less than 0.04 micromol/L during, and less than 0.04 micromol/L at 1 to 5 days, 1.63 micromol/L at 6 to 10 days, 1.70 micromol/L at 11 to 30 days, and 5.70 micromol/L at more than 30 days after asparaginase therapy, respectively. CSF depletion was more common in patients with low baseline CSF asparagine concentrations (P = .003). CONCLUSION: CSF asparagine concentrations are depleted by conventional doses of E coli asparaginase in the majority of patients, but they rebound once asparaginase therapy is completed.","['Woo, M H', 'Hak, L J', 'Storm, M C', 'Gajjar, A J', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Harrison, P L', 'Wang, B', 'Pui, C H', 'Relling, M V']","['Woo MH', 'Hak LJ', 'Storm MC', 'Gajjar AJ', 'Sandlund JT', 'Harrison PL', 'Wang B', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, and College of Pharmacy, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Asparagine/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Likelihood Functions', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/therapy', 'Remission Induction/methods']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 May;17(5):1568-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1568.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1568 [doi]'],,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Antithymocyte globulin and thiotepa were added to standard total-body irradiation/cyclophosphamide conditioning. Donor bone marrows were depleted ex vivo of T lymphocytes by soybean agglutination and E-rosetting. This approach was tested in 54 consecutive patients with acute leukemia who received transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors or, in two cases, from family donors mismatched at D-DR. No posttransplant immunosuppressive treatment was given as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. RESULTS: Neither graft rejection nor GVHD occurred. Transplant-related deaths occurred in six (16.6%) of 36 patients in remission and in seven (38.8%) of 18 patients in relapse at the time of transplantation. The probability of relapse was .12 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to .19) for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and .28 (95% CI, .05 to .51) for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who received transplants at the first or second remission. At a median follow-up of 6.9 years (minimum follow-up, 4.9 years), event-free survival for patients who received transplants while in remission was .74 (95% CI, .54 to .93) for acute myeloid leukemia patients and .59 (95% CI, .35 to .82) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. All surviving patients have 100% performance status. CONCLUSION: Adding antithymocyte globulin and thiotepa to the conditioning regimen prevents rejection of extensively T-cell-depleted bone marrow. Even in the complete absence of GVHD, the leukemia relapse rate is not higher than in unmanipulated transplants.","['Aversa, F', 'Terenzi, A', 'Carotti, A', 'Felicini, R', 'Jacucci, R', 'Zei, T', 'Latini, P', 'Aristei, C', 'Santucci, A', 'Martelli, M P', 'Cunningham, I', 'Reisner, Y', 'Martelli, M F']","['Aversa F', 'Terenzi A', 'Carotti A', 'Felicini R', 'Jacucci R', 'Zei T', 'Latini P', 'Aristei C', 'Santucci A', 'Martelli MP', 'Cunningham I', 'Reisner Y', 'Martelli MF']","['BMT Program, Section of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University of Perugia, Italy. aversa@unipg.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 May;17(5):1545-50. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1545.,,,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1545 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A decision analysis.,1465-73,"PURPOSE: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been a standard procedure in the management of breast cancer. In a patient with a clinically negative axilla, ALND is performed primarily for staging purposes, to guide adjuvant treatment. Recently, the routine use of ALND has been questioned because the results of the procedure may not change the choice of adjuvant systemic therapy and/or the survival benefit of a change in adjuvant therapy would be small. We constructed a decision model to quantify the benefits of ALND for patients eligible for breast-conserving therapy. METHODS: Patients were grouped by age, tumor size, and estrogen receptor (ER) status. The model uses the Oxford overviews and three combined Cancer and Leukemia Group B studies. We assumed that patients who did not undergo ALND received axillary radiation therapy and that the two procedures are equally effective. All chemotherapy combinations were assumed to be equally efficacious. RESULTS: The largest benefits from ALND are seen in ER-positive women with small primary tumors who might not be candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy if their lymph nodes test negative. Virtually no benefit results in ER-negative women, almost all of whom would receive adjuvant chemotherapy. When adjusted for quality of life (QOL), ALND may have an overall negative impact. In general, the benefits of ALND increase with the expected severity of adjuvant therapy on QOL CONCLUSION: Our model quantifies the benefits of ALND and assists decision making by patients and physicians. The results suggest that the routine use of ALND in breast cancer patients should be reassessed and may not be necessary in many patients.","['Parmigiani, G', 'Berry, D A', 'Winer, E P', 'Tebaldi, C', 'Iglehart, J D', 'Prosnitz, L R']","['Parmigiani G', 'Berry DA', 'Winer EP', 'Tebaldi C', 'Iglehart JD', 'Prosnitz LR']","['Institute of Statistics and Decision Sciences and Center for Clinical Health Policy Research, Duke University, Durham, NC 27708, USA. gp@isds.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Adult', 'Axilla', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/drug therapy/*pathology/*surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', '*Decision Support Techniques', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lymph Node Excision', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', '*Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Receptors, Estrogen', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tamoxifen/therapeutic use']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 May;17(5):1465-73. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1465.,"['0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)']",,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1465 [doi]'],,,"['P50 CA68438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-CA68438-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 365 women with measurable metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with chemotherapy for their metastatic disease, were randomized to receive either immediate chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil (CAF) or up to four cycles of one of five sequential cohorts of single-agent drugs: trimetrexate, melphalan, amonafide, carboplatin, or elsamitrucin, followed by CAF. RESULTS: The toxicity of each single agent followed by CAF was comparable to that of CAF alone. The cumulative response rates for the single agent followed by CAF were not statistically different from those of CAF alone (44% v 52%; P = .24). However, in the multivariate analysis, patients with visceral disease had a trend toward lower response rates on the phase II agent plus CAF arm (P = .078). Although survival and response duration also were not statistically significantly different between the two study arms (P = .074 and P = .069, respectively), there was a suggestion of benefit for the CAF-only arm. CONCLUSION: The brief use of a phase II agent, regardless of its efficacy, followed by CAF resulted in response rates, toxicities, durations of response, and survival statistically equivalent to those seen with the use of CAF alone. These findings support the use of a new paradigm for the evaluation of phase II agents in the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer.","['Costanza, M E', 'Weiss, R B', 'Henderson, I C', 'Norton, L', 'Berry, D A', 'Cirrincione, C', 'Winer, E', 'Wood, W C', 'Frei, E 3rd', 'McIntyre, O R', 'Schilsky, R L']","['Costanza ME', 'Weiss RB', 'Henderson IC', 'Norton L', 'Berry DA', 'Cirrincione C', 'Winer E', 'Wood WC', 'Frei E 3rd', 'McIntyre OR', 'Schilsky RL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, 01655, USA. mary.costanza@banyan.ummed.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,,"['Adenine', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Carboplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imides/therapeutic use', 'Isoquinolines/therapeutic use', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthalimides', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Organophosphonates', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Trimetrexate/therapeutic use']",1999/05/20 06:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/05/20 06:00'],"['1999/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1999 May;17(5):1397-406. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1397.,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Naphthalimides)', '0 (Organophosphonates)', '1Q8D39N37L (amonafide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'ZTV0FOB6NU (elsamicin A)', 'CAF protocol']",,,['10.1200/JCO.1999.17.5.1397 [doi]'],,,"['CA26506/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effect of IFN-alpha on the biologic functions of B-CLL cells, which were stimulated by cross-linking of the CD40 antigen. In cell samples from 16 B-CLL patients, the addition of IFN-alpha to CD40-stimulated purified B-CLL cells caused a significant increase in [3H]thymidine uptake (p < 0.003). In B-CLL cells maximally activated by CD40 cross-linking and interleukin-2 (IL-2)/IL-10, proliferation was not further enhanced or inhibited by IFN-alpha. In contrast, proliferation of normal tonsillar B cells stimulated by the combination CD40/IL-2/IL-10 was significantly inhibited by IFN-alpha. Because B-CLL activation might be enhanced by induction of the autocrine growth factor tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), we investigated the effect of IFN-alpha on the secretion of B cell tropic cytokines. In fact, IFN-alpha significantly stimulated the secretion of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in CD40-activated B-CLL cells (p < 0.01). Although exogenous addition of TNF-alpha did not influence activation of CD40-stimulated B-CLL cells, neutralization of TNF-alpha by polyclonal antibodies led to a complete inhibition of CD40-mediated proliferation of B-CLL cells, suggesting that enhanced proliferation and increased cytokine production by CD40-activated B-CLL cells are independent IFN-alpha-mediated events. The studies presented here provide evidence that IFN-alpha mediates costimulatory signals in the context of T cell-mediated B-CLL cell activation.","['Brass, U', 'Tretter, T', 'Schneller, F', 'Schuler, M', 'Huber, C', 'Peschel, C']","['Brass U', 'Tretter T', 'Schneller F', 'Schuler M', 'Huber C', 'Peschel C']","['IIIrd Department of Medicine, The Johannes Gutenberg University School of Medicine, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'CD40 Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999 Apr;19(4):335-43. doi: 10.1089/107999099314036.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,['10.1089/107999099314036 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Review of all cases of cytomegalovirus retinitis diagnosed or treated at a tertiary care pediatric hospital during a 10-year period. RESULTS: Nine immunocompromised children younger than 16 years were diagnosed as having cytomegalovirus retinitis. The underlying causes of immunocompromise were severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (n = 2), severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome after bone marrow transplantation (n = 1), acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (n = 2), AIDS and previous bone marrow transplantation for leukemia (n = 1), immunosuppressive therapy after renal transplantation (n = 1), chemotherapy for leukemia (n = 1), and congenital cytomegalovirus infection (n = 1). Five children (56%) had symptomatic extraocular cytomegalovirus infection. Only two children reported visual symptoms with cytomegalovirus retinitis at initial examination. Cytomegalovirus retinitis was bilateral in eight children (89%) and involved the posterior pole in at least one eye of all nine children. Four children (44%) died within 10 months of being diagnosed with cytomegalovirus retinitis. The remaining five children were alive, with follow-up ranging from 14 to 70 months. Successful bone marrow transplantation in one child and discontinuation of immunosuppressive medications in two children improved systemic immune function and permitted discontinuation of anticytomegaloviral therapy. CONCLUSION: Pediatric cytomegalovirus retinitis is often asymptomatic and bilateral and involves the posterior pole at initial examination. Recovery of systemic immune function may occur in some children. Evaluation of children at risk and prompt treatment of cytomegalo. virus retinitis are important to prevent long-term visual morbidity.","['Baumal, C R', 'Levin, A V', 'Read, S E']","['Baumal CR', 'Levin AV', 'Read SE']","['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis/*complications/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*complications', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Visual Acuity']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 1999 May;127(5):550-8. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9394(99)00031-8.,['0 (Antiviral Agents)'],,,"['S0002939499000318 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9394(99)00031-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, SRS 19-6 MuLV env glycoprotein was distinct from all other MuLVs (ecotropic and non-ecotropic) in the proline-rich hypervariable region. No evidence for recombination with endogenous MuLV env sequences in generation of SRS 19-6 MuLV was observed. Comparisons of long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences revealed that the GV 1.4 molecular clone of Graffi MuLV contained 96% sequence identity to SRS 19-6 MuLV's LTR with 99% identity when comparisons were restricted to the U3 regions of the two viruses. The consensus enhancer binding motifs contained in the U3 regions of the two viruses were nearly identical. Nevertheless the two viruses have previously been shown to induce distinct patterns of disease. Comparisons between 196 and Graffi GV1.4 MuLVs may provide insights into the mechanisms of disease specificity induced by MuLVs.","['Bundy, L M', 'Fan, H']","['Bundy LM', 'Fan H']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, University of California at Irvine 92697, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*classification/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virus Genes. 1999;18(1):65-79. doi: 10.1023/a:1008073419746.,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",,,['10.1023/a:1008073419746 [doi]'],,,['CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/UNKNOWN'],,,,,,,,,,,

Characterisation of the WT1 expression pattern and of the structure of the encoded protein isoforms and their mode of action has now spanned almost a decade. WT1 proteins act as nucleic acid-binding zinc finger-containing transcription factors involved in both transactivation and repression. These activities are facilitated and constrained by interactions with other proteins. Expression analyses and knockout mice indicate that WT1 protein plays a critical role in normal kidney and gonad development. Specific constitutional WT1 mutations results in several urogenital anomaly syndromes. While only 10% of sporadic Wilms' tumours do display WT1 mutation, WT1 is mutated in other cancers, including acute myeloid leukaemia. Much is still to be determined in WT1 biology. The next decade will see at least three streams of attention. The first two, elucidation of the role of WT1 in RNA metabolism and the characterisation of further protein partners, may together explain the distinct tissue-specific functions of WT1. Finally, further research into the role of WT1 in haematopoiesis will improve our understanding of WT1 in leukaemia.","['Little, M', 'Holmes, G', 'Walsh, P']","['Little M', 'Holmes G', 'Walsh P']","['Centre for Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.

In this paper, we investigated the mechanism of action of pironetins in antitumour activity and cell cycle arrest at the M-phase. As reported previously for murine leukaemia P388 cells, pironetin showed antitumour activity in a dose-dependent manner in the human leukaemia cell line HL-60. Since DNA fragmentation was observed in both P388 and HL-60 cells, the antitumour activity of pironetin is thought to be due to the induction of apoptosis. Pironetin also induced the rapid phosphorylation of Bcl-2 before formation of the DNA ladder in HL-60 cells, as seen with several tubulin binders. These results suggest that the antitumour activity of pironetin is due to apoptosis caused by the phosphorylation of Bcl-2, and that pironetin targets the microtubules. Pironetin and demethylpironetin exhibited reversible disruption of the cellular microtubule network in normal rat fibroblast 3Y1 cells. However, epoxypironetin, which contains epoxide instead of the double bond of pironetin, showed only weak activity. Since the concentrations that inhibit cell cycle progression at the M-phase were the same as those for disruption of the microtubule network, it was suggested that the mitotic arrest induced by pironetin was the result of the loss of the mitotic spindle. These compounds also inhibited the microtubule-associated protein-induced and glutamate-induced tubulin assembly in vitro. Pironetin inhibited the binding of [3H]vinblastine, but not that of [3H]colchicine, to tubulin, and the Kd values revealed that the affinity of pironetin for tubulin is stronger than that of vinblastine. These results suggest that pironetins are novel antitumour agents which inhibit microtubule assembly.","['Kondoh, M', 'Usui, T', 'Nishikiori, T', 'Mayumi, T', 'Osada, H']","['Kondoh M', 'Usui T', 'Nishikiori T', 'Mayumi T', 'Osada H']","['Antibiotics Laboratory, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), Hirosawa 2-1, Wako-shi, Saitama, 351-0198, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microtubules/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrones/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1999 Jun 1;340 ( Pt 2):411-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrones)', '151519-02-7 (pironetin)']",,,,PMC1220265,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although FLAP plays an important role in 5-LOX activity, this protein is found at high levels in some cells lacking LOX, suggesting it might mediate other effects. Furthermore, the concentration of MK886, a FLAP inhibitor, required to induce apoptosis is approximately 100-fold more than that required to inhibit LOX, and this compound remains effective in cells lacking LOX. The present study examines the role of FLAP in MK886-induced apoptosis. MK886 induced apoptosis in WSU cells, a human chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cell line that lacks FLAP protein and mRNA, suggesting that this agent is acting independently of FLAP. This conclusion was further supported by the fact that a more specific FLAP inhibitor, MK591, induced only minimal apoptosis in FL5.12 cells, a murine prolymphoid cell line containing FLAP. The role of FLAP was examined more directly by decreasing its expression by more than 50% in FL5.12 cells treated with 10 microM of an antisense oligonucleotide for 48h. This change in FLAP was not accompanied by any increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, FLAP-depleted cells exhibited the same level of apoptosis 8 h after treatment with 10 microM MK886, as did control cells. The increased fluorescence seen in MK886-treated cells loaded with carboxydichlorofluorescein indicates that oxidative reactions are stimulated by this compound, possibly via the release of fatty acids from fatty acid-binding proteins and their subsequent oxidation.","['Datta, K', 'Biswal, S S', 'Kehrer, J P']","['Datta K', 'Biswal SS', 'Kehrer JP']","['Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712-1074, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,,"['5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1999 Jun 1;340 ( Pt 2):371-5.,"['0 (5-Lipoxygenase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (ALOX5AP protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Quinolines)', '080626SQ8C (MK-886)', '136668-42-3 (MK 0591)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,,PMC1220259,,"['ES07784/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48035/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL51005/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elements to be considered include the substantial proportion of pregnant women who remain smokers, the widespread nature of exposure to ETS during pregnancy as well as during childhood, the known toxicology of tobacco smoke, and in particular sidestream smoke, characterized by a rich carcinogen content, the specific metabolism of foetuses and new-borns and finally the amount of epidemiologic data already available. We conducted a thorough review of the literature to identify studies either exclusively dealing with the effects of passive smoking on the occurrence of childhood cancers or more generally etiologic studies of cancer, be it overall or site-specific. We identified close to 50 publications presenting pertinent results from epidemiological investigations and about 50 more on mechanisms and metabolism, smoking in pregnancy and exposure to ETS as well as selected reviews and commentaries. Collaborative epidemiological studies were conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), USA, Sweden, Netherlands and internationally (France, Italy). In addition, other studies were also available from the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Italy, Denmark and People's Republic of China. The vast majority were case-control studies dealing with all cancers, leukaemia and lymphomas, central nervous system (CNS) tumours, Wilms' tumour, retinoblastoma, neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, bone and soft tissues tumours, germ cell tumours, as well as specific histological types of leukaemias, lymphomas or CNS tumours. No strong association between maternal smoking in pregnancy and/or exposure to ETS and childhood cancer is found. Yet, several studies found slightly increased relative risks, generally smaller than 1.5, i.e. the order of magnitude associated with some recognized hazards of exposure to ETS (1.2 to 1.3 for adult lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases). Tumours most often found associated with maternal smoking in pregnancy or ETS exposure are childhood brain tumours and leukaemia-lymphoma, with risks up to two or greater in selected studies. In a few studies, risks associated with paternal smoking are higher than the maternal ones. This evidence from human studies coupled with demonstration of genotoxic effects on the foetus of exposure to metabolites of tobacco smoke, and demonstrable presence of adducts should lead to strong recommendations aiming at fully protecting foetuses, new-borns and infants from tobacco smoke.","['Sasco, A J', 'Vainio, H']","['Sasco AJ', 'Vainio H']","['Unit of Epidemiology for Cancer Prevention, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Hum Exp Toxicol,Human & experimental toxicology,9004560,IM,,"['Brain Neoplasms/etiology', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Male', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*adverse effects']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Exp Toxicol. 1999 Apr;18(4):192-201. doi: 10.1191/096032799678839905.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)']",,,['10.1191/096032799678839905 [doi]'],,,,115,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relationship between the features of the lipid-DNA complexes ('lipoplexes') and their mode of interaction with cells, the efficiency of gene transfer and gene expression remain to be clarified. To gain insights into these aspects, the size and zeta potential of cationic liposomes (composed of 1,2-dioleoyl-3- (trimethylammonium) propane (DOTAP) and its mixture with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)), and their complexes with DNA at different (+/-) charge ratios were determined. A lipid mixing assay was used to assess the interaction of liposomes and lipoplexes with monocytic leukaemia cells. The use of inhibitors of endocytosis indicated that fusion of the cationic liposomes with cells occurred mainly at the plasma membrane level. However, very limited transfection of these cells was achieved using the above complexes. It is possible that the topology of the cationic liposome-DNA complexes does not allow the entry of DNA into cells through a fusion process at the plasma membrane. In an attempt to enhance transfection mediated by lipoplexes composed of DOTAP and its equimolar mixture with dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) two different strategies were explored: (i) association of a targeting ligand (transferrin) to the complexes to promote their internalization, presumably by receptor-mediated endocytosis; and (ii) association of synthetic fusogenic peptides (GALA or the influenza haemagglutinin N-terminal peptide HA-2) to the complexes to promote endosomal destabilization and release of the genetic material into the cytoplasm. These strategies were effective in enhancing transfection in a large variety of cells, including epithelial and lymphoid cell lines, as well as human macrophages, especially with the use of optimized lipid/DNA (+/-) charge ratios. Besides leading to high levels of transfection, the ternary complexes of cationic liposomes, DNA, and protein or peptide, have the advantages of being active in the presence of serum and being non-toxic. Moreover, such ternary complexes present a net negative charge and, thus, are likely to alleviate the problems associated with the use of highly positively charged complexes in vivo, such as avid complexation with serum proteins. Overall, the results indicate that these complexes, and their future derivatives, may constitute viable alternatives to viral vectors for gene delivery in vivo.","['de Lima, M C', 'Simoes, S', 'Pires, P', 'Gaspar, R', 'Slepushkin, V', 'Duzgunes, N']","['de Lima MC', 'Simoes S', 'Pires P', 'Gaspar R', 'Slepushkin V', 'Duzgunes N']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, University of Coimbra, Portugal.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Mol Membr Biol,Molecular membrane biology,9430797,IM,,"['Cations/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endocytosis/physiology', 'Endosomes/metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Liposomes/*administration & dosage', 'Peptides/metabolism', '*Transfection', 'Transferrin/metabolism']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Membr Biol. 1999 Jan-Mar;16(1):103-9. doi: 10.1080/096876899294823.,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Transferrin)']",,,['10.1080/096876899294823 [doi]'],,,['AI 35231/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had been diagnosed as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and treated until 4 month before his death with complete remission. The patient suddenly died 9 days after he complained of occipital headache. Autopsy and histopathologic findings were as follows: the left pleura was thick and calcificated with abscess, compatible with the findings of old tuberculosis complicated with bacterial infection. Furthermore, polynuclear leukocytes and gram-positive micro-organisms were accumulated in the lungs, and pyogenic meningitis, pyonephritis, splenitis were also found. Bacteologically, Streptococcus pneumoniae was detected from cadaver's blood and cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore, we concluded that the patient was died of septic shock caused by systemic infection of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The mortality of septic shock is high and in some patients, causative organisms may not be isolated. In the present case, although the original inflammation was left pleuritis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae, correct clinical diagnosis was not made before death as the patient had lacked any complaints except for occipital headache. This case revealed that the cause of sudden death was sepsis induced by Streptococcus pneumoniae instead of a relapse of APL.

We have localized a 317 base pair cis-acting regulatory element, HS I, associated with a hematopoietic-specific DNase I hypersensitive site, which lies approx. 3.7 kilobases upstream of the murine hematopoietic-specific GATA-1 IE promoter. HS I directs high-level expression of reporter GATA-1/lacZ genes to primitive and definitive erythroid cells and megakaryocytes in transgenic mice. Comparative sequence analysis of HS I between human and mouse shows approx. 63% nucleotide identity with a more conserved core of 169 base pairs (86% identity). This core contains a GATA site separated by 10 base pairs from an E-box motif. The composite motif binds a multi-protein hematopoietic-specific transcription factor complex which includes GATA-1, SCL/tal-1, E2A, Lmo2 and Ldb-1. Point mutations of the GATA site abolishes HS I function, whereas mutation of the E-box motif still allows reporter gene expression in both lineages. Strict dependence of HS I activity on a GATA site implies that assembly of a protein complex containing a GATA-factor, presumably GATA-1 or GATA-2, is critical to activating or maintaining its function. Further dissection of the 317 base pair region demonstrates that, whereas all 317 base pairs are required for expression in megakaryocytes, only the 5' 62 base pairs are needed for erythroid-specific reporter expression. These findings demonstrate differential lineage requirements for expression within the HS I element.","['Vyas, P', 'McDevitt, M A', 'Cantor, A B', 'Katz, S G', 'Fujiwara, Y', 'Orkin, S H']","['Vyas P', 'McDevitt MA', 'Cantor AB', 'Katz SG', 'Fujiwara Y', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'TCF Transcription Factors', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1999 Jun;126(12):2799-811.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LDB1 protein, human)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Ldb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L1 protein, human)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tcf7l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",,,,,,"['MC_U137961146/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'K08-T32HL07623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['GENBANK/X59708'],,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: X-irradiated Molt-4 cells and cell extract (CE) were used to analyse: (1) induced apoptosis (Giemsa stain), (2) p53, Bcl-2 and Bax expressions (immunoblot), (3) mitochondrial potential deltapsi(m) and (4) [Ca2+]i (flow cytometry), (5) caspase-3 activity, and (6) roles of [Ca2+]- and caspase-3-mediated pathways by inhibiting either or both pathways for induced apoptosis. RESULTS: Molt-4 cells were sensitive to apoptosis since 5 Gy induced 57 and 94% apoptosis at 6 and 24 h. After 5Gy, p53 was accumulated that upregulated Bax but which repressed Bcl-2 with time, resulting in a 7-fold increase in Bax/Bxl-2 at 6 h. Predominant Bax reduced deltapsi(m), and low-deltapsi(m) cells increased 45 min earlier than apoptosis after 5 Gy. Caspase-3 was activated in apoptotic CE. The caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO inhibited apoptosis and DNA-ladder formation by approximately 50%, suggesting a approximately 50% role of caspase-3-activated DNase (CAD). [Ca2+]i was increased after 5 Gy. [Ca2+]i-chelating BAPTA-AM (5 microM) and/or DNase gamma-inhibiting Zn2+ (0.5 mM) inhibited approximately 50% of induced apoptosis and DNA-laddering, indicating a 50% participation of Ca2+/Mg2+-dependent DNase gamma.

These proteins have been identified as the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and a novel guanine nucleotide binding protein (BARS-50), respectively. The role of ADP-ribosylation in mediating the effects of BFA on the structure and function of the Golgi complex was analyzed by several approaches including the use of selective pharmacological blockers of the reaction and the use of ADP-ribosylated cytosol and/or enriched preparations of the BFA-induced ADP-ribosylation substrates, GAPDH and BARS-50. A series of blockers of the BFA-dependent ADP-ribosylation reaction identified in our laboratory inhibited the effects of BFA on Golgi morphology and, with similar potency, the ADP-ribosylation of BARS-50 and GAPDH. In permeabilized RBL cells, the BFA-dependent disassembly of the Golgi complex required NAD+ and cytosol. Cytosol that had been previously ADP-ribosylated (namely, it contained ADP-ribosylated GAPDH and BARS-50), was instead sufficient to sustain the Golgi disassembly induced by BFA. Taken together, these results indicate that an ADP-ribosylation reaction is part of the mechanism of action of BFA and it might intervene in the control of the structure and function of the Golgi complex.","['Silletta, M G', 'Colanzi, A', 'Weigert, R', 'Di Girolamo, M', 'Santone, I', 'Fiucci, G', 'Mironov, A', 'De Matteis, M A', 'Luini, A', 'Corda, D']","['Silletta MG', 'Colanzi A', 'Weigert R', 'Di Girolamo M', 'Santone I', 'Fiucci G', 'Mironov A', 'De Matteis MA', 'Luini A', 'Corda D']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Consorzio Mario Negri Sud, Department of Cell Biology and Oncology, Santa Maria Imbaro (Chieti), Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Brefeldin A/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*physiology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/pharmacology', 'Golgi Apparatus/physiology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'NAD/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/20 00:00,1999/05/20 00:01,['1999/05/20 00:00'],"['1999/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1999 Mar;193(1-2):43-51.,"['0 (Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '130349-12-1 (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (304-313))', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This method is based on the analysis of FCM derived list-mode-datasets with a new software called ""Continuous Gating"". The program is able to decrease the detection level of aneuploid tumor cells by analyzing groups of cells with comparable antigen density and scatter properties. METHODS: Aneuploid acute lymphocytic leukemia cells with a known CD34 expression were diluted with diploid bone marrow cells to a concentration of 10, 1, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01%. Each sample was measured in a FACScan flow cytometer, after staining with CD34 Moab and propidium iodide. Listmode-data were analyzed with the new ""Windows""-based ""Continuous Gating"" software. A gate was set in the DNA parameter, defining the channels in which the aneuploid G0/G1-peak of possible residual tumor-cells should be found. Ten thousand overlapping gates of size 200 x 200 channels (out of 1,023 x 1,023 channels) were set automatically by the program into the side-scatter (SSC)/CD34 dot-plot, calculating the percentage of aneuploid G0/G1-phase cells for every specific gate. RESULTS: The results are plotted in a contour-plot. In dot-plot gates with less than 20 cells, the calculation of the percentage of aneuploid cells was declared invalid and the area in the contour-plot was marked.

Many epidemiological studies have been performed. Evidence for a causal association derives almost entirely from case-control studies, whereas practically all cohort studies find no association, most notably the series of atomic bomb survivors exposed in utero. Although it is likely that in utero radiation presents a leukemogenic risk to the fetus, the magnitude of the risk remains uncertain. The causal nature of the risk of cancers other than leukemia is less convincing, and the similar relative risks (RR = 1.5) for virtually all forms of childhood cancer suggests an underlying bias. Few studies have addressed the potential risk of adult cancer after intrauterine exposure. Radiotherapy given to newborns, however, has been linked to cancers of the thyroid and breast later in life.","['Boice, J D Jr', 'Miller, R W']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Miller RW']","['International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, Maryland 20850-3127, USA. boicej@compuserve.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Teratology,Teratology,0153257,IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', '*Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Assessment']",1999/05/20 06:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1999/05/20 06:00'],"['1999/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1999/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Teratology. 1999 Apr;59(4):227-33. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199904)59:4<227::AID-TERA7>3.0.CO;2-E.,,,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199904)59:4<227::AID-TERA7>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199904)59:4<227::AID-TERA7>3.0.CO;2-E [doi]']",,,,60,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a 75-year-old male patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) of recent onset (3 months' history) associated with a massive leukemic spread of immature tryptase+ MC (tentative term: myelomastocytic leukemia). The patient presented with pancytopenia, bleeding, hypofibrinogenemia, and an increased cellular tryptase level. Moreover, an excessive elevation of plasmin-antiplasmin complexes (9,200 ng/ml; normal range: 10-150), an elevated D-dimer, and an increase in thrombin-antithrombin III complexes were found. The identity of the circulating MC was confirmed by immunophenotyping (CD117/c-kit+, CD123/IL-3R alpha-, CD11b/C3biR-), biochemical analysis (cellular ratio [ng:ng] of tryptase to histamine >1), and electron microscopy. Bone marrow (bm) examination showed trilineage dysplasia (17% blasts), 30% diffusely scattered MC, and a complex karyotype. No dense, compact MC infiltrates (mastocytosis) were detectable in bm sections. Despite hyperfibrinolysis and mediator syndrome (flushing, headache), the patient received remission induction polychemotherapy (DAV) followed by two cycles of consolidation with intermediate dose ARA-C (2 x 1 g/m2/day on days 1, 3, and 5). He entered complete remission after the first chemotherapy cycle without evidence of recurring MDS. Moreover, in response to chemotherapy, the hyperfibrinolysis and mediator syndrome resolved, and the circulating c-kit+ MC disappeared.

RTF has been reported to down-regulate cell-mediated immune responses. To examine the potential role of tumor-derived RTF to suppressing antitumor responses, we analyzed a panel of seven B cell tumor lines for the membrane RTF using a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated monoclonal antibody, which reacts with membrane RTF. All the B cell tumor lines we examined express RTF on the cell surface. We also tested conditioned media from these B cell lines for their ability to suppress IL-2R expression on activated cells. Conditioned media from each B cell line suppressed IL-2R expression on activated Jurkat T cells and activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. A monoclonal antibody to the biologically active portion of RTF reversed this suppressive activity. Finally, the tumor cell population from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was found to express cell surface RTF.

We show that it was rapidly induced in the acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line NB4 during granulocytic differentiation after exposure to retinoic acid (RA). Our data suggest that induction of C/EBPepsilon expression was through the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) pathway. Reporter gene studies showed that C/EBPepsilon promoter/enhancer activity increased in a retinoid-dependent fashion via the retinoic acid response element (RARE) present in the promoter region of C/EBPepsilon. The RA-induced expression of C/EBPepsilon markedly increased in U937 myelomonoblasts that were induced to express promyelocytic leukemia/RARalpha (PML/RARalpha), but not in those induced to express promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger/RARalpha (PLZF/RARalpha). In retinoid-resistant APL cell lines, C/EBPepsilon either is not induced or is induced only at very high concentrations of RA (>/=10(-6) M). In addition, forced expression of C/EBPepsilon in the U937 myelomonoblastic leukemia cells mimicked terminal granulocytic differentiation, including morphologic changes, increased CD11b/CD66b expression, and induction of secondary granule protein expression. Our data strongly suggest that C/EBPepsilon is a downstream target gene responsible for RA-induced granulocytic differentiation of APL cells.","['Park, D J', 'Chumakov, A M', 'Vuong, P T', 'Chih, D Y', 'Gombart, A F', 'Miller, W H Jr', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Park DJ', 'Chumakov AM', 'Vuong PT', 'Chih DY', 'Gombart AF', 'Miller WH Jr', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA. parkd@ucla.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoids/*therapeutic use', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",1999/05/20 06:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1999/05/20 06:00'],"['1999/05/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1999/05/20 06:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1999 May 15;103(10):1399-408. doi: 10.1172/JCI2887.,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,['J Clin Invest. 1999 May 15;103(10):1367-8.

The biochemical characterization of the encoded products has helped to elucidate important regulatory pathways involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation, or control of cell death, and has helped to define how alterations in these pathways contribute to leukemogenesis. In addition, these efforts have led to the development of molecular-based assays for the identification of the specific molecular lesions. Clinical application of these assays has rapidly led to the realization that molecular lesions can identify distinct patient subgroups with predictable clinical features and responses to therapy.

The mechanism by which these events are regulated has not yet been determined. Using HB60, a newly established erythroblastic cell line, we show here that Epo-induced terminal erythroid differentiation is associated with a transient downregulation in the expression of the Ets-related transcription factor Fli-1. Constitutive expression of Fli-1 in HB60 cells, similar to retroviral insertional activation of Fli-1 observed in Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV)-induced erythroleukemia, blocks Epo-induced differentiation while promoting Epo-induced proliferation. These results suggest that Fli-1 modulates the response of erythroid cells to Epo. To understand the mechanism by which Fli-1 regulates erythropoiesis, we searched for downstream target genes whose expression is regulated by this transcription factor. Here we show that the retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, which was previously shown to be involved in the development of mature erythrocytes, contains a Fli-1 consensus binding site within its promoter. Fli-1 binds to this cryptic Ets consensus site within the Rb promoter and transcriptionally represses Rb expression. Both the expression level and the phosphorylation status of Rb are consistent with the response of HB60 cells to Epo-induced terminal differentiation. We suggest that the negative regulation of Rb by Fli-1 could be one of the critical determinants in erythroid progenitor cell differentiation that is specifically deregulated during F-MuLV-induced erythroleukemia.","['Tamir, A', 'Howard, J', 'Higgins, R R', 'Li, Y J', 'Berger, L', 'Zacksenhaus, E', 'Reis, M', 'Ben-David, Y']","['Tamir A', 'Howard J', 'Higgins RR', 'Li YJ', 'Berger L', 'Zacksenhaus E', 'Reis M', 'Ben-David Y']","[""Department of Medical Biophysics, Cancer Biology Research, Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Science Centre, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M4N 3M5, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/*genetics', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jun;19(6):4452-64. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.6.4452.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.6.4452 [doi]'],PMC104404,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLF undergoes fusions with the E2A gene, resulting in chimeric E2a-Hlf proteins containing the E2a transactivation domains and the Hlf bZIP DNA binding and dimerization motifs. To investigate the in vivo role of this chimeric bZIP protein in oncogenic transformation, its expression was directed to the lymphoid compartments of transgenic mice. Within the thymus, E2a-Hlf induced profound hypoplasia, premature involution, and progressive accumulation of a T-lineage precursor population arrested at an early stage of maturation. In the spleen, mature T cells were present but in reduced numbers, and they lacked expression of the transgene, suggesting further that E2a-Hlf expression was incompatible with T-cell differentiation. In contrast, mature splenic B cells expressed E2a-Hlf but at lower levels and without apparent adverse or beneficial effects on their survival. Approximately 60% of E2A-HLF mice developed lymphoid malignancies with a mean latency of 10 months. Tumors were monoclonal, consistent with a requirement for secondary genetic events, and displayed phenotypes of either mid-thymocytes or, rarely, B-cell progenitors. We conclude that E2a-Hlf disrupts the differentiation of T-lymphoid progenitors in vivo, leading to profound postnatal thymic depletion and rendering B- and T-cell progenitors susceptible to malignant transformation.","['Smith, K S', 'Rhee, J W', 'Naumovski, L', 'Cleary, M L']","['Smith KS', 'Rhee JW', 'Naumovski L', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'Survival', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jun;19(6):4443-51. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.6.4443.,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.6.4443 [doi]'],PMC104403,,"['T32 CA009302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI07290/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA042971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA066284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09302/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the nuclear body is a target of autoantibodies in patients with the autoimmune disease primary biliary cirrhosis. Although the precise function of the nuclear body in normal cellular biology is unknown, this structure may have a role in the regulation of gene transcription. In a previous investigation, we identified a leukocyte-specific, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-inducible autoantigen designated Sp140. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the cellular location of Sp140 with respect to the nuclear-body components PML and Sp100 and to examine the potential role of Sp140 in the regulation of gene transcription. We used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to express Sp140 in human cells and observed that the protein colocalized with PML and Sp100 in resting cells and associated with structures containing PML during mitosis. In cells infected with the adenovirus expressing Sp140 and incubated with IFN-gamma, the number of PML-Sp100 nuclear bodies per cell increased but immunoreactive Sp140 was not evenly distributed among the nuclear bodies. Sp140 associated with a subset of IFN-gamma-induced PML-Sp100 nuclear bodies. To examine the potential effect of Sp140 on gene transcription, a plasmid encoding Sp140 fused to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4 was cotransfected into COS cells with a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene containing five GAL4-binding sites and a simian virus 40 enhancer region. The GAL4-Sp140 fusion protein increased the expression of the reporter gene. In contrast, Sp100 fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain inhibited CAT activity in transfected mammalian cells. The results of this study demonstrate that Sp140 associates with a subset of PML-Sp100 nuclear bodies in IFN-gamma-treated cells and that Sp140 may activate gene transcription. Taken together, these observations suggest that the nuclear bodies within a cell may be heterogeneous with respect to both composition and function.","['Bloch, D B', 'Chiche, J D', 'Orth, D', 'de la Monte, S M', 'Rosenzweig, A', 'Bloch, K D']","['Bloch DB', 'Chiche JD', 'Orth D', 'de la Monte SM', 'Rosenzweig A', 'Bloch KD']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts. bloch@helix.mgh.harvard']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,,"['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Autoantigens/metabolism/physiology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry/*physiology', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1999 Jun;19(6):4423-30. doi: 10.1128/MCB.19.6.4423.,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (SP140 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '135844-47-2 (Sp100 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,['10.1128/MCB.19.6.4423 [doi]'],PMC104401,,"['R01 HL059521/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AR-01866/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-051179/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-54202/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current practice and new perspectives.,431-6,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Progress and changes in the management of blood diseases, in surgery and in video technology stimulate a critical reappraisal of splenectomy in hematology. DESIGN AND METHODS: We have collected information on the current practice of splenectomy in hematology in Italy and we have reviewed the results of a new technique of laparoscopic splenectomy (LS). RESULTS: Current splenectomy practice: the current practice in Italy is to offer splenectomy as front-line treatment for hereditary spherocytosis and as second-line for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and hemolytic anemia. Splenectomy is also offered in selected cases of leukemia and lymphoma but is going out of practice for hairy cell leukemia and Hodgkin's disease. The number of splenectomies that are performed every year is estimated to be higher than 10x10(6) persons (more than 500 cases per year). Laparoscopic splenectomy (LS): more than 700 cases of LS have been reported so far, for thrombocytopenia (470 cases) as well as for many other hematologic indications. The procedure carries a mortality of 0.8%, and a complication rate of 12%. Time spent in the operating theater ranges from 1.5 to 4 hours, blood transfusion requirement is minimal and the mean post-operative hospital stay is 3 days. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although a prospective comparison is not available, the results of LS compare favorably with the results of classic open splenectomy, so that LS is likely to become the technique of choice especially when the spleen is small, as in ITP. LS can also have some advantages in other cases of splenectomy, including splenomegaly for leukemia and lymphoma. These data and suggestions should stimulate and renew a discussion about splenectomy in hematology, with the purpose of establishing evidence-based guidelines.","['Baccarani, U', 'Terrosu, G', 'Donini, A', 'Zaja, F', 'Bresadola, F', 'Baccarani, M']","['Baccarani U', 'Terrosu G', 'Donini A', 'Zaja F', 'Bresadola F', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Surgery, Udine University Hospital, 33100 Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Hematologic Diseases/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Italy', '*Laparoscopy', 'Splenectomy/*methods']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 May;84(5):431-6.,,,,,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the expression of CD36 in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) by multiparameter flow cytometry; results were correlated with clinical features. DESIGN AND METHODS: CD36 expression was evaluated on peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from 24 patients affected by CD5+ B-CLL. Mononuclear cells were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation, were labeled with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies under standard experimental conditions and were analyzed by flow cytometry. CD36 expression was quantified both in terms of frequency of CD19+CD36+ cells and of mean fluorescence intensity (MFI-R) of CD36+ cell populations. The intensity of CD36 expression was arbitrarily classified as weak (MFI-R ranging from 3 to 6; score 0), moderate (MFI-R ranging from 6 to 9; score 1), intermediate (MFI-R ranging from 9 to 11; score 2) or strong (MFI-R ranging from 11 to 17; score 3). RESULTS: CD36 could be detected on 3% (range 2-5) of normal CD19+ B-lymphocytes and on 45% (range 30-75) of neoplastic CD19+ B-cells. When CLL patients were stratified according to CD36 staining intensity, higher hemoglobin levels (Hb) were recorded in patients assigned to score 0 (Hb = 14.3 g/dL; range 13.9-15.1) compared to patients scoring 1-2 (Hb = 11.2; range 10.3-12.2) or 3 (Hb = 9.8; range 9.6-11.6; p=0.0053). Similarly, higher platelet counts (Plt) were found in patients scoring 0 (Plt = 282x10(3)/microL; range 244-319), compared to patients with intermediate (Plt = 175x10(3)/microL; range 144-238) and high scores (Plt = 149x10(3)/microL; range 103-230; p=0.044); lymphocyte count (Ly) was significantly higher in patients assigned to score 3-4 (Ly = 23.3x10(3)/microL, range 13-30) compared to score 0-2 (Ly = 9.8x10(3)/microL, range 8.5-10.8; p=0.045). CLL patients expressing CD36 at intermediate-to-strong intensity (MFI-R = 14, range 9-16) were more frequently assigned to Rai stages III-IV than stages I-II (CD36 MFI-R = 9, range 6.5-11; p=0.005) and stage 0 (CD36 MFI-R = 6, range 4-7.3; p<0.001). Interestingly, bone marrow diffuse histology was strongly associated with higher CD36 expression (MFI-R = 8.7; range 4.7-13.9) compared to non-diffuse patterns of bone marrow infiltration (MFI-R = 6.7; range 5.2-9.3; p=0.0019). In multivariate regression analysis, CD36 staining intensity significantly and independently correlated with diffuse BM histology (p=0.033). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The present report provides the first evidence of CD36 expression on CD19+ B-cells from CLL; the correlations with clinical parameters strongly support the view that CD36 might favor tumor cell spreading. Whether high CD36 expression levels on CLL CD19+ B-cells identify an aggressive disease subset remains to be further confirmed in larger series of patients.","['Rutella, S', 'Rumi, C', 'Puggioni, P', 'Barberi, T', 'Di Mario, A', 'Larocca, L M', 'Leone, G']","['Rutella S', 'Rumi C', 'Puggioni P', 'Barberi T', 'Di Mario A', 'Larocca LM', 'Leone G']","['Department of Hematology, Center for the Flow Cytometric Study of Blood Cells, Catholic University, largo A.

We investigated, by quantitative flow cytometry, the expression of CD79b, CD5 and CD19 in cells from a variety of B-cell disorders to see whether this analysis adds further information useful to the diagnosis and characterization of these diseases. DESIGN AND METHODS: Peripheral blood cells from 6 normal individuals were used as reference controls. The diseases of the 63 patients investigated comprised: 29 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), six of them with atypical morphology, 6 B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), 12 splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) and 16 mantle-cell (Mc) lymphoma in leukemic phase. The study was carried out by triple immunostaining with directly conjugated monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against CD79b, CD5 and CD19 and quantitative estimation of the antigens per cell assessed with standard microbeads (Quantum Simply Cellular). RESULTS: Compared to normal B-cells, the number of CD19 molecules was significantly lower in cells from all of the B-cell disorders except PLL. The intensity of CD5 in leukemic B-cells was significantly higher in CLL cells, including atypical cases, and Mc lymphoma than in normal B-cells, whilst PLL and SLVL had values similar to those of normal B-lymphocytes. CD79b was expressed at lower levels in all types of leukemic cells compared to normal B-lymphocytes but differences were statistically significant in CLL, Mc lymphoma and SLVL. The number of CD79b molecules per cell was significantly lower in typical CLL than in the remaining B-cell diseases whilst the comparison of CD5 and CD19 intensity between CLL and non-CLL samples failed to show any statistically significant difference. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Distinct antigen density patterns for the various conditions emerged from this analysis: Typical CLL was characterized by moderate CD5 and weak or negative CD79b expression. Mc lymphoma showed an homogeneous pattern, characterized by similar expression of CD5 than CLL but significantly stronger expression of CD79b whilst PLL and SLVL had weak CD5 and moderate CD79b expression. Atypical CLL had an intermediate pattern of CD79b antigen expression ranging from weak to moderate with bright CD5. Unlike CD5 and CD79b, CD19 did not discriminate the various B-cell disorders but only between normal and leukemic cells.","['Cabezudo, E', 'Carrara, P', 'Morilla, R', 'Matutes, E']","['Cabezudo E', 'Carrara P', 'Morilla R', 'Matutes E']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, CD19/*blood', 'CD5 Antigens/*blood', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 May;84(5):413-8.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the existence of both false positives and negatives highlights the need for more objective methods of screening AML cases and further molecular confirmation of the t(15;17) translocation. DESIGN AND METHODS: In the present study we analyzed a total of 111 AML cases in order to investigate whether immunophenotyping based on the assessment of multiple-stainings analyzed at flow cytometry could improve the sensitivity and specificity of morphologic identification of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) carrying the t(15;17) translocation. FISH analysis was used as a complementary technique for cases in which morphology and molecular biology yielded discrepant results. RESULTS: Concordant results between morphology and RT-PCR were found in 102/111 (91.8%) cases: 34 patients had M3/PML-RARalpha+ and 68 non-M3/PML-RARalpha- disease. Nine cases showed discrepants results. Multivariate analysis showed that the best combination of immunologic markers for discriminating between M3/PML-RARalpha+ and non-M3/PML-RARalpha- cases was that of the presence of heterogeneous expression of CD13, the existence of a single major blast cell population, and a characteristic CD34/CD15 phenotypic pattern (p<0.02). A score system based on these parameters was designed, and the 34 M3/PML-RARalpha+ cases showed a score of 3 (presence of the 3 phenotypic characteristics). In contrast, only 1 out of the 68 (1.3%) non-M3/PML-RARalpha- cases had this score, most o these latter cases (53/68, 78%) scoring either 0 or 1. Therefore, among these cases, immunophenotyping showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99% for predicting PML/RARalpha gene rearrangements. Of the 9 cases in which morphology and molecular biology results were discrepant, four cases displayed M3 morphology without PML/RARalpha rearrangements by RT-PCR. In only one of these 4 cases did the immunophenotype score 3, this being the only FISH positive case. From the remaining five discrepant cases (non-M3 morphology while positive for PML/RARalpha) two cases had a phenotypic score of 3 and were FISH positive while the other three were negative by FISH. Upon repeating RT-PCR studies, two of these latter three cases became negative. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that immunophenotyping may be of great value for quick screening of APL with PML/RARalpha rearrangements.","['Orfao, A', 'Chillon, M C', 'Bortoluci, A M', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Garcia-Sanz, R', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Tabernero, M D', 'Garcia-Marcos, M A', 'Rasillo, A I', 'Hernandez-Rivas, J', 'San Miguel, J F']","['Orfao A', 'Chillon MC', 'Bortoluci AM', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Garcia-Sanz R', 'Gonzalez M', 'Tabernero MD', 'Garcia-Marcos MA', 'Rasillo AI', 'Hernandez-Rivas J', 'San Miguel JF']","['Servicio General de Citometria, Hospital Universitario Salamanca, Paseo de San Vicente, 58-182, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. orfao@gugu.usal.es']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'CD13 Antigens/blood', 'Child', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1999 May;84(5):405-12.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether autologous graft-versus-host disease could be induced in recipients of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and whether tacrolimus induced the disease instead of cyclosporine. METHODS: Twelve patients with acute leukemia and 5 patients with malignant lymphoma received either cyclosporine (1 mg/kg/day) or tacrolimus (0. 05 mg/kg/day) orally after autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Autologous graft-versus-host disease of the skin, confirmed by histopathologic criteria, occurred in 40% of the patients at 8 to 25 days after transplantation and lasted 3 to 15 days. The frequency of autologous graft-versus-host disease was approximately the same (40%) irrespective of the source of the graft (bone marrow cells or peripheral blood stem cells) and the drug used for induction (cyclosporine or tacrolimus).

Previous studies with deletion mutants have shown that the membrane-proximal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is sufficient for mitogenic signaling, whereas the membrane-distal domain is required for differentiation signaling. However, the function of the four cytoplasmic tyrosines of the G-CSF-R in the control of proliferation, differentiation, and survival has remained unclear. Here we investigated the role of these tyrosines by expressing a tyrosine ""null"" mutant and single tyrosine ""add back"" mutants in maturation-competent myeloid 32D cells. Clones expressing the null mutant showed only minimal proliferation and differentiation, with survival also reduced at low G-CSF concentrations. Analysis of clones expressing the add-back mutants revealed that multiple tyrosines contribute to proliferation, differentiation, and survival signals from the G-CSF-R.

A specific pseudoknot located eight nucleotides 3' of the UAG is required for this redefinition of the UAG stop codon. The structural probing and mutagenic analyses presented here provide evidence that loop I of the pseudoknot is one nucleotide, stem II has seven base-pairs, and the nucleotides 3' of stem II are important for function.

We have used these viruses to efficiently mark and follow the developmental progression of a large population of cells in rat neocortex and whole avian embryos. In the chick embryo, the migration and development of GFP-marked neural crest cells were monitored using time-lapse videomicroscopy. In the neocortex, GFP clearly delineates the morphology of a variety of neuronal and glial phenotypes. Cells expressing GFP display normal dendritic morphologies, and infected cells persist into adulthood. Cortical neurons appear to form normal local axonal and long-distance projections, suggesting that the presence of cytoplasmic or GAP-43-tagged GFP does not significantly interfere with normal development.","['Okada, A', 'Lansford, R', 'Weimann, J M', 'Fraser, S E', 'McConnell, S K']","['Okada A', 'Lansford R', 'Weimann JM', 'Fraser SE', 'McConnell SK']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California, 94305, USA. amio@leland.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,IM,,"['Actins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Axons/ultrastructure', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cerebral Cortex/cytology/*embryology', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Dendrites/ultrastructure', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'GAP-43 Protein/genetics', '*Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Microscopy, Video', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neural Crest/*cytology', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*physiology']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 1999 Apr;156(2):394-406. doi: 10.1006/exnr.1999.7033.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (GAP-43 Protein)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,"['S0014-4886(99)97033-4 [pii]', '10.1006/exnr.1999.7033 [doi]']",,['Copyright 1999 Academic Press.'],"['EY08411/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'MH49176/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'NS12151/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were studied in the presence or absence of LIF a cytokine known to be involved in bone turnover and to act as a growth factor in some solid tumours. The direct effect of LIF on MNC was examined by a post-embedding colloidal gold immunocytochemistry process using human anti-LIF and anti-LIF-receptor (chain gp190) antibodies. After 7 days of culture, the MNC obtained displayed osteoclast immunocytochemical features. Moreover, these MNC were able to resorb large amounts of dentin and presented typical features of active osteoclasts. Immunolocalization of LIF and LIF-receptor revealed the presence of this cytokine and its receptor within the cytoplasm and nucleus of active resorbing MNC. LIF upmodulated MNC number and nucleation but decreased their ability to resorb dentin. The present study suggests that MNC obtained from human GCT, currently considered as osteoclast-like cells, are targets for LIF and may be a source of LIF production in this pathological condition.","['Gouin, F', 'Couillaud, S', 'Cottrel, M', 'Godard, A', 'Passuti, N', 'Heymann, D']","['Gouin F', 'Couillaud S', 'Cottrel M', 'Godard A', 'Passuti N', 'Heymann D']","['Faculte de Chirurgie Dentaire, Centre de Recherche Interdisciplinaire sur les Tissus Calcifies et les Biomateriaux, UPRES EA 2159, 1 Pl.

Unilamellar liposomes containing 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine, [14C]Ch, and 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-cholest-6-ene-5-hydroperoxide (5alpha-OOH) or 3beta-hydroxycholest-5-ene-7alpha-hydroperoxide (7alpha-OOH) [100:75:5, mol/mol] were used as a test system. Liposomes incubated in the presence of ascorbate and a lipophilic iron complex were analyzed for radiolabeled oxidation products/intermediates (ChOX) by means of silica gel high-performance thin layer chromatography with phosphorimaging detection. The following ChOX were detected and quantified: 7alpha-OOH, 7beta-OOH, 7alpha-OH, 7beta-OH, and 5, 6-epoxide. Total ChOX yield increased in essentially the same time- and [iron]-dependent fashion for initiating 5alpha-OOH and 7alpha-OOH. The initial rate of [14C]7alphabeta-OH formation was greatly diminished when GSH and ebselen (a selenoperoxidase mimetic) were present, consistent with the attenuation of one-electron peroxide turnover. [14C]Ch-labeled L1210 cells also accumulated ChOX when incubated with 5alpha-OOH-containing liposomes. The rate of accumulation was substantially greater for Se-deficient than Se-sufficient cells, indicating that peroxide-induced chain reactions were modulated by selenoperoxidase action.

We show here that TPA suppresses hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, while retinoids augment it. Further, an HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin (SnPP), suppresses TPA-induced K562 cell differentiation to monocytes. It was also found that co-treatment of K562 cells with SnPP and TPA induces erythroid differentiation of K562 cells, though SnPP alone or TPA alone does not induce erythroid differentiation, suggesting a role of HO in the directional switch of differentiation.","['Koiso, Y', 'Fujimoto, Y', 'Matsumura, D', 'Nakajima, O', 'Hashimoto, Y']","['Koiso Y', 'Fujimoto Y', 'Matsumura D', 'Nakajima O', 'Hashimoto Y']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Metalloporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Protoporphyrins/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 1999 Apr;22(4):439-40. doi: 10.1248/bpb.22.439.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Metalloporphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', 'DIO3JT9G2P (tin protoporphyrin IX)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['10.1248/bpb.22.439 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MBL binding was observed in 3 of 7 colon adenocarcinoma cell lines (Colo205, Colo201 and DLD-1), but not in any of 3 leukemia cell lines tested. The binding of MBL to these cell lines was sugar-specific and calcium-dependent, since it was almost completely inhibited in the presence of 10 mM EDTA or 50 mM mannose. The MBL binding to Colo205 cells was more strongly reduced by the pretreatment of the cells with an O-linked glycosylation inhibitor, benzyl-2-acetamide-2-deoxy-alpha-galactopyranoside (Bz-alpha-GalNAc), rather than an N-linked glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin. The degree of MBL binding was well correlated with the expression of Lewis A and Lewis B antigens on these cell lines. Moreover, MBL binding to Colo205 cells was inhibited by anti-Lewis A and anti-Lewis B antibodies.

We investigated the effects of As2O3 on a panel of malignant lymphocytes to determine whether growth-inhibitory and apoptotic effects of As2O3 can be observed in these cells at clinically achievable concentrations. METHODS: Eight malignant lymphocytic cell lines and primary cultures of lymphocytic leukemia and lymphoma cells were treated with As2O3, with or without dithiothreitol (DTT) or buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) (an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis). Apoptosis was assessed by cell morphology, flow cytometry, annexin V protein level, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labeling of DNA fragments. Cellular proliferation was determined by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation into DNA and flow cytometry and by use of a mitotic arrest assay. Mitochondrial transmembrane potential (delta psi(m)) was measured by means of rhodamine 123 staining and flow cytometry. Protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis or immunofluorescence. RESULTS: Therapeutic concentrations of As2O3 (1-2 microM) had dual effects on malignant lymphocytes: 1) inhibition of growth through adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion and prolongation of cell cycle time and 2) induction of apoptosis. As2O3-induced apoptosis was preceded by delta psi(m) collapse. DTT antagonized and BSO enhanced As2O3-induced ATP depletion, delta psi(m) collapse, and apoptosis. Caspase-3 activation, usually resulting from delta psi(m) collapse, was not always associated with As2O3-induced apoptosis. As2O3 induced PML (promyelocytic leukemia) protein degradation but did not modulate expression of cell cycle-related proteins, including c-myc, retinoblastoma protein, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, cyclin D1, and p53, or expression of differentiation-related antigens. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial growth inhibition and apoptosis without evidence of differentiation were induced in most malignant lymphocytic cells treated with 1-2 microM As2O3. As2O3 may prove useful in the treatment of malignant lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Zhu, X H', 'Shen, Y L', 'Jing, Y K', 'Cai, X', 'Jia, P M', 'Huang, Y', 'Tang, W', 'Shi, G Y', 'Sun, Y P', 'Dai, J', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Chen, S J', 'Zhang, T D', 'Waxman, S', 'Chen, Z', 'Chen, G Q']","['Zhu XH', 'Shen YL', 'Jing YK', 'Cai X', 'Jia PM', 'Huang Y', 'Tang W', 'Shi GY', 'Sun YP', 'Dai J', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ', 'Zhang TD', 'Waxman S', 'Chen Z', 'Chen GQ']","[""Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Annexin A5/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Lymphoma/chemistry/*drug therapy', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 May 5;91(9):772-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/91.9.772.,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 1999 May 5;91(9):743-5.

The ct-DNA studies suggest that the compounds also interacted with the DNA molecule itself, probably affecting template activity.","['Hall, I H', 'Peaty, N J', 'Henry, J R', 'Easmon, J', 'Heinisch, G', 'Purstinger, G']","['Hall IH', 'Peaty NJ', 'Henry JR', 'Easmon J', 'Heinisch G', 'Purstinger G']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27559-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrazones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 1999 Apr;332(4):115-23. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1521-4184(19994)332:4<115::aid-ardp115>3.0.co;2-g.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazones)', '0 (Pyridines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1521-4184(19994)332:4<115::AID-ARDP115>3.0.CO;2-G [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1521-4184(19994)332:4<115::aid-ardp115>3.0.co;2-g [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which HOX11 facilitates this initial step of leukemogenesis is, however, not well understood. We have used a DNA binding site selection assay to investigate cooperative DNA binding by HOX11 with other transcription factors. A consensus sequence was derived and identified as the binding site for the CCAAT-box-binding transcription factors (CTF). HOX11 was shown to interact in vitro and in vivo with CTF1. Retrovirus-mediated transduction of an antisense CTF1 cDNA dramatically reduced the proliferative capacity of HOX11-immortalized hematopoietic precursor cells. CTF1 is, therefore, the first HOX11 protein partner identified that plays an important role in hematopoietic precursor cell immortalization.","['Zhang, N', 'Shen, W', 'Hawley, R G', 'Lu, M']","['Zhang N', 'Shen W', 'Hawley RG', 'Lu M']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0671, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Antisense/pharmacology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1999 Apr 1;18(13):2273-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1202545.,"['0 (CHL1 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143275-75-6 (TLX1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['10.1038/sj.onc.1202545 [doi]'],,,['DK49619/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We employ a tet-repressible system to show that, under conditions in which the WAF1 mRNA steady-state level is upregulated fourfold by p53, the SCL mRNA level is not altered. In a previous report, we demonstrated that p53 interactions with the SCL CS can upregulate downstream reporter gene activity 43-fold in transient reporter assays. This disparity prompted us to explore the differences between p53 regulation of SCL CS activity in organized (chromosomally integrated) and disorganized (non-replicating episomal plasmid) chromatin. We show that p53 can increase (between 3-80-fold), decrease (between 5-33-fold) or have no effect upon transactivation of an SCL CS/reporter fusion gene depending upon chromosomal integration site. Most studies used to characterize p53 binding sites employ transient transfection assays.

METHODS: Records of patients treated with uracil mustard between 1958 and 1970 were reviewed. A current histologic review according to the International Formulation was performed when possible. Total doses of uracil mustard were similar to those of mechlorethamine, although there were variations in the dose schedule. RESULTS: Employing criteria used over 25 years ago to evaluate patients' responses, the overall regression rate for 94 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients was 69.2% (complete response [CR] 23.4%). Of 62 patients with Hodgkin disease, 69.4% responded (CR 9.7%). For 39 patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia, the combined complete and partial response rate was 74% (CR 7.7%). Thrombocytopenia was the primary toxicity.

Trisomy 12 was the most frequent abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and was found in 27.8% (10/36) of the patients, indicating that the incidence of trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Chinese patients might not be low compared with the West as previously suggested. Structural abnormalities involving chromosomes 13 at band q14 were the next most common abnormalities in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Among the 11 patients with mantle cell lymphoma in leukemic phase, t(11;14) was seen in only 2 patients (18.2%). Several unusual cytogenetic abnormalities also were found.","['Wong, K F', 'Chan, J K']","['Wong KF', 'Chan JK']","[""Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 May;111(1):55-60. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00216-7.,,,,"['S0165460898002167 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00216-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic alterations associated with CML blast crisis have previously been extensively studied by conventional G-banding analysis. However the complexity of some chromosome abnormalities or poor chromosome morphology or both has exceeded the resolution of G-banding analysis in a significant proportion of CML cases, and complex chromosome rearrangements have remained unidentified. In this study, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was used to elucidate genome imbalances in chronic phase or blast crisis samples or both from 12 CML patients. CGH and G-banding results were compared, and discrepancies were further clarified by using multipaint chromosome analysis and locus-specific DNA probes. No imbalances were detected in the 4 early disease phase samples studied. Eleven blast crisis samples were analyzed by G-banding and CGH, and the commonest genomic abnormality detected was overrepresentation of the long arm of chromosome 8, which was detected in 5 patients. This overrepresentation was attributable to trisomy 8 in 4 patients, whereas amplification of the entire long arm of chromosome 8 was detected in 1 patient. The formation of isochromosomes of the long arm of chromosome 8 was observed as a mechanism for gene amplification in this patient. Additional material originating from chromosome 8 was also observed intercalated into three marker chromosomes in peripheral blood metaphase spreads from this patient. These markers may further define areas on chromosome 8 that harbor oncogenes implicated in transformation of chronic myeloid leukemia.","['Gribble, S M', 'Sinclair, P B', 'Grace, C', 'Green, A R', 'Nacheva, E P']","['Gribble SM', 'Sinclair PB', 'Grace C', 'Green AR', 'Nacheva EP']","['Department of Haematology, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Painting', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1999 May;111(1):7-17. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00213-1.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],,,"['S0165460898002131 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(98)00213-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper compares the polyamine transport between sensitive P388 murine lymphoma cells and two multidrug resistant P388 sublines with the assistance of an experimental model. This new model allows the characterisation of the whole polyamines uptake and efflux. Three parameters are identified by the model: two rate constants (K+ for the uptake and K- for the efflux) which are considered as physical constants specific to the transport of one polyamine in one cell type, and Ci(o) which represents the initial intracellular concentration. This model well describes our experimental results of polyamine transport across the P388 cell plasma membrane. Multidrug resistant P388 cells exhibit spermine uptake significantly higher than that of sensitive cells when on the opposite, putrescine enters more rapidly into the sensitive P388 cells. In conclusion, comparison of polyamine transport between sensitive and multidrug resistant P388 phenotypes shows large and significant differences.","['Berlaimont, V', 'Bogaerts, P', 'Dubois, J', 'Hanus, R', 'Hanocq, M']","['Berlaimont V', 'Bogaerts P', 'Dubois J', 'Hanus R', 'Hanocq M']","['Department of Bioanalytical Chemistry, Toxicology and Applied Physical Chemistry, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium. valerie.berlaimont@wanadoo.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Biophys Chem,Biophysical chemistry,0403171,IM,,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1999/05/18 00:00,1999/05/18 00:01,['1999/05/18 00:00'],"['1999/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1999/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biophys Chem. 1999 Mar 29;77(2-3):161-71. doi: 10.1016/s0301-4622(99)00020-4.,"['0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",,,"['S0301-4622(99)00020-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-4622(99)00020-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
