Insertion of a 105 bp fragment at the region corresponding to the extracellular domain of rat EpoR was found. The insert sequence, which encodes additional 21 amino acids, is similar to that previously found in the mouse EpoR gene, however, has an additional 27 bp direct repeat. Due to the presence of a stop codon in the insert, the alternative transcript is translated to a truncated and soluble form of EpoR which is preferentially expressed in liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and bone marrow cells as well as cultured erythroleukemia cells. These findings suggest that alternative splicing of the EpoR gene may play an important role in proliferation and differentiation of rat erythroid cells.","['Fujita, M', 'Takahashi, R', 'Liang, P', 'Saya, H', 'Ashoori, F', 'Tachi, M', 'Kitazawa, S', 'Maeda, S']","['Fujita M', 'Takahashi R', 'Liang P', 'Saya H', 'Ashoori F', 'Tachi M', 'Kitazawa S', 'Maeda S']","['Second Department of Pathology, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:444-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These 93 patients included 31 patients with low grade lymphoma, 55 with intermediate or high grade lymphoma and 7 with Hodgkin's disease. Median TNF alpha plasma values were 20 pg/mL (range 5-380 pg/mL) in patients versus 7 pg/mL (range 4-9 pg/mL) in healthy control subjects. Presence of TNF alpha level equal or greater than 20 pg/mL was significantly associated with elevated LDH level, serum beta 2-microglobulin level > or = 3 mg/L, hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL, Ann Arbor stage III or IV disease, and with bulky tumor. High level of TNF alpha was also associated, although less strongly, with B symptoms, poor performance status, and serum albumin < or = 35 g/L, yet it was not associated with change in acute phase protein levels. Levels of p55-sR were also markedly elevated in these lymphoma patients (median of 3.5 ng/mL, range 0.8-18.8 ng/mL) versus 1.45 ng/mL in control subjects (range 1.1-2.3 ng/mL). Level of p55-sR equal or greater than 3.5 ng/mL was significantly associated with poor performance status, B symptoms, beta 2-microglobulin levels > or = 3 mg/L, serum albumin < or = 35 g/L, C-reactive protein > 6 mg/L, hemoglobin < or = 12 g/dL, and bulky tumor. In the whole group of 93 patients, both high TNF alpha and p55-sR levels strongly predicted short freedom from progression and overall survival.

In thymocytes, the tumor suppressor p53 has been shown to be required for this type of apoptosis. However an as yet unknown, p53-independent pathway(s) appears to mediate the same event in mitogenically activated mature T lymphocytes. By using mice with a null mutation in the IRF-1 gene, we revealed that DNA damage-induced apoptosis in the latter cell type is dependent on the anti-oncogenic transcription factor interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1). Thus two different anti-oncogenic transcription factors, p53 and IRF-1, are required for distinct apoptotic pathways in T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we found that mitogen induction of the interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (Ice) gene, a mammalian homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans cell death gene ced-3, is also IRF-1-dependent. An IRF-1 binding sequence was identified in the 5' flanking region of the Ice gene. In addition, ectopic overexpression of IRF-1 results in the activation of the endogenous Ice gene and enhances the sensitivity of cells to radiation-induced apoptosis. Thus, induction of Ice gene may be involved in IRF-1 dependent DNA damage-induced apoptosis in activated mature T lymphocytes.","['Tamura, T', 'Ishihara, M', 'Lamphier, M S', 'Tanaka, N', 'Oishi, I', 'Aizawa, S', 'Matsuyama, T', 'Mak, T W', 'Taki, S', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Tamura T', 'Ishihara M', 'Lamphier MS', 'Tanaka N', 'Oishi I', 'Aizawa S', 'Matsuyama T', 'Mak TW', 'Taki S', 'Taniguchi T']","['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Irf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics/physiology', 'Caspase 1', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology/radiation effects', 'Concanavalin A', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Gamma Rays', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:439-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that Tpo is constitutively and ubiquitously expressed in all tissues examined, including bone marrow stromal cells, even in thrombocytopenia, thrombosis and steady-state condition in mice. Thus, platelet level in circulation is not regulated by Tpo gene expression. Furthermore, when the purified megakaryocytes were cocultured with the stromal cells, most of the megakaryocytes adhered to the stromal cells and remained unchanged, while free megakaryocytes induced proplatelet formation. Thus the stromal cells in bone marrow secrete Tpo and stimulate megakaryocytopoiesis, but the interaction of megakaryocytes with the stromal cells may suppress platelet formation. Study on signal transduction through Mp1 revealed that Tpo induces activation of JAK2 and Tyk2, which in turn activate STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5. Further, Tpo stimulates transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2, which induce differentiation markers, GPIIb/IIIa and Pm-1. In addition, Shc, Vav, Ras, Raf-1, MAPKK, MAPK and Pim-1 are also activated. Thus, Tpo activates a lineage-specific cascade as well as a specific JAK-STAT cascade and a common signaling cascade.","['Nagata, Y', 'Nagahisa, H', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Todokoro, K']","['Nagata Y', 'Nagahisa H', 'Nagasawa T', 'Todokoro K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Tyk2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/physiology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/cytology', 'TYK2 Kinase', 'Thrombopoietin/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:435-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initiation of the erythroleukemia is due to binding of the env-related glycoprotein gp55 encoded by F-SFFV to the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). The gp55/EPOR interaction induces prolonged and growth factor independent proliferation in a factor-dependent cell line. In erythropoietin (EPO) signaling, the JAK2/STAT5 pathway was shown to be activated downstream of the EPOR to transmit the signal to the cells. To determine members of the JAK family and the STAT transcription factor family involved in the gp55/EPOR signaling, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of JAKs and STATs in F-SFFV-infected erythroid or erythroleukemic cells. JAK1 and STAT5 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated but the DNA binding activity of STAT5 was not induced without EPO stimulation in erythroblastoid cells from spleens of F-SFFV-infected mice and erythroleukemia cell lines derived from gp55-transgenic mice.

Moreover, a comparison of Epo-induced proliferation with Epo-induced Yphos patterns, using DA-3 cells expressing WT, Null and various Y to F EpoR point mutants revealed that Stat5 Yphos and activation correlated directly with proliferation and was mediated primarily throuhg the most membrane proximal Y, i.e., Y343, although other tyrosines (most likely Y401 and Y431) within the EpoR could activate Stat5 in its absence.

The MOLT4 transfectants with the box1 mutants of the IL-2 receptor beta chain lacking Jak1 association showed IL-2 responsiveness, in terms of activations of Jak3 and Stat5 and induction of cell growth, indicating that Jak1 is dispensable for IL-2-mediated cell growth signaling, and that Jak1 activation is not required for activation of Jak3 and Stat5 in the MOLT4 transfectants.","['Higuchi, M', 'Asao, H', 'Tanaka, N', 'Oda, K', 'Takeshita, T', 'Sugamura, K']","['Higuchi M', 'Asao H', 'Tanaka N', 'Oda K', 'Takeshita T', 'Sugamura K']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Janus Kinase 3', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/chemistry/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Syk Kinase', 'Transfection', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:416-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the calorie restriction, the incidence of myeloid leukemia was significantly decreased. In addition, the latent period of the myeloid leukemia in the groups for calorie restriction was significantly extended at a greater extent as compared with the control diet groups.

The SH2 domain binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and the SH3 domain binds to protein containing proline-rich regions. However, the mechanisms of signal transduction through Grb2/Ash in hematopoietic cells are still unclear. By means of the binding experiments using the GST fusion protein including the full length Grb2/Ash, we have found that Shc and unidentified 130-kDa and 135-kDa proteins are associated with Grb2/Ash and that they are tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in a human leukemia cell line UT-7. We have purified the 130-kDa protein (pp 130) using GST-GRB2/Ash affinity column. The amino-acid sequence analysis showed that the pp130 was identical to the human c-cbl proto-oncogene product (c-Cbl). c-Cbl constitutively binds to the SH3 domain of Grb2/Ash both in vitro and in vivo but not to the SH2 domain of Grb2/Ash. Moreover, c-Cbl (pp 130) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated rapidly and transiently depending on GM-CSF and EPO stimulation. However, we could not find the homologous regions with guanine nucleotide exchange factors or GTPase-activating proteins in the c-cbl gene. These findings strongly suggest that c-Cbl is implicated in the signal transduction of GM-CSF and EPO in hematopoietic cells, and c-Cbl and Grb2/Ash might also transduce a signal that is different from the signal leading to Ras regulation. Recently, we have shown that the proto-oncogene vav product (Vav) is also tyrosine-phosphorylated by treatment with GM-CSF and EPO and is constitutively associated with the SH3 domain of Grb2/Ash in UT-7. Another guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos is also associated with Grb2/Ash in UT-7. It has been reported that Vav has guanine nucleotide exchange activity and activates Ras in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that tyrosine kinases, the adapter Grb2/Ash, and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav and Sos are members of a signaling pathway leading to Ras activation in hematopoietic cells.","['Odai, H', 'Hanazono, Y', 'Sasaki, K', 'Iwamatu, A', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Odai H', 'Hanazono Y', 'Sasaki K', 'Iwamatu A', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'ErbB Receptors/physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'src Homology Domains']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:405-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the expression of endogenous c-jun was augmented in cells expressing exogenous v-Rel, but not c-Rel. The transcriptional activities of v-Rel to the tested promoters containing the kB-site are lower than that of c-Rel, but that to the c-jun promoter was much higher than that of c-Rel. The N-terminal DNA binding domain of v-Rel, which is responsible for its high transforming activity of v-Rel was also responsible for the high transcriptional activity to the c-jun promoter. Thus, the activity of v-Rel upon the c-jun promoter correlates well with its transforming ability.

On the contrary, no mutation was observed in Ha- and Ki-ras genes in these leukemias. The consistent occurrence of the above N-ras mutation in DMBA-induced leukemias indicates that N-ras gene plays an important role in DMBA-leukemogenesis. Mutations in ras genes generally takes place during the initiation stage of carcinogenesis because they often appear in the premalignant stage of tumors. In order to detect the N-ras mutation in an early stage of leukemogenesis, we designed the mutant-allele-specific amplification (MASA) method to detect the mutation in bone marrow (BM) cells of DMBA-treated rats. The MASA method was sensitive enough to detect one mutant cell mixed in 10(6) normal cells. Using this method, the N-ras mutation was found in BM cells 2 days after single DMBA injection and thereafter throughout the preleukemic stage.

Recently it has been clarified that physiological cell death, apoptosis plays important role of hematopoiesis. So we evaluated the effects of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) on leukemic cells, especially focused on apoptosis. Intravenous inoculation of radiation-induced murine leukemia cell line, C2M-A5 into the parent C3H mice resulted in the development of myeloid leukemia. However, the leukemic death of the mice was completely suppressed by the daily subcutaneous injection of recombinant human (rh)G-CSF from the next day (Bessho M. et al., Leuk Res 1989:13:1001-1007). In the in vitro study using C2M-A5 cells, we found that apoptosis appears on the cells at 48 hours after addition of G-CSF in culture. The cells in this stage lost the leukemogenicity to C3H mice (Bessho M. et al., Leukemia 8:1185-1190:1994). To clarify the mechanism of the induction of apoptosis by G-CSF we studied cell cycle and molecular changes in C2M-A5 cells cultured in medium with or without rhG-CSF by means of using the flowcytometry and Northern and Western blot analyses. After addition of rh G-CSF to culture, C2M-A5 cells removed to S phase, next arrested at G0/G1 phase on and after 24 hours, and 48 hours later, apoptosis was observed. Overexpression of mRNAs for c-myc (3-24 hours later) and for p53 (6-24 hours later), were observed in the cell cultured in rhG-CSF administered medium with a concomitant down-expression of bcl-2 mRNA (from 6 hours later). Tyrosine-phosphorylated protein (17 kd) appeared at 48 hours after administration of rhG-CSF to cell culture. This protein was suggested for specific apoptosis induction by rhG-CSF. These results are summarized as follows. (1) rhG-CSF induced apoptosis to C2M-A5 and deprived its leukemogenicity to mice. (2) Induction of apoptosis was associated with cell cycle and correlated to the changes of the expression rates of c-myc,p53, and bcl-2. (3) Tyrosine kinase may play an important role in apoptosis induction to C2M-A5 by rhG-CSF.","['Handa, A', 'Kashimura, T', 'Kawano, N', 'Yamamoto, A', 'Yoshida, S', 'Jinnai, I', 'Murohashi, I', 'Bessho, M', 'Hirashima, K']","['Handa A', 'Kashimura T', 'Kawano N', 'Yamamoto A', 'Yoshida S', 'Jinnai I', 'Murohashi I', 'Bessho M', 'Hirashima K']","['Department of 1st Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, p53', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:387-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL effectively inhibit KCN-induced cell death which is characterized by necrotic features including apparently intact chromatin, remarkable mitochondrial swelling with loss of crista structure and loss of plasma membrane integrity. The necrotic cell death is also inhibited by inhibitors of ICE (interleukin-1 beta converting enzyme)(-like) proteases, the common mediators of apoptosis.

In the B cell line WEHI-231, sIg crosslinking induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at the late G1 phase, both of which are reversed by CD40 signaling. Crosslinking of sIg reduces the activity of cyclin dependent kinase (Cdk)2 required for cell cycle progression in the late G1 phase by induction of a Cdk inhibitor (CKI) p27Kip1, but the induction of p27Kip1 is abrogated by CD40 signaling.

A complex network of molecular interactions has been identified. In particular, a class of cell cycle inhibitory proteins has been identified but details of the molecular mechanism of their action have yet to be resolved. These inhibitors regulate the progression through G1 and the G1/S transition via the inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) activity. The potential function of these negative regulators as tumor suppressors provides new insights into the link between the cell cycle and oncogenesis. Kip1 is a potent inhibitor of Cdks. In quiescent cells Kip1 accumulates without an increase in mRNA or protein synthesis. We demonstrated that cell cycle regulation of Kip1 levels, both in normal and transformed human cells, occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In a crude in vitro system, Kip1 is ubiquitinated and degraded in an ATP dependent manner and inhibition or depletion of the proteasome blocks Kip1 degradation. Human Ubc2 and Ubc3, the homologs of yeast Rad6 and Cdc34 gene products respectively, are specifically involved in the ubiquitination of Kip1. Compared to proliferating cells, quiescent cells contain a far lower amount of Kip1 ubiquitinating activity. These results represent the first demonstration that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a role in the regulation of a cell cycle protein in human cells, namely the Cdk inhibitor Kip1. The specific proteolysis of Kip1 may be involved in the pathway of inactivation of Cdks.","['Tam, S W', 'Theodoras, A M', 'Pagano, M']","['Tam SW', 'Theodoras AM', 'Pagano M']","['Mitotix Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cdkn1b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (CDC34 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (CDC34 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (RAD6 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Fungal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Ligases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*metabolism', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:363-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phosphorylation of the cyclin D1-bound Cdk4 by Cdk4-activating kinase, composed of cyclin H and MO15 (alias Cdk7), which was reconstituted in Spodoptera frugiperda cells (Sf9) could convert inactive cyclin D1-Cdk4 complex into active form in vitro, suggesting that threonine 172 in the Cdk4, whose phosphorylation is required for its activation, was in part unphosphorylated in the contact-inhibited 3Y1. Although MO15 was active in cell extracts prepared from the contact-inhibited 3Y1, activation of bacterially produced Cdk4 in the cell extracts was inhibited. Removing p27kip1 from the cell extracts allowed MO15 holoenzyme to phosphorylate the Cdk4 and to activate it, indicating that an access of MO15 to Cdk4 was inhibited by p27kip1 in the contact-inhibited 3Y1.","['Kato, A', 'Takahashi, H', 'Takahashi, Y', 'Matsushime, H']","['Kato A', 'Takahashi H', 'Takahashi Y', 'Matsushime H']","['Department of Biology, Nippon Roche Research Institute, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Ccnh protein, rat)', '0 (Cdkn1b protein, rat)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin H)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk4 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line', '*Contact Inhibition', 'Cyclin D1', 'Cyclin H', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Spodoptera', 'Threonine', 'Transfection', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:361-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene deletions but not minute mutations should be the predominant mechanism of p16 gene inactivation in these types of tumors. The p16 gene is most frequently deleted among the p16, p15 and IFN alpha genes and thus should be the target of deletions in this locus. Deletions of the p16 gene were frequently observed in tumors carrying chromosome 9p abnormalities while a significant number of cases showed loss of the p16 gene without chromosome 9p abnormalities. So far inactivation of p53 and Rb tumor suppressors have also been found in lymphoid tumors. In our study, we detected homozygous deletions of p16 gene in 20%, loss of Rb protein in 28%, and p53 gene alterations in 8% of lymphoid tumors. Notably, 44% of lymphoid tumors showed inactivation of at least one of the three tumor suppressors, suggesting these tumor suppressors are important for lymphoid tumorigenesis.

Likewise, the gene is inactive in untransformed cells but is transcriptionally activated after transformation by v-Ki-ras oncogene, suggesting that the intact MSX-2 may play a positive, rather than suppressive, role in cell transformation. To test this possibility, we isolated a full-length human MSX-2 cDNA and tested its activities in two cell systems: fibroblast and myoblast. In NIH3T3 fibroblasts, although the gene by itself failed to confer a transformed phenotype, antisense MSX-2 cDNA as well as truncated MSX-2 cDNA interfered with the transforming activities of both v-Ki-ras and v-raf oncogene.

Mutations in p53 abrogate its ability to inhibit cell growth and to suppress tumor progression. The anti-proliferative activity of p53 can be mediated by the induction of growth arrest and/or programmed cell death (apoptosis). Recent in vivo studies support the involvement of apoptosis in tumor suppression by p53. To gain further insight into the mechanisms by which p53 induces apoptosis, the activity of p53 was studied in HeLa cells using a transient transfection assay. To define the functional domains of p53 required for apoptosis a C-terminal deletion mutant of p53 was used. This mutant, p53d1214, lacks the oligomerization domain, the nuclear localization signal and a large part of the core DNA binding domain. This mutant was shown to be deficient in sequence specific transactivation activity. Overexpression of wt p53 induced an efficient apoptosis in transiently transfected HeLa cells. Surprisingly p53d1214, containing only the first 214 N-terminal residues induced extensive apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by p53d1214 is slower than that induced by wt p53. Furthermore, p53d1214 suppressed the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts by several oncogene combinations, such as myc plus ras. In view of the fact that p53d1214 lacks measurable transactivation potential, our findings suggest the existence of two p53 dependent-apoptotic pathways--one involves activation of specific target genes, and the other is independent of it.

Cytokine-treated cells were reversibly arrested in G1 and resumed growth upon return to 37 degrees C. Certain clones exhibited only a G1 arrest in response to p53 activation at 32 degrees C.

We tested the possibility that autocrine secretion of IL-3 played a role in preventing apoptosis and showed that disruption of the autocrine loop by cell dilution or with neutralizing antibodies to IL-3 restored p53-dependent apoptosis at 32 degrees C. Thus, two properties of p53 protein, namely, its ability to arrest cells in G1 and its ability to promote apoptosis could be uncoupled by cytokines acting as survival factors.","['Lin, Y', 'Benchimol, S']","['Lin Y', 'Benchimol S']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mutagenesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:324-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several mutations can activate Abl and convert it into an oncogene. In man, chromosomal translocations result in fusion proteins associated with chronic myelogenous leukemias and some acute lymphocytic leukemias. In viral forms of abl, gag sequences are fused to Abl portions resulting in a deletion of N-terminal sequences. To study c-Abl activity in a cellular environment likely to lack specific regulators, we have expressed human c-Abl in Schizosaccharomyces pombe in an inducible fashion. c-Abl causes growth arrest followed by death of the cells. Mutations in the SH2 domain or in the autophosphorylation site dramatically reduce the ability of Abl to confer the growth arrest phenotype and to phosphorylate endogenous proteins, suggesting a fundamental role of these structures in the activity of the enzyme. An SH3 domain deletion mutant of Abl is as active as c-Abl in yeast indicating that there is no intrinsic regulation of c-Abl occurring via the SH3 domain and suggesting that the inhibitory effect of the SH3 domain observed in cells of vertebrate origin is mediated by a factor that is absent in fission yeast. We have used this assay to functionally screen a human cDNA library for molecules able to counteract the lethal effect of c-Abl expression. We are currently in the process of characterising the isolated clones. We hope to identify among them the molecule(s) responsible for regulating c-Abl activity in human cells.","['Moro, M', 'Walkenhorst, J', 'Goga, A', 'Witte, O N', 'Superti-Furga, G']","['Moro M', 'Walkenhorst J', 'Goga A', 'Witte ON', 'Superti-Furga G']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Schizosaccharomyces/genetics/growth & development', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Vertebrates']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:313-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore a dominant negative form of AML1, AML1a, totally suppressed granulocytic differentiation otherwise induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor when AML1a was overexpressed in 32Dc13 murine myeloid cells. Such differentiation block by AML1a was canceled by the concomitant overexpression of AML1b.

Initial follow-up marrow samples from the second patient had persistently positive CS-PCR results while they were still morphologically and TCR delta PCR negative and the patient had a frank leukemic relapse at 18 months. The other two patients had persistent disease by conventional morphological examination, Southern analysis, TCR delta PCR and CS-PCR studies were all positive as expected.

AML1 corresponds to CBFA2, and encodes one of the DNA-binding subunits of the enhancer core binding factor CBF. Other members of this family of DNA-binding proteins are CBFA1 and CBFA3, also known as AML3 and AML2. The three proteins are characterized by a highly conserved domain (runt domain, > 90% homology) at the amino end that is necessary for DNA-binding and protein dimerization, and by a unique domain at the carboxyl end that is necessary for transactivation. Two recurring chromosomal translocations involving AML1 associated with myeloid leukemias are the t(8;21)(q22;q22), seen in 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M2, and the t(3;21)(q26;q22), that occurs in myeloid leukemias primarily following treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors. In five patients with a t(3;21) whom we studied, AML1 is interrupted by the translocation breakpoint between the runt domain and the transactivation domain, and is fused to two genes on chromosome band 3q26: EAP, which encodes the ribosomal protein L22, and MDS1, which encodes a small polypeptide of unknown function. In one of the five patients we studied, a fusion with a third gene EVI1 also occurs. The fusion of EAP to AML1 is not in frame, and leads to a protein that is terminated shortly after the fusion junction by introduction of a stop codon. The fusion of AML1 to MDS1 is in frame, and adds 127 codons to the interrupted AML1. Thus, in the five cases that we studied, the 3;21 translocation results in expression of two coexisting chimeric mRNAs which contain the identical runt domain at the 5' region, but differ in the 3' region. In addition, the chimeric junction AML1/MDS1/EVII has been detected in cells from one of our patients with the 3;21 translocation. Several genes necessary for myeloid lineage differentiation contain the target sequence for AML1 in their regulatory regions. We have compared the normal AML1 to AML1/MDS1 and AML1/EAP as transcriptional regulators of the CSF1R promoter which contains the CBF target sequence. Our results indicate that whereas the normal AML1 can activate the promoter, the chimeric proteins compete with the normal AML1 and repress expression from the CSF1R promoter. To determine the role of the chimeric proteins in cell growth, we expressed their cDNA in rat fibroblasts. When either fusion gene is expressed, the cells lose contact inhibition and form foci over the monolayer. However, only cells expressing AML1/MDS1 grow as large tumors in nude mice. Thus, although both chimeric genes have similar effects in transactivation of the CSF1R promoter, they affect cell growth as tumor promoters differently in vivo.","['Zent, C', 'Rowley, J D', 'Nucifora, G']","['Zent C', 'Rowley JD', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL., USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Fibroblasts', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Rats', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transfection', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:273-8.,,"['CA 42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the majority of B-CLL is of CD5 B cell type, and because the majority of CD5 B cells produces polyreactive autoantibodies, certain regulatory abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of CD5 B cells appear to be involved in B-CLL and autoimmune disease, respectively. In studies using MHC(H-2)-congenic New Zealand mouse strains, NZB(H-2d), NZW(H-2z) and NZB x NZW F1(H-2d/z), we found that while H-2d/z heterozygosity acts as one genetic predisposing element for autoimmune disease, by providing the element for abnormal differentiation of CD5 B cells, the H-2z/z homozygosity serves as one predisposition for B-CLL, by promoting the abnormal proliferation of CD5 B cells. Another non-MHC-linked genes were also involved in the aberrant proliferation of CD5 B cells, as determined by microsatellite DNA analysis.

In an attempt to understand how the virus alters the growth of erythroid cells, studies were carried out to determine if virus infection leads to the constitutive activation of the Jak-Stat pathway, one of the signal transduction pathways activated by Epo. Our data indicates that expression of SFFV in erythroid cells leads to the constitutive activation of the same Stat proteins that are transiently activated by Epo. While constitutive activation of Stat proteins by SFFV is associated with Epo-independent proliferation of splenic erythroid progenitor cells from Fv-2-sensitive mice and Epo-dependent HCD-57 cells, it is not sufficient to induce their differentiation. Although constitutive activation of the same Stat proteins is detected in erythroid cells from SFFV-infected Fv-2-resistant mice, it does not lead to their Epo-independent growth. It is also not required for transformation of erythroid cells by SFFV. Studies are in progress to identify the mechanism by which Stat proteins are phosphorylated in SFFV-infected cells in the absence of Epo. Although it has been shown that Epo activates Stat proteins through Jak2 kinase, our results suggest that the SFFV-induced Stat protein activation is Jak2-independent.","['Ohashi, T', 'Masuda, M', 'Ruscetti, S K']","['Ohashi T', 'Masuda M', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', '*Genes, fos', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology/virology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*physiopathology/virology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*physiology', '*Virus Replication/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:251-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible involvement of cytokine expression by PVC-211 MuLV-infected BCEC in the induction of neuropathological changes will be discussed.","['Masuda, M', 'Masuda, M', 'Ruscetti, S K', 'Hoffman, P M']","['Masuda M', 'Masuda M', 'Ruscetti SK', 'Hoffman PM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/pathology/*virology', 'Capillaries', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chimera', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*virology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:233-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum Fv-4' env antigen binds to ecotropic MuLV receptors, shown by specific binding to transfectant cells expressing ecotropic MuLV receptors but not to parental mink cells. To determine whether the binding of Fv-4' env antigen to the putative MuLV receptors would block FLV infection, C3H thymocytes or spleen cells that had been preincubated with C4W serum were mixed with FLV and the subsequent production of MuLV specific antigens was examined. C3H thymocytes or spleen cells treated with C4W serum became refractory to binding by FLV. These results provide evidence that the Fv-4' env antigen is released from C4W-derived cells in vivo and binds to cells expressing surface receptors for ecotropic MuLV, thereby protecting them from infection with FLV. The implication of these findings for gene therapy of retrovirus-induced disease such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is discussed.","['Kitagawa, M', 'Aizawa, S', 'Ikeda, H', 'Hirokawa, K']","['Kitagawa M', 'Aizawa S', 'Ikeda H', 'Hirokawa K']","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Fv4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/biosynthesis', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/virology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/virology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Receptors, Virus/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:230-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like other retroviruses, infection with BLV results in deregulation of the host immune system at both humoral and cellular levels. An approach which might help in the elucidation of some immune impairment phenomena is the investigation of the role that cytokines play in the pathogenesis and immune response of BLV infected animals. Here we describe our findings on IL-6 and TNF. We have found that the levels of IL-6 in the sera of BLV infected cows which show persistent lymphocytosis (BLV+ PL+) were significantly higher than those of BLV infected with no lymphocytosis (BLV+ PL-) or BLV negative cows (BLV-). The same results were obtained by measuring the spontaneous production of IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Furthermore, PBMC derived from BLV+PL+ cows secrete higher levels of IL-6 and TNF alpha than those derived from BLV+PL- and BLV- ones following in vitro exposure to the BLV gp51 antigen, bacterial endotoxins (LPS) and ConA. Similar results were obtained when supernatants from stimulated adherent (monocytes, macrophages) and non-adherent cells (B and T lymphocytes) were tested. When exogenous IL-6 and TNF alpha were added to BLV infected cells in vitro, the expression of viral antigens was strongly suppressed. Thus, the possibility exists that the elevated production of IL-6 and even more than that of TNF alpha play a role as contributing factors to the latency of the clinical expression in BLV infection.","['Meirom, R', 'Moss, S', 'Brenner, J', 'Heller, D', 'Trainin, Z']","['Meirom R', 'Moss S', 'Brenner J', 'Heller D', 'Trainin Z']","['Kimron Veterinary Institute, Bet-Dagan, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Retroviridae/classification', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:219-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the nature of c143 TAA was likely to be that of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens, we isolated cDNAs for bovine MHC (BoLA) class II a-chains and b-chains, produced transfectants that expressed a single type of BoLA class II molecules and analyzed them by flow cytometry with c143 MAb. The c143 MAb recognized the transfectant expressing BoLA-DR but not BoLA-DQ. However, the treatment of lymphocytes with c143 or anti-BoLA-DR MAb induced different effects. Although mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was inhibited by the addition of anti-BoLA-DR MAb, the c143 MAb did not inhibit a proliferative response of T cells in MLR. Increased spontaneous proliferation of lymphocytes in healthy donors was obtained in the presence of c143 MAb but not anti-BoLA-DR MAb, and was much in lymphocytes from the carrier.

Both transgenic mice showed apparently normal phenotype. However in TgNES mice, but not in TgNEsol mice, the number of neutrophil decreased to 50% compared with that in their negative littermate.

Our studies have shown that the mitomycin-c treated or irradiated RAW117-H10 cells very significantly (p < 0.001) inhibited the nitrogen induced proliferation of normal Balb/c splenocytes. The cell surface extracts from the immunosuppressive RAW117-H10 lymphoma cells significantly inhibited the in vitro T cell or NK/LAK cell functions. Our in vivo studies demonstrated that there was a significant suppression of immune response in the Balb/c mice bearing RAW117-H10 cells when compared with mice bearing low metastatic parental RAW117-P cells or control mice. Subsequently we isolated and purified the main molecule responsible for this immunosuppression and found that the molecule is a glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 70 kD with an isoelectric point of 4.3, which cross reacted with antibodies to murine leukemia virus envelope gp70 molecules. Further analysis using immunoelectrophoresis, molecular probing techniques, and mannose specific lectin binding assay revealed that the immunosuppressive 70 kD molecule, is different from the wild type MLV envelope gp70 molecule and thus appears to be an altered gp70 molecule.

In order to obtain a clue for the structure of the binding site to the EPO-R, we isolated and analyzed many spontaneous revertant F-SFFVs which derived from the non-leukemogenic mutant F-SFFV having an ecotropic env sequence instead of the polytropic env sequence in its gp55 gene.","['Amanuma, H', 'Yugawa, T', 'Watanabe, N', 'Ikawa, Y']","['Amanuma H', 'Yugawa T', 'Watanabe N', 'Ikawa Y']","['Laboratory of Gene Technology and Safety, Tsukuba Life Science Center, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (glycoprotein gp55, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Gene Products, env/biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Genes, env', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Weight', 'Polycythemia', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Splenomegaly', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:160-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To find a suitable experimental model system for analysis of the functions of the ERV3 genome, an extensive screening study of different normal and neoplastic human tissues was performed. Most tissues express low levels of the ERV3 env mRNA although high expression levels are observed in placenta, sebaceous glands, adrenals, testis, bronchial, epithelium and the monocytic cell line U-937. In U-937 cells the ERV3 env expression varied in a manner related to the differentiation status of the cells; being highest in the terminally differentiated non proliferating cells. U-937 cells can be induced to differentiate from the monoblastic to the mature monocyte/macrophage stage upon stimulation by several substances such as phorbolesters (TPA), Vitamin D3, Retinoic Acid (RA) and combinations of some cytokines.

To characterize the sequence variation and its correlation to serologic diversity of HIV-1 Group O and HIV-2 isolates, samples were identified by differential reactivity in selected commercial and research assays. Analysis of sera from Equatorial Guinea (EG) led to identification of 4 HIV-1 Group O variants. Viral RNA, extracted from these samples was used to PCR amplify overlapping sequences of the entire envelope gene using multiple primer pairs. Sequence analysis indicated that the V3 loop nucleotide and protein sequences aligned more closely with HIVANT70 compared to other Group O sequences. The amino acid sequences at the octameric tip of the V3 loop were RIGPLAWY, RIGPMAWY, or GLGPLAVY. The tetrameric tip GPLA is represented only once in the published 1994 HIV database (Los Alamos) but was present in 2 of 4 of EG samples. The immuno-dominant region (IDR) sequences derived from EG sera were unique in that none of the sequences were completely homologous to other HIV-1 group O variants. Further, the HIV-1 group O sequence variation could be correlated with differential serologic reactivity using IDR peptides. Compared to HIV-1, the sequence information on HIV-2 isolates is relatively limited, though the HIV-2 isolates also show genetic variation similar to HIV-1. To further establish a correlation between the genetic diversity and serologic detection of HIV-2, plasma samples from Western Africa were evaluated. Eight samples were selected based on weak serologic reactivity to env proteins. PCR amplification and sequence analysis of the gag, env V3 loop, and env IDR regions indicated that the samples could be classified as subtypes A (4 samples), B (3 samples) and D (1 sample). Across the subtypes, there was conservation in the IDR region of the sequence WGCAFRQVCHT. This region is absolutely conserved among the majority of currently known HIV-2 and related SIV viruses (1994 HIV database). One subtype B sample had a unique sequence immediately adjacent to the IDR, however, this did not change the serologic detection using a HIV-2 IDR specific monoclonal antibody.","['Hunt, J C', 'Brennan, C A', 'Golden, A M', 'Yamaguchi, J', 'Lund, J K', 'Vallari, A S', 'Hickman, R K', 'Zekeng, L', 'Gurtler, L G', 'Hampl, H', 'Kaptue, L', 'Devare, S G']","['Hunt JC', 'Brennan CA', 'Golden AM', 'Yamaguchi J', 'Lund JK', 'Vallari AS', 'Hickman RK', 'Zekeng L', 'Gurtler LG', 'Hampl H', 'Kaptue L', 'Devare SG']","['Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL-60064, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/virology', 'Africa, Western', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blood Donors', 'Cameroon', 'Equatorial Guinea', 'Female', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry', 'Genes, env', '*Genetic Variation', 'HIV-1/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'HIV-2/classification/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification', 'Serotyping']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:138-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CBA/Ca male mice started on AZT 0.75 mg/ml H2O at 84 days of age and kept on it for 687 days when dosage reduced to 0.5 mg/ml H2O for a group, another group removed from AZT to see recovery, and third group remained on 0.75 mg. At 687 days mice that had been on 0.75 mg had average platelet counts of 2.5 x 10(6). Histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such thrombocytopenia showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A variety of histological patterns was observed. There were two cases of hypocellular myelodysplasia, two cases of hypersegmented myelodysplastic granulocytosis, two cases of hypercellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with bizarre nuclei, one case of megakaryocytic myelosis associated with a hyperplastic marrow, dysmyelopoiesis and a hypocellular marrow and two cases of myelodysplasia with dyserythropoiesis, hemosiderosis and a hypocellular marrow.

However, a number of studies have shown that this is determined not only at the level of the cellular receptor(s) or virus entry, but at a number of additional and later stages in virus replication. We have recently reported that the reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA is markedly enhanced by the association of the gag encoded nucleocapsid p15 protein and cellular topoisomerase I. In the present study we have investigated if the recruitment of cellular topoisomerase I during virus replication is important in determining the cellular tropism of HIV-1. Employing a stable murine cell line, L929, expressing both human CD4 and topoisomerase I, it could be demonstrated that effective proviral DNA synthesis occurred following infection. In contrast in cells expressing only human CD4, proviral DNA synthesis was not detected. In addition we have co-expressed fusin, a protein known to act as an accessory factor as the virus entry stage in infection of T cell tropic HIV-1, to support viral entry completely. However no progeny virus could be detected after HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that reverse transcription in vivo is critically dependent on the presence of cellular topoisomerase I, and support the view that involvement of this enzyme is important in HIV-1 replication. Moreover the findings suggest that other factors which remained to be identified, are involved in restricting HIV-1 replication in non-primate cells.","['Takahashi, H', 'Tatsumi, M', 'Matsuda, M', 'Nagashima, K', 'Kurata, T', 'Hall, W W']","['Takahashi H', 'Tatsumi M', 'Matsuda M', 'Nagashima K', 'Kurata T', 'Hall WW']","['National Institute of Health, Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Genes, gag', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Nucleocapsid/biosynthesis', 'Primates', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:113-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have characterized the effects of three such compounds on Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV). We find that, as with HIV-1, the compounds inactivate cell-free MuLV particles and induce disulfide cross-linking of NC in these particles. In contrast, the compounds have no effect on the infectivity of human foamy virus, a spumaretrovirus lacking zinc fingers in its NC protein. The resistance of foamy virus supports the hypothesis that the zinc fingers are the targets for inactivation of MuLV and HIV-1 by the compounds. The absolute conservation of the zinc finger motif among oncoretroviruses and lentiviruses, and the lethality of all known mutations altering the zinc-binding residues, suggest that only the normal, wild-type structure can efficiently perform all of its functions. This possibility would make the zinc finger an ideal target for antiretroviral agents.","['Rein, A', 'Ott, D E', 'Mirro, J', 'Arthur, L O', 'Rice, W G', 'Henderson, L E']","['Rein A', 'Ott DE', 'Mirro J', 'Arthur LO', 'Rice WG', 'Henderson LE']","['Retroviral Genetics Section, SAIC-Frederick, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Disulfides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*pharmacology', 'Disulfides', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis', 'Nucleocapsid/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Spumavirus/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/drug effects/*physiology', 'Zinc Fingers']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:106-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the course of virus production, particularly during the late stage, viral genomic RNA is incorporated specifically into virion particles. This specific incorporation of the genomic RNA requires a packaging signal sequence. A region that functions as the packaging signal was mapped to a location upstream of the gag open reading frame on the HIV-1 viral genome. In addition of this packaging signal, other cis-acting elements that are scattered throughout the genome are also required for efficient packaging. The region upstream of the splice donor site is probably important for dimer formation. Therefore, we focused on one region located between the 3' end of the primer binding site and the 5' splice donor site of HIV-1. Experiments were conducted to investigate how deletions or point mutations in this region affect both dimerization in vitro and the production of infectious virus particles. A series of RNAs of varying lengths containing the 5' noncoding region were generated, and genomic dimerization of the altered viral RNA was analyzed in vitro. One RNA construct which consisted of 112 nucleotides (nt) from nt 639 to nt 750 formed a heterodimeric complex with the RNA which consisted of 200 nucleotides from nt 551 to nt 750. We then constructed proviruses with mutations in the 639 to 750 nt region and assayed for virus production. Several mutants that lacked the complementarity necessary to form a possible stem-loop structure in this region showed decreased production of infectious virus particles. Moreover, both deletion of this region and randomization of its nucleotide sequence completely impaired infectious virus production. Thus, the way that this region affects infectious virus production may be through its RNA secondary structure.","['Hirota, M', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'An, D S', 'Iwanaga, Y', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Shimotohno, K']","['Hirota M', 'Koyanagi Y', 'An DS', 'Iwanaga Y', 'Yamamoto N', 'Shimotohno K']","['Virology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Genes, gag', '*Genome, Viral', 'HIV-1/*genetics/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Proviruses', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:102-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a means to evaluate the mechanism of vaccine protection, cats were either passively immunized with serum antibodies or transfused with peripheral blood cells from FIV-vaccinated cats. Cats passively immunized with vaccine sera or purified vaccine antibodies were protected from homologous FIV infection at a challenge doses which infected all control cats (5 and 10 CID50). Such passive protection was not achieved against heterologous FIV challenge. More importantly, cats transfused with washed blood cells from half-matched vaccinated cat were protected from FIV challenge (20 and 50 CID50).

This was in spite of high-level resistance to this compound and the appearance of the M184V substitution in the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, responsible for diminished sensitivity to 3TC. This apparent contradiction is explained by an increase in the fidelity of the HIV RT, conferred by the M184V mutation, on the basis of the following observations. First, titers of viral neutralizing antibodies, as measured against sequential autologous HIV isolates, remained stable in this population in contrast to rapid declines in patients treated with other drugs. This suggests that increased fidelity of M184V RT may limit variability in the HIV env gene and result in protracted effectiveness of anti-viral immune responsiveness. Second, recombinant HIV, that contained the M184V substitution in RT, could not replicate in the presence of d4T, AZT, Nevirapine, Delavirdine or Saquinavir, using previously described protocols for the generation of drug resistance in vitro.","['Wainberg, M A']",['Wainberg MA'],"['McGill University AIDS Centre, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (HIV Reverse Transcriptase)']",IM,"['Anti-HIV Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Female', 'Genes, env', 'HIV Infections/*drug therapy', 'HIV Reverse Transcriptase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'HIV-1/drug effects/*enzymology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Lamivudine/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', '*Point Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:85-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Horizontal distribution of inflammatory lesions was symmetric at any spinal levels. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated T-cell dominance. The numbers of CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were equally present in patients with shorter clinical course. Apoptosis of helper/inducer T cells were observed in the presence of TIA1+ cytotoxic T cells in these active inflammatory lesions. Inflammatory infiltrates were markedly decreased and CD8+/TIA1- T cells were predominated over CD4+ cells in patients with prolonged clinical course. HTLV-1 proviral DNA amounts in the freshly frozen spinal cord measured by quantitative PCR were well correlated with the numbers of infiltrated CD4+ cells. In situ PCR of HTLV-1 proviral DNA using multi-primary pairs demonstrated the presence of HTLV-1 infected cells exclusively in the mononuclear infiltrates of perivascular areas.

The disparate up-regulation of several genes in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) versus HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), seropositive carriers (SPC) and uninfected normals may reflect events at the molecular level related to leukemogenesis or to processes maintaining the heme-oncologic phenotype. Further, the genetic transduction of cytokine and receptor genes uniquely associated with ATL may provide targets for the development of leukemia-specific gene therapies aimed at exploiting differences in the production of certain growth factors and growth factor receptors. Comparisons of the transcriptional and translational levels of interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha), transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) and intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in ATL, HAM/TSP, and SPC and in several control populations revealed selectively up-regulated expression in ATL. We evaluated the feasibility of using lymphoid-specific TRS to activate herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk) to achieve selective cytotoxicity in leukemias expressing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT).

Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of hGMR beta subunit and several cellular proteins are observed with hGM-CSF stimulation. We analyzed role of tyrosine residue of hGMR beta subunit and nature of tyrosine kinase, JAK2 in hGMR signals using several hGMR beta subunit mutants. In addition to box1 region, a membrane distal region (a.a. 544-589) of hGMR beta is required for c-fos activation. Only one tyrosine residue (Tyr577) exists within the region 544-589, and substitution of Tyr577 to phenylalanine in GMR beta 589 resulted in the loss of c-fos activation. In contrast, the same substitution in a wild type receptor did not affect GM-CSF-induced activities such as c-fos mRNA induction and proliferation but abolished Shc phosphorylation. These results suggest that the activation of Shc is not essential for c-fos activation and several tyrosine residues co-ordinate to activate c-fos activation. It is well documented that IL-3 or GM-CSF activates JAK2 in BA/F3 cells. However the role of JAK2 in IL-3/GM-CSF functions is largely unknown. We examined the role of JAK2 in GM-CSF-induced signaling pathways. Dominant negative JAK2 (delta JAK2) lacking the C-terminus kinase domain, suppressed IL-3/GM-CSF induced c-fos activation, c-myc activation and proliferation suggesting that JAK2 is involved in both signaling pathways. PTP1D and Shc are phosphorylated by IL-3/GM-CSF in BA/F3 cells, however these phosphorylation events were inhibited by expression of delta JAK2. Taken together, these results indicate that JAK2 is a primary kinase regulating all the known activities of GM-CSF. JAK2 mediates GM-CSF induced c-fos activation through receptor phosphorylation and Shc/PTP1D activation.","['Watanabe, S', 'Itoh, T', 'Arai, K']","['Watanabe S', 'Itoh T', 'Arai K']","['Department of Molecular and Developmental Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Genes, fos', 'Genes, myc', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phenylalanine', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'Tyrosine']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:76-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The retrovirus, human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), is the causative agent of ATL. In ATL-endemic areas, the rate of HTLV-I carriers is high. A definite diagnosis of ATL is based on the presence of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the tumor cell DNA. ATL cells originate from the CD4 subset of peripheral T cells. ATL shows diverse clinical features but can be divided into four subtypes: acute, chronic, smoldering, and lymphoma type. Chemotherapy is not effective; the acute and lymphoma types have a poor prognosis. Familial occurrence of ATL is common. HTLV-I infection is caused by transmission of live infected lymphocytes from mother to child, from man to female, or by blood transfusion. Infection with HTLV-I can lead to other diseases, including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-I uveitis.","['Takatsuki, K']",['Takatsuki K'],"['Kumamoto University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Lecture'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/*blood', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Proviruses/isolation & purification', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:54-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently reported that the reverse transcription of HIV-1 RNA is markedly enhanced by the association of the gag encoded nucleocapsid p15 protein and cellular topoisomerase 1. In the present study we have now investigated if the recruitment of cellular topoisomerase I during virus replication is important in determining the cellular tropism of HIV-1. Employing a stable murine cell line, L929, expressing both human CD4 and topoisomerase I, it could be demonstrated that effective proviral DNA synthesis occurred following infection. In contrast in cells expressing only human CD4 proviral DNA synthesis was not detected. In addition we have co-expressed fusin, a protein known to act as an accessory factor as the virus entry stage in infection of T cell tropic HIV-1, to support viral entry completely. However no progeny virus could be detected after HIV-1 infection. These results suggest that reverse transcription in vivo is critically dependent on the presence of cellular topoisomerase I, and support the view that involvement of this enzyme is in HIV-1 replication. Moreover the findings suggest that other factors which remained to be identified, are involved in restricting HIV-1 replication in non-primate cells.","['Takahashi, H', 'Tatsumi, M', 'Matsuda, M', 'Nagashima, K', 'Kurata, T', 'Hall, W W']","['Takahashi H', 'Tatsumi M', 'Matsuda M', 'Nagashima K', 'Kurata T', 'Hall WW']","['National Institute of Health, Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'CD4 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag/*biosynthesis', 'Genes, gag', 'Glutathione Transferase', 'HIV-1/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primates', 'RNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:26-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examination of the basal factors interacting with the 21 bp repeat elements through electrophoretic mobility shift (EMS) analyses has demonstrated the formation of DNA-protein complexes common to each of the 21 bp repeats (C1-C3) as well as three DNA-protein complexes specific to the promoter proximal (pp) repeat (U1 (U1A/U1B) and U2; 1-4). These studies have indicated that the individual repeats are not identical with respect to the cellular factors with which they interact. EMS analyses utilizing a series of mutated pp repeat elements demonstrate that the nucleotide sequence requirements for U1 (U1A/U1B) and U2 formation are separable from those required for C1-C3 formation. Competition EMS analyses utilizing Sp1 and CREB binding site oligonucleotides demonstrate that Sp family members are critical components of U1 (U1A/U1B) and U2 and that ATF/CREB family members are critical components of C1-C3. EMS supershift analyses have demonstrated that Sp1 is involved in U1A formation while Sp3 is involved in U1B and U2 formation. EMS analyses performed with nuclear extracts from Tax-expressing Jurkat cells and HTLV-I-transformed peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrate that Tax prevents the formation of U1 (U1A/U1B) and U2 DNA-protein complexes. Therefore, Tax appears to inhibit the interaction of Sp family members with the pp repeat. Based on these observations, it is possible that the interaction of Sp and ATF/CREB family members with the pp repeat during basal and Tax-mediated transcription may play a critical role in viral gene expression during the initial stages of virus infection or during activation of a latent infection.","['Wessner, R', 'Yao, J', 'Wigdahl, B']","['Wessner R', 'Yao J', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 3:10-3.,,"['CA 54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gamma chain is upregulated by Tax, like the IL-2 receptor alpha chain. This upregulation may compensate the gamma chain downregulation after IL-2 binding, presumably resulting in more frequent growth of HTLV-I infected T cells. The other is gp34 that was initially identified as a molecule specifically expressed on HTLV-I-infected T cells. gp34 has been demonstrated to bind OX40 which belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family.

The latter two protocols were performed to detect the light chains restriction of immunoglobulin with peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) methods, and the clonality of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene with the hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method, respectively. Although in 8 cases it could not be morphologically determined whether they were neoplastic or not, clonality was revealed in 1 case with immunohistochemistry and in 4 cases with PCR. Two cases showed discordant results between immunohistochemistry and PCR probably due to somatic mutation of the framework region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. Therefore, we, concluded that examination with these methods contribute to a better understanding of the nature of the ocular adnexal lymphoid proliferations. Furthermore, the immunoglobulin gene PCR method is very useful in practical examination, as it can be used with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens.","['Kubota, T', 'Yatabe, Y', 'Awaya, S', 'Asai, J', 'Mori, N']","['Kubota T', 'Yatabe Y', 'Awaya S', 'Asai J', 'Mori N']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Aich-ken, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi,Nippon Ganka Gakkai zasshi,7505716,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eye Neoplasms/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nippon Ganka Gakkai Zasshi. 1997 Jun;101(6):510-5.,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: The records of 137 patients who underwent splenectomy (63 LS and 74 OS) at a large private teaching hospital between March 1991 and April 1996 were reviewed retrospectively. Diagnosis, age, gender, operative time, blood loss, splenic weight, time to resumption of oral diet, postoperative hospital stay, morbidity, mortality, and costs (direct and operative) were analyzed by multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Laparoscopic splenectomy patients had significantly shorter hospitalization and time to resumption of an oral diet (p < 0.01); although operative costs were higher, total direct costs were not. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura patients had earlier resumption of an oral diet after LS, shorter postoperative stay, and comparable OR time. Five patients (7%) were converted, with outcomes similar to OS except for greater operative time and cost. Grade II complications occurred in three LS and four OS patients; Grade III in three OS patients; and Grade IV in two OS patients. There were two major complications of LS and eight of OS, with two deaths. Multivariate analysis showed that operative time and time to resumption of oral intake were significantly related to age, diagnosis, operative technique, and splenic weight. Duration of postoperative hospitalization was related to operative technique, splenic weight, and major complications. Costs (direct and operative) were related to age, splenic weight, and major complications, but not to operative technique. CONCLUSIONS: LS results are influenced by splenic weight, disease, and age. Splenic weight appears to be the crucial determinant of operative time and length of hospitalization. LS is a superior treatment for patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and patients with small spleens.","['Friedman, R L', 'Hiatt, J R', 'Korman, J L', 'Facklis, K', 'Cymerman, J', 'Phillips, E H']","['Friedman RL', 'Hiatt JR', 'Korman JL', 'Facklis K', 'Cymerman J', 'Phillips EH']","['Department of Surgery, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, California 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Coll Surg,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,9431305,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Hemolytic/surgery', 'Blood Loss, Surgical', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eating', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', '*Laparoscopy', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Organ Size', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Splenectomy/adverse effects/*methods', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Surg. 1997 Jul;185(1):49-54.,,,1,['S1072751597000082 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presence of fever is accepted as a reliable indicator of either acute of chronic disease. Although the vast majority of fevers are caused by infectious agents, some solid tumors have fever as a presenting illness usually because of associated inflammation or infection secondary to the neoplasm. However, cancer cells can spontaneously produce cytokines, small proteins with multiple biological properties. Some cytokines released by neoplastic cells are pyrogenic, ie, they produce fever directly by their action on the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center. Examples of malignant cells producing pyrogenic cytokines are renal carcinoma, lymphomas, and acute myelogenous and chronic myelogenous leukemias. The pyrogenic cytokines released by these cancers are interleukin-6, interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and interferon, but others likely exist. Antipyretics reduce fever regardless of its causation; some studies suggest that fever caused by pyrogenic cytokines released from malignancies is preferentially reduced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents.","['Dinarello, C A', 'Bunn, P A Jr']","['Dinarello CA', 'Bunn PA Jr']","['Department of Medicine, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and Colorado Cancer Center, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol,Seminars in oncology,0420432,"['0 (Analgesics, Non-Narcotic)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Cytokines)']",IM,"['Analgesics, Non-Narcotic/therapeutic use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Fever/drug therapy/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*complications/metabolism']",1997/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol. 1997 Jun;24(3):288-98.,71,['AI-15614/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Paradoxically, RIN1 potentiates the oncogenic activity of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in hematopoietic cells and dramatically accelerates BCR-ABL-induced leukemias in mice. RIN1 rescues BCR-ABL mutants for transformation in a manner distinguishable from the cell cycle regulators c-Myc and cyclin D1 and the Ras connector Shc. These biological effects require tyrosine phosphorylation of RIN1 and binding of RIN1 to the Abl-SH2 and SH3 domains. RIN1 is tyrosine phosphorylated and is associated with BCR-ABL in human and murine leukemic cells.

METHODS: Thirty eight DNA samples (derived predominantly from bone marrow) obtained from 31 patients with multiple myeloma were examined for mutations in p53 exons 5-9 by polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism. Twenty three samples were analysed at the time of diagnosis (one patient had plasma cell leukaemia), three in plateau phase, and 12 at relapse (one plasma cell leukaemia and one extramedullary relapse). RESULTS: One p53 mutation was detected in this group of patients (3.2%). This was seen in the diagnostic bone marrow sample of a 35 year old man with stage IIA disease and occurred in exon 6 as a result of a silent A to G transition at codon 213 (CGA-->CGG), a polymorphism that has been reported in about 3% of breast and lung tumours. CONCLUSIONS: p53 gene mutations are rare events in multiple myeloma and would seem to be of limited value as a prognostic factor.","['Owen, R G', 'Davis, S A', 'Randerson, J', 'Rawstron, A C', 'Davies, F', 'Child, J A', 'Jack, A S', 'Morgan, G J']","['Owen RG', 'Davis SA', 'Randerson J', 'Rawstron AC', 'Davies F', 'Child JA', 'Jack AS', 'Morgan GJ']","['Centre for Haematological Oncology, General Infirmary at Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pathol. 1997 Feb;50(1):18-20. doi: 10.1136/mp.50.1.18.,,,1,['10.1136/mp.50.1.18 [doi]'],['Mol Pathol. 1997 Dec;50(6):329.

We have found using scanning electron microscopy, phase contrast and immunofluorescence, that a proportion of these cells also exhibit the formation of circular membrane ruffles on their dorsal surface after exposure to an IgE-directed secretagogue; some cells also develop circular membrane ruffles following stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate or by calcium ionophore A23187. A flattened morphology appears to be linked to circular membrane ruffle formation in that these ruffles were found in areas of presumed cell spreading which are largely devoid of intermediate filaments and displaced to one side of the cell's nucleus, and they were not observed on rounded cells. This is in contrast to the wavy ruffles which are found on the entire cell surface including the region overlying the nucleus, and which are observed in rounded cells as well as spread cells. Circular ruffle formation and secretion are triggered by similar concentrations of antigen, but the circular ruffles are formed more slowly and only become abundant at times after most of the histamine has been released. The circular membrane ruffles showed no obvious association with endocytosis, as detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran as a fluid phase marker. The position of accumulation of endocytotic vesicles occurring subsequent to secretion was not found to be related to the circular membrane ruffles, but was observed around the nucleus. Circular membrane ruffles contain F-actin, and their formation is prevented by cytochalasin D. At least three types of myosin, types I, II and V are present and presumably play a role in circular ruffle formation.","['Edgar, A J', 'Bennett, J P']","['Edgar AJ', 'Bennett JP']","[""Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Imperial College School of Medicine, St. Mary's, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London/United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens/*administration & dosage', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Intermediate Filaments/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Microtubules/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Myosins/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1997 Jun;73(2):132-40.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The humoral immunological response was followed by ELISA for 2 months. Seroconversion to BLV was demonstrated at 4-5 weeks post-infection. Total and differential leukocyte counts were performed. Acute lymphocytosis was observed at the time of seroconversion in the majority of the experimental calves. By the aid of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), the proportion as well as the total number of lymphoid cells were studied in four of the calves, applying analytical flow cytometry. At the time of seroconversion the percentage of B-cells increased from 19.1 +/- 7.5% to 37.9 +/- 15.8%, and the T-cells (CD2+) decreased from 36.7 +/- 7.3% to 22.7 +/- 6.0%, the latter being attributable to decreases in the percentage of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T-cells for the infected calves together. Subsequently, altered B/T ratios were observed. In one of the calves an increase in the absolute number of CD5+ cells coincided with an increase in total B-cells. The early phenotypic alterations in lymphocyte subsets, before and after seroconversion to BLV, were comparable to those of non-lymphocytotic and persistent lymphocytotic cattle, respectively. Sera from 15 calves were tested for the presence of interferon (IFN), as measured by antiviral activity.

Proliferation of CML marrow CD34+ cells in primary short-term cultures, maintained in the presence or absence of macrophage inhibitory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), was tracked with the membrane dye PKH2. After 7 to 10 days it was possible to distinguish between cytokine responsive (CR) CD34+ cells (cells which had divided thus becoming PKH2dim) and cytokine nonresponsive (CNR) CD34+ cells (cells which had not divided and had therefore remained PKH2bright). CR and CNR CD34+ cells were isolated by flow cytometric cell sorting, seeded in secondary long-term cultures, and their progeny cells assayed weekly for their clonogenic progenitor cell content and expression of BCR/ABL by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Whereas CNR cells isolated from control primary cultures (control/CNR) sustained in vitro hematopoiesis, similar cells from cultures treated with MIP-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha/CNR) supported a higher and, in some patients, a more extended production of clonogenic HPC, indicating that MIP-1 alpha was able to maintain primitive HPC in a quiescent state. Predominance of BCR/ABL negative progenitors in vitro was more evident in secondary cultures initiated with CNR cells than in those initiated with CR cells, especially those established with MIP-1 alpha/CNR cells. Of interest is the observed decline in the percentage of BCR/ABL+ progenitors in these cultures with time. Whereas up to 100% of progenitors were BCR/ABL+ on day 0, by day 14, only 46% of progenitors in MIP-1 alpha/CNR secondary cultures were BCR/ABL+ and by day 28 and beyond, the percentage of BCR/ABL+ progenitors dropped to below 20%. These results suggest that the quiescent nature of normal HPC present in CML marrow may favor their identification via cell tracking and, subsequently, their isolation from the more actively cycling leukemic cells. These studies also confirm the feasibility of employing negative hematopoietic regulators to augment the sequestration of normal HPC among the cytokine nonresponsive fraction of CD34+ cells, an approach that may be clinically feasible for autotransplantation.","['Veena, P', 'Cornetta, K', 'Davidson, A', 'Aguero, B', 'McMahel, J', 'Traycoff, C M', 'Srour, E F']","['Veena P', 'Cornetta K', 'Davidson A', 'Aguero B', 'McMahel J', 'Traycoff CM', 'Srour EF']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University, School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jun;19(12):1213-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700818.,,"['P01 CA 59348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55716/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",12,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700818 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients of median age 30 years were transplanted between 1983 and 1994 in 25 European centres. The overall probabilities of survival and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years were 32 and 25%, respectively. In univariate analysis, two factors were identified which affected survival and LFS, ie the state of disease at the time of transplant and the degree of HLA disparity. Fifty-nine patients were transplanted in first chronic phase and the probability of survival at 2 years was 47%. Forty-four patients received their transplants for advanced disease and their probability of survival at 2 years was 25% (P = 0.004).

All patients received heparin 200 IU/kg bw continuous i.v. infusion starting the day before conditioning until day +30. Thirty-four of 36 patients (94%) engrafted and no secondary graft failure was observed. The two non-engraftments occurred in patients with CML in blast crisis with extensive myelofibrosis. All 34 engrafted patients (100%) were in complete remission on day +30 as shown by bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic examinations. No life-threatening treatment-related morbidity or mortality (TRM) were observed, in particular, no severe veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver and no fatal pulmonary complication. Use of G-CSF significantly shortened the time of neutropenia by 5 days. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of CsA/methylprednisolone with or without MTX. Acute GVHD grade II-IV was observed in 18/34 patients (53%) and cGVHD in 12/27 patients (45%), who survived to day +100. In seven patients (four with HLA class I or II mismatch) anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG) was added for acute GVHD prophylaxis. One of seven had aGVHD grade II and none developed grade III to IV GVHD or graft failure.

Incidence is evaluated about half that of extra-gonadal GCT. Their treatment is generally based on protocols used for testicular cancer, but with poorer results. Based on our experience of 40 patients with PMNSGCTs and data from the literature, we review here the clinical and biological data of these neoplasms. PMNSGCTs seem to constitute a specific entity, distinct from other GCT by the following criteria: true extra-gonadal origin, high incidence in patients with the Klinefelter's syndrome, over-representation of the yolk-sac component, poorer chemosensitivity and survival compared to other GCT, frequent occurrence of non-treatment related hematological neoplasia. The finding of an isochromosome of the short arm of the chromosome 12 in the leukemic karyotype is one of the strongest argument for a common origin in the yolk-sac component of the PMNSGCTs and their associated leukemia. Treatment of PMNSGCTs is still a challenge and should be conducted by a well-trained medical team.","['Fizazi, K', 'Culine, S', 'Droz, J P', 'Le Chevalier, T', 'Ruffie, P', 'Theodore, C']","['Fizazi K', 'Culine S', 'Droz JP', 'Le Chevalier T', 'Ruffie P', 'Theodore C']","['Departement de medecine oncologique, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (alpha-Fetoproteins)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/blood', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/genetics', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', '*Germinoma/blood/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Klinefelter Syndrome/complications', 'Leukemia/complications/genetics', 'Male', '*Mediastinal Neoplasms/blood/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'alpha-Fetoproteins/analysis']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1997 Mar;84(3):313-27.,142,,3,,,,Tumeurs germinales non seminomateuses mediastinales primitives: de la clinique a la biologie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A search of DNA sequence databases with the MBD sequence identified a human cDNA with potential to encode an MBD-like region. Sequencing of the complete cDNA revealed that the open reading frame also encodes two cysteine-rich domains that are found in animal DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and in the mammalian HRX protein (also known as MLL and All-1). HRX is related to Drosophila trithorax. The protein, known as Protein Containing MBD (PCM1), was expressed in bacteria and shown to bind specifically to methylated DNA. PCM1 also repressed transcription in vitro in a methylation-dependent manner. A polyclonal antibody raised against the protein was able to 'supershift' the native MeCP11 complex from HeLa cells, indicating that PCM1 is a component of mammalian MeCP1.","['Cross, S H', 'Meehan, R R', 'Nan, X', 'Bird, A']","['Cross SH', 'Meehan RR', 'Nan X', 'Bird A']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, Edinburgh University U.K. Sally.Cross@ed.ac.uk and A.Bird@ed.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MECP2 protein, human)', '0 (MeCP1 histone deacetylase complex, human)', '0 (MeCP1 histone deacetylase complex, mouse)', '0 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/*chemistry/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'HeLa Cells', '*Histone Deacetylases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 1997 Jul;16(3):256-9. doi: 10.1038/ng0797-256.,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],3,['10.1038/ng0797-256 [doi]'],,,,"['GENBANK/X63692', 'GENBANK/Y10746', 'SWISSPROT/Q03164']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tested the relationship between araC cytotoxicity, measured in an in vitro tetrazolium dye reduction assay of cell viability, and the cellular abundance of es nucleoside transport elements, assayed by a flow cytometric method that used the es-specific stain, 5-(SAENTA-x8)-fluorescein (5-(Sx8)-F), in cultured leukemia cells and in myeloblasts and lymphoblasts (blasts) from leukemia patients. Cellular es site abundance (B(max) value for 5-(Sx8)-F binding) varied sixfold among nine leukemic myeloblast samples from patients. In cultured OCI/AML-2 myeloblasts and CCRF-CEM T-lymphoblasts, and in fresh leukemic blasts, es sites were fractionally blocked by treatment with graded concentrations of nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), an inhibitory es site ligand, to simulate the variation in es expression found in leukemic blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia. When the cytotoxicity of a single concentration of araC was determined in NBMPR-treated leukemia cells, cell kill correlated closely with the intensity of 5-(Sx8)-F fluorescence (r = .92 to .99), a measure of the cell surface abundance of functional es nucleoside transporter sites. Concentrations of NBMPR that achieved half-maximal reduction (4.3 to 12 nmol/L) of cellular 5-(Sx8)-F fluorescence (measured by flow cytometry) approximated IC50 values (1 to 10 nmol/L) previously found for inhibition by NBMPR of es-mediated nucleoside fluxes in several cell types, supporting the view that 5-(Sx8)-F interacted with the estransporter. The correlation of araC cytotoxicity and the B(max) for 5-(Sx8)-F binding to es sites in cultured leukemia cells and in leukemic blasts from acute leukemia patients (r = .95) suggests that the flow cytometry assay of es capacity may be useful in predicting clinical response to araC.","['Gati, W P', 'Paterson, A R', 'Larratt, L M', 'Turner, A R', 'Belch, A R']","['Gati WP', 'Paterson AR', 'Larratt LM', 'Turner AR', 'Belch AR']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Alberta, and Cross Cancer Institute, Edmonton, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""130117-76-9 (5'-S-(2-aminoethyl)-N(6)-(4-nitrobenzyl)-5'-thioadenosine)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'TPY09G7XIR (Fluorescein)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives', 'Affinity Labels', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*toxicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescein', 'Fluoresceins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleosides/*metabolism', 'Thionucleosides', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):346-53.,,,1,['S0006-4971(20)55014-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the context of anti-BCR/ABL antisense strategies in chronic myeloid leukemia, we have reexamined the antiproliferative effect of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate ODNs on the leukemic cell line BV173 and on CD34+ bone marrow cells in liquid culture. The 3' sequences of the ODNs determine their effect. At concentrations of 10 micromol/L (for phosphorothioate ODNs) or 25 micromol/L (for phosphodiester ODNs), all the tested ODNs exert an antiproliferative activity, except those that contain a cytosine residue at either their two most terminal 3' positions. We show that this antiproliferative effect is due to the toxicity of the d-NMPs (5' monophosphate deoxyribonucleosides), the enzymatic hydrolysis products of the ODNs in culture medium. The toxicity of the d-NMPs on hematologic cells depends on their nature (d-CMP [2'deoxycytidine 5'-monophosphate] is not cytotoxic), on their concentration (d-GMP [2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-monophosphate], TMP [thymidine 5'-monophosphate], and d-AMP [2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate] are cytotoxic at concentrations between 5 and 10 micromol/L), and on the coincident presence of other d-NMPs in the culture medium (d-CMP neutralizes the toxicity of d-AMP, d-GMP, or TMP). The antiproliferative activity of ODNs is thus restricted to conditions where the 3' hydrolysis process by exonucleases generates significant amounts of d-NMPs with a low proportion of d-CMP. Our results reveal a novel example of a nonantisense effect of ODNs, which should be taken into account when performing any experiment using assumed antisense ODNs.","['Vaerman, J L', 'Moureau, P', 'Deldime, F', 'Lewalle, P', 'Lammineur, C', 'Morschhauser, F', 'Martiat, P']","['Vaerman JL', 'Moureau P', 'Deldime F', 'Lewalle P', 'Lammineur C', 'Morschhauser F', 'Martiat P']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire Hematologique, Cliniques St Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Clos Chapelle-aux-champs, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleotides/genetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):331-9.,,,1,['S0006-4971(20)55012-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From the normal allele, both RAR alpha1 and RAR alpha2 mRNAs were expressed in all APL cases (N = 24). From the translocated allele, RAR alpha1-PML mRNA was expressed in 77% and RAR alpha2-PML mRNA in 28% of cases (N = 98). RAR alpha2-PML mRNA was not observed in the absence of RAR alpha1-PML mRNA.

RAR alpha1-PML mRNAs and RAR alpha2-PML mRNAs from 5' PML breaksite cases coded for full-length RAR alpha-PML proteins but RAR alpha2-PML mRNAs from 3' PML breaksite cases encoded a truncated RAR alpha2 peptide.

Our analysis indicated that RAR alpha1/alpha2-PML mRNA expression markedly differs from normal RAR alpha1/alpha2 mRNA expression, that the difference in RAR alpha1-PML and RAR alpha2-PML mRNA expression frequency is primarily related to the genomic separation of the RAR alpha1 and RAR alpha2 coding exons, and that variations in RAR alpha1/alpha2-PML mRNA expression likely have no clinically relevant function in APL cells.","['Li, Y P', 'Andersen, J', 'Zelent, A', 'Rao, S', 'Paietta, E', 'Tallman, M S', 'Wiernik, P H', 'Gallagher, R E']","['Li YP', 'Andersen J', 'Zelent A', 'Rao S', 'Paietta E', 'Tallman MS', 'Wiernik PH', 'Gallagher RE']","['Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein Cancer Center, Bronx, NY 10467, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):306-12.,,"['CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",1,['S0006-4971(20)55009-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anesthetized rats were placed in a modified stereotaxic frame and then injected intrathecally, at the level of the cisterna magna, with human leukemic cells. Cerebrospinal fluid and tissue samples from brain, spinal cord, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, bone marrow, and cervical lymph nodes were subjected to histopathologic examination and molecular genetic screening by clonotype primer-directed polymerase chain reaction (CPD-PCR). Ninety-three percent of animals (n = 14) developed signs of meningeal irritation leading to death 30 to 63 days postinjection (median, 36.0 days, mean, 38.7); death occurred between 30 and 39 days in 77% of all animals. Leukemic cells progressively infiltrated the pericerebellar and pericerebral subarachnoid space and infiltrated the Virchow-Robin (perivascular) space. The infiltrating meningeal leukemia closely resembled the pathologic presentation in the human condition. By CPD-PCR, leukemic cells were first detected in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on day 4 postinjection, were variably present over the ensuing 17 days, and were consistently detected after day 21. At terminal stages, CPD-PCR tissue surveys showed leukemic DNA in all brains and spinal cords and rarely in cervical lymph nodes, but leukemic DNA was not detected in any other tissue screened. Leukemic meningitis was reliably produced with a predictable survival time. Intrathecal administration of leukemic cells was an efficient means of transmitting leukemic meningitis and it compartmentalized the disease to the central nervous system (CNS), eliminating potential complications of systemic illness.

The metabolic salvage and DNA incorporation of the normal nucleoside, deoxycytidine, is functionally compartmentalized toward repair synthesis in a process regulated by ribonucleotide reductase. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic pathways by which nucleoside analogs that do (fludarabine, gemcitabine) or do not (ara-C) affect ribonucleotide reductase are incorporated into DNA in proliferating human leukemia cells. Using alkaline density-gradient centrifugation to separate repaired DNA from replicating DNA and unreplicated parental DNA strands, approximately 60% of ara-C nucleotide in DNA was incorporated by repair synthesis in CCRF-CEM cells; the remainder was incorporated by replication. In contrast, fludarabine and gemcitabine, nucleosides that inhibit ribonucleotide reductase and decreased deoxynucleotide pools, were incorporated mainly within replicating DNA. Hydroxyurea also depleted deoxynucleotide pools and increased the incorporation of ara-C into DNA by replicative synthesis. Stimulation of DNA repair activity by UV irradiation selectively enhanced the incorporation of all nucleosides tested through repair synthesis. These findings suggest that the pathways by which therapeutically useful nucleoside analogs are incorporated into DNA are affected by cellular dNTP pools from de novo synthesis and by the relative activities of DNA repair and replication. The antitumor activity of these drugs may be enhanced by combination with either ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors to increase their incorporation into replicating DNA or with agents that induce DNA damage and evoke the DNA repair process.","['Iwasaki, H', 'Huang, P', 'Keating, M J', 'Plunkett, W']","['Iwasaki H', 'Huang P', 'Keating MJ', 'Plunkett W']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', '*DNA Repair', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):270-8.,,['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],1,['S0006-4971(20)55005-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the potential therapeutic use of GM-CSF toxins, we fused human GM-CSF to truncated forms of either Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE) or diphtheria toxin (DT) and tested the cytotoxicity of the resulting GM-CSF-PE38KDEL and DT388-GM-CSF on human gastrointestinal (GI) carcinomas and leukemias. Toward gastric and colon cancer cell lines, GM-CSF-PE38KDEL was much more cytotoxic than DT388-GM-CSF, with IC50s (concentration resulting in 50% inhibition of protein synthesis) of 0.5 to 10 ng/mL compared with 4 to 400 ng/mL, respectively. In contrast, toward leukemia lines and fresh bone marrow cells DT388-GM-CSF was more cytotoxic than GM-CSF-PE38KDEL. The cytotoxicity of both GM-CSF-PE38KDEL and DT388-GM-CSF toward the human cells was specific, because it could be competed by an excess of GM-CSF. Binding studies indicated that human GM-CSF receptors were present on all of the human GI and leukemic cell lines tested, at levels of 540 to 3,700 sites per cell (kd = 0.2 to 2 nmol/L), and the number of sites per cell did not correlate with the cell type. A similar pattern of cytotoxicity was found with recombinant immunotoxins binding to the transferrin receptor, in that anti-TFR(Fv)-PE38KDEL was much more cytotoxic than DT388-anti-TFR(Fv) toward GI cells, but both were similar in their cytotoxic activity toward leukemia cells. The fact that PE is more effective than DT in killing GI but not leukemic tumor cells targeted by GM-CSF indicates a fundamental difference in the way PE or DT gains access to the cytosol in these cells. GM-CSF-PE38KDEL and DT388-GM-CSF deserve further evaluation as possible treatments for selected tumors.","['Kreitman, R J', 'Pastan, I']","['Kreitman RJ', 'Pastan I']","['Division of Cancer Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Exotoxins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Death/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*toxicity', 'Exotoxins/*toxicity', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Pseudomonas', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*toxicity', 'Recombinant Proteins/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):252-9.,,,1,['S0006-4971(20)55003-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD23 is released from the surface of cells as soluble fragments, and a 25-kD species of soluble CD23 (sCD23) appears to act as a multifunctional cytokine. In this report, sCD23 is shown to sustain the growth of low cell density cultures of a human pre-B-acute lymphocytic leukemia cell line, SMS-SB: no other cytokine tested was able to induce this effect. Flow cytometric analysis indicates that sCD23 acts to prevent apoptosis of SMS-SB cells. SMS-SB cells cultured at low cell density possess low levels of bcl-2 protein. Addition of sCD23 to cells at low cell density maintained bcl-2 expression at levels equivalent to those observed in SMS-SB cells cultured at higher cell densities. No CD23 mRNA was found in SMS-SB cells, ruling out an autocrine function for CD23 in this cell line model. Although SMS-SB cells do not express the known receptors for CD23, namely CD21, CD11b-CD18, or CD11c-CD18, the cells specifically bind CD23-containing liposomes, but not glycophorin-containing liposomes. Binding of CD23-containing liposomes is inhibited by anti-CD23 but not by anti-CD21 or anti-CD11b/c monoclonal antibodies.

Human OSM (hOSM) and LIF share a functional high-affinity receptor that is composed of gp130 and LIF receptor beta subunit (LIFRbeta). A second high-affinity receptor for hOSM was recently found to be formed by gp130 and the hOSM receptor beta subunit. However, the nature of murine OSM (mOSM) and its receptors has remained unknown. Using the recently cloned mOSM cDNA, we produced recombinant mOSM and studied its biological activity and receptor structure. Murine hematopoietic cell lines M1 and DA1.a, an embryonic stem cell line CCE, and Ba/F3 transfectants expressing gp130 and LIFRbeta responded to murine LIF (mLIF) and hOSM equally well, while these cells responded to mOSM only at a 30-fold to 100-fold higher concentration than those of mLIF and hOSM. In contrast, NIH3T3 cells responded to mOSM, but not to mLIF and hOSM. Scatchard plot analyses showed that mOSM bound to gp130 with low-affinity (kd = 2.8 to 4.2 nmol/L) and that the binding affinity did not increase in the presence of LIFRbeta. However, mOSM bound to NIH3T3 cells with high-affinity (kd = 660 pmol/L), whereas mLIF did not bind to NIH3T3 cells at all. These results indicate that unlike hOSM, mOSM and mLIF do not share the same functional receptor, and mOSM delivers signals only through its specific receptor complex. Further studies in mice will define the physiological roles of OSM.","['Ichihara, M', 'Hara, T', 'Kim, H', 'Murate, T', 'Miyajima, A']","['Ichihara M', 'Hara T', 'Kim H', 'Murate T', 'Miyajima A']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):165-73.,,,1,['S0006-4971(20)54993-8 [pii]'],,,,,,['Blood 1997 Sep 1;90(5):2120'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have performed an analysis of the clinical effects of specific mutations in the FAC gene. Using the amplification refractory mutation system assays that we developed to rapidly detect FAC mutations, at least one mutated copy of the FAC gene was identified in 59 FA patients from the International Fanconi Anemia Registry (IFAR). This represents 15% of the 397 FA patients tested. FA-C patients were divided into three subgroups based on results of a genotype-phenotype analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model: (1) patients with the IVS4 mutation (n = 26); (2) patients with at least one exon 14 mutation (R548X or L554P) (n = 16); and (3) patients with at least one exon 1 mutation (322delG or Q13X) and no known exon 14 mutation (n = 17). Kaplan-Meier analysis shows that IVS4 or exon 14 mutations define poor risk subgroups, as they are associated with significantly earlier onset of hematologic abnormalities and poorer survival compared to exon 1 patients and to the non-FA-C IFAR population. There was no direct correlation between the degree of cellular hypersensitivity to the clastogenic effect of diepoxybutane and severity of clinical phenotype. Sixteen of the 59 FA-C patients (27%) have developed acute myelogenous leukemia. Thirteen of these patients have died; AML was the cause of death in 46% of the expired FA-C patients.

Conversely, the ability of normal LTC-IC to expand their numbers was shown to be independent of the presence of Ph+LTC-IC and later types of Ph+colony-forming cell (CFC) progenitors. In contrast to the LTC-IC, CFC were consistently amplified in cultures initiated with CML-derived CD34+CD38- cells and the additional CFC present after 10 days were, like the starting population of CFC, almost exclusively Ph+ regardless of the genotype(s) of the LTC-IC in the original CML samples. Amplification of the Ph+CFC population in these cultures showed the same factor dependence as previously demonstrated for the in vitro expansion of CFC from normal marrow CD34+CD38- cells. Ph+LTC-IC disappeared regardless of the cytokines present. Taken together these findings support a model of CML in which the leukemic stem cells are characterized by a decreased probability of self-renewal and an increased probability of differentiation.

My+ patients in both BL and TL groups were more likely than My- patients to have favorable presenting features.

We show the expression of FasL on the surface of neoplastic plasma cells. We provide evidence that the FasL is functionally active because five of five neoplastic plasma cell lines tested killed CEM-C7H2 T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells. The effect was mediated via the Fas (Apo-1/CD95) receptor molecule because blocking of Fas on the target cells or the FasL on the tumor cells by receptor- and ligand-specific monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), respectively, protected T cells from being killed by myeloma cells. In addition, overexpression of the cowpox virus protein CrmA, a molecule with inhibitory potential on caspase-1 and caspase-8, specifically involved in Fas-induced signaling, protected T cells from being destroyed by the neoplastic cells or the agonistic anti-Fas MoAb. The potential of the malignant plasma cells to extinguish target T cells was independent of their own sensitivity to the agonistic anti-Fas MoAb, and FasL-positive (FasL+) CEM-C7H2 T cells were incapable of killing myeloma cells. Our results suggest that tumor cell-induced suppression of the immune system may be exerted via the FasL active on malignant plasma cells. Furthermore, loss of Fas expression or insensitivity to the agonistic anti-Fas MoAb do not seem to be prerequisites for myeloma cells to defeat T cells via Fas/FasL interaction.","['Villunger, A', 'Egle, A', 'Marschitz, I', 'Kos, M', 'Bock, G', 'Ludwig, H', 'Geley, S', 'Kofler, R', 'Greil, R']","['Villunger A', 'Egle A', 'Marschitz I', 'Kos M', 'Bock G', 'Ludwig H', 'Geley S', 'Kofler R', 'Greil R']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Surveillance', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Escape', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/immunology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jul 1;90(1):12-20.,,,1,['S0006-4971(20)54975-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta inhibited B-cell proliferation in the majority of patients (15/21) but no inhibition was detected in 6/21 patients whatever the type of stimulant used. Addition of neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta increased spontaneous and cytokine-induced proliferation; this effect was dose dependent and specific because addition of an irrelevant chicken IgG had no effect on B-CLL proliferation. In resistant patients, neutralizing antibodies to TGF-beta did not increase the proliferation. The expression of TGF-beta receptors on B-CLL cells was significantly lower than the one observed on normal CD5+ B lymphocytes for which the sensitivity to TGF-beta inhibition was more marked than in CLL. In addition, we found a strong correlation between the response of leukaemic B cells to TGF-beta inhibitory action and the expression of TGF-beta receptors on these cells. In summary, TGF-beta appears to function in CLL as a negative regulator of B lymphocytes but loss of responsiveness to this factor accompanied by a decrease of TGF-beta receptor expression, might provide a selective advantage to B-CLL lymphocytes.","['Lagneaux, L', 'Delforge, A', 'Bron, D', 'Massy, M', 'Bernier, M', 'Stryckmans, P']","['Lagneaux L', 'Delforge A', 'Bron D', 'Massy M', 'Bernier M', 'Stryckmans P']","[""Service de Medecine Interne et Laboratoire d'Investigation Clinique Henri Tagnon, Institut J.

The Medical Research Council's Working Party on Childhood Leukaemia.,603-6,"At the commencement of UKALL XI, a national MRC trial for childhood lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), the therapy included a bolus of daunorubicin (DR) on the first 2 d of the protocol. This component of treatment was subsequently withdrawn because of concern about long-term cardiotoxicity. All children both before and after this change of policy had their marrow status at the end of the first week assessed by central review as part of the trial to examine the clinical importance of the rate of disease clearance. This also afforded an opportunity to observe the effect of DR on gross residual disease at an early stage of therapy. 1419 children were studied: 342 received DR ('recipients'), 1077 did not. 44% of the recipients completely cleared their marrow of blast cells after 8 d compared with 13% of the non-recipients (chi2 = 158.2, P < 0.0001). The difference in the proportion with massive residual disease (>80% blasts) was less impressive but there was still a difference in favour of DR recipients (DR 9%, no DR 15%; chi2 = 7.7, P = 0.006). The rate of disease clearance correlated with disease-free survival for both recipients and non-recipients, but there was no significant difference in outcome when comparing the two groups with each other, either in terms of disease-free or relapse-free survival. DR accelerated the rate of blast cell disappearance from the marrow but the difference this made to disease free survival is small or non-existent. It appears to be the relative speed of response to a given therapeutic regimen that is prognostically important rather than the absolute rate of response when comparing one treatment with another.","['Lilleyman, J S', 'Gibson, B E', 'Stevens, R F', 'Will, A M', 'Hann, I M', 'Richards, S M', 'Hill, F G']","['Lilleyman JS', 'Gibson BE', 'Stevens RF', 'Will AM', 'Hann IM', 'Richards SM', 'Hill FG']","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jun;97(3):603-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1002914.x.,,,3,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.1002914.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 50% of these patients were included in the EORTC cooperative clinical trials, thus confirming the important selection bias in most of the published series on elderly ALL patients. 43% of the elderly patients achieved a complete remission (CR). The median survival was 10 months and the 5-year overall survival was only 7.6 +/- 4%. In multivariate analysis, W.H.O. performance status and peripheral blast counts at day 7 were found to significantly influence achievement of CR and survival. In patients with W.H.O. performance status > or = 2, 35% died during induction treatment versus 4% in patients with W.H.O. performance status < 2.

We evaluated the effects of thrombopoietin on platelet activation using platelet-rich plasma from 16 patients with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD group) and 16 healthy volunteers (control group). Preincubation with thrombopoietin significantly enhanced platelet aggregation stimulated by ADP, collagen, or epinephrine in the MPD group as well as the control group. However, aggregation induced by 3 micro ADP or 16 microM epinephrine showed significantly less augmentation by thrombopoietin in the MPD group than in the control group. Thrombopoietin significantly shortened the lag time between the addition of 3 microM ADP or 16 microM epinephrine and initiation of secondary aggregation and the lag time between addition of 2 microg/ml collagen and initiation of aggregation in both groups. When platelet-rich plasma was used without adjustment of the platelet count, thrombopoietin itself induced aggregation in two patients. Hypoaggregation after addition of 0.5 microg/ml collagen was observed in seven out of nine patients with normal thrombopoietin levels and only one of six patients with high levels (P = 0.04). Enhancement of 0.5 microg/ml collagen-induced aggregation by thrombopoietin was seen in five out of nine patients with normal thrombopoietin levels and none of the six patients with elevated levels (P = 0.04). These results indicate that platelet activation by certain agonists is enhanced by thrombopoietin in patients with these diseases as well as in normal controls and that the serum thrombopoietin level may regulate the function of circulating platelets in vivo.","['Usuki, K', 'Iki, S', 'Endo, M', 'Izutsu, K', 'Inoue, K', 'Nishimura, T', 'Urabe, A']","['Usuki K', 'Iki S', 'Endo M', 'Izutsu K', 'Inoue K', 'Nishimura T', 'Urabe A']","['Division of Haematology, Kanto Teishin Hospital, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)'],IM,"['Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Platelet Activation/*physiology', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood', 'Thrombopoietin/*physiology', 'Thrombosis/blood']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 Jun;97(3):530-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.802720.x.,,,3,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.802720.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When HL-60 cells undergo terminal myeloid differentiation in the presence of ATRA, the beta2 isoform appeared inside nuclei and was up-regulated until 72 hours of ATRA treatment. The beta3 isozyme was also increased until 72 hours and both isoforms lowered their intranuclear amount at 96 hours and following days of treatment. By contrast PLC gamma1 and gamma2 progressively increased in the nucleus during granulocytic differentiation even after 72 hours of treatment. Terminal differentiation was characterised by the expression of high levels of PLC gamma1 and gamma2 and by low levels of PLC beta2 and beta3 in the nucleus. PIP2 and PIP hydrolysis paralleled the prevalence of the beta or gamma subfamily, respectively. Moreover, at all the examined times no changes of PLCs in the whole cell were detectable, indicating a de novo nuclear translocation of the beta2 and an increased accumulation of beta3, gamma1, and gamma2 isoforms. Thus, the intranuclear presence, expression, and activity of PLC isozymes, which are modulated during differentiation of HL-60 cells, implicate a role for nuclear phosphoinositide signalling in the process of cell maturation. In particular the nuclear translocation of PLC beta2 candidates this PLC as a key enzyme in the granulocytic differentiative commitment of HL-60 cells.","['Bertagnolo, V', 'Marchisio, M', 'Capitani, S', 'Neri, L M']","['Bertagnolo V', 'Marchisio M', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","['Signal Transduction Unit/Laboratory of Cell Biology, Institute of Human Anatomy, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (PLCB2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (PLCB3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phospholipase C beta)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Phospholipase C beta', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*biosynthesis']",1997/06/27 00:00,1997/06/27 00:01,['1997/06/27 00:00'],"['1997/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Jun 27;235(3):831-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6893.,,,3,"['S0006-291X(97)96893-5 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6893 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL-1 is the human homologue of Drosophila trithorax which plays a critical role in maintaining proper spatial and temporal expression of the Antennapedia-bithorax homeotic genes determining the fruit fly's body pattern. Utilizing specific antibodies, we found that the ALL-1 protein distributes in cultured cells in a nuclear punctate pattern. Several chimeric ALL-1 proteins encoded by products of the chromosome translocations and expressed in transfected cells showed similar speckles. Dissection of the ALL-1 protein identified within its approximately 1,100 N-terminal residues three polypeptides directing nuclear localization and at least two main domains conferring distribution in dots. The latter spanned two short sequences conserved with TRITHORAX. Enforced nuclear expression of other domains of ALL-1, such as the PHD (zinc) fingers and the SET motif, resulted in uniform nonpunctate patterns. This indicates that positioning of the ALL-1 protein in subnuclear structures is mediated via interactions of ALL-1 N-terminal elements. We suggest that the speckles represent protein complexes which contain multiple copies of the ALL-1 protein and are positioned at ALL-1 target sites on the chromatin. Therefore, the role of the N-terminal portion of ALL-1 is to direct the protein to its target genes.","['Yano, T', 'Nakamura, T', 'Blechman, J', 'Sorio, C', 'Dang, C V', 'Geiger, B', 'Canaani, E']","['Yano T', 'Nakamura T', 'Blechman J', 'Sorio C', 'Dang CV', 'Geiger B', 'Canaani E']","['Kimmel Cancer Institute, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Nucleus/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/07/08 00:00,1997/07/08 00:01,['1997/07/08 00:00'],"['1997/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jul 8;94(14):7286-91. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.14.7286.,,"['P01 CA050507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50507/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",14,['10.1073/pnas.94.14.7286 [doi]'],,PMC23813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For (+) strand synthesis using a (-) strand DNA template linked to the tRNA primer, only the first 18 nt of tRNA are replicated to regenerate the primer binding site, creating the (+) strand strong stop DNA intermediate and providing a 3' terminus capable of strand transfer and further elongation. On model HIV templates that approximate the (-) strand linked to natural modified or synthetic unmodified tRNA3Lys, we find that a (+) strand strong stop intermediate of the proper length is generated only on templates containing the natural, modified tRNA3Lys, suggesting that a posttranscriptional modification provides the termination signal. In the presence of a recipient template, synthesis after strand transfer occurs only from intermediates generated from templates containing modified tRNA3Lys. Reverse transcriptase from Moloney murine leukemia virus and avian myoblastosis virus shows the same requirement for a modified tRNA3Lys template. Because all retroviral tRNA primers contain the same 1-methyl-A58 modification, our results suggest that 1-methyl-A58 is generally required for termination of replication 18 nt into the tRNA sequence, generating the (+) strand intermediate, strand transfer, and subsequent synthesis of the entire (+) strand. The possibility that the host methyl transferase responsible for methylating A58 may provide a target for HIV chemotherapy is discussed.","['Burnett, B P', 'McHenry, C S']","['Burnett BP', 'McHenry CS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Genetics and Molecular Biology Program, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, 4200 East 9th Avenue, B121, Denver, CO 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'RNA/*genetics', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1997/07/08 00:00,1997/07/08 00:01,['1997/07/08 00:00'],"['1997/07/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jul 8;94(14):7210-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.14.7210.,,"['F32 AI009171/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1F32 AI09171/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5 RO1 AI26600/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",14,['10.1073/pnas.94.14.7210 [doi]'],,PMC23794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through the use of monoclonal antibodies and the introduction both in research and routine diagnostic practice of multiparameter analysis techniques, it is now possible to correlate several cellular parameters, to identify clonality of malignant cells as well as their lineage assignment and maturation stage.

To date, however, the most favorable time point for high-dose chemotherapy has not yet been definitively established-not has the patient group most likely to benefit or the most effective combination of cytostatics to be used. For this reason, such treatment, even of these diseases, should not be applied outside of controlled studies, and must be viewed even more critically in the case of other diseases for which data from randomized studies are not yet available. Despite a relatively low overall level of toxicity, peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) still has a mortality rate--even in large centers--of 2 to 5%.

These elements transpose in a replicative manner via an RNA intermediate and its reverse transcription, and their transposition should therefore be tightly controlled by their transcription level. The in vivo pattern of expression of these potentially mutagenic elements had previously been analysed in normal mice, and we have now investigated their expression in transgenic mice carrying different oncogenes (e.g. c-myc, v-Ha-ras, SV40 T-antigen) under tissue-specific promoters and disclosing tumors within the brain, the mammary or salivary glands, or the lymphoid organs. Northern blot analysis of IAP expression within the resulting tumors demonstrates a lack of significant and/or systematic effect of v-Ha-ras and SV40 T-antigen expression, but a systematic IAP induction in the myc-induced tumors. In this case, however, analysis of double transgenic mice obtained by crossing the tumor-prone mice with previously described transgenic mice carrying IAP reporter genes did not provide any evidence for induction of the IAP transgenes, therefore strongly suggesting that c-myc expression had an effect on only a limited number of IAP sequences--most probably depending on their position and/or methylation state. These results strengthen the importance of in vivo studies for a correct appraisal of complex biological processes, and moderate previous conclusions derived from in vitro analyses on the general activation of IAPs by oncogenes and on the role of these transposable elements in tumorigenesis.","['Dupressoir, A', 'Heidmann, T']","['Dupressoir A', 'Heidmann T']","['Unite de Physicochimie et Pharmacologie des Macromolecules Biologiques, CNRS URA147, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Retroelements)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Genes, myc', 'Genes, ras', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics/*metabolism', '*Oncogenes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Retroelements']",1997/06/19 00:00,1997/06/19 00:01,['1997/06/19 00:00'],"['1997/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Jun 19;14(24):2951-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201148.,,,24,['10.1038/sj.onc.1201148 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two variants, HL-205 and HL-525, are equally susceptible to differentiation to the granulocyte lineage by exposure to DMSO, but only HL-205 cells acquire the macrophage phenotype following exposure to phorbol esters. The kinetics of 2-5A synthetase activity was established in both variants exposed to either DMSO or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. With DMSO treatment, 2-5A synthetase activity was markedly induced in both variants, although with slightly different kinetics. With phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment, 2-5A enzymatic activity increased only in HL-205; no activity was detected up to 96 h after treatment in HL-525. The induction of 2-5A synthetase activity is apparently alpha/beta-IFN dependent, because only antibodies directed against a mixture of alpha- and beta-IFN completely abolished the increase in activity detected during differentiation of HL-205 cells. To directly establish the role of 2-5A synthetase in differentiation, HL-205 cells were transfected with an expression vector harboring the cDNA for the 43-kDa isoform of murine 2-5A synthetase fused to the inducible metallothionein promoter. Two clones, clone 6, which yielded a low level of 2-5A synthetase activity in response to ZnCl2 (which activates the promoter), and clone 7, which was a high responder, were further analyzed and compared with the control clone, neo. Reductions in the rates of cell growth and thymidine incorporation were observed with both clone 6 and clone 7 cells exposed to ZnCl2; clone 7 was more responsive. In addition, the level of c-myc-specific RNA transcript was greatly reduced in ZnCl2 or beta-IFN-treated clone 7 cells, whereas the neo cells responded similarly only after beta-IFN treatment. Treatment of clone-neo cells with beta-IFN resulted in conversion of pRb protein from the phosphorylated to the underphosphorylated form within 24 h; ZnCl2 had no effect, even after 72 h. In contrast, the accumulation of the underphosphorylated form of pRb was observed in clone 7 cells treated either with beta-IFN or ZnCl2. Finally, a significant increase in nitro blue tetrazolium-positive cells, an indication of differentiation, was evident with ZnCl2-treated clone 6 and clone 7 cells; no such increase was observed with clone-neo cells under similar conditions. We conclude that ectopic expression of 2-5A synthetase in HL-205 cells results in cell growth arrest and facilitates the appearance of a myeloid differentiation marker.","['Salzberg, S', 'Hyman, T', 'Turm, H', 'Kinar, Y', 'Schwartz, Y', 'Nir, U', 'Lejbkowicz, F', 'Huberman, E']","['Salzberg S', 'Hyman T', 'Turm H', 'Kinar Y', 'Schwartz Y', 'Nir U', 'Lejbkowicz F', 'Huberman E']","['Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Zinc Compounds)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '86Q357L16B (zinc chloride)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)"", 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*metabolism"", 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-beta/immunology/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Macrophages/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Compounds/pharmacology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jul 1;57(13):2732-40.,,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This complex is mainly composed by the D(b) molecule interacting with a Rauscher virus antigen (Ag) determinant and the Vbeta5+ T cell receptor.

The data strongly support the hypothesis that the high immunogenicity of virus-induced or infected tumors is determined by the expression of immunodominant virus-encoded Ag.

Assessment of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and function by means of immunocytochemistry, DNR accumulation, and modulation of resistance and accumulation by the P-gp inhibitor cyclosporin A (CsA) were selected as parameters for multidrug resistance (MDR). On the other hand, we used the MTT assay and measured apoptosis and proliferative activity (S- and G2M-phases of the cell cycle) by flow cytometry. Validation of test methods was achieved for four leukemic cell lines (HL-60, KG-1a, K562/WT, K562/ADM). This battery of tests was then applied to mononuclear cells (MNC) from 18 leukemic patients. Low proficiency of MNC to undergo apoptosis and low proliferative activity rather than P-gp-mediated MDR correlated with DNR resistance as measured by the MTT assay. Bell-shaped dose-response curves for apoptosis, however, which reflect a switch from the apoptotic to the necrotic death mode with increasing cellular damage tend to limit practicability in clinical testing, because appropriate dose range and time points need to be explored. Thus, measurement of apoptosis by flow cytometry may be less convenient than the MTT assay for determination of chemosensitivity, if clinical samples with unknown patterns of responsiveness are to be tested. Spontaneous apoptosis in untreated MNC following 24 h incubation in vitro correlated significantly with DNR sensitivity in the MTT assay. A lack of essential viability factors (eg growth factors or cytokines) in vitro which are known to prevent apoptosis may contribute to DNR sensitivity.","['Efferth, T', 'Fabry, U', 'Osieka, R']","['Efferth T', 'Fabry U', 'Osieka R']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, der RWTH Aachen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Thiazoles/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1180-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400669.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400669 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, although different molecular targets for anthracyclines such as DNA, cell membranes, or enzymes like topoisomerases could be involved, mechanisms by which these compounds exert their cytotoxic and differentiating effects remain unclear. Studies of correlation between the biological effects of anthracyclines and drug uptake have given conflicting conclusions. For example, a decrease in drug cytotoxicity for different incubation temperatures has been observed in spite of the same intracellular anthracycline amount, suggesting that temperature-dependent cytotoxic effects may be mediated by drug interaction with the cell membrane. What we propose in this review are results of our laboratory which are in agreement with an action mechanism targeted to the nucleus. In fact, we have shown by using microspectrofluorometry, that identical nuclear anthracycline concentration induces the same degree of cytotoxicity, independent of cellular MDR phenotype and the anthracycline structure. Thus, we could acquire information on the mechanisms of drug resistance related to drug transport. We could also give evidence that this accumulation is increased when MDR modulators, such as verapamil and S9788 and cyclosporin A or anthracyclines are used. For clinical applications, our studies have already dealt with nuclear concentration measurements of doxorubicin in leukocytes of treated patients, and in vitro measurements of drug efflux from nuclei of acute leukemic cells and its correlation with P-glycoprotein expression. However, in these studies, there was no correlation between anthracycline nuclear accumulation in vitro and P-glycoprotein expression. In addition, from preliminary results, we have shown that some modulators such as quinine do not significantly increase nuclear accumulation of anthracyclines in MDR cells but are able to restore anthracycline sensitivity. Other authors have recently shown that quinine has a relatively weak effect on cellular doxorubicin accumulation in MDR cells but is able to completely restore doxorubicin sensitivity. They concluded that quinine has essentially intracellular targets involved in drug distribution (cytoplasm --> nucleus) from sequestration compartments. Our data contradict this and we believe that such modulator modifies the molecular environment of anthracyclines and/or their binding to a possible cytoplasmic target leading to different cell death. Thus, we conclude that mechanisms by which anthracyclines induce cell death, and ways by which chemotherapy fails in resistant cells remain complex and are related to more than one target.","['Morjani, H', 'Millot, J M', 'Belhoussine, R', 'Sebille, S', 'Manfait, M']","['Morjani H', 'Millot JM', 'Belhoussine R', 'Sebille S', 'Manfait M']","['Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, UFR de Pharmacie, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1170-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400668.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400668 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies using human myeloma cell lines have shown that the MDR1 gene product, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), is responsible for conferring drug resistance to natural products and glucocorticoids. We have developed assays to measure the expression of MDR1/Pgp in human myeloma specimens. These assays include immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and RT/PCR.

In the present report we find that 3H-octylpyridinium, the simple aromatic cation which has been shown to be preferentially toxic to MDR- as compared to MDR+ cells, accumulates 4.7-fold greater in the MDR- cell line. In contrast, we find that 3H-guanidinium which displays no selective toxicity between MDR+ and MDR- cells, shows no significant uptake differences between these two cell types. We also present data which demonstrate that other organic cations which contain aromatic rings, a minimal degree of lipophilicity (log P> -1) and carry a delocalized (Rho 123) or shielded (triphenylmethyl phosphonium) positive charge, also accumulate to a greater degree in MDR- vs MDR+ cells. Additionally, we find that human cells which express p-gp MDR, have similar requirements for recognition of these simple compounds. In fact, the sensitivity profiles of these compounds closely correlate between murine and human cell lines. It was also found that none of the series of simple organic compounds tested showed modulatory activity in MDR+ cells, as assayed by monitoring retention of Rho 123. Thus, the requirements for MDR recognition vs those for MDR modulation are clearly distinguished with these simple structured compounds. In comparison, the calcium channel antagonist, verapamil, and a calcium channel agonist, Bay K 8644, both showed modulatory activity by increasing Rho 123 retention in MDR+ cells, further supporting the interpretation that verapamil's modulation of MDR is unrelated to its action on calcium flux. Overall, the data presented here add further information for defining the structural requirements of compounds for their recognition by, or modulation of, human cells expressing p-gp-mediated MDR.","['Lampidis, T J', 'Shi, Y F', 'Calderon, C L', 'Kolonias, D', 'Tapiero, H', 'Savaraj, N']","['Lampidis TJ', 'Shi YF', 'Calderon CL', 'Kolonias D', 'Tapiero H', 'Savaraj N']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Miami, School of Medicine, FL 33101, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '71145-03-4 (3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid,', '1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'JU58VJ6Y3B (Guanidine)']",IM,"['3-Pyridinecarboxylic acid, 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-5-nitro-4-(2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-, Methyl ester/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Guanidine', 'Guanidines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pyridinium Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1156-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400700.,,['CA 37109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400700 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim of improving the sensitivity of such analysis, we have evaluated JC-1, a fluorescent lipophilic carbocyanine dye. Above a critical concentration, JC-1 aggregates in a 'liquid crystal' form. Aggregates display a specific red emission band centered at 597 nm whereas the monomers display a green emission band centered at 540 nm. JC-1 was avidly accumulated in sensitive K562 cells where it displayed both a green cytoplasmic and red mitochondrial fluorescence. In contrast, JC-1 was poorly accumulated in resistant K562 cells, which displayed only a slight green fluorescence. The level of JC-1 accumulation was correlated with the level of Pgp expression detected by MRK16 and UIC2 antibodies on a set of K562 subclones with increasing resistance levels. The specific fluorescence properties of JC-1 allow accurate discrimination between low-level resistant cells and sensitive cells.

The accumulation of certain substrates is concentration dependent and the parameters which determine probe accumulation are impacted by the level of P-glycoprotein expression. In addition, higher concentrations of reversal agents are required to inhibit multidrug resistance in cell lines expressing higher levels of P-glycoprotein. Furthermore, the concentration of reversal agents required to inhibit completely P-glycoprotein transport activity is higher than generally recognized. Thus, the level of P-glycoprotein expression may confound intersample comparisons unless sensitive probes are used in combination with saturating concentrations of potent reversal agents.

The data are presented in subdivisions based on the techniques used, which will facilitate finding specific information. Based on our extensive experience with Pgp analysis, which includes radioactive assays, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, we recommend a flow cytometry-based assay, that measures the effect of 2 microM PSC 833 on rhodamine 123 (R123) accumulation as the most practical and sensitive functional Pgp test. In combination with the flow cytometric measurement of Pgp using an antibody against an extracellular epitope (eg MRK16), this offers a sensitive and reproducible method for Pgp detection in AML, which is also rapid and practical. Furthermore, an R123 accumulation assay is specific for Pgp, because R123 is transported much less efficiently by the multidrug resistance protein (MRP) than by Pgp. Another probe of similar sensitivity and specificity is 3,3'-diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide. Alternatively, especially for the analysis of small numbers of cells (for example sorted subpopulations of leukemic cells), convenient and sensitive procedures are being developed by using DNA-binding Pgp substrates which remain fixed in the nuclei of the cells upon formaldehyde exposure for quantitative fluorescence laser scanning microscopy with image analysis. Less experimental data have been published to establish the optimal conditions for dual parameter flow cytometry (Pgp function, in eg Pgp+ or CD34+ cells). However, laboratories with flow cytometry experience will be able to implement this useful option to analyze subpopulations of cells.","['Broxterman, H J', 'Lankelma, J', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Eekman, C A', 'Wahrer, D C', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Broxterman HJ', 'Lankelma J', 'Pinedo HM', 'Eekman CA', 'Wahrer DC', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis/*physiology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1110-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400685.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400685 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

French Network of the Drug Resistance Intergroup, and Drug Resistance Network of Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris.",1086-94,"The wide discrepancies in the frequency of 'positive' samples for multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype within the same type of tumor observed in the literature justified the need for the definition of consensus recommendations. To define standard techniques of MDR phenotype measurement, we ran a large multicentric evaluation of the different methods available. Thirty-six French centers participated in the study, and 742 samples of 2-10 x 10(6) viable cells were sent by overnight express mail between December 1993 and February 1996. The same batches of MRK16, 4E3 and UIC2 were used. Nineteen samples of leukemia (12 AML, 1 ALL, 6 lymphoproliferative syndromes) and six leukemic cell lines with different levels of MDR expression were tested. Five meetings reached agreement concerning the guidelines for each technique, except immunocytochemistry. The 19 fresh samples were tested by each center using one to four techniques among cytofluorometry, immunocytochemistry, functional tests and RT-PCR. Five samples were diagnosed as 'negative' according to local criteria, with few discordant results (0 to 16% of 'positive' results). For all the 14 remaining samples, large discrepancies were observed from center to center, and from one technique to another. No correlations could be found between techniques. Flow cytometric analysis of cells already exposed to MRK16 or control IgG2A, fixed in paraformaldehyde and sent to centers did not reduce the discrepancies between centers in two of the four samples with moderate expression, emphasizing the role of histogram interpretation. The use of alternative monoclonal antibodies (4E3 and UIC2) did not reduce the discrepancies observed. In a second step, the K562 parental cell line, a low resistant subline (K562/HHT100, x7 resistance index to DNR) and a high resistant subline (K562/HHT300, x125 resistance index to DNR) were sent blindly three times, with an increasing level of recommendations for flow cytometry. Dramatic improvements were observed in cytometric results when the result was expressed as the ratio of arithmetic mean of fluorescence of antibody (10 microg of MRK16)/arithmetic mean of fluorescence of control (10 microg IgG2A): the proportion of expected results increased from 61 to 100% for K562, and from 37 to 85% for K562/HHT100. For uptake and drug efflux measurements, the use of 1 h uptake of 0.1 microM of rhodamine, followed by 1 h efflux +/-10 microM of verapamil, permitted an increased reproducibility of the technique from 71 to 100% for K562 and K562/HHT100. Whatever the technique used, concordant results were obtained for K562/HHT300. The immunocytochemistry, using several antibodies (MRK16, JSB1 and C219) gave many non-interpretable results (44%), due to a frequent high background and discordant results between antibodies in the same centers, and discordant conclusions between centers. The group does not recommend this technique for circulating tumoral cells.","['Marie, J P', 'Huet, S', 'Faussat, A M', 'Perrot, J Y', 'Chevillard, S', 'Barbu, V', 'Bayle, C', 'Boutonnat, J', 'Calvo, F', 'Campos-Guyotat, L', 'Colosetti, P', 'Cazin, J L', 'de Cremoux, P', 'Delvincourt, C', 'Demur, C', 'Drenou, B', 'Fenneteau, O', 'Feuillard, J', 'Garnier-Suillerot, A', 'Genne, P', 'Gorisse, M C', 'Gosselin, P', 'Jouault, H', 'Lacave, R', 'Robert, J']","['Marie JP', 'Huet S', 'Faussat AM', 'Perrot JY', 'Chevillard S', 'Barbu V', 'Bayle C', 'Boutonnat J', 'Calvo F', 'Campos-Guyotat L', 'Colosetti P', 'Cazin JL', 'de Cremoux P', 'Delvincourt C', 'Demur C', 'Drenou B', 'Fenneteau O', 'Feuillard J', 'Garnier-Suillerot A', 'Genne P', 'Gorisse MC', 'Gosselin P', 'Jouault H', 'Lacave R', 'Robert J', 'et al.']","[""Service d'Hematologie biologique, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/analysis', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1086-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400656.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400656 [doi]'],['Leukemia. 1998 Aug;12(8):1327-8.

Thirteen fixation methods were compared using six antibodies in both immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. The optimal fixation for P-gp (C219, MRK16), MRP (MRPr1) and LRP (LRP56) was a mixture of 2% (v/v) formaldehyde solution and acetone incubated for only 10 s at room temperature (FAc). For MRP recognized by MRPm6, the optimal fixation condition was acetone for 5 min at room temperature in immunocytochemistry, and methanol for 15 min at -20 degrees C in flow cytometry. P-gp staining by 4E3 was strongly antibody batch-dependent; on cytospins FAc fixation was optimal, but inconclusive data were obtained by flow cytometry. The optimized fixation conditions on fresh samples revealed a day-to-day variation in staining (both increasing and decreasing) in one third of the immunocytochemical tests. In flow cytometry the day-to-day variation in the fluorescence index was -1 +/- 22%. In both techniques, staining was comparable between fresh and cryopreserved cells.

In this study tumor cell P-170 expression was assessed in 29 patients suffering from acute leukemia (17 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 12 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)) using three different techniques: flow cytometry measuring rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux (functional level), immunocytochemistry (protein level) and RT-PCR (mRNA level). Rh123 efflux was detectable in 10/29 (34%) of all cases, in 9/17 (53%) of AML and in 1/12 (8%) of ALL samples. In AML patients a significant association of CD34 expression and P-170 activity was observed (P < 0.02). All AML patients with the FAB subtype M5 were Rh123 negative (P < 0.007). Cytospin preparations were analyzed for staining with monoclonal antibodies JSB1 and MM4.17. Eight of 16 (50%) AML and 0/9 (0%) ALL cases expressed the multidrug resistance (MDR) protein assessed by JSB1. With MM4.17 87% of AML and 50% of ALL patients were scored positive. Agreement between both antibodies was found in only 13/23 (57%) samples. Extracted RNA from 12 patients was analyzed by RT-PCR to evaluate the expression of MDR1 and multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) mRNA. An increased level of MDR1 mRNA was detectable in 4/7 AML and 0/5 ALL cases. MRP expression was found in 3/7 AML and 0/5 ALL patients. Comparison of Rh123 assay and immunocytochemistry revealed a very good correlation when using MoAb JSB1 (P < 0.004) but not with MM4.17 (not significant (NS)). JSB1 also showed a much better association with the PCR results (P < 0.05) than MM4.17 (NS). Finally, we compared the results of the functional Rh123 assay and RT-PCR and observed a high correlation for Rh123/MDR1 (r = 0.819, P < 0.001) but low for Rh123/MRP (r = 0.562, NS). We conclude that measurement of Rh123 efflux and immunocytochemical staining of cytospin preparations with JSB1 allows the accurate monitoring of P-170 expression in acute leukemia.

The assay is based on an IgH-PCR with an automated fluorescence-based strategy for PCR detection of IgH gene rearrangements. Third complementarity determining region (IgH-CDR3) sequences were amplified using fluorescent dye labeled consensus primers homologous to the corresponding variable (V[H]) and joining (J[H]) gene segments in combination with a thermostable proofreading DNA polymerase. PCR products were size separated on a high resolution polyacrylamide gel and analyzed for clonality by exact size determination and fluorescence quantification in an automated DNA sequencer. PCR findings obtained with the optimized IgH-CDR3-PCR assay showed an overall monoclonality detection rate of 97% (97 of 101 cases with B cell neoplasms). The specificity was 100% as determined by analysis of 50 controls, all of which gave polyclonal PCR results. We found a high rate of monoclonal IgH-CDR3-PCR results not only in the leukemias and diffuse lymphoma but also in the group of follicular lymphoma, where a high rate of false negative results is frequently reported in the literature. In summary, we identified monoclonal IgH-CDR3 junctions in 55 out of 59 cases (93%) with B cell lymphoma and in 42 of 42 (100%) cases with leukemia, immunocytoma and multiple myeloma. The results demonstrate that automated fluorescence detection of IgH-CDR3-PCR products is an ideal tool for detection of clonal and polyclonal lymphoid B cells. In combination with allele-specific primers the procedure may improve current experimental approaches to detect occult malginant B cells during initial staging and follow-up of NHL and ALL patients.","['Linke, B', 'Bolz, I', 'Fayyazi, A', 'von Hofen, M', 'Pott, C', 'Bertram, J', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Kneba, M']","['Linke B', 'Bolz I', 'Fayyazi A', 'von Hofen M', 'Pott C', 'Bertram J', 'Hiddemann W', 'Kneba M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Georg-August University, Goettingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1055-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400736.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400736 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, large numbers of cells are required for successful engraftment in preirradiated mice due to residual graft resistance, that may be mediated by cells from the mononuclear phagocytic system. Intravenous (i.v.) injection of liposomes containing dichloromethylene diphosphonate (Cl2MDP) may eliminate mouse macrophages in spleen and liver. In this study outgrowth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells in SCID mice conditioned with a single i.v. injection of Cl2MDP liposomes in addition to sublethal total body irradiation (TBI) was compared to outgrowth of these cells in SCID mice that had received TBI alone. A two- to 10-fold increase in outgrowth of AML cells was observed in four cases of AML. Administration of 10(7) UCB cells reproducibly engrafted SCID mice that had been conditioned with Cl2MDP liposomes and TBI, whereas human cells were not detected in mice conditioned with TBI alone. As few as 2 x 10(4) purified CD34+ UCB cells engrafted in all mice treated with Cl2MDP liposomes. In SCID mice treated with macrophage depletion unexpected graft failures were not observed. Histological examination of the spleen showed that TBI and Cl2MDP liposomes i.v. resulted in a transient elimination of all macrophage subsets in the spleen, whereas TBI had a minor effect. Cl2MDP liposomes were easy to use and their application was not associated with appreciable side-effects. Cl2MDP liposome pretreatment in combination with TBI allows for reproducible outgrowth of high numbers of human hematopoietic cells in SCID mice.","['Terpstra, W', 'Leenen, P J', 'van den Bos, C', 'Prins, A', 'Loenen, W A', 'Verstegen, M M', 'van Wyngaardt, S', 'van Rooijen, N', 'Wognum, A W', 'Wagemaker, G', 'Wielenga, J J', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Terpstra W', 'Leenen PJ', 'van den Bos C', 'Prins A', 'Loenen WA', 'Verstegen MM', 'van Wyngaardt S', 'van Rooijen N', 'Wognum AW', 'Wagemaker G', 'Wielenga JJ', 'Lowenberg B']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0813BZ6866 (Clodronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Clodronic Acid/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Liposomes', 'Macrophages/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1049-54. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400694.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400694 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to look for aneuploidy in the two main B cell components of the peripheral blood: PBPC and CD20-positive B lymphocytes. Conventional cytogenetics (CC) or DNA content analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromeric probes were performed on bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) of 21 patients with multiple myeloma and peripheral blood cells were studied as follows: immunostaining to look for PBPC and to assess their number, image analysis cytometry for the determination of their DNA content, and FISH chromosomes analysis. FISH was performed using probes against the chromsomes that were lost or gained in BMPC and was coupled with immunostaining of the relevant light chain or CD20 antigen to study PBPC or B lymphocytes, respectively. Monotypic PBPC were found in 16 patients. Their DNA content was the same or nearly the same as for BMPC and they exhibited the same monosomies or trisomies as those found within their BM counterpart. By contrast, DNA content of mononuclear cells other than PBPC was within normal ranges, and in 13 of 15 patients CD20-positive B lymphocytes failed to show chromosomal changes by FISH analysis. In two patients however, a few CD20+ cells with lymphoid morphology exhibited chromosome changes, hypothesizing that a few cytogenetically abnormal B cells without plasmocytic morphology may circulate. From these data, we conclude that PBPC share the same genetic abnormalities as BMPC and thus belong to the malignant clone, whereas most peripheral blood B lymphocytes are unrelated to the tumor clone.","['Zandecki, M', 'Bernardi, F', 'Genevieve, F', 'Lai, J L', 'Preudhomme, C', 'Flactif, M', 'Cosson, A', 'Bauters, F', 'Facon, T']","['Zandecki M', 'Bernardi F', 'Genevieve F', 'Lai JL', 'Preudhomme C', 'Flactif M', 'Cosson A', 'Bauters F', 'Facon T']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie A, Hopital Calmette, CHU, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood', 'Plasma Cells/*ultrastructure']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1034-9.,,,7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since thymomas induced by Mo-MuLV show recurring proviral integration near certain cellular proto-oncogenes, it was reasoned that if the pathogenesis of bcr-abl/M thymomas is affected by viral integration, then it may be possible to detect proviral insertion near common Mo-MuLV integration sites in bcr-abl-induced thymomas. A panel of thymomas induced by intrathymic injection of Mo-MuLV, Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV), or the bcr-abl/M virus was analyzed for proviral integration near c-myc, N-myc, Pim-1, and Mlvi-1 loci that are frequently occupied by provirus in Mo-MuLV-induced T cell lymphomas, and for integration near Ahi-1 that is often occupied in A-MuLV/M-induced pre-B cell lymphoma. As expected, thymomas induced with Mo-MuLV showed frequent rearrangements in these loci while thymomas induced with A-MuLV/M (which does not require Mo-MuLV) did not. The bcr-abl/M-induced tumors also showed recurring proviral integration near c-myc, Pim-1 and Mlvi-1, albeit at a lower frequency than seen in the Mo-MuLV tumors. Unexpectedly, four independent thymomas that were clearly of T cell origin demonstrated proviral integration within the Ahi-1 region which was previously thought to only occur in A-MuLV/M induced pre-B cell lymphoma. These observations suggest that recurring proviral insertion in c-myc, Pim-1, Mlvi-1, and Ahi-1 may provide a selective advantage for bcr-abl/M transformed T lymphoid cells. This model may provide a tool for identifying cellular genes that can cooperate with bcr-abl in lymphoid transformation.","['Clark, S S']",['Clark SS'],"['Department of Human Oncology and University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center, Madison 53792, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Thymoma/*virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*virology', '*Virus Integration']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1026-33. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400701.,,"['CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400701 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies revealed that following 96 h treatment, the vitamin D derivatives inhibited the proliferation, and induced the differentiation of U937 and HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by cell counts and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assays, respectively. EB1089 and KH1060 were found to be more effective than 1,25(OH)2D3 in exhibiting their antiproliferative and differentiative effects. In contrast, induction of leukaemic cell differentiation with 1 ng/ml GM-CSF after 96 h was less effective when compared with the vitamin D derivatives used individually. Fluorescence activated cell scanning (FACS) analyses indicated that the vitamin D derivatives readily induced the expression of the monocyte-associated cell surface antigen, CD14, and also the beta2-integrins, CD11b and CD18 in both cell lines after 48 h and 96 h treatment. The ability of EB1089 and KH1060 to induce these antigens was achieved with greater efficacy relative to the native hormone. When U937 and HL-60 cell cultures were cotreated for 48 h with the vitamin D compounds and GM-CSF and analysed by FACS, enhanced effects on CD14 and CD11b induction were observed compared to those of the compounds alone. These co-operative effects may occur as a consequence of molecular events which involve the transcription by vitamin D receptors (VDR) of genes required for the responsiveness of immature cells to factors such as GM-CSF, and place these and other related vitamin D analogues as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of leukaemia.","['James, S Y', 'Williams, M A', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Newland, A C', 'Colston, K W']","['James SY', 'Williams MA', 'Kelsey SM', 'Newland AC', 'Colston KW']","[""Division of Gastroenterology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, St George's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '131875-08-6 (KH 1060)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'Q0OZ0D9223 (seocalcitol)']",IM,"['CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1017-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400676.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400676 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A defined region of the cytoplasmic domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSF-R) transmits signals for maturation or differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. Mutations in this region have been found in some patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) who subsequently evolved to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To determine if mutations of the G-CSF-R are more widespread in hematological malignancies, we have investigated a total of 47 patients, including 29 patients with blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-BC) and 18 patients with de novo acute leukemia as well as 19 normal controls, by RT-PCR and SSCP analysis. Two point mutations were found in a single individual with secondary AML (FAB type M1). The first was heterozygous and is predicted to replace the normal glutamine at position 718 with a stop codon, leading to a truncated protein. An identical mutation has been described previously and shown to act in a dominant negative manner. The second mutation was homozygous and would substitute a lysine for the normal glutamic acid at position 785. No mutations were found in any other patient or control samples. We conclude that mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the G-CSF-R are infrequent in CML-BC or acute leukemia but may contribute to malignant transformation in some cases.","['Carapeti, M', 'Soede-Bobok, A', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Sill, H', 'Touw, I P', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Carapeti M', 'Soede-Bobok A', 'Hochhaus A', 'Sill H', 'Touw IP', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):1005-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400697.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400697 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By applying the mRNA differential display to RNA obtained from A549 lung carcinoma cell line that was incubated with 50 ng/ml IL-1 for 0, 1, 2, and 6 h, we identified several cDNA fragments that correspond to genes regulated by IL-1.

In this study, we report that the expression of human A1 is either absent or present at low levels in leukemic cells, while it is expressed in human bone marrow cells and abundant in peripheral blood progenitors. It is induced by IL-1 and TNF alpha in A549 lung carcinoma, bone marrow, and certain leukemic cells. A1 is also induced in leukemic cells during granulocytic or macrophage but not erythroid differentiation.

Two shifts toward LZM gene demethylation coincided with upregulation of expression: activation of expression in myeloid precursor cells was associated with significant demethylation at a CpG dinucleotide within an Alu repeat in the 5' flanking region; high-level expression in different types of mature phagocytic cells was associated with complete demethylation at two additional, intragenic CpG sites contained in Alu sequences.

The DNA methylation status of 25 CpG sites was determined by sequence analysis after bisulfite treatment of the DNA. This method showed that 13 out of 14 patients had increased numbers of methylated CpG sites in the calcitonin gene region at initial diagnosis when compared to control DNA from healthy individuals. The 5' region of the calcitonin gene appears to be methylated to a significantly higher degree in T lineage ALL compared to B lineage ALL (P < 0.01). Each of six ALL patients who were investigated at initial diagnosis and at relapse showed alterations in DNA methylation between the two stages. These six cases were also investigated by Southern blot analysis with methylcytosine-sensitive restriction enzymes and this method showed an increase in DNA methylation in only four of the six cases. The DNA sequencing method thus appears to be better suited to assess alterations of DNA methylation than Southern blot analysis. There are marked regional differences in the frequency of methylation of individual CpG sites and in the frequency of alterations between the two stages. Our results show that alterations in DNA methylation continue to occur from the initial stage to the relapse stage of ALL, suggesting that aberrant DNA methylation may play a role in tumor progression.","['Leegwater, P A', 'Lambooy, L H', 'De Abreu, R A', 'Bokkerink, J P', 'van den Heuvel, L P']","['Leegwater PA', 'Lambooy LH', 'De Abreu RA', 'Bokkerink JP', 'van den Heuvel LP']","['Laboratory for Pediatrics and Neurology, University Hospital of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['9007-12-9 (Calcitonin)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Calcitonin/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Recurrence']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):971-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400688.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400688 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, inhibition of MDR1 expression persisted for 3 days after removal of oligonucleotides. Increased accumulation of rhodamine 123 and nearly a three-fold sensitization of cells to vincristine paralleled the reduction in staining with MRK16.

These results indicate that antisense targeted to MDR1 can sensitize drug-resistant leukemia cells and suggest that antisense treatment may prevent the emergence of MDR1-mediated drug resistance.","['Li, X', 'Smyth, A P', 'Barrett, D J', 'Ivy, S P', 'von Hofe, E']","['Li X', 'Smyth AP', 'Barrett DJ', 'Ivy SP', 'von Hofe E']","['Hybridon, Inc., Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):950-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400696.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400696 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that leukaemic cells with autonomous growth characteristics express high levels of bcl-2 and are relatively resistant to apoptosis. As bcl-x(L) is a bcl-2-related gene with anti-apoptotic activity which also confers resistance to cytotoxic drugs we have studied its expression in AML in relation to cellular growth characteristics and to the expression of P-glycoprotein. Cells from 15 patients were studied. Immunoblotting demonstrated bands at 31 kDa corresponding to bcl-x(L) from the cells of all patients. Bcl-x(S) was not detected in any sample. Using standardised, quantitative flow cytometry, bcl-x(L) expression ranged from 0.25 x 10(5) to 4.24 x 10(5) bound FITC molecules, (median 1.35 x 10[5]). AML blasts with autonomous growth in vitro expressed more bcl-x(L) (median 1.76 x 10[5]) than those which did not (median 0.86 x 10(5), P=0.01). Quantitative bcl-x(L) expression strongly correlated with that of P-glycoprotein, also measured by quantitative flow cytometry using the MRK16 antibody (r=0.95, P < 0.001), but not with MRPr1. These results provide a further explanation for the poor prognosis associated with autonomous in vitro growth of AML blasts and illustrate that these cells may coexpress different modalities of resistance to cytotoxic drug therapy involving both anti-apoptotic pathways (bcl-x(L), bcl-2) and classic multidrug resistance (MDR1). The implication of these findings is that the use of agents to reverse MDR1 function in AML may be unsuccessful in the absence of strategies to reduce resistance to apoptosis.","['Pallis, M', 'Zhu, Y M', 'Russell, N H']","['Pallis M', 'Zhu YM', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital and University of Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*physiology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):945-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400705.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400705 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells express Bcl-2 and little or no Bcl-X(L), while K562 expresses Bcl-X(L) but not Bcl-2. Since phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of Bcl-2, we planned to investigate whether the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Bax, a protein that antagonizes the antiapoptotic function of Bcl-2, are regulated in myeloid leukemia cell lines (K562, KU812 and HL-60) treated with okadaic acid. Our results indicate that exposure of all three leukemic cell lines to nanomolar concentrations of okadaic acid causes a loss of viability by activation of an apoptotic process accompanied by a marked decrease in the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L) and Bax at both mRNA and protein level, but not of c-fos, vimentin and epsilon-globin, ruling out a non-specific effect of okadaic acid. Furthermore, constitutive expression of either Bcl-X(L) or Bcl-2 by gene transfer inhibited apoptosis triggered by okadaic acid in K562 cells. Thus, we suggest that protein phosphatases may be involved in maintaining the expression of bcl-2 family genes as part of the survival machinery of the cell.","['Benito, A', 'Lerga, A', 'Silva, M', 'Leon, J', 'Fernandez-Luna, J L']","['Benito A', 'Lerga A', 'Silva M', 'Leon J', 'Fernandez-Luna JL']","['Servicio de Immunologia, Hospital Universitario Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Okadaic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):940-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400699.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400699 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IRF1 functions as an activator for IFN and IFN-inducible genes, whereas IRF2 represses the action of IRF1. Expression of the two regulatory genes is itself IFN-inducible. Because therapeutic responses of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients to IFN-alpha may be determined by intracellular levels of these two mutually antagonistic transcription factors, we have devised a competitive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay which provides an estimate of the ratio of IRF1 to IRF2 expression in a given cell population. Analysis of peripheral blood leucocytes from 25 normal individuals showed that the IRF1:IRF2 ratio varied between 1.13 and 2.30 (mean +/- s.d. 1.49 +/- 0.33). Similar values were obtained for normal bone marrow specimens, with no significant difference between CD34+ and CD34- cells. In contrast, the IRF1:IRF2 ratio in leucocytes from CML patients showed a much wider variation (0.53-5.11). Eleven out of 130 patients in chronic phase had ratios above the normal range, whereas none of the 33 blast crisis samples had a ratio >2.5. Analysis of diagnostic specimens in 59 CML patients treated subsequently with IFN-alpha showed a high IRF1:IRF2 ratio of 5.11 in one of two patients who became complete responders; all the 53 patients with minimal or no cytogenetic response had ratios below 2.5. In a separate series of 97 CML patients studied after IFN-alpha therapy a highly significant correlation was found between the IRF1:IRF2 ratio and both the cytogenetic and the molecular response (ie low concentration of BCR-ABL transcripts) to treatment: 53 out of 115 prospectively analysed samples of good cytogenetic responders had ratios above 2.0, as opposed to only 13 out of 91 samples from poor responders (P < 0.0001; chi2 test). We conclude that a high ratio of IRF1/IRF2 expression may be associated with good cytogenetic and molecular response to IFN-alpha in CML.","['Hochhaus, A', 'Yan, X H', 'Willer, A', 'Hehlmann, R', 'Gordon, M Y', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Hochhaus A', 'Yan XH', 'Willer A', 'Hehlmann R', 'Gordon MY', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF1 protein, human)', '0 (IRF2 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-1', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):933-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400723.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400723 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All had been previously treated and 12 (92%) had disease refractory to interferon-alpha therapy. They received ATRA 175 mg/m2 orally in two divided doses daily until disease progression. The median duration of therapy was 56 days (range 11 to 190). Only one patient in late chronic phase had a transient decrease in WBC counts; all other patients in late chronic phase showed no response to therapy. Four of the five patients in accelerated phase showed evidence of antileukemia effect manifested by a decrease in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood blasts, promyelocyte and/or basophil percentages. In all cases the response was transient. The patient in blastic phase had no evidence of antileukemic effect. The treatment was well tolerated with the major side-effects being headache, nausea, dry skin, and dry mucosal membranes. One patient required dose reductions due to toxicity. We conclude that in this population of patients with extensively treated, advanced stage, Ph-positive CML, ATRA alone is ineffective for long-term therapy.

In this study, the biological and clinical features of 30 APL patients were reported. The risk factors for relapse and for occurrence of retinoic acid (RA) syndrome, which might cause morbidity or mortality of patients after ATRA treatment, were also analyzed. All patients showed 15;17 translocation by cytogenetic and/or gene analysis. Patients in this study had higher white blood cell (WBC) counts and a higher incidence of additional abnormalities than those from other areas. The ratio of long (L) form to short (S) form PML-RAR alpha fusion transcript was 1.8:1, a value lower than that of Latino patients but higher than that of Italians. Leukemic cells from four patients showed coexpression of T cell-associated antigen CD2 which was highly correlated with S form fusion transcript. Nine (36%) of the 25 patients treated with ATRA developed RA syndrome; all but one were successfully controlled by corticosteroid. Complete remission (CR) rate was 84%. Patients with high WBC counts tended to develop RA syndrome and had increased risk of relapse. Isochromosome for the long arm of the derivative chromosome 17, ider(17q), as an additional chromosomal abnormality was also associated with poor outcome in this study. In conclusion, APL in this study showed some different biological characteristics compared with those reported in other areas. High WBC count was a risk factor for relapse and development of RA syndrome after ATRA treatment. The prognostic implication of the presence of ider(17q) needs further clarification.","['Chou, W C', 'Tang, J L', 'Yao, M', 'Liang, Y J', 'Lee, F Y', 'Lin, M T', 'Wang, C H', 'Shen, M C', 'Chen, Y C', 'Tien, H F']","['Chou WC', 'Tang JL', 'Yao M', 'Liang YJ', 'Lee FY', 'Lin MT', 'Wang CH', 'Shen MC', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jul;11(7):921-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400690.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400690 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the CD10- patients, the EFS was favorably influenced by the female sex (p = 0.04), leukocyte count under 10 x 10(9)/l (p = 0.05) and LDH < 300 U/l (p = 0.02). CNS infiltration was documented in 4.2% (5/119). Mortality secondary to chemotherapy was seen in 7%. In conclusion, this is the first large series in Mexican children with B-lineage ALL published. Because of the relatively small number of patients in each group (pre B and transitional pre B), all the patients in the current series were treated alike. When the 119 patients were divided only on the basis of CD10 reactivity, the EFS for both groups (CD10+ and-) was similar; therefore, the reactivity to CD10 has no prognostic value in this type of ALL.","['Rivera-Luna, R', 'Cardenas-Cardos, R', 'Leal-Leal, C', 'Navarro-Alegria, I', 'Meza-Coria, C', 'Gomez-Martinez, R', 'Vega-Vega, L']","['Rivera-Luna R', 'Cardenas-Cardos R', 'Leal-Leal C', 'Navarro-Alegria I', 'Meza-Coria C', 'Gomez-Martinez R', 'Vega-Vega L']","['Departamento de Oncologia del Instituto Nacional de Pediatria, SS, Mexico, D.F.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Teniposide/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1997 Summer;28(2):233-9.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two hundred forty-two patients were diagnosed and treated at two hospitals affiliated with the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). These are the Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI and Centro Medico La Raza Hospitals; the remaining 61 patients were diagnosed and treated at the Hospital General de Mexico (HGM). Clonal abnormalities were detected in 75.6% of the patients; this result agrees with what has been reported in other large series of AML studies. The incidence of changes per hospital was similar in patients from the IMSS hospitals (72-75%), while an increase was seen in patients from the HGM (85.2%). The chromosomal changes seen in this study in order of frequency were: t(15;17)[18.8%], t(9;22)[9.2%], miscellaneous chromosomal changes (mainly rearrangements of chromosomes 1,2,3,12y17)[8.2%], abnormalities of 16q22 [7.3%], t(8;21)[6.3%], -7/del(7q)[5.6%], t(6;9)[5.3%], and abnormalities of 11q23 [4.6%]. We reported an increase in the incidence of certain types of chromosomal changes seen in cases of AML, in comparison with reports from other countries. These differences could be due to methodological variations, although ethnic, socioeconomic and nutritional differences must not be disregarded. We support this finding when comparing distribution of changes in the population of patients seen in the IMSS hospitals with those from the HGM; the main difference lies in the socioeconomic level.","['Arana-Trejo, R M', 'Gomez-Morales, E', 'Rubio-Borja, M E', 'Kassack-Ipina, J J', 'Cervantes-Peredo, A', 'Guerrero-Rivera, S', 'Gonzalez-Llaven, J', 'Gutierrez-Romero, M', 'Pizzuto-Chavez, J', 'Kofman-Alfaro, S']","['Arana-Trejo RM', 'Gomez-Morales E', 'Rubio-Borja ME', 'Kassack-Ipina JJ', 'Cervantes-Peredo A', 'Guerrero-Rivera S', 'Gonzalez-Llaven J', 'Gutierrez-Romero M', 'Pizzuto-Chavez J', 'Kofman-Alfaro S']","['Departamento de Genetica, Hospital General de Mexico SSa, Mexico, D.F.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Hospitals, General', 'Hospitals, Public', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/ultrastructure', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Social Security', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 1997 Summer;28(2):209-14.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primer pairs encompassing the TM domain were selected to generate a 357-base pair (bp) fragment. A 146-bp PCR product was observed consistently in addition to the target 357-bp PCR product in mRNA from HTLV-I-infected cell lines, such as MT-1, MT-2, MT-4 and in PBMC isolated from ATL patients. However, this 146-bp PCR product was undetectable in HTLV-I-negative cell lines. The product was also detected in PBMC from normal individuals if activated in vitro with phytohaemagglutinin but not without stimulation. DNA sequence analyses revealed that exons from 5 to 7, which define a 211-bp region containing the conventional TM domain, were deleted in the 146-bp PCR product. The C-terminal amino acid sequence starting from Gly174 of the 211-bp-deleted molecule was distinct from that of conventional IL-2R alpha as a result of an altered reading frame. We identified a 45000 MW peptide generated from IL-2R alpha mRNA through this exon skip in cell lysate of MT-1 and MT-2 by Western blot analyses using an antibody raised against the peptides specific to an altered IL-2R alpha. Our results indicate that an altered IL-2R alpha chain is expressed in HTLV-I-infected T lymphocytic cell lines and in ATL patients.","['Horiuchi, S', 'Koyanagi, Y', 'Tanaka, Y', 'Waki, M', 'Matsumoto, A', 'Zhou, Y W', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Horiuchi S', 'Koyanagi Y', 'Tanaka Y', 'Waki M', 'Matsumoto A', 'Zhou YW', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Gene Expression', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1997 May;91(1):28-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1997.00236.x.,,,1,['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1997.00236.x [doi]'],,PMC1364031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We enrolled 638 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were under 15 years of age and were registered with the Children's Cancer Group and 620 controls in a study of residential exposure to magnetic fields generated by nearby power lines. In the subjects' current and former homes, data collectors measured magnetic fields for 24 hours in the child's bedroom and for 30 seconds in three or four other rooms and outside the front door. A computer algorithm assigned wire-code categories; based on the distance and configuration of nearby power lines, to the subjects' main residences (for 416 case patients and 416 controls) and to those where the family had lived during the mother's pregnancy with the subject (for 230 case patients and 230 controls). RESULTS: The risk of childhood ALL was not linked to summary time-weighted average residential magnetic-field levels, categorized according to a priori criteria. The odds ratio for ALL was 1.24 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 1.79) at exposures of 0.200 mu T or greater as compared with less than 0.065 mu T. The risk of ALL was not increased among children whose main residences were in the highest wire-code category (odds ratio as compared with the lowest category, 0.88; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.48 to 1.63). Furthermore, the risk was not significantly associated with either residential magnetic-field levels or the wire codes of the homes mothers resided in when pregnant with the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide little evidence that living in homes characterized by high measured time-weighted average magnetic-field levels or by the highest wire-code category increases the risk of ALL in children.","['Linet, M S', 'Hatch, E E', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Robison, L L', 'Kaune, W T', 'Friedman, D R', 'Severson, R K', 'Haines, C M', 'Hartsock, C T', 'Niwa, S', 'Wacholder, S', 'Tarone, R E']","['Linet MS', 'Hatch EE', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Robison LL', 'Kaune WT', 'Friedman DR', 'Severson RK', 'Haines CM', 'Hartsock CT', 'Niwa S', 'Wacholder S', 'Tarone RE']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md 20892-7362, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Housing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk']",1997/07/03 00:00,1997/07/03 00:01,['1997/07/03 00:00'],"['1997/07/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/03 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1997 Jul 3;337(1):1-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199707033370101.,,['R01 CA48051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],1,['10.1056/NEJM199707033370101 [doi]'],"['N Engl J Med. 1997 Jul 3;337(1):44-6.

The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ASA in a large prepubertal male population (aged 1.2-13 years) consisting of three groups: Group I, 52 patients affected by malignant diseases (lymphoblastic leukaemia, malignant lymphoma, or Wilm's tumour, n = 42), or by nephrotic syndrome (n = 10); Group II, 212 patients with either genital tract abnormalities (cryptorchidism, inguinal hernia, funicular torsion or hypospadias, n = 202), or cystic fibrosis (n = 10); Group III: 100 age-matched normal boys. Group I and II patients were investigated at diagnosis and during or after treatment (drug, radiation or surgical therapy). Group III was used as controls. ASA were detected in sera by the Tray Agglutination Test (TAT) and indirect IgG, IgA and IgM immunobead tests (iIBT). All normal boys were ASA-negative using both tests. Twenty-six out of the 264 patients (9.8%) in Groups I and II were ASA-positive: 23 (8.7%) patients had a positive TAT with a titre of 1:32 to 1:128, whilst 14 (5.3%) had IgG-ASA after iIBT. Eleven patients (4.1%) were ASA-positive in both tests. Of the 26 ASA-positive boys, 24 had genital tract abnormalities (cryptorchidism, testicular torsion, hypospadias) and two had leukaemia with testicular infiltration. Treatment did not modify antibody positivity. Our data confirm that ASA can occur in prepubertal boys, mostly among cases with urogenital pathology, but that it is rare among other cases. Therefore autoimmune reaction against spermatozoa is another factor that should be considered in the evaluation of several conditions in childhood involving reproductive tract alteration and potential impairment of the blood testis (Sertoli cell) barrier.","['Sinisi, A A', ""D'Apuzzo, A"", 'Pasquali, D', 'Venditto, T', 'Esposito, D', 'Pisano, G', 'De Bellis, A', 'Ventre, I', 'Papparella, A', 'Perrone, L', 'Bellastella, A']","['Sinisi AA', ""D'Apuzzo A"", 'Pasquali D', 'Venditto T', 'Esposito D', 'Pisano G', 'De Bellis A', 'Ventre I', 'Papparella A', 'Perrone L', 'Bellastella A']","['Institute of Endocrinology, Second University, Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Androl,International journal of andrology,8000141,['0 (Autoantibodies)'],IM,"['Autoantibodies/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystic Fibrosis/immunology', 'Genitalia, Male/*abnormalities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/immunology/radiotherapy', 'Puberty', 'Spermatozoa/*immunology', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy/immunology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Androl. 1997 Feb;20(1):23-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2605.1997.00101.x.,,,1,['10.1046/j.1365-2605.1997.00101.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also produced in a variety of other cell types, in particular following activation by inflammatory mediators. Changes in the rate of transcription are important in the control of GM-CSF expression in T cells and in fibroblasts and endothelial cells. The GM-CSF gene contains two distinct transcriptional control regions. These are the proximal promoter consisting of the first 120 bp from the transcription start site and an enhancer located approximately 3 kb upstream from the proximal promoter. Distinct regions of the proximal promoter respond to a wide array of signals such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and Ca2+ ionophore or phytohemaglutinin (PHA), CD28 activation, human T leukemia virus (HTLV)-1 tax, TNF, and interleukin 1 (IL-1). The transcription factors that mediate these responses have mainly been defined, with the major inducible proteins being the NF-kappa B/rel and AP-I families of transcription factors.

Particularly in patients having undergone bone marrow transplantation, respiratory diseases account for a significant number of deaths. In a retrospective study, we evaluated 41 patients with leukemia and severe aplastic anemia who were operated on consecutively from 1980 to 1995. METHODS: Fourteen open lung biopsies, four video-assisted lung biopsies, and 24 lung resections were performed in 24 male and 17 female patients. Mean age was 32.2 years. RESULTS: Eleven (27%) early deaths occurred (30-day mortality): ten in patients after lung biopsy (56%) and one after lung resection (4%) (p < 0.001). Perioperative morbidity relating to pulmonary disease or operation included 10 (24.4%) cases of prolonged (> 24 hours) postoperative mechanical ventilation and two (4.8%) cases of bleeding or hematoma. In one (2.4%) patient a slowly developing, contained bronchial stump insufficiency appeared after lobectomy, which was successfully operated on 3 weeks later. CONCLUSION: We conclude that resection of localized pulmonary lesions, be it for diagnostic or therapeutic (or combined) purposes, can be carried out with low morbidity and mortality in patients with leukemia and severe aplastic anemia. However, early mortality is high after open or thoracoscopic lung biopsies in patients with acute-onset diffuse pulmonary disease, and little therapeutic benefit is realized in these cases.","['Habicht, J M', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Tamm, M', 'Drewe, J', 'Proske, M', 'Stulz, P']","['Habicht JM', 'Gratwohl A', 'Tamm M', 'Drewe J', 'Proske M', 'Stulz P']","['Department of Surgery, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg,The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,0376343,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*complications', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lung Diseases/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg. 1997 Jun;113(6):982-8. doi: 10.1016/s0022-5223(97)70282-4.,,,6,"['S0022522397001839 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-5223(97)70282-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a retrospective study of 95,806 consecutive screening mammograms, 37 cases of 'pathological' axillary nodes were identified using two or more of the following criteria: size > 2 cm, replacement of fatty hilum, rounded shape and generalized increased density. In 16 cases with an additional mammographic abnormality, 12 had a mass (10 malignant and two benign) and four had suspicious calcification (all malignant). In 12 of these cases, the lymph nodes showed malignancy (75%). In 21 patients with lymphadenopathy alone on screening, six patients had a known underlying diagnosis and were not recalled from screening. The remaining 15 patients were recalled for further assessment including fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). The ultimate diagnosis was benign in 10 cases (48%)--six reactive changes, one healed granulomatous disease, one rheumatoid arthritis, one amyloid and one acute infection--and malignant in 11 cases (52%)--six non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, four metastatic carcinoma and one leukaemia. In conclusion, there is a high incidence of malignant nodal involvement in cases of screen detected lymphadenopathy (62% of cases in our series). We would advise that patients with lymphadenopathy as the sole finding on screening mammography and in whom there is no known underlying cause should undergo FNAC followed by excision biopsy. Fifty per cent of such patients in this study had underlying malignancy.","['Murray, M E', 'Given-Wilson, R M']","['Murray ME', 'Given-Wilson RM']","[""Department of Radiology, St George's Healthcare Trust, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Radiol,Clinical radiology,1306016,,IM,"['Aged', 'Axilla', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Breast Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnostic imaging', '*Mammography', '*Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Radiol. 1997 Jun;52(6):458-61. doi: 10.1016/s0009-9260(97)80008-6.,,,6,['10.1016/s0009-9260(97)80008-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K155A and K155W mutants lost cell survival promoting activity for chicken dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons and inhibited the activity of the wild type. However, they retained slight agonistic activity for the survival of rat DRG neurons, indicating there is a difference between chicken and rat cells for receptor recognition around the D1 cap region including K155 residue. The chicken receptor recognizes the D1 cap region more strictly than does the rat receptor. The substitution of F152, which locates at the top of the D1 cap region, was combined with the K155A mutation. A combination of the two mutations gave an antagonistic feature to not only chicken but also rat cells. Both F152S/K155A and F152D/K155A mutants lacked cell survival promoting activity and had an antagonistic effect on rat DRG neurons. The three-dimensional structure of CNTF suggests the following. F152 and K155 bind to the receptor with hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, respectively. F152 locates close to L156 with a van der Waals contact, and K155 contacts with Q42 through a hydrogen bond. Both interactions play indispensable roles in maintaining the structure around the D1 cap region of CNTF.","['Inoue, M', 'Karita, H', 'Nakayama, C', 'Noguchi, H']","['Inoue M', 'Karita H', 'Nakayama C', 'Noguchi H']","['Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Research Center, Konohana-ku, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Chickens', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Mutagenesis/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons/chemistry/cytology/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cytokine/chemistry/genetics', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/chemistry/*genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 1997 Jul;69(1):95-101. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.69010095.x.,,,1,['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1997.69010095.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that adenovirus E1A represses the interleukin-6 signal transduction pathway that uses the same JAK tyrosine kinase and STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factor as LIF. Here, we report that the LIF-JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is blocked in cellular E1A-expressing undifferentiated F9 cells, and that the block is overcome by retinoic acid-induced differentiation. LIF failed to stimulate the expression of the acute phase response element (APRE)-driven luciferase gene in undifferentiated F9 cells, whereas the luciferase activity was remarkably increased by LIF treatment in differentiated F9 (dF9) cells. We analyzed the mechanism of the APRE regulation and found that the LIF-induced APRE-binding activity was regulated in a differentiation-dependent manner. The protein levels and the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and STAT3 in F9 cells were not different from those in dF9 cells. The exogenous expression of activated c-Ha-ras partially recovered the LIF responsiveness of the APRE-luciferase gene in F9 cells, but the dominant negative ras N-17 did not repress the LIF-induced activation of APRE-luciferase in dF9 cells. These results suggested that an unknown coactivation process that is partially compensated by Ras is required for STAT3-APRE binding in F9 cells.","['Takeda, T', 'Kurachi, H', 'Yamamoto, T', 'Homma, H', 'Adachi, K', 'Morishige, K', 'Miyake, A', 'Murata, Y']","['Takeda T', 'Kurachi H', 'Yamamoto T', 'Homma H', 'Adachi K', 'Morishige K', 'Miyake A', 'Murata Y']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Embryonal/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genes, ras', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocrinology. 1997 Jul;138(7):2689-96. doi: 10.1210/endo.138.7.5280.,,,7,['10.1210/endo.138.7.5280 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ser and Dl encode transmembrane ligands for Notch, whereas fng encodes a pioneer protein. We have investigated the relationship between these genes by a combination of expression and coexpression studies in the Drosophila wing. We found that Ser and Dl maintain each other's expression by a positive feedback loop. fng is expressed specifically by dorsal cells and functions to position and restrict this feedback loop to the developing dorsal-ventral boundary. This is achieved by fng through a cell-autonomous mechanism that inhibits a cell's ability to respond to Serrate protein and potentiates its ability to respond to Delta protein.","['Panin, V M', 'Papayannopoulos, V', 'Wilson, R', 'Irvine, K D']","['Panin VM', 'Papayannopoulos V', 'Wilson R', 'Irvine KD']","['Waksman Institute and Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Rutgers, The State University, Piscataway, New Jersey 08855, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Insect Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Jagged-1 Protein)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Ser protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Serrate-Jagged Proteins)', '0 (delta protein)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.222 (fng protein, Drosophila)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Insect Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jagged-1 Protein', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', '*N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferases', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Serrate-Jagged Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wings, Animal/embryology']",1997/06/26 00:00,2001/03/23 10:01,['1997/06/26 00:00'],"['1997/06/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/23 10:01 [medline]', '1997/06/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1997 Jun 26;387(6636):908-12. doi: 10.1038/43191.,,,6636,['10.1038/43191 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because vitronectin also binds plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), and plasmin cleavage of vitronectin reduces PAI-1 binding, we explored the effects of plasmin and PAI-1 on the interaction between uPAR and vitronectin. PAI-1 blocked cellular binding of and adhesion to vitronectin by over 80% (IC50 approximately 5 nM), promoted detachment of uPAR-bearing cells from vitronectin, and increased cellular migration on vitronectin. Limited cleavage of vitronectin by plasmin also abolished cellular binding and adhesion and induced cellular detachment. A series of peptides surrounding a plasmin cleavage site (arginine 361) near the carboxy-terminal end of vitronectin were synthesized. Two peptides spanning res 364-380 blocked binding of uPAR to vitronectin (IC50 approximately 8-25 microM) identifying this region as an important site of uPAR-vitronectin interaction. These data illuminate a complex regulatory scheme for uPAR-dependent cellular adhesion to vitronectin: Active urokinase promotes adhesion and also subsequent detachment through activation of plasmin or complex formation with PAI-1. Excess PAI-1 may also promote migration by blocking cellular adhesion and/or promoting detachment, possibly accounting in part for the strong correlation between PAI-1 expression and tumor cell metastasis.","['Waltz, D A', 'Natkin, L R', 'Fujita, R M', 'Wei, Y', 'Chapman, H A']","['Waltz DA', 'Natkin LR', 'Fujita RM', 'Wei Y', 'Chapman HA']","[""Division of Respiratory Diseases, Children's Hospital, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. waltz@a1.tch.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (PLAUR protein, human)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vitronectin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement/drug effects/*physiology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Fibrinolysin/*pharmacology', 'Fibronectins', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Urokinase Plasminogen Activator', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitronectin/isolation & purification/*physiology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Jul 1;100(1):58-67. doi: 10.1172/JCI119521.,,"['HL-03169-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-44712/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",1,['10.1172/JCI119521 [doi]'],,PMC508165,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When transfected into murine hematopoietic cell lines, BCR/ABL causes cytokine-independence and enhances viability. There is also growing evidence that p210(BCR/ABL) affects cytoskeletal structure. p210(BCR/ABL) binds to actin, and several cytoskeletal proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated by this oncoprotein. Also, at least one aspect of cytoskeletal function is abnormal, in that the affinity of beta1 integrins for fibronectin is altered in CML cells. However, isolated changes in beta1 integrin function would be unlikely to explain the clinical phenotype of CML. We used time-lapse video microscopy to study cell motility and cell morphology on extracellular cell matrix protein-coated surfaces of a series of cell lines before and after transformation by BCR/ABL. BCR/ABL was associated with a striking increase in spontaneous motility, membrane ruffling, formation of long actin extensions (filopodia) and accelerated the rate of protrusion and retraction of pseudopodia on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Also, while untransformed cells were sessile for long periods, BCR/ABL-transformed cells exhibited persistent motility, except for brief periods during cell division. Using cell lines transformed by a temperature-sensitive mutant of BCR/ABL, these kinetic abnormalities of cytoskeletal function were shown to require BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Similar abnormalities of cytoskeletal function on fibronectin-coated surfaces were observed when hematopoietic progenitor cells purified by CD34 selection from patients with CML were compared with CD34 positive cells from normal individuals. Interestingly, alpha-interferon treatment was found to slowly revert the abnormal motility phenotype of BCR/ABL-transformed cells towards normal. The increase in spontaneous motility and other defects of cytoskeletal function described here will be useful biological markers of the functional effects of BCR/ABL in hematopoietic cells.","['Salgia, R', 'Li, J L', 'Ewaniuk, D S', 'Pear, W', 'Pisick, E', 'Burky, S A', 'Ernst, T', 'Sattler, M', 'Chen, L B', 'Griffin, J D']","['Salgia R', 'Li JL', 'Ewaniuk DS', 'Pear W', 'Pisick E', 'Burky SA', 'Ernst T', 'Sattler M', 'Chen LB', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.

Interestingly, IL-2+Trx alone was found to induce proliferation in B-CLL cells from patients with advanced stages of disease. In addition, we also found that IL-2+Trx and SAC+IL-2+Trx-induced DNA synthesis of B-CLL cells was inhibited by CD40 activation (by soluble anti-CD40 MoAb and anti-CD40 MoAb presented on irradiated CD32L cells).

To quantify these numbers two fluorescence methods using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled monoclonal antibodies (mAb) were applied. A commercially available set of standard beads was used in flow cytometry to quantitate CD14 with eight different mAbs. Independent from their isotype the various mAbs showed minor differences and indicated that peripheral blood monocytes expressed 99,500-134,600 (115,400 +/- 10,600) and neutrophils 1,900-4,400 (3,300 +/- 800) CD14 receptors. There was no significant difference in CD14 expression on leukocytes in unprocessed freshly obtained whole blood and after a Ficoll isolation procedure. However, a short temperature shift resulted in a 1.3- to 1.6-fold up-regulation of CD14. The results obtained with the reference beads were verified with fluorescence Scatchard analysis and spectrofluorometry using mAb 26ic-FITC and showed 109,500 CD14 per monocyte and 6,700 CD14 per neutrophil. For comparison the number of CD14 on the monocytic THP-1 cells and Fc gamma-receptors on human leukocytes were determined using the reference beads and flow cytometry and gave results comparable to published data. Our data indicate that resting human monocytes express roughly 110,000 CD14 molecules on their surface using a simple fluorometric assay. Correct determination of the number of CD14 and other cell surface receptors is of importance in the monitoring of septic patients.","['Antal-Szalmas, P', 'Strijp, J A', 'Weersink, A J', 'Verhoef, J', 'Van Kessel, K P']","['Antal-Szalmas P', 'Strijp JA', 'Weersink AJ', 'Verhoef J', 'Van Kessel KP']","['Eijkman-Winkler Institute for Medical Microbiology, Utrecht University, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Cell Separation', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Direct/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Glycophorins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/blood/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*blood/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Monocytes/*chemistry/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*chemistry/immunology', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1997 Jun;61(6):721-8. doi: 10.1002/jlb.61.6.721.,,,6,['10.1002/jlb.61.6.721 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we demonstrate that AN-9 is a cytostatic but not cytotoxic agent in a myelomonocytic cell line (WEHI); thus, the cells were growth-arrested and differentiated. These late changes in the cells were preceded by changes in the expression of the early regulatory genes, c-myc and c-jun. Although initiation of all these events had already occurred after 1 h exposure to AN-9, the tumorigenicity of these cells tested in Balb/c mice was not affected. A marked reduction in the tumorigenicity of AN-9-treated cells was observed after 4 h of exposure. Exposure of the highly metastatic subclone of Lewis lung carcinoma (3LLD122) to AN-9 resulted in a very pronounced effect on the tumorigenicity of these cells tested in C57BL mice. Unlike WEHI cells, the tumorigenicity of 3LLD122 was almost completely diminished after 1 h of exposure.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients registered in Pediatric Oncology Group phase II studies were evaluated. Patients had to be < 21 years of age with recurrent and refractory measurable disease. Tumor types and response rates were determined. Death on therapy from either drug toxicity, progressive disease, infection, or hemorrhage was measured. Tumor-specific, disease-free survival curves were calculated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. RESULTS: Between 1984 and 1994, 2,465 patient entries were made on 45 phase II trials. Malignancies registered included acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (16.7%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (12.0%), osteogenic sarcoma (7.8%), neuroblastoma (7.2%), astrocytoma (7.2%), medulloblastoma (7.1%), glioma (6.7%), ependymoma (6.1%), and others (29.2%). The overall response rate was 19.6% (CR + PR) for children entered on phase II trials. Tumor-specific response rates ranged from 62.1% (23/37) for children with Hodgkin's disease to no responses (0/23) in patients with hepatoblastoma. When comparing single versus multiagent trials, a significantly better initial response rate was seen in the latter studies. However, 5-year survival was comparable. Progression-free survival for all tumor histologies were 12.9% and 9.2% at 2 and 5 years, respectively. Death on study was seen in 11.6% of the patients; however, only three deaths were directly related to drug toxicity. There were no significant gender differences in regards to response, progressive disease, or death on study. CONCLUSION: Phase II studies conducted in children offer a considerable likelihood of therapeutic benefit without exposing these patients to untoward toxicity.","['Weitman, S', 'Ochoa, S', 'Sullivan, J', 'Shuster, J', 'Winick, N', 'Pratt, C', 'Vietti, T', 'Harris, M']","['Weitman S', 'Ochoa S', 'Sullivan J', 'Shuster J', 'Winick N', 'Pratt C', 'Vietti T', 'Harris M']","['University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7810, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Osteosarcoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 May-Jun;19(3):187-91. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199705000-00002.,,"['CA-05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",3,['10.1097/00043426-199705000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review article discusses a possible role of molecular mimicry in the production of autoantibodies. Antibodies reactive with products of bacterial and viral genes sometime cross-react with normal cellular proteins. Sera from patients with systemic autoimmune diseases show crossreactivity with some bacterial and/or viral gene products at a significant frequency. Identification of the structures of antigenic epitopes recognized by disease-associated autoantibodies by expression cloning of autoantigen molecules and gene fragment expression revealed the amino acid residues that are shared by autoantibody-defined epitopes and microbial proteins. The presence of amino acid sequences shared between microbial proteins and autoantigens and the detection of antibodies in patients' sera that bind to the crossreactive epitopes suggest that immune responses to bacterial and viral infections may initiate the production of autoantibodies. Receptor-mediated phagocytosis of autoantigen molecules by crossreactive B cells and subsequent antigen presentation to helper T cells may facilitate the production of autoantibodies reactive with separate epitopes, if the autoantigen complex contains multiple B-cell epitopes and a shared T helper cell epitope. Analyses of the fine specificity of T helper cell epitopes on Friend murine leukemia virus env gene products revealed unexpected heterogeneity and redundancy of T cell responses even to a single epitope. This heterogeneity in T cell responses might play a role in the activation of self-reactive T helper cells through molecular mimicry.","['Miyazawa, M']",['Miyazawa M'],"['Department of Immunology, Kinki University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Rinsho,Nihon rinsho.

Mean UBz was 1155 ng/l (S.D. = 494), range 85-1980 ng/l; these values roughly correspond to 10-1000 micrograms/m3 of benzene in air. Mean t,t-MA was 297 micrograms/g creatinine; the range was large (20-1295 micrograms/g creatinine), and the distribution of values was bimodal. At further analysis of t,t-MA data, two subgroups of 59 and 18 subjects were identified (3 outliers were excluded): mean values of the index were 108 (S.D. = 65) and 916 (S.D. = 264) micrograms/g creatinine respectively, and the values within each subgroup were normally distributed. The mean ratio between t,t-MA and UBz in the subgroups were 0.15 and 0.85, respectively; the difference was significant. The first subgroup was defined as 'poor t,t-MA metabolizers', the other as 'efficient t,t-MA metabolizers'. No inter-subgroup differences were observed regarding the main characteristics (age, dietary and smoking habits, etc.). As the parent compound of t,t-MA, trans,trans-muconaldehyde is myelotoxic, and its production has been implicated in benzene-induced leukemia. 'efficient' t,t-MA metabolizers may be at higher risk of developing benzene toxicity. If confirmed in further studies, the inter-individual variability rate of metabolizing benzene to t,t-MA may introduce some limitations in the application of this metabolite as an exposure index of low benzene exposure. Nevertheless, the t,t-MA/UBz ratio may be an important index of susceptibility to benzene toxicity.","['Gobba, F', 'Rovesti, S', 'Borella, P', 'Vivoli, R', 'Caselgrandi, E', 'Vivoli, G']","['Gobba F', 'Rovesti S', 'Borella P', 'Vivoli R', 'Caselgrandi E', 'Vivoli G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena, Italy. f.gobba@unimo.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Sci Total Environ,The Science of the total environment,0330500,"['0 (Air Pollutants)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants/analysis', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benzene/analysis/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cohort Studies', 'Creatinine/urine', '*Environmental Monitoring', 'Humans', 'Italy', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Reference Standards', 'Sorbic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Urine/*chemistry']",1997/06/20 00:00,1997/06/20 00:01,['1997/06/20 00:00'],"['1997/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Sci Total Environ. 1997 Jun 20;199(1-2):41-8. doi: 10.1016/s0048-9697(97)05480-6.,,,1-2,"['S0048-9697(97)05480-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0048-9697(97)05480-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accompanying the increased NAb binding, LYNAb+ bound more monoclonal 14.8 anti-CD45RA and DNL-1.9 anti-CD45RC and less 13/2 anti-pan CD45, and the binding of MB23G2 anti-CD45RB was eliminated. However, neuraminidase treatment increased NAb binding and detection of pan CD45, CD45RA, and CD45RC but reduced CD45RB expression, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by the former Abs are masked by sialic acid, while the latter includes sialic acid.

The Children's Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).,60-4,"OBJECTIVE: Skin involvement in children with acute monocytic leukemia or CD30-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma is well-known. In contrast, very little is known about the malignant cutaneous infiltrates in children with acute lymphoblatic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL). This study was designed to determine the frequency of these specific lesions in childhood ALL or LBL and the characteristics of such patients. DESIGN: We studied the clinical and biological findings of children with cutaneous involvement at initial diagnosis of ALL or LBL enrolled between August 1989 and March 1995 in the multicentric trial 58881 of the Children's Leukemia Cooperative Group of the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). RESULTS: Among the 1359 children enrolled in the multicenter trial EORTC 58881, 24 presented with skin involvement at diagnosis. ALL was diagnosed in 15 patients and LBL in 9. In 15 cases, skin lesions were observed within a median time of 6 weeks (range, a few days to 8 months) before the diagnosis of the hematologic disease. Twenty-one children had at least one skin lesion located on the head. Diffuse cutaneous lesions were observed in 7 infants with high-risk ALL. Seventeen of the 24 children remain in the first complete remission (median follow-up of 3 years; range 2 months to 5 years) and 3 are in the second remission with a follow-up of 14 to 24 months. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates that cutaneous involvement can be an early manifestation of ALL or LBL. Cutaneous leukemic infiltrates can be observed in children with standard risk as well as in high-risk ALL. Cutaneous involvement in children with LBL is mainly associated with a B-cell precursor immunophenotype of the lymphomatous cells. The most frequent location of skin lesions in children with ALL or LBL is on the head. Further studies are needed to evaluate the prognosis of children with such involvement at diagnosis.","['Millot, F', 'Robert, A', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Laureys, G', 'Ferster, A', 'Brock, P', 'Rohrlich, P', 'Mazingue, F', 'Plantaz, D', 'Plouvier, E', 'Pacquement, H', 'Behar, C', 'Rialland, X', 'Chantraine, J M', 'Guilhot, F', 'Otten, J']","['Millot F', 'Robert A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Mechinaud F', 'Laureys G', 'Ferster A', 'Brock P', 'Rohrlich P', 'Mazingue F', 'Plantaz D', 'Plouvier E', 'Pacquement H', 'Behar C', 'Rialland X', 'Chantraine JM', 'Guilhot F', 'Otten J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Poitiers, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Head and Neck Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Risk Factors', '*Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Time Factors']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 1997 Jul;100(1):60-4. doi: 10.1542/peds.100.1.60.,,,1,['10.1542/peds.100.1.60 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

F1 progeny of a cross between RPRL late-feathering (LF) line EV21+ males and RPRL early feathering (EF) line 15B1 females harboring or lacking EV21 were used. The EF chicks lacking EV21 were inoculated with a field strain of subgroup A ALV at hatch and contact exposed to LF, EV21+ hatchmates for various time intervals. In a second experiment, EV21 contact-exposed and unexposed EF chicks as well as LF, EV21+ hatchmates were inoculated with ALV at various ages. Chickens were tested for ALV-induced viremia and antibody and were observed for tumors until 24 wk of age. Antibody to EV21 in EF chickens contact-exposed to LF, EV21+ hatchmates varied from 10 to 65%, and was detected by 10 wk of age. By 24 wk of age, ALV-induced viremia and tumors in EF chickens varied from 5 to 30%, and from 15 to 32%, respectively, regardless of exposure to EV21. The incidence of ALV-induced tumors was significantly higher in LF chickens genetically infected with EV21 than in EV21 contact-exposed or unexposed EF chickens, but only in chickens inoculated with ALV at hatch. The data suggest that contact infection with EV21 has no influence on ALV infection and tumors. The data also suggest that genetic transmission of EV21 may increase susceptibility of chickens to ALV infection and tumors following infection with ALV at hatch, but not at 4 wk of age or older.","['Fadly, A M', 'Smith, E J']","['Fadly AM', 'Smith EJ']","['USDA, Agricultural Research Service, Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory, East Lansing, Michigan 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/epidemiology/*genetics/*transmission', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/physiology', 'Chickens/*genetics/physiology/virology', 'Feathers', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Phenotype', 'Poultry Diseases/epidemiology/*genetics/*transmission', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Diseases/genetics/transmission/*veterinary']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 1997 Jul;76(7):968-73. doi: 10.1093/ps/76.7.968.,,,7,"['10.1093/ps/76.7.968 [doi]', 'S0032-5791(19)40637-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports have suggested that vitamin E may inhibit smooth muscle cell and also cancer cell growth. We have studied the effect of dl-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) on a series of well-established cancer cell lines that included two erythroleukemia cell lines and a hormone-responsive breast and prostate cancer cell line. Cell proliferation was examined in these cell lines, which were maintained at optimal growth conditions. A dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth was found in all cell lines examined, with the MCF-7 breast and CRL-1740 prostate cancer cell lines showing potent suppression of growth at 0.1 mM vitamin E, whereas the erythroleukemia cell lines, HEL and OCIM-1, responded only at > 0.25 mM vitamin E with inhibition of proliferation. Studies of [3H]thymidine incorporation showed that vitamin E supplementation reduced DNA synthesis in all cell lines. Analysis of high-molecular-weight DNA revealed extensive fragmentation, indicating apoptosis of all cell lines supplemented with vitamin E. Our studies thus give evidence of a general inhibition of cell proliferation by dl-alpha-tocopherol, with breast and prostate cancer cells distinctly more sensitive than erythroleukemia cells.","['Sigounas, G', 'Anagnostou, A', 'Steiner, M']","['Sigounas G', 'Anagnostou A', 'Steiner M']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858, USA. sigounas@brody.med.ecu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/*pharmacology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 1997;28(1):30-5. doi: 10.1080/01635589709514549.,,['HL-39109/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],1,['10.1080/01635589709514549 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors present two fulminant cases of L-asparaginase-induced pancreatitis and review the current literature. The first patient is a 15-year-old boy who underwent induction chemotherapy with L-asparaginase for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with bone marrow involvement. He presented with diffuse patchy necrosis of the pancreas as well as a large infected pancreatic pseudocyst. He subsequently required operative debridement of the pancreas and external drainage of the pseudocyst. He is currently doing well. The second patient is a 5-year-old boy who was treated with L-asparaginase for a diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia. Within 3 weeks of initiation of therapy, fulminant pancreatitis developed, which progressed to multisystem organ failure. Computed tomography scan demonstrated extensive pancreatic necrosis involving 90% of the gland. He underwent surgical debridement of his necrotic pancreas and wide drainage of the lesser sac. Postoperatively he improved but subsequently multiple complications developed including erosion of his gastroduodenal artery with significant intraabdominal bleeding, which was controlled with angiographic embolization. Subsequently erosion of his endotracheal tube into the innominate vein developed, and he died. L-asparaginase-induced pancreatitis has been described after therapy for various pediatric neoplasms, and the reported cases have usually been self-limiting. However, our cases demonstrate potentially fatal sequelae of this complication and mandate early diagnosis with appropriate surgical intervention in this setting.","['Sadoff, J', 'Hwang, S', 'Rosenfeld, D', 'Ettinger, L', 'Spigland, N']","['Sadoff J', 'Hwang S', 'Rosenfeld D', 'Ettinger L', 'Spigland N']","['Department of Surgery, UMDNJ-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Pseudocyst/*chemically induced/surgery', 'Pancreatitis, Acute Necrotizing/*chemically induced/surgery', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1997 Jun;32(6):860-3. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(97)90636-9.,,,6,"['S0022-3468(97)90636-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(97)90636-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pediatric HIV-1 infection, for example, is associated with a distinctive neuropathogenesis that includes marked cortical atrophy, cognitive disorders, and pyramidal dysfunction. The ability of HIV's envelope glycoprotein, gp120, to produce increased intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) leading to neuronal death has been documented. We hypothesize that gp120 and the envelope glycoproteins of other retroviruses may have similar calcium-increasing effects in advancing growth cones, a property which could disrupt the orderly development of the nervous system. To explore this possibility, we exposed chick ciliary ganglion neurons in culture to a known cytopathic region (CVR5) of the feline leukemia virus' envelope glycoprotein. CVR5 produced [Ca2+]i increases and dose-dependent morphological changes in growth cones isolated from their cell bodies by axotomy. These responses of growth cones to CVR5 suggest that the neurotoxic effects of retroviruses could be mediated at the level of the individual growth cone through exposure to envelope glycoproteins and could constitute one mechanism by which these viruses perturb the normal development of the nervous system.","['Fails, A D', 'Mitchell, T W', 'Rojko, J L', 'Whalen, L R']","['Fails AD', 'Mitchell TW', 'Rojko JL', 'Whalen LR']","['Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp120)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cats', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ganglia, Parasympathetic/cytology', 'Gene Products, env/*pharmacology', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Neurons/cytology/physiology/*virology', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptide Fragments/*pharmacology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurovirol. 1997 Jun;3(3):179-91. doi: 10.3109/13550289709018292.,,['R01 NS28510/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],3,['10.3109/13550289709018292 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the role of functional T cell subsets in the mediation of GVL, alloreactive donor CD4+ (Th1/Th2) and CD8+ (Tc1/Tc2) T cells of defined cytokine phenotype were generated by in vitro culture. A leukemia/transplantation model (B6 into B6C3F1; 1050 cGy host irradiation) was established using the bcr/abl-transfected myeloid leukemia line, 32Dp210 (P210; H-2k). Leukemia control mice (1X10(4) P210 cells per recipient) died at day 12.0 post-BMT. Recipients of the CD4+, Th1-type or CD8+, Tc1-type populations were conferred a survival advantage (death at 20.7 and 23.5 days post-BMT, respectively). In contrast, the CD4+, Th2-type population did not mediate GVL (death at 12.3 days). Furthermore, cell mixing experiments demonstrated that the Th2 subset abrogated both Th1- and Tc1-mediated GVL. The CD8+, Tc2 population, which secreted type II cytokines and lysed the P210 leukemia target in vitro, mediated GVL in some experiments; interestingly, the magnitude of Tc2-mediated GVL was inversely related to the level of interleukin-10 (IL-10) secreted in vitro by the Tc2 population. These studies therefore indicate that alloreactive T cells of type I phenotype maximally generate GVL, and that type I/type II interactions are an important consideration for allogeneic transplantation in the setting of leukemic hosts.","['Fowler, D H', 'Breglio, J', 'Nagel, G', 'Hirose, C', 'Gress, R E']","['Fowler DH', 'Breglio J', 'Nagel G', 'Hirose C', 'Gress RE']","['Transplantation Therapy Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892 USA. dhfowler@helix.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Rabbits', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*immunology']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 1996 Oct;2(3):118-25.,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have investigated the efficacy of Dex-Verapamil, the R-isomer of Verapamil, as a chemosensitizer in a murine leukemia cell line (P388) and in its resistant counterpart (P388/Dx) expressing a typical MDR phenotype. We have examined in vivo the effect of the co-administration of Dex-Verapamil and Doxorubicin in mice transplanted with P388 or P388/Dx cells. Mice treated with the combination of Doxorubicin plus RMA had a significant increase in survival rate as compared to controls; however, the effect was modest. On the contrary, in vitro Dex-Verapamil can enhance Doxorubicin cytotoxicity in P388/Dx cells with a much greater effect depending on the treatment scheme used, by increasing the intracellular content of drug. Taken together our data indicate that Dex-Verapamil can indeed increase the sensitivity to Doxorubicin in resistant cells, but the limited efficacy shown in vivo demonstrates that this phenomenon is strongly dependent on the treatment scheme used and on the maintenance of constantly elevated serum levels.","['Noviello, E', 'Allievi, E', 'Russo, P', 'Parodi, S']","['Noviello E', 'Allievi E', 'Russo P', 'Parodi S']","['Transgenic Unit, Advanced Biotechnology Centre, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Survival Analysis', 'Verapamil/*administration & dosage']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1997 Jun;12(4):261-76.,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further elucidate the biological significance of WT1 in leukemic cell growth, we overexpressed exogenous WT1 in murine M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells using the isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG)-controlled expression system.

Upon addition of genistein at day 1, 2, 3, or 4 postinfection, further proliferation of E. risticii was prevented. The inhibition was reversible, since regrowth of E. risticii occurred upon the removal of genistein. Genistein prevented spreading of E. risticii from P388D1 cells to THP-1 cells. Genistein did not prevent binding of [35S]methionine-labeled E. risticii to P388D1 cells but did prevent internalization of [35S]methionine-labeled E. risticii. 14CO2 production from L-[14C]glutamine in Percoll density gradient-purified E. risticii was not inhibited by genistein or herbimycin A, which suggests that these reagents did not directly inhibit ehrlichial energy metabolism. Double indirect immunofluorescence labeling with antiphosphotyrosine antibody and anti-E. risticii antibody revealed colocalization of tyrosine phosphoproteins with ehrlichial inclusions. There was, however, no colocalization of phosphotyrosine with phagosomes containing 0.5-microm-diameter fluorescent beads. Western immunoblot analysis revealed that 52- and 54-kDa proteins were tyrosine phosphorylated only in infected cells and that phosphorylation of these two proteins was reduced when infected cells were treated with genistein for 6 h.

We show that, although very few rhodopsin+ rods develop in the presence of 10% foetal calf serum (FCS), large numbers develop in the absence of serum, but only if the cell density in the cultures is high. The rods all develop from nondividing rhodopsin- cells, and new rods continue to develop from rhodopsin- cells for at least 6-8 days, indicating that there can be a long delay between when a precursor cell withdraws from the cell cycle and when it becomes a rhodopsin+ rod. We show that FCS arrests rod development in these cultures at a postmitotic, rhodopsin-, pre-rod stage. We present evidence that FCS acts indirectly by stimulating the proliferation of Muller cells, which arrest rod differentiation by releasing leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These findings identify an inhibitory cell-cell interaction, which may help to explain the long delay that can occur both in vitro and in vivo between cell-cycle withdrawal and rhodopsin expression during rod development.","['Neophytou, C', 'Vernallis, A B', 'Smith, A', 'Raff, M C']","['Neophytou C', 'Vernallis AB', 'Smith A', 'Raff MC']","['Biology Department, University College London, UK. ucbtcne@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '9009-81-8 (Rhodopsin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', '*Embryonic Induction', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Growth Inhibitors/immunology/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Mitosis', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neuroglia/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*embryology', 'Rhodopsin/physiology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Development. 1997 Jun;124(12):2345-54.,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangements of AML1 are frequently associated with several types of human leukemia. Three types of AML1 cDNA isoforms have been described to date; they have been designated AML1a, AML1b, and AML1c. All of these isoforms encode the conserved-Runt domain, which harbors the DNA binding and heterodimerization activities. We have identified a new isoform of the AML1 transcript, termed AML1 deltaN, in which exon 1 is directly connected to exon 4 by alternative splicing. The AML1 deltaN transcript was detected in various hematopoietic cell lines of lymphoid to myeloid cell origin, as revealed by RNase protection and reverse transcriptase PCR analyses. The protein product of AML1 deltaN lacks the N-terminal region of AML1, including half of the Runt domain, and neither binds to DNA nor heterodimerizes with the beta subunit. However, AML1 deltaN was found to interfere with the transactivation activity of PEBP2, and the molecular region responsible for this activity was identified. Stable expression of AML1 deltaN in 32Dcl3 myeloid cells blocked granulocytic differentiation in response to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. These results suggest that AML1 deltaN acts as a modulator of AML1 function and serves as a useful tool to dissect the functional domains in the C-terminal region of AML1.","['Zhang, Y W', 'Bae, S C', 'Huang, G', 'Fu, Y X', 'Lu, J', 'Ahn, M Y', 'Kanno, Y', 'Kanno, T', 'Ito, Y']","['Zhang YW', 'Bae SC', 'Huang G', 'Fu YX', 'Lu J', 'Ahn MY', 'Kanno Y', 'Kanno T', 'Ito Y']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (run protein, Drosophila)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Dimerization', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jul;17(7):4133-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.7.4133.,,,7,['10.1128/MCB.17.7.4133 [doi]'],,PMC232267,,['GENBANK/D89788'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These t-AMLs display distinct cytogenetic alterations, most often disrupting the MLL gene on chromosome 11q23 within a breakpoint cluster region (bcr) of 8.3 kb. We recently identified a unique site within the MLL bcr that is highly susceptible to DNA double-strand cleavage by classic topo II inhibitors (e.g., etoposide and doxorubicin). Here, we report that site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr can be induced by either catalytic topo II inhibitors, genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents which do not target topo II, or nongenotoxic stimuli of apoptotic cell death, suggesting that this site-specific cleavage is part of a generalized cellular response to an apoptotic stimulus. We also show that site-specific cleavage within the MLL bcr can be linked to the higher-order chromatin fragmentation that occurs during the initial stages of apoptosis, possibly through cleavage of DNA loops at their anchorage sites to the nuclear matrix. In addition, we show that site-specific cleavage is conserved between species, as specific DNA cleavage can also be demonstrated within the murine MLL locus. Lastly, site-specific cleavage during apoptosis can also be identified at the AML1 locus, a locus which is also frequently involved in chromosomal rearrangements present in t-AML patients. In conclusion, these results suggest the potential involvement of higher-order chromatin fragmentation which occurs as a part of a generalized apoptotic response in a mechanism leading to chromosomal translocation of the MLL and AML1 genes and subsequent t-AML.","['Stanulla, M', 'Wang, J', 'Chervinsky, D S', 'Thandla, S', 'Aplan, P D']","['Stanulla M', 'Wang J', 'Chervinsky DS', 'Thandla S', 'Aplan PD']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Species Specificity', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jul;17(7):4070-9. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.7.4070.,,['CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],7,['10.1128/MCB.17.7.4070 [doi]'],,PMC232260,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported a boundary of megabase-sized GC% mosaic domains at the junction area between major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes II and III, proposing it as a possible chromosome band boundary. DNA replication timing during the S phase is known to be correlated cytogenetically with chromosome band zones, and thus the band boundaries have been predicted to contain a switch point for DNA replication timing. In this study, to identify to the nucleotide sequence level the replication switch point during the S phase, we determined the precise DNA replication timing for MHC classes II and III, focusing on the junction area. To do this, we used PCR-based quantitation of nascent DNA obtained from synchronized human myeloid leukemia HL60 cells. The replication timing changed precisely in the boundary region with a 2-h difference between the two sides, supporting the prediction that this region may be a chromosome band boundary. We supposed that replication fork movement terminates (pauses) or significantly slows in the switch region, which contains dense Alu clusters; polypurine/polypyrimidine tracts; di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide repeats; and medium-reiteration-frequency sequences. Because the nascent DNA in the switch region was recovered at low efficiency, we investigated whether this region is associated with the nuclear scaffold and found three scaffold-associated regions in and around the switch region.","['Tenzen, T', 'Yamagata, T', 'Fukagawa, T', 'Sugaya, K', 'Ando, A', 'Inoko, H', 'Gojobori, T', 'Fujiyama, A', 'Okumura, K', 'Ikemura, T']","['Tenzen T', 'Yamagata T', 'Fukagawa T', 'Sugaya K', 'Ando A', 'Inoko H', 'Gojobori T', 'Fujiyama A', 'Okumura K', 'Ikemura T']","['Department of Evolutionary Genetics, National Institute of Genetics, and The Graduate University for Advanced Studies, Shizuoka-ken, Japan. ttenzen@ddbj.nig.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Evolution', 'DNA Primers', '*DNA Replication', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Replicon', 'Time Factors']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jul;17(7):4043-50. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.7.4043.,,['R012664/PHS HHS/United States'],7,['10.1128/MCB.17.7.4043 [doi]'],,PMC232257,,['GENBANK/AB000565'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, PIF was constitutively activated in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-transformed MT-2 cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that PIF is Egr-1 based on its recognition by anti-Egr-1 antisera in gel mobility shift assays, even though the IL-2Rbeta DNA binding motif differed substantially from the canonical Egr-1 binding site. In addition, Egr-1 bound to the Sp binding site. In Jurkat cells, both sites were required for maximal IL-2Rbeta promoter activity, and in HeLaS3 cells, transfection of Egr-1 could drive activity of a reporter construct containing both sites. Moreover, Sp1 and Egr-1 could form a complex with kinetics that correlated with the production of Egr-1 in Jurkat cells upon PMA stimulation. Thus, Sp1 and Egr-1 physically and functionally cooperate to mediate maximal IL-2Rbeta promoter activity.","['Lin, J X', 'Leonard, W J']","['Lin JX', 'Leonard WJ']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-1674, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (IL15RA protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-15)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (SP3 protein, human)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '148710-94-5 (Sp3 Transcription Factor)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-15', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sp3 Transcription Factor', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1997 Jul;17(7):3714-22. doi: 10.1128/MCB.17.7.3714.,,,7,['10.1128/MCB.17.7.3714 [doi]'],,PMC232223,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ADAMs closest known homologues are the type III reprolysin enzymes which have been demonstrated to be, among other things potent type IV collagenases. ADAMs are putative membrane linked proteins with several domains including a metalloproteinase domain, a potential integrin binding domain, a cysteine rich sequence and an EGF like sequence. They have been implicated in a wide variety of functions including basement membrane degradation and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. We have used RT-PCR and Northern blotting to characterise the expression of members of this family in cells derived from a variety of haematological malignancies including leukaemia (HL60 and Jurkat), erythroleukaemia (K562), lymphoma (U937 and Cupillo) and myeloma (U266B1). We find clear expression of four members of this novel family of proteins but note differences in the expression levels of each member. The ADAMs known as MADM (ADAM10), MCMP (ADAM12, MDC9) and Metargidin (ADAM15) which all possess potentially active metalloproteinase domains are expressed in all these cell types to significant levels. The putative tumour suppressor gene MDC (ADAM11) is expressed at very low levels in all cells examined. As ADAMs may have both potential metalloproteinase activity and adhesive domains we wish to explore the role of these proteins with regard to pathophysiology of haematological malignancy such as egression of leukaemic cells from the bone marrow.","['Wu, E', 'Croucher, P I', 'McKie, N']","['Wu E', 'Croucher PI', 'McKie N']","['Department of Human Metabolism and Clinical Biochemistry, University of Sheffield Medical School, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA, Complementary', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Humans', 'Integrins/chemistry/genetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*genetics', 'Metalloendopeptidases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/18 00:00,1997/06/18 00:01,['1997/06/18 00:00'],"['1997/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Jun 18;235(2):437-42. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6714.,,,2,"['S0006-291X(97)96714-0 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6714 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used liposomes to deliver nuclease-resistant antisense oligonucleotides (oligos) that are specific for the GRB2 or CRKL mRNA to leukemic cells to specifically downregulate Grb2 or Crkl protein expression. We found that by downregulating Grb2 or Crkl protein expression, Grb2 or Crkl antisense oligos could selectively inhibit the growth of Bcr-Abl positive cells, but not that of Bcr-Abl negative cells.

Remembering the generalization from the literature that most patients with ET who are to have a catastrophic thrombosis either have it at the time of diagnosis or after preceding, less severe thrombotic symptoms, it is acceptable to omit myelosuppressive therapy in asymptomatic patients with ET. Young patients with PV and no thrombotic manifestations can similarly be managed with phlebotomy alone. There is no evidence in the literature to show that myelosuppressive therapy should be used simply because the platelet count is high or to prevent transition to myeloid metaplasia. In patients with ET or PV with previous thrombotic manifestations, the risk/benefit ratio probably favors myelosuppressive therapy. The PVSG studies also suggest that patients over the age of 70 with PV are at particular risk for thrombosis and should be treated with myelosuppression. No myelosuppressive agent has been shown to be superior to hydroxyurea. Patients who fail on hydroxyurea should not be treated with 32P or alkylating agents. Anagrelide or interferon would be more appropriate. The PVSG-05 study suggests that high doses of aspirin, i.e. approximately 1.0 grams per day, are not indicated. Trials of low dose aspirin to prevent thrombosis are encouraged. There is no way to predict which patients will have hemorrhagic complications and, as mentioned, one study suggests that there will be few (44). Patients with thrombocytosis and pathological bleeding, i.e. hemorrhagic thrombocythemia, generally improve with myelosuppressive therapy. This syndrome is to be distinguished from patients who bleed with normal or low platelet counts, generally in the setting of myeloid metaplasia (14). These patients have an acquired disorder of platelet function due to platelet production from abnormal megakaryocytes. An occasional patient will benefit from increasing the platelet count by splenectomy.","['Murphy, S']",['Murphy S'],"['Thomas Jefferson University, American Red Cross Blood Services, Penn-Jersey Region, Philadelphia, PA 19123, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,,IM,"['*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Hemorrhage/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/complications/*therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/complications/therapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/therapy', 'Thrombosis/*complications']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1997 Jul;78(1):622-6.,46,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A1-Pi is expressed and induced in liver during inflammatory responses but can also be produced by epithelial cells. Since hepatocyte A1-Pi production is stimulated by interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other gp130-cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OM), we investigated the role of these cytokines in regulating A1-Pi in lung epithelial cells. We show that OM, a monocyte and T cell product, can specifically and potently induce A1-Pi production in lung-derived A549 alveolar (epithelial) cells, as well as in liver-derived HepG2 cells. Both A1-Pi protein (as detected by ELISA and Western blots) and mRNA levels were enhanced 20-fold to 30-fold in A549 cells. OM was also able to stimulate the expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 in these cells. Interestingly, other members of the IL-6 family (IL-6 and LIF) had little or no effect on A549 cells, and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) also had no stimulatory effect on A1-Pi synthesis in A549 cells. Costimulation with IL-1 beta resulted in a decrease in A1-Pi production from OM-stimulated A549 cells. However, IL-6 production was synergistically enhanced. OM was also able to stimulate A1-Pi production from a bronchial epithelial primary cell line, whereas an intestinal epithelial cell line HT29 responded to IL-6 but not OM. These results suggest that lung levels A1-Pi could be derived not only from liver and inflammatory cells but also from epithelial cells, which can be upregulated on stimulation by OM. This may have implications for regulation of local activity of human neutrophil elastase (HNE) in such diseases as emphysema and cystic fibrosis.","['Sallenave, J M', 'Tremblay, G M', 'Gauldie, J', 'Richards, C D']","['Sallenave JM', 'Tremblay GM', 'Gauldie J', 'Richards CD']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Bronchiolo-Alveolar', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Epithelium/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/*biosynthesis/*drug effects/genetics']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997 Jun;17(6):337-46. doi: 10.1089/jir.1997.17.337.,,,6,['10.1089/jir.1997.17.337 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With both IFNs, the cells from CML patients appeared slightly but not significantly more sensitive to inhibition than the cells from normal donors.

MATERIALS AND TREATMENT: In vitro (cells). Arachidonic acid (AA) stimulated rat basophilic leukemia, (RBL) cells; A23817 activated neutrophils (human rat, and rabbit), macrophages (rat), and blood (human). In vitro (enzyme activity). RBL-cell homogenate; purified human recombinant 5-LO. In vivo: Rat (Sprague-Dawley) models in which peritoneal leukotriene products were measured after challenge with zymosan (3 animals per group), A23187 (11 animals per group), and immune complexes (3-5 animals per group), respectively. METHODS: 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) and dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (diHETEs, including LTB4) were measured as radiolabeled products (derived from [14C]-AA) or by absorbance at 235 or 280 nm, respectively, after separation by HPLC. Radiolabeled 5-HPETE was measured by a radio-TLC analyser after separation by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Deacylation of membrane bound [14C]-AA was determined by measuring radiolabel released into the extracellular medium. 5-LO translocation from cytosol to membrane was assessed by western analysis. Rat peritoneal fluid was assayed for PGE, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, LTE4 or LTB4 content by EIA and for TXB2 by RIA. RESULTS: Tenidap suppressed 5-LO mediated product production in cultured rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells from exogenously supplied AA, and in human and rat neutrophils, and rat peritoneal macrophages stimulated with A23187 (IC50, 5-15 microM). In addition, tenidap was less potent in inhibiting the release of radiolabeled AA from RBL-1 cells (IC50, 180 microM), suggesting that the decrease in 5-LO derived products could not be explained by an effect on cellular mobilization of AA (i.e., phospholipase). Tenidap blocked 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) production by dissociated RBL-1 cell preparations (IC50, 7 microM), as well as by a 100000 x g supernatant of 5-LO/hydroperoxidase activity, suggesting a direct effect on the 5-LO enzyme itself. In addition, tenidap impaired 5-LO translocation from cytosol to its membrane-bound docking protein (FLAP) which occurs when human neutrophils are stimulated with calcium ionophore, indicating a second mechanism for inhibiting the 5-LO pathway. Surprisingly, tenidap did not block the binding of radiolabeled MK-0591, an indole ligand of FLAP, to neutrophil membranes. Although its ability to inhibit the cyclooxygenase pathway was readily observed in whole blood and in vivo, tenidap's 5-LO blockade could not be demonstrated by ionophore stimulated human blood, nor after oral dosing in rat models in which peritoneal leukotriene products were measured after challenge with three different stimuli. The presence of extracellular proteins greatly reduced the potency of tenidap as a 5-LO inhibitor in vitro, suggesting that protein binding is responsible for loss of activity in animal models. CONCLUSIONS: Tenidap inhibits 5-lipoxygenase activity in vitro both directly and indirectly by interfering with its translocation from cytosol to the membrane compartment in neutrophils. A potential mechanism for the latter effect is discussed with reference to tenidap's ability to lower intracellular pH. Tenidap did not inhibit 5-LO pathway activity in three animal models.","['Carty, T J', 'Sweeney, F J', 'Griffiths, R J', 'Eskra, J D', 'Ernest, M J', 'Pillar, J S', 'Cheng, J D', 'Loose, L D', 'Joseph, P A', 'Pazoles, P P', 'Moore, P F', 'Nagahisa, A', 'Murase, S', 'Kadin, S B']","['Carty TJ', 'Sweeney FJ', 'Griffiths RJ', 'Eskra JD', 'Ernest MJ', 'Pillar JS', 'Cheng JD', 'Loose LD', 'Joseph PA', 'Pazoles PP', 'Moore PF', 'Nagahisa A', 'Murase S', 'Kadin SB']","['Central Research Division, Pfizer Inc., Groton, CT 06340, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

The patterns of the main enzymes involved in purine nucleotide metabolism (those of the salvage pathway and catabolism) were estimated by a radiochemical method. Although the data expressed in relation to cells and protein showed some discrepancies, several common differences were evident in both cases. The main differences were an increase in NAD and IMP, a sharp decrease in 5'-nucleotidase activities and in total guanylate content and synthesis, and an increase in the A/G ratio in lymphocytes of patients with respect to controls. The changes in these parameters in CLL indicate an imbalance in purine metabolism and may play a specific role in the biology of the leukemia cell.

METHODS: Ten patients with leukemia were transplanted with allogeneic blood cells from HLA-identical sex-mismatched siblings; blood cells were mobilized with recombinant rhG-CSF. Up to 6 months after transplantation, blood and bone marrow samples were obtained from the recipient and analyzed for the presence of donor cells, using fluorescence in situ hybridization with specific probes hybridizing to sex chromosomes. RESULTS: Analysis of blood and bone marrow smears demonstrated a complete chimera, as early as day 15 after transplantation. Furthermore, marrow and blood CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD34+ cells were sorted using direct immunofluorescence and flow cytometry: fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis on sorted cells demonstrated that most progenitors and most cells in the T- and B-cell lineages were of donor origin as early as day 15 after transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Together with recently reported results, this study demonstrates that allogeneic rhG-CSF-mobilized blood cells contain primitive hematopoietic progenitors that can repopulate all lymphoid and myeloid lineages. Establishment of chimerism seems to be quick and stable, including the T- and B-cell lineages. Although establishment of chimerism in mitogen-responsive T cells is readily assayable with conventional cytogenetics, our study provides additional insight on the reconstitution of the B lineage and T-cell subsets after allogeneic transplantation in patients with leukemia.","['Chabannon, C', 'Lafage, M', 'Mozziconacci, M J', 'Faucher, C', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Blaise, D']","['Chabannon C', 'Lafage M', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Faucher C', 'Maraninchi D', 'Blaise D']","['Departement de Transfert de Gene et de Therapie Genique, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre Regional de Lutte Contre le Cancer, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*transplantation', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1997 Jun 15;63(11):1646-52. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199706150-00019.,,,11,['10.1097/00007890-199706150-00019 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological findings were supplemented by Southern blots using Ig-JH-, TCRbeta- and bcr-probes. Patients in BC (n = 30) expressed high proportions of CD10, CD20, CD33, CD34 and low degrees of a mature myeloid marker (CD15). Myeloid BC bone marrow (BM) cells showed a high degree of coexpression of unusual, lineage restricted markers: 25% of CD15-positive cells also expressed markers like CD10, CD20 or CD34. In contrast, BM cells in lymphoid BC did not show this coexpression.

Grafts were studied at a median of 37 (SD 48.43) months from transplantation. The light density marrow population from the patients and controls was monocyte- and T-lymphocyte depleted; CD34+ precursors were then selected with immunomagnetic beads (median 90.2 and 92% blasts) and cultured in the progenitor cell assay at a cell density of 5 x 10(3) culture with incremental concentrations of recombinant human growth factors (rhGFs). BMT patients' cultures showed significantly lower colony scores at the lowest cytokine concentrations in both erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-Es) and erythroid colony forming units (CFU-Es) as well as in myeloid lineages; colony forming units-granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM), and did not improve at the highest GF doses. No significant differences in the results were found between the autologous and allogeneic marrow sources. We conclude that following BMT, lineage restricted progenitors within the CD34+ population are significantly reduced, failing to recover even 8 years after transplantation.","['Novitzky, N', 'Mohammed, R']","['Novitzky N', 'Mohammed R']","['The University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology, Groote Schuur Hospital, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1997 Jun;25(6):471-7.,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of ICE, a unique processing enzyme involved in the production of active IL-1 beta, has provided a new approach to specifically block the production of this potent cytokine. Consequently, the discovery and development of inhibitors against the enzyme could hold great promise therapeutically. Potent inhibitors of the enzyme would be useful in the treatment of a number of important inflammatory diseases and potentially in the management of leukemia (Arend, 1993b; Estrov and Talpaz, 1996). A number of key questions must be answered before the therapeutic potential of such inhibitors can be realized. The development of a pharmaceutically acceptable cysteine proteinase inhibitor will almost certainly involve new chemical strategies gauged at safely inactivating the enzyme. For such inhibitors, it will be necessary to achieve selectivity for ICE from among the growing number of ICE family members while retaining potency. It will also be important to establish the level of inhibition of IL-1 beta required to achieve therapeutic efficacy. The studies comparing IL-1 beta- and ICE-deficient mice suggest that complete abrogation of IL-1 beta is required to achieve efficacy in models of inflammation. It is not known if this is the case in humans. Understanding the source of the residual IL-1 beta produced in ICE-deficient mice will be important in order to ascertain if a similar mechanism could generate active IL-1 beta in patients receiving if a ICE inhibitor. As for ICE itself, a number of formidable questions remain regarding its regulation and mechanism of activation. Answering these questions experimentally will present a major challenge due to the extremely low levels of enzyme present in cells. Studies on other family members may provide easier access to some of these questions and provide clues that can be applied to ICE. The components of the pathway involved in IL-1 trafficking and secretion are unknown, as are the mechanisms of ICE activation and regulation. Clearly other cellular proteins that have yet to be discovered will be involved in each of these processes, opening up new avenues of research in this field.","['Tocci, M J']",['Tocci MJ'],"['Department of Molecular Immunology, Merch Research Laboratories, Rahway, New Jersey 07065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Caspase 1', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Protease Inhibitors', 'Substrate Specificity']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 1997;53:27-63. doi: 10.1016/s0083-6729(08)60703-7.,106,,,['10.1016/s0083-6729(08)60703-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prevalences of FeLV and FIV in this population were compared to those in a population of predominantly sick cats. DESIGN AND PROCEDURES: Serum specimens were obtained over a 2-year period from 200 cats older than 1 year of age presented to veterinary clinics for routine procedures, including cat fight injuries or abscesses, vehicular trauma, neutering, dental scaling, vaccination, grooming or boarding. An additional 894 sera were obtained over approximately the same period from specimens submitted by veterinarians to a private clinical pathology laboratory, mainly from sick cars suspected of having immune dysfunction, but including some sera from healthy cats being screened prior to FeLV vaccination. FIV antibody and FeLV antigen were detected in samples using commercial enzyme immunoassays. RESULTS: Amongst 200 'healthy' cats, the prevalence of FeLV infection was 0 to 2%, and the prevalence of FIV was 6.5 to 7.5%, depending on the stringency of the criteria used to define positivity. FIV infection was significantly more prevalent in cats which resided in an inner city environment (P = 0.013). Of the 894 serum specimens submitted to the laboratory by practitioners, 11/761 (1.4%) were FeLV positive, while 148/711 (20.8%) were FIV positive. The prevalence of FIV was significantly higher in these predominantly 'sick' cats than in cats seen for routine veterinary procedures (P < 0.00001), while there was no difference in the prevalence of FeLV (P = 0.75) CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FeLV and FIV in healthy cats may have been substantially overestimated in some previous Australian surveys. FeLV infection would appear to be a rare cause of disease in Australian cats. The higher prevalence of FIV positivity in sick as opposed to healthy cats infers that FIV infection contributes to the development of disease.","['Malik, R', 'Kendall, K', 'Cridland, J', 'Coulston, S', 'Stuart, A J', 'Snow, D', 'Love, D N']","['Malik R', 'Kendall K', 'Cridland J', 'Coulston S', 'Stuart AJ', 'Snow D', 'Love DN']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Sciences, University of Sydney, New South Wales.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Lentivirus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Male', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aust Vet J. 1997 May;75(5):323-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.1997.tb15701.x.,,,5,['10.1111/j.1751-0813.1997.tb15701.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Home address postcodes (PCs) and their map coordinates were identified at birth and at death in children who died from leukaemia or cancer. Potentially hazardous industrial addresses and PCs were listed from business and other directories, and map coordinates obtained from the Central Postcode Directory or else located directly on Ordnance Survey (OS) maps. Railway lines and motorways were digitised from OS maps. Numbers of deaths (and births) at successive radial distances from these hazards were counted and compared with expected numbers. The latter were based on a count of all PCs at similar distances. Relative case density ratios at successive distances from the hazards were obtained from observed and expected numbers, aggregated over similar sites. This was repeated for different hazard types and results were tested for evidence of systematic centrifugal case density gradients. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: All 22,458 children dying from leukaemia or cancer aged 0-15 years, in England, Wales, and Scotland, between 1953 and 1980. MAIN RESULTS: Relative excesses of leukaemias and of solid cancers were found near the following: (1) oil refineries, major oil storage installations, railside oil distribution terminals and factories making bitumen products; (2) motor car factories, coach builders, and car body repairers; (3) major users of petroleum products including manufacturers of solvents, paint sprayers, fibreglass fabricators, paint and varnish makers, plastics and detergent manufacturers, and galvanisers; (4) users of kilns and furnaces including steelworks, power stations, galvanisers, cement makers, brickworks, crematoria and aluminium, zinc, and iron/steel foundries; (5) airfields, railways, motorways and harbours. The findings for leukaemias and for solid cancers were indistinguishable. The hazard proximities of birth addresses were stronger than for death addresses. For children who had moved house between birth and death, the proximity effect was limited to the birth addresses. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancers are geographically associated with two main types of industrial atmospheric effluent namely: (1) petroleum derived volatiles and (2) kiln and furnace smoke and gases, and effluents from internal combustion engines.","['Knox, E G', 'Gilman, E A']","['Knox EG', 'Gilman EA']","['Department of Public Health and Epidemiology, Medical School, University of Birmingham.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demography', 'Humans', 'Industry', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Metallurgy', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Petroleum', 'Population Density', 'Railroads', '*Residence Characteristics', 'Space-Time Clustering', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1997 Apr;51(2):151-9. doi: 10.1136/jech.51.2.151.,,,2,['10.1136/jech.51.2.151 [doi]'],,PMC1060437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety herpes simplex virus (HSV)-seropositive patients aged 18 to 84 years were included. Forty-five patients received acyclovir (800 mg by mouth daily) and 45 placebo. The patients were examined daily for 28 days from the initiation of remission-induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: Fever developed in all patients in both groups. Acyclovir prophylaxis postponed the development of an oral temperature > or = 38.0 degrees C by 3 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1 to 4 days; P = .03) and the initiation of antibacterial treatment by 3 days (95% CI, 1 to 5 days; P = .008). The duration of fever, use of antibacterial treatment, incidence of bacteremia, and need for systemic antifungal therapy were not affected by acyclovir prophylaxis. At fever development, acyclovir prophylaxis affected the incidence and localization pattern of oral ulcers. Thus, in the acyclovir group, the number of nonfungal oral infections was reduced (relative risk, 0.45 [95% CI, 0.24 to 0.85]) and mainly located on the soft palate (relative risk, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.19 to 5.22]).

Given that c-mpl expression carries an adverse prognosis in myelodysplastic syndrome and given the prognostic significance of expression of other growth factor receptors in other diseases, we attempted to determine whether c-mp/mRNA expression is a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed bone marrow samples from 45 newly diagnosed AML patients by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Samples from 27 patients (60%) expressed c-mpl mRNA (c-mpl+); their clinical and laboratory features were compared with those of the 18 patients without detectable levels of c-mpl(c-mpl-). No significant differences in age, sex, leukocyte count, French-American-British subtype, or karyotype group were found. c-mpl+ patients more commonly had secondary AML (41% v 11%; P = .046) and more commonly expressed CD34 (67% v 12%; P = .0004). There was no significant difference in complete remission (CR) rate. However, c-mpl+ patients had shorter CR durations (P = .008; median, 6.0 v > 17.0 months). This was true when only de novo AML patients were considered and when controlling for age, cytogenetics, or CD34 expression. There was a trend toward shorter survival in c-mpl+ patients (P = .058; median, 7.8 v 9.0 months). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that c-mpl expression is an adverse prognostic factor for treatment outcome in adult AML that must be considered in the analysis of clinical studies using thrombopoietin in AML.","['Wetzler, M', 'Baer, M R', 'Bernstein, S H', 'Blumenson, L', 'Stewart, C', 'Barcos, M', 'Mrozek, K', 'Block, A W', 'Herzig, G P', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Wetzler M', 'Baer MR', 'Bernstein SH', 'Blumenson L', 'Stewart C', 'Barcos M', 'Mrozek K', 'Block AW', 'Herzig GP', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department of Hematologic Oncology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. wetzler@dm3100.med.buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2262-8. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2262.,,['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],6,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2262 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial D-xylose absorption studies were conducted in 110 consecutive adult patients admitted to a university-affiliated tertiary care hospital for remission-induction therapy for untreated newly diagnosed AML. Serial serum D-xylose levels were obtained 1 hour after a 5-g oral dose of D-xylose at baseline and weekly for 4 weeks until marrow recovery. These results were correlated with invasive infection using multivariate techniques. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SEM) serum D-xylose levels were 0.88 +/- 0.03, 0.69 +/- 0.03, 0.58 +/- 0.02, 0.53 +/- 0.02, and 0.73 +/- 0.02 mmol/L at baseline and weeks 1 to 4, respectively (P < .0001, analysis of variance [AN-OVA]). Time to malabsorption varied with induction regimen (P = .007, log-rank test). Bloodstream infections during week 2 correlated with malabsorption (P = .007). Neutropenic enterocolitis correlated independently with induction regimen (P = .009), malabsorption at week 2 (P = .02), and the development of candidemia (P = .005). Hepatosplenic fungal infection correlated with induction regimen (P = .03), malabsorption at week 2 (P = .02), and fever at diagnosis (P = .003). Malabsorption was unrelated to the duration of severe neutropenia and the administration of parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: Serial D-xylose absorption studies in subjects with AML produced a characteristic profile of cytotoxic therapy-related damage to the functional integrity of the intestinal epithelium that was regimen dependent, myelosuppression independent, and predictive for invasive infectious complications. Further study to validate these observations appears warranted.","['Bow, E J', 'Loewen, R', 'Cheang, M S', 'Shore, T B', 'Rubinger, M', 'Schacter, B']","['Bow EJ', 'Loewen R', 'Cheang MS', 'Shore TB', 'Rubinger M', 'Schacter B']","['Department of Medicine, University of Manitoba and The Manitoba Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'A1TA934AKO (Xylose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Malabsorption Syndromes/*chemically induced/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Xylose/blood/*pharmacokinetics']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2254-61. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2254.,,,6,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2254 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

German-Austrian Pediatric Hodgkin's Disease Group.,2247-53,"BACKGROUND: In the last two decades, it has become evident that secondary leukemias after Hodgkin's disease (HD) are mainly caused by the treatment with alkylating agents, especially mechlorethamine. Since 1978, the German-Austrian trials for childhood HD have used combined chemoradiotherapy without mechlorethamine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The risk of secondary hematologic malignancies (SHM) was assessed in the total cohort of 667 children treated in four consecutive German-Austrian trials between 1978 and 1990. Primary chemotherapy for stages IA/B and IIA consisted of two cycles of vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, and doxorubicin (OPPA) or OPA (without procarbazine) and, for more advanced stages, of two cycles of OPPA or OPA plus two, four, or six cycles of COPP or COMP (C, cyclophosphamide; M, methotrexate). Radiotherapy was given in the first study to extended fields, and in later trials to involved fields only. In 591 patients, only primary therapy was given; 76 patients (11%) needed additional salvage therapy. The actuarial survival rate at 15 years is 94%. RESULTS: SHM developed in 5 of 667 patients: four acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and one myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The estimated cumulative risk for SHM at 15 years is 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0% to 2.2%). Salvage therapy was a significant risk factor for SHM (relative risk, 7.25; P = .03), whereas age, sex, stage of HD, splenectomy, and amount of alkylating agents were not. CONCLUSION: The observed risk of SHM is smaller than in other studies (adults and children) in which chemotherapy with mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) was given. This difference can be attributed to the lower cumulative doses of alkylating agents, the absence of mechlorethamine in the chemotherapy, and the small number of patients who needed salvage therapy in the presented cohort. In general, differences in the incidence of SHM after HD reflect complex differences between treatment strategies.","['Schellong, G', 'Riepenhausen, M', 'Creutzig, U', 'Ritter, J', 'Harbott, J', 'Mann, G', 'Gadner, H']","['Schellong G', 'Riepenhausen M', 'Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Harbott J', 'Mann G', 'Gadner H']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Munster, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'COPP protocol', 'MOPP protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Mechlorethamine/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Procarbazine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2247-53. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2247.,,,6,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2247 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 45 children studied, 26 received busulfan-cyclophosphamide (Bu-Cy) in preparation for transplantation and 19 received TBI. TBI was fractionated in nine cases and delivered as a single dose in 10. Four children in the Bu-Cy group and none in the TBI group had received prior cranial radiation. The mean follow-up duration after BMT was 5.9 years for the whole group. RESULTS: The mean cumulative changes in height SD score (SDS) were -0.86 at 3 years and -1.56 at 5 years in the TBI group, whereas these changes were only -0.05 and -0.17 in the Bu-Cy group (P < .01 at 3 and 5 years). The 6-year probability of hypothyroidism was 9% +/- 8% in the Bu-Cy group and 43% +/- 15% after TBI (P < .02). Pubertal development after Bu-Cy was assessable in two girls and five boys: both girls had primary ovarian failure, whereas Leydig cell function appeared to be preserved in the five boys. One child who had received anthracycline when he was less than 1 year old developed cardiac dysfunction 4 years after Bu-Cy. The 6-year probability of cataracts was 70% +/- 13% in the TBI group and 0% after Bu-Cy. CONCLUSION: The use of Bu-Cy represents an alternative transplant cytoreductive regimen for children with AML in first CR, which can reduce the risk of posttransplant growth impairment, thyroid dysfunction, Leydig cell damage, and the incidence of cataracts.","['Michel, G', 'Socie, G', 'Gebhard, F', 'Bernaudin, F', 'Thuret, I', 'Vannier, J P', 'Demeocq, F', 'Leverger, G', 'Pico, J L', 'Rubie, H', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Reiffers, J', 'Gratecos, N', 'Troussard, X', 'Jouet, J P', 'Simonin, G', 'Gluckman, E', 'Maraninchi, D']","['Michel G', 'Socie G', 'Gebhard F', 'Bernaudin F', 'Thuret I', 'Vannier JP', 'Demeocq F', 'Leverger G', 'Pico JL', 'Rubie H', 'Mechinaud F', 'Reiffers J', 'Gratecos N', 'Troussard X', 'Jouet JP', 'Simonin G', 'Gluckman E', 'Maraninchi D']","[""Hopital d'Enfants La Timone and the Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France. gmichel@ap_hm.fr""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Growth/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Puberty/*drug effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2238-46. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2238.,,,6,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2238 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group.,2231-7,"PURPOSE: The translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), known as Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1) or its molecular equivalent the expression of BCR-ABL-mRNA, is one of the most striking and well-characterized cytogenetic abnormalities in leukemia. Although investigated for more than 30 years, it remains unclear whether the Ph1 is an independent risk factor for outcome of leukemia or not. METHODS: A matched-pair analysis was performed within a homogeneous group of patients, which consisted of children who presented with a first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated according to ALL relapse trials (ALL-REZ BFM) protocols. A total of 307 patients were eligible for this analysis: 30 positive and 277 negative for Ph1. Positive patients were matched exactly for time point of relapse (on [during] or off [after cessation of] front-line therapy), site, and immunophenotype, and as close as possible for duration of first remission, peripheral blast-cell count, WBC count, and year of relapse diagnosis. RESULTS: The probability of event-free survival is 0.46 at 5 years for negative and 0.11 for positive patients, respectively (P = .0006). Multivariate analysis showed risk ratios of 4.229 for relapse on therapy, 3.561 for Ph1 and/or expression of BCR-ABL- mRNA, 1.691 for high peripheral blast-cell count, and 0.232 for bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSION: It was shown that the Ph1 is indeed an independent risk factor in childhood relapsed ALL. There are striking similarities between these patients and children at initial diagnosis, as well as adult patients. Therefore, it is highly suggestive that the Ph1 is also an independent risk factor under all of these circumstances.","['Beyermann, B', 'Adams, H P', 'Henze, G']","['Beyermann B', 'Adams HP', 'Henze G']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Children's Hospital, Virchow Medical Center, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Matched-Pair Analysis', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/genetics/therapy', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Probability', 'Risk Factors']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2231-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2231.,,,6,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2231 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to improve EFS further, CCG investigators formulated an augmented BFM (A-BFM) regimen that provides prolonged, intensified postinduction chemotherapy relative to the CCG-modified BFM regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We tested A-BFM in 101 patients with ALL and unfavorable presenting features that showed slow early response (SER) to induction therapy who attained remission on day 28. Their outcome was compared with that of 251 concurrent patients with unfavorable presenting features, a rapid early response to therapy (RER), and remission by day 28, treated with CCG-BFM with or without cranial radiation (CRT). RESULTS: The 4-year EFS rate from the end of induction for SER patients treated with A-BFM was 70.8% +/- 4.6%. Seventeen patients remain in continuous remission beyond 5 years. Vincristine (VCR) neurotoxicity developed in 50% of patients, but was rarely debilitating. Allergies to Escherichia coli L-asparaginase (L-ASP) occurred in 35% of patients. Avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) developed in 9% of patients. In comparison, a concurrent RER group treated with standard BFM +/- CRT had a 4-year EFS rate of 73.1% +/- 4.6%. CONCLUSION: The toxicity of A-BFM is significant, but acceptable. Compared with historical control SER patients treated with CCG-modified BFM, A-BFM therapy appears to produce a significant improvement in EFS. This is the first study to show that intensive chemotherapy, as given in the A-BFM regimen, can abrogate the adverse prognostic significance of SER.","['Nachman, J', 'Sather, H N', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Lukens, J N', 'Wolff, L', 'Trigg, M E']","['Nachman J', 'Sather HN', 'Gaynon PS', 'Lukens JN', 'Wolff L', 'Trigg ME']","['University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Tables', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jun;15(6):2222-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2222.,,"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",6,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.6.2222 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we sought to determine the influence of leukemic cell apparent maturational stage on treatment outcomes in pediatric T-lineage ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1983 through 1993, 407 pediatric T-lineage ALL patients were enrolled onto two sequential series of risk-adjusted treatment protocols of the Children's Cancer Group. In the current analysis, T-lineage ALL patients were immunophenotypically classified as follows: CD7+ CD2- CD5- pro-thymocyte leukemia (pro-TL), CD7+ (CD2 or CD5)+ CD3- immature TL, and CD7+ CD2+ CD5+ CD3+ mature TL. RESULTS: Similar induction outcomes of 91.4%, 97.1%, and 98.3% were obtained by the pro-, immature, and mature TL groups, respectively. Four-year event-free survival (EFS) was lower for pro-TL patients (57.1%; SD = 8.4%,) compared with immature and mature TL patients (68.5%; SD = 3.5%; and 77.1%; SD = 4.0%, respectively) with an overall significance of .05 (log-rank test) or .04 (log-rank trend test). Relative hazards rates (RHR) were 2.11 and 1.22 for pro-TL and immature TL versus mature TL, respectively.

Evidence for participation of multiple signaling pathways which converge at Ras.,16631-6,"Chimeric receptors containing the entire or various cytoplasmic domains of either gp130 or leukemia inhibitory factor receptor alpha (LIFR) were used to identify signaling molecules and regions of these polypeptides required for the stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Coexpression of dominant-negative Jak2 inhibited chimeric receptor-stimulated MAPK activity by approximately 70%, while expression of dominant-negative Ras completely blocked MAPK activation by either receptor polypeptide. Deletion analysis identified a 24-amino acid region of gp130 that was necessary for maximal stimulation of MAPK, and contained box 3 (positions 120-129) and a consensus tyrosine binding motif (Tyr-118) for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase, SHP2. Expression of receptors lacking this region or of chimeric gp130(Y118F) point mutants inhibited MAPK activity by approximately 55%, suggesting that Tyr-118, but not box 3, was required during activation of MAPK by gp130. Similarly, expression of chimeric LIFR constructs lacking box 3 maximally stimulated MAPK activity, while those lacking Tyr-115, a putative SHP2 binding site, inhibited stimulation of MAPK by this polypeptide. Our results demonstrate that gp130 and LIFR stimulate MAPK activity through box 3-independent mechanisms involving: (i) effects at Tyr-118 and Tyr-115, respectively, for maximal stimulation of MAPK activity and (ii) a Jak/Tyk-dependent pathway that, together with Tyr-118- or Tyr-115-generated signals, converges at the level of Ras during activation of MAPK by cytokine.","['Schiemann, W P', 'Bartoe, J L', 'Nathanson, N M']","['Schiemann WP', 'Bartoe JL', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', '*Genes, ras', 'Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', '*Growth Inhibitors', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', '*Lymphokines', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1997/06/27 00:00,1997/06/27 00:01,['1997/06/27 00:00'],"['1997/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jun 27;272(26):16631-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.26.16631.,,"['GM07018/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07750/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30410/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",26,"['10.1074/jbc.272.26.16631 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)70145-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the activation of STAT proteins induced by interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or erythropoietin (EPO) using the human leukemia cell line, UT-7, which requires these cytokines for growth. IL-3, GM-CSF, and EPO induced DNA-binding activity to the oligonucleotides corresponding to the sis-inducible elements (SIE) of c-fos, in addition to the beta-casein promoter (beta-CAP), SIE- and beta-CAP-binding proteins were identical to Stat1alpha and Stat3 complex and to Stat5 protein, respectively. This indicates that IL-3, GM-CSF, and EPO commonly activated Stat1alpha, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins in UT-7. However, EPO hardly activated Stat1alpha and Stat3 in UT-7/GM, which is a subline of UT-7 that grows slightly in response to EPO. Transfection studies revealed that UT-7/GM cells constitutively expressing Stat1alpha, but not Stat3, can grow as well in response to EPO as GM-CSF, suggesting that Stat1alpha is involved in the EPO-induced proliferation of UT-7.

In humans and rodents, two major forms of leptin receptors (OB-R) are expressed. The short form (OB-RS), considered to lack signaling capability, is detected in many organs. In contrast, OB-R long form (OB-RL) predominates in the hypothalamus, but is also present at low levels in peripheral tissues. Transient transfection experiments have demonstrated that OB-RL transduces an intracellular signaling similar to interleukin (IL)-6 type-cytokine receptors. To define the specificity by which OB-R induces genes and cooperates with signal transduction pathways utilized by other hormones and cytokines, rat and human hepatoma cell lines were generated which stably express human OB-RL. Hepatoma cell lines selected for appreciable levels of OB-RL mRNA display enhanced leptin binding and responded to leptin with an IL-6 receptor-like signaling that includes the activation of STAT proteins, induction of acute-phase plasma proteins, and synergism with IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. A leptin-mediated recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to insulin receptor substrate-2 was also detected. However, no significant tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-2 and modulation of the immediate cell response to insulin were observed. The data suggest that OB-RL action in hepatic cells is equivalent to that of IL-6 receptor. However, leptin does not play a specific role in muting insulin action on hepatoma cells and therefore may not contribute to the diabetic symptoms associated with obesity.","['Wang, Y', 'Kuropatwinski, K K', 'White, D W', 'Hawley, T S', 'Hawley, R G', 'Tartaglia, L A', 'Baumann, H']","['Wang Y', 'Kuropatwinski KK', 'White DW', 'Hawley TS', 'Hawley RG', 'Tartaglia LA', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (leptin receptor, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leptin', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/drug effects', 'Proteins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, Leptin', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/27 00:00,1997/06/27 00:01,['1997/06/27 00:00'],"['1997/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jun 27;272(26):16216-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.26.16216.,,['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],26,"['10.1074/jbc.272.26.16216 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)70090-2 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although ABL kinase activity has been shown to be required for the transforming abilities of BCR-ABL and numerous substrates of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase have been identified, the requirement of most of these substrates for the transforming function of BCR-ABL is unknown. In this study we mapped a direct binding site of the c-CBL proto-oncogene to the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL. This interaction only occurs under conditions where c-CBL is tyrosine-phosphorylated. Despite the direct interaction of c-CBL with the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL, deletion of the SH2 domain of BCR-ABL did not result in an alteration in the complex formation of BCR-ABL and c-CBL, suggesting that another site of direct interaction between c-CBL and BCR-ABL exists or that another protein mediates an indirect interaction of c-CBL and BCR-ABL. Since CRKL, an SH2, SH3 domain-containing adapter protein is known to bind directly to BCR-ABL and also binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated c-CBL, the ability of CRKL to mediate a complex between c-CBL and BCR-ABL was examined.","['Bhat, A', 'Kolibaba, K', 'Oda, T', 'Ohno-Jones, S', 'Heaney, C', 'Druker, B J']","['Bhat A', 'Kolibaba K', 'Oda T', 'Ohno-Jones S', 'Heaney C', 'Druker BJ']","['Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CRKL protein)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1997/06/27 00:00,1997/06/27 00:01,['1997/06/27 00:00'],"['1997/06/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jun 27;272(26):16170-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.26.16170.,,['CA65823/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],26,"['10.1074/jbc.272.26.16170 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)70083-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under some circumstances, bryostatin 1 may lead to enhanced conversion of ara-C to its lethal metabolite, ara-CTP. However, bryostatin 1 is able to potentiate ara-C-mediated cytotoxicity in the absence of metabolic perturbations, presumably by modulating the cell death pathway itself. For example, chronic exposure of cells to bryostatin 1 leads to PKC down-regulation, which may alter the balance between survival (e.g., ERK) versus stress (e.g., SAPK/JNK)-related pathways. The ability of bryostatin 1 to enhance ara-C-mediated apoptosis is inversely related to its capacity to induce leukemic cell maturation and may involve the failure to down-regulate expression of the cell cycle progression-related proto-oncogene, c-myc. Finally, recent evidence suggests that bryostatin 1 may act, through modification of Bcl-2 phosphorylation status, at a distal site in the cell death pathway.

The progression to acute myeloid leukemia adds to morbidity and mortality. Supportive care including red blood cell and platelet transfusions are still the cornerstone of therapeutic management. However, the clinical use of the recombinant hematopoietic growth factors has enlarged the range of therapeutic applications in patients with MDS. It is possible to reverse neutropenia in MDS patients by administration of G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) or GM-CSF (granulocyte-monocyte colony stimulating factor). Because of the lower incidence of adverse events, G-CSF is preferable. However, neither G-CSF nor GM-CSF have been shown to reduce the rate of severe infection or mortality from infection when given prophylactically. In the case of a severe infection, therapeutic administration of G-CSF together with antibiotics might be justified in otherwise neutropenic MDS patients. Preliminary data suggest it to be possible to identify MDS patients with a higher than 50% chance of reversal of anemia or transfusion dependency by treatment with high-dose erythropoietin (EPO).

Predisposing factors that have been identified include cytotoxic chemotherapy, benzene and other environmental mutagens, and bone marrow transplantation. Clinically patients present with effects of deficiency of erythrocytes, neutrophils and/or platelets or the diagnosis may be made unexpectedly after routine blood testing. The bone marrow is generally hypercellular and often disorganized; abnormal in vitro cell growth is common. Non-random cytogenetic abnormalities are characteristic and helpful diagnostically; certain subtypes are associated with specific clinical and cytological features. Especially noteworthy are the 5q- and 7-syndromes. The outlook generally is poor. Death comes about from transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), from the complications of cytopenias, or from intercurrent illness. Treatment is unsatisfactory except in young patients who can undergo allografting. Treatments of uncertain value include intensive or gentle chemotherapy. Of the cytokines erythropoietin and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) so far seem the most promising.

In the present study, we have isolated polysaccharide fraction of Cordyceps sinensis (PSCS) and investigated its effect on the proliferation and differentiation of human leukemic U937 cells using an in vitro culture system. Our results showed that the conditioned medium from PSCS (10 microg/ml)-stimulated blood mononuclear cells (PSCS-MNC-CM) had an activity that could significantly inhibit the proliferation of U937 cells resulting in a growth inhibition rate of 78-83%. Furthermore, PSCS-MNC-CM treatment induced about 50% of the cells differentiating into mature monocytes/macrophages expressing nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity and the surface antigens of CD11b, CD14, and CD 68. Yet, the differentiated U937 cells also had functions of phagocytosis and superoxide production. However, PSCS alone or normal MNC-CM had no such effects. The levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-1 were very low in normal MNC-CM, and they were greatly increased in MNC-CM prepared with PSCS stimulation. Antibody neutralization studies further revealed that the tumoricidal and differentiating effects of PSCS-MNC-CM were mainly derived from the elevated cytokines, especially IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. These two cytokines acted synergistically on inhibiting cell growth and inducing differentiation of the target U937 cells.","['Chen, Y J', 'Shiao, M S', 'Lee, S S', 'Wang, S Y']","['Chen YJ', 'Shiao MS', 'Lee SS', 'Wang SY']","['Department of Medical Research, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polysaccharides)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Plant Extracts/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', '*Plants, Medicinal/chemistry', 'Polysaccharides/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 1997;60(25):2349-59. doi: 10.1016/s0024-3205(97)00291-9.,,,25,"['S0024320597002919 [pii]', '10.1016/s0024-3205(97)00291-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rex functions have been attributed to at least three separate domains of the protein determining nuclear/nucleolar accumulation and RNA binding (overlapping), multimerization, and nuclear export of Rex-responsive RNA. The steady-state intracellular localization of functional Rex molecules is mainly nucleolar. Fusions of wild-type Rex and the ligand binding domain of human estrogen receptor (ER) produced conditional molecules (ERRex and ERalaRex), which remained cytoplasmic in the absence of hormone and in response to hormone colocalized with the nuclear pore complex (NPC). These molecules induced in a hormone-dependent manner the expression of a Rex reporter plasmid and of the HTLV-1 Env protein and fusion of Env expressing cells. In contrast, activation domain mutants (ERRex delta and ERRexGly) translocated from the cytoplasm and acquired a diffuse nuclear localization. These mutants did not associate with the NPC and failed to show any of the expected Rex functions. Rex functions were perturbed by inactivating the RNA binding domain (mutant ERM2) or the oligomerization domain (mutant ERM7). However, these two mutant fusion proteins exhibited a hormone-dependent NPC colocalization. These observations provide in vivo evidence that intranuclear translocation of intact Rex to the NPC is dependent exclusively on a functional activation domain and is not influenced by binding to the target RNA.","['Rehberger, S', 'Gounari, F', 'DucDodon, M', 'Chlichlia, K', 'Gazzolo, L', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Khazaie, K']","['Rehberger S', 'Gounari F', 'DucDodon M', 'Chlichlia K', 'Gazzolo L', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Khazaie K']","['Department of Tumour Immunology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, rex/chemistry/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Envelope/*metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Estrogen/chemistry', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 Jun 15;233(2):363-71. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3562.,,,2,"['S0014-4827(97)93562-X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3562 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the maturation-resistant NB4-R1 subclone, retinoids failed to downregulate Bcl-2 even in the situation of apoptosis massively induced by pan-agonists and RXR-selective agonists. We observed that NB4 and NB4-R1 cells differed with respect to the intracellular localization of Bcl-2 which showed a perinuclear localization in NB4-R1 cells, while Bax was broadly expressed in the cytoplasm and to only a minor extent in the perinuclear area. Therefore, the distinct intracellular localization of Bcl-2 and Bax was in general nonoverlapping. Bcl-2 remained massively expressed until cell disruption. Bax was not significantly upregulated in cells committed to death. However, Bax localization changed from a diffuse pattern to concentrate in few specific cytoplasmic area at a stage preceding the formation of apoptotic bodies. A human Bcl-2 transgene was transiently overexpressed in NB4-R1 cells which showed increased resistance to apoptosis induced by retinoids. Stably transfected clones of NB4-R1 cells showed an increased expression of Bcl-2 and a marked resistance to apoptosis. Interestingly, the overexpression of Bcl-2 restored a pattern of uniform Bcl-2 labeling in the cytoplasm and, remarkably, the colocalization of Bcl-2 with Bax. This work demonstrates that the ability of retinoid-induced cells to undergo apoptosis depends on the level of expression and the functional interaction between Bcl-2 and Bax.","['Bruel, A', 'Karsenty, E', 'Schmid, M', 'McDonnell, T J', 'Lanotte, M']","['Bruel A', 'Karsenty E', 'Schmid M', 'McDonnell TJ', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U-301, Centre G.

Cytogenetic study revealed 46, XY, t(15;17) (q22:q11). He was treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) along with hydroxyurea (HU) and low-molecular weight heparin (LMH). Because his WBC increased to 93,700/microliter on day 6 of ATRA therapy, DCMP chemotherapy was given, while ATRA was withheld. He developed enterocolitis due to myelosuppression. ATRA was restarted along with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF). His WBC rose to 10,400/microliter with a marked, but temporary predominance of myelomonocytes both in peripheral blood and in bone marrow. These myelomonocytoid cells were positive for specific and nonspecific esterase double stainings. Then he entered complete remission. It was of interest that myelomonocytoid differentiation of APL cells was induced by ATRA. The etiology was discussed.","['Mori, H', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Takahashi, N', 'Tada, J', 'Higuchi, T', 'Harada, H', 'Niikura, H', 'Omine, M', 'Fujita, K']","['Mori H', 'Fujiwara H', 'Takahashi N', 'Tada J', 'Higuchi T', 'Harada H', 'Niikura H', 'Omine M', 'Fujita K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Showa University Fujigaoka Hospital.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1997 May;38(5):440-4.,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, cigarette smoking is a direct cause of ischaemic heart disease (the commonest cause of death in western countries), respiratory heart disease, aortic aneurysm, chronic obstructive lung disease, stroke, pneumonia and cirrhosis and cancer of the liver. Cigarette smoking can kill in 24 different ways and, although smoking protects against several fatal and non-fatal conditions, the adverse effect of smoking on health is largely negative. In developed countries as a whole, tobacco is responsible for 24% of all male deaths and 7% of all female deaths: these figures rise to over 40% in men in some countries of central and eastern Europe and to 17% in women in the United States. The average loss of life of smokers is 8 years. Among United Kingdom doctors followed for 40 years, overall death rates in middle age were about three times higher among doctors who smoked cigarettes as among doctors who had never smoked regularly. About half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually be killed by their habit. The important information is that it is never too late to stop smoking: among United Kingdom doctors who stopped smoking, even in middle age, there was a substantial improvement in life expectancy. World-wide, smoking is killing three million people each year and this figure is increasing. In most countries the worst is yet to come, since by the time the young smokers of today reach middle or old age there will be about 10 million deaths/year from tobacco. Approximately 500 million individuals alive today can expect to be killed by tobacco, 250 million of these deaths will occur in middle age. Tobacco is already the biggest cause of adult death in developed countries. Over the next few decades tobacco could well become the biggest cause of adult death in the world. For men in developed countries, the full effects of smoking can already be seen. Tobacco now causes one-third of all male deaths in middle age (plus one fifth in old age). Tobacco is a cause of about half of all male cancer deaths in middle age (plus one-third in old age). Of those who start smoking in their teenage years and keep on smoking, about half will be killed by tobacco. Half of these deaths will be in middle age (35-69) and each will lose an average of 20-25 years of non-smoker life expectancy. In non-smokers in many countries, cancer mortality is decreasing slowly and total mortality rapidly. The war against cancer is being won slowly: the effects of cigarette smoking are holding back this victory. Lung cancer now kills more women in the United States each year than breast cancer. For women in developed countries, the peak of the tobacco epidemic has not yet arrived. Tobacco now causes almost one-third of all deaths in women in middle age in the United States. Although it has only 5% of the world's female population, the United States has 50% of the world's deaths from smoking in women. Tobacco smoking is a major cause of premature death. Throughout Europe, in 1990 tobacco smoking caused three quarters of a million deaths in middle age (between 35 and 69). In the Member States of the European Union in 1990 there were over one quarter of a million deaths in middle age directly caused by tobacco smoking: there were 219700 in men and 31900 in women. There were many more deaths caused by tobacco at older ages. In countries of central and eastern Europe, including the former USSR, there were 441200 deaths in middle age in men and 42100 deaths in women. There is a need for urgent action to help contain this important and unnecessary loss of life. In formulating Recommendations, the European Cancer Experts Consensus Committee recognised that Tobacco Control depends on various parts of society and not only on the individual.","['Boyle, P']",['Boyle P'],"['Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/*mortality', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Smoking/*adverse effects', 'Smoking Prevention']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 1997 May;17(1):1-60. doi: 10.1016/s0169-5002(97)00648-x.,285,,1,"['S016950029700648X [pii]', '10.1016/s0169-5002(97)00648-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistent/relapsed leukemia 4 months after transplantation did not respond to cessation of cyclosporine. Due to logistic difficulties in obtaining donor leukocytes, she was treated with interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha 2b. Although the interleukin could be administered for a short period only, the interferon was continued for 4 months. Interferon was stopped when limited chronic graft-versus-host disease developed, but was followed by extramedullary and early marrow relapse. Reinstitution of interferon resulted in the development of scleroderma-like extensive chronic GVHD and remission. Interferon was given for 5 months. GVHD improved slowly with treatment, but scleroderma-like changes still persist. The patient is alive with no evidence of disease and a Karnofsky score of 90% 41 months after relapse and 26 months after stopping cyclosporine. We conclude that cytokines alone may occasionally result in a durable response of acute leukemia relapsing after allografting, and should be considered in patients with a low tumor burden if it is difficult to obtain donor cells.","['Singhal, S', 'Powles, R', 'Treleaven, J', 'Mehta, J']","['Singhal S', 'Powles R', 'Treleaven J', 'Mehta J']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jun;19(11):1151-3. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700793.,,,11,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700793 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to determine if an abnormal expression of PML, followed by the development of anti-PML antibodies, can be implicated in chronic GVHD pathogenesis, we studied the expression of PML in the skin of seven patients with chronic GVHD as well as the presence of circulating anti-PML antibodies. PML was highly expressed by the lesional skin keratinocytes, but circulating antibodies were never detected. PML is induced by interferon (IFN) gamma. The expression of PML by GVHD epidermis is likely secondary to the IFN gamma produced by infiltrating lymphocytes. Since PML display growth suppressor properties, the role of this protein in tissue lesions is discussed.","['Aractingi, S', 'de The, H', 'Gluckman, E', 'Le Goue, C', 'Carosela, E D']","['Aractingi S', 'de The H', 'Gluckman E', 'Le Goue C', 'Carosela ED']","['DRM-DSV, CEA, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies/blood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Keratinocytes/*chemistry', 'Male', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jun;19(11):1125-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700810.,,,11,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700810 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of the 10th UK MRC AML trial. Medical Research Council Leukaemia Working Parties.,1117-23,"Cytogenetic analysis performed at diagnosis is widely recognised to provide one of the most valuable prognostic indicators in AML. Yet any role for this technique in residual disease assessment, particularly in the context of subsequent transplantation procedures has been incompletely explored. The present study considers the outcome of 190 patients drawn from the UK MRC AML 10 trial in whom cytogenetics were assessed whilst in morphological CR at the time of bone marrow harvest. Cytogenetics at this stage were abnormal in 19 patients (10%). In 11/19 patients, the abnormalities detected reflected the acquisition of new clonal (3/11) or nonclonal changes (8/11) that were not identified at diagnosis; comparison of this group to patients with normal cytogenetics at harvest provided no evidence that such acquired changes are of prognostic significance. In 8/19 patients, abnormalities detected were indicative of persistence of the disease-related clone in harvested marrow. Two of these patients died of sepsis during consolidation therapy. Two received ABMT in first morphological CR: one patient with AML associated with a favourable karyotype (+8,inv(16)) remains in CR, 5.5 years post-transplant, whereas the other with cytogenetic abnormalities considered to confer a poor prognosis (inv(3q),-7), relapsed within 5 months of ABMT. All four of the remaining patients with cytogenetic evidence of persistent disease who were not transplanted in first CR, relapsed within 6.5 months of harvest. Therefore, among 101 of 190 patients with AML characterised by abnormal karyotype at diagnosis, persistence of the disease-related clone in eight patients (8%), revealed by conventional cytogenetic assessment at bone marrow harvest whilst in morphological remission, was found to predict a poor prognosis. Nevertheless, transplantation procedures using marrow which is obviously contaminated with the original leukaemic clone may occasionally still be associated with long-term survival.","['Grimwade, D', 'Walker, H', 'Oliver, F', 'Wheatley, K', 'Clack, R', 'Burnett, A', 'Goldstone, A']","['Grimwade D', 'Walker H', 'Oliver F', 'Wheatley K', 'Clack R', 'Burnett A', 'Goldstone A']","['Department of Haematology, University College Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jun;19(11):1117-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700804.,,,11,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700804 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All received 36 g/m2 cytosine arabinoside (HDA) and 1200 cGy fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). We assessed the association of EFS and toxicities with the following risk factors; age, gender, diagnosis, initial relapse risk and patient-donor histocompatibility. The EFS probability is 33% at 800 days post-BMT. Twenty-six patients (36%) died of toxicity within 100 days and 14 (19%) have relapsed. EFS was inversely associated with age (P < 0.0001) and initial relapse risk (P = 0.007). The risk of pulmonary (P = 0.023) and hepatic toxicity (P = 0.011) increased with age. Diagnosis other than acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was a risk factor (P = 0.015) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD); and fewer ALL patients died from toxicity (P = 0.014). The probability of sepsis within 100 days post-BMT correlated (P = 0.007) with initial relapse risk. We conclude: (1) the lower EFS and greater pulmonary and hepatic toxicity associated with increasing age indicate a need for less toxic regimens that maintain high antileukemic efficacy for older patients; (2) the high GVHD and sepsis rates seen in certain categories of patients indicate a need for careful definition of eligibility criteria for this still highly toxic treatment.","['Kumar, M', 'Saleh, A', 'Rao, P V', 'Ochoa, S', 'Meyers, L', 'Miller, A', 'Graham-Pole, J']","['Kumar M', 'Saleh A', 'Rao PV', 'Ochoa S', 'Meyers L', 'Miller A', 'Graham-Pole J']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital, Galveston, TX, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Jun;19(11):1061-4. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700797.,,,11,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700797 [doi]'],,PMC7091784,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of RBL cells with Clostridium botulinum C2 toxin, which specifically ADP-ribosylated monomeric G-actin and caused complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells, inhibited Fc epsilon RI receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effects at 100 ng/ml C2I and 200 ng/ml C2I. C2 toxin (10 ng/ml C2I and 20 ng/ml C2II) increased antigen- or calcium ionophore (A23187)-stimulated [3H]serotonin release maximally by about 3 fold. Clostridium botulinum C3, which ADP-ribosylated Rho in intact RBL cells, had no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulated secretion. In contrast, the cytotoxic Clostridium difficile toxin B (ToxB), which glucosylated the Rho-subtype family members RhoA and Cdc42, blocked or reduced antigen- or calcium ionophore-mediated [3H]serotonin release, respectively, and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110 kDa protein. The data indicate that different actin pools control tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in RBL cells and suggest that Rho subfamily proteins regulate secretion independently of the actin cytoskeleton.","['Prepens, U', 'Just, I', 'Hofmann, F', 'Aktories, K']","['Prepens U', 'Just I', 'Hofmann F', 'Aktories K']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie und Toxikologie, Albert-Ludwigs-Universiat, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (toxB protein, Clostridium difficile)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (ADP Ribose Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (exoenzyme C3, Clostridium botulinum)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.24.69 (Botulinum Toxins)', 'FPM7829VMX (botulinum toxin type C)']",IM,"['ADP Ribose Transferases/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Bacterial Proteins', 'Bacterial Toxins/pharmacology', 'Basophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Botulinum Toxins/*pharmacology', 'Clostridioides difficile', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Phosphorylation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1997;419:349-53. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4419-8632-0_46.,,,,['10.1007/978-1-4419-8632-0_46 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A second course of myeloablative chemotherapy has been given to some patients, but few data are available on the indications, morbidity, and overall survival associated with this approach. This study was undertaken to evaluate morbidity and identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from a second transplant. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-four patients with lymphoma given two cycles of myeloablative chemotherapy and entered onto the European Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT) registry between 1982 and 1995 were included in this study: Hodgkin's disease (HD), n = 12; intermediate/high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HG-NHL), n = 17; and low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (LG-NHL), n = 5. The reason for second transplant, status at transplant, conditioning regimen, morbidity, and both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. RESULTS: The second procedure was performed for the following reasons: (1) elective double procedure in four patients, (2) relapse after first transplant in 20, (3) partial remission (PR) after first transplant in eight, and (4) refractory disease after first transplant in two. The OS rate at 2 years for patients who underwent two transplants (estimated from the date of second transplant) was 49%, with a median follow-up time of 44 months. The OS rate at 2 years by histologic subtype was as follows; HD, 50%; HG-NHL, 60%; and LG-NHL, 0%. Seven of 15 patients with HD or HG-NHL who relapsed after they had achieved a posttransplant complete remission (CR) remain in CR 13 to 36 months after the second transplant, compared with two of 10 patients in CR (at 6 and 19 months after second transplant) who achieved a PR or had refractory disease after the first transplant. There were eight deaths (24%) before 3 months, of which three (9%) were transplant-related and the remainder due to persistent disease. Three late toxic deaths occurred: two of cardiovascular disease and one of secondary leukemia. CONCLUSION: Selected patients with HD and HG-NHL whose disease recurs after one transplant may benefit from a second transplant. Patients with refractory disease and LG-NHL did not benefit from a second transplant.","['Vandenberghe, E', 'Pearce, R', 'Taghipour, G', 'Fouillard, L', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Vandenberghe E', 'Pearce R', 'Taghipour G', 'Fouillard L', 'Goldstone AH']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals, United Kingdom. evandenb@hgmp.mrc.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Reoperation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Apr;15(4):1595-600. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.4.1595.,,,4,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.4.1595 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this pilot study, we used this approach in patients without prior IFN-alpha therapy to determine if the number and quality of mobilized progenitors would be increased and to evaluate the potential effect of these cells as autografts. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two untreated patients were mobilized within 12 months of diagnosis. The treatment regimen consisted of the mini-ICE protocol. Beginning on day +8, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) was used in all patients. Leukophoresis was performed as the patients were recovering from aplasia, when WBC count exceeded 0.8 x 10(9)/L. RESULTS: In 14 patients, (63%) the leukophoresis product was entirely Ph1-negative and in four patients the Ph1-positive cell rate was < or = 7%. Significant numbers of long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) and CD34+ Thy1+Lin- cells were found in most of the Ph1-negative collections that were tested. Twelve patients underwent autografting with their mobilized peripheral-blood progenitor cells (PBPC) (Ph1-negative collections, 10 patients; major cytogenetic response, two patients). All patients engrafted and are alive; six have Ph1-negative marrow 7 to 15 months after autografting. Posttransplant treatment was IFN-alpha combined with interleukin (IL)-2 because of the recent demonstration of synergistic activity in augmenting cytolytic activity.

European Study Group of CAMPATH-1H Treatment in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,1567-74,"PURPOSE: CAMPATH-1H is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to nearly all B- and T-cell lymphomas and leukemias. We report the results of a multicenter phase II trial that used CAMPATH-1H in previously chemotherapy-treated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients who had relapsed after an initial response (n = 8) or were refractory (n = 21) to chemotherapy were treated with CAMPATH-1H administered as a 30-mg 2-hour intravenous (IV) infusion thrice weekly for a maximum period of 12 weeks. RESULTS: Eleven patients (38%) achieved a partial remission (PR) and one (4%) a complete remission (CR) (response rate, 42%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 23% to 61%). Three of eight patients (38%) with a relapse and nine of 21 refractory patients (43%) responded to CAMPATH-1H therapy. CLL cells were rapidly eliminated from blood in 28 of 29 patients (97%). CR in the bone marrow was obtained in 36% and splenomegaly resolved completely in 32%. Lymphadenopathy was normalized in only two patients (7%). The median response duration was 12 months (range, 6 to 25+). World Health Organization (WHO) grade IV neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in three (10%) and two patients (7%), respectively. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia recovered in most responding patients during continued CAMPATH-1H treatment. Lymphopenia (< 0.5 x 10(9)/L) occurred in all patients.

Therefore, we conducted a study to determine whether intensive MTX therapy could be safely delivered despite isolated serum ALT elevations in children with ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 243 children with B-precursor ALL were treated with extended pulses of oral divided-dose MTX (dMTX). Serum ALT levels were measured approximately every 7 weeks during therapy, as well as after its cessation. By protocol design, treatment was continued without modification in the presence of ALT elevations if there was no other evidence of liver dysfunction. RESULTS: Of 239 assessable patients, 159 (66.5%) had an ALT level > or = 180 IU/L during therapy and 28 patients (17.6%) had one or more values > or = 720 IU/L. After the completion of therapy, only 17 of 104 assessable patients have had one or more elevated ALT value. Eight of these 17 patients (47%) are hepatitis C virus (HCV)-seropositive. The remaining nine children had subsequent normal or near normal ALT values, and none have clinical evidence of liver disease. CONCLUSION: Our data show that MTX can be safely delivered without dose modification in patients with isolated ALT elevations and that continued therapy does not lead to clinically apparent liver disease. ALT elevations are not a reliable predictor of the presence or extent of hepatic injury, and persistently increased ALT values following the completion of ALL therapy are rare in the absence of HCV infection. Continued MTX therapy allows for increased dose-intensity and may improve outcome in children with ALL.","['Farrow, A C', 'Buchanan, G R', 'Zwiener, R J', 'Bowman, W P', 'Winick, N J']","['Farrow AC', 'Buchanan GR', 'Zwiener RJ', 'Bowman WP', 'Winick NJ']","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Children's Medical Center, Dallas 75235-9063, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.6.1.- (Transaminases)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Liver Diseases/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/*therapy', 'Transaminases/*blood/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 Apr;15(4):1560-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.4.1560.,,['CA09640-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],4,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.4.1560 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The breakpoints in t(3;3) cases were 15 to 330 kb upstream of the EVI1 gene, while those in inv(3) cases were 150 to 200 kb downstream and outside of the EVI1 coding region. The EVI1 gene is also activated in chronic myelogenous leukemia-blastic crisis (CML-BC) with inv(3)(q21q26); however, the molecular mechanism of EVI1 activation in CML-BC is still unclear. In this paper, we have analyzed chromosomal rearrangements in two leukemia cell lines derived from CML-BC with inv(3)(q21q26) and have identified the breakpoints within the EVI1 coding area. The EVI1 gene spans over 100 kb with 12 exons (10 coding exons), and the chromosomal breakpoints are clustered in the intron region before the last coding exon (exon 12). The nucleotide sequence of EVI1 cDNA clones from MOLM-1 cells was truncated at exon 11, and a novel sequence of 681 nucleotides was added at the 3' end of the EVI1 transcripts. The novel sequence was derived from a readthrough intron sequence 3' to the coding exon 11 adjacent to the breakpoint. The breakpoints at 3q21 were within the breakpoint cluster area downstream of the ribophorin I gene, suggesting that the activation mechanism of the EVI1 gene in CMLs with inv(3) is the same as that in AMLs with inv(3). These results indicate that expression of a truncated EVI1 gene is an important factor in the progression of CML.","['Suzukawa, K', 'Taki, T', 'Abe, T', 'Asoh, H', 'Kamada, N', 'Yokota, J', 'Morishita, K']","['Suzukawa K', 'Taki T', 'Abe T', 'Asoh H', 'Kamada N', 'Yokota J', 'Morishita K']","['Biology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1997 Jun 1;42(2):356-60. doi: 10.1006/geno.1997.4732.,,,2,"['S0888-7543(97)94732-7 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1997.4732 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The shorter of these new isoforms, called B3, presents an open reading frame (ORF) of 1713 bp coding for 571 amino acids. Its nucleotide sequence is homologous to the cDNA coding for the ABCDF isoform of ZNF162, except for a 4-nucleotide insertion that results in a frame shift of the ORF starting from nucleotide 1725 of the ZNF162 sequence. As a consequence, the predicted translation product of B3 contains the consensus sequence of the A motif (G-X-X-X-X-G-K-S) of the ""ATP/ GTP binding site,"" which is characteristic of several protein families including protein kinases. Moreover, B3 shows the use of a different stop codon and contains a different tyrosine-rich COOH terminus. The longer isoform, called B4, differs from the ABCDEF isoform of ZNF162 by the insertion, at position 2137, of 383 nucleotides leading to a different, proline-rich COOH terminus. The complex transcription pattern of the ZNF162 gene is characterized by four transcripts, of approximately 3.9, 3.7, 3.2, and 2.9 kb, in GF-D8 cells. The 3.7- and 2.9-kb transcripts are expressed in resting GF-D8 cells. Upon stimulation with GM-CSF the expression of these mRNAs is up-regulated in parallel with the induction of two additional transcripts of 3.9 and 3.2 kb. The same pattern of expression has also been observed in freshly isolated myeloid leukemia cells and normal CD34+ stem cells. In light of these data, and since GM-CSF is known to stimulate signal transduction pathways, it becomes relevant that all the different isoforms of ZNF162 contain the KH module, which is a sequence motif present in proteins playing a major role in regulating cellular RNA metabolism. A search for functional domains demonstrates that ZNF162 belongs to a new and growing family of genes dubbed STAR (signal transduction and activator of RNA) proteins that are thought to play a downstream role in cell signaling and also in RNA binding. The mammalian members include Sam68, which is a target of Src, Fyn, and Grb2, and the newly cloned mouse quaking proteins (qkI) necessary in early embryogenesis and myelination. Moreover, since ZNF162 is highly conserved from yeast to humans, it implies that this new pathway has a significant function.","['Caslini, C', 'Spinelli, O', 'Cazzaniga, G', 'Golay, J', 'De Gioia, L', 'Pedretti, A', 'Breviario, F', 'Amaru, R', 'Barbui, T', 'Biondi, A', 'Introna, M', 'Rambaldi, A']","['Caslini C', 'Spinelli O', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Golay J', 'De Gioia L', 'Pedretti A', 'Breviario F', 'Amaru R', 'Barbui T', 'Biondi A', 'Introna M', 'Rambaldi A']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (SF1 protein, human)', '0 (Sf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Genes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA/*metabolism', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Signal Transduction/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1997 Jun 1;42(2):268-77. doi: 10.1006/geno.1997.4705.,,,2,"['S0888-7543(97)94705-4 [pii]', '10.1006/geno.1997.4705 [doi]']",,,,"['GENBANK/L49345', 'GENBANK/L49380']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Failure to undergo apoptosis is associated with drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia and other cancers. Therefore, it is important to establish causal relationships between the physiological changes that take place in apoptosis, because these are potential targets for novel treatment strategies to overcome this form of drug resistance. We describe the use of multilaser flow cytometry methods to make correlated measurements of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), the generation of reactive oxygen intermediates, the cellular content of reduced glutathione (GSH), intracellular calcium, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. Using these combined methods, we have mapped a ""death sequence"" that occurs after treatment of leukemic blasts with clinically relevant concentrations of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C). Dual labeling of MMP and cellular glutathione content showed that loss of MMP, indicative of the permeability transition, took place in cells that were depleted of glutathione. The loss of MMP coincided with phosphatidylserine exposure and preceded a state of high reactive oxygen generation. Finally, there was an increase in intracellular calcium. These results demonstrate that the mitochondrial permeability transition takes place during ara-C toxicity but suggest that this occurs downstream of the loss of GSH. Thus, oxidative stress after ara-C-induced toxicity seems to be a biphasic phenomenon, with the permeability transition occurring after a depletion of GSH and preceding a state of high reactive oxygen generation.","['Backway, K L', 'McCulloch, E A', 'Chow, S', 'Hedley, D W']","['Backway KL', 'McCulloch EA', 'Chow S', 'Hedley DW']","['Department of Pathology, Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*physiology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*physiology', 'Permeability', 'Phosphatidylserines/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jun 15;57(12):2446-51.,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of tyrphostins on OCI-Ly8, a cell line derived from a patient with immunoblastic lymphoma that carries the t(14;18) translocation and overexpresses the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 gene (bcl-2). To test the possibility that tyrphostins induce apoptosis in these cells, overcoming the protection rendered by bcl-2, we screened 16 tyrphostins representing different families at a concentration of 0.5-50 microM. We found that AG17 was the most potent in this regard. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that AG17 induces arrest at the G1 phase followed by apoptosis with general reduction of the intracellular level of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. To further elucidate the mechanism of action of AG17, we investigated its effect on some of the key proteins that regulate the cell cycle. Bcl-2 and cdk2 protein levels were not altered with AG17, whereas cdk2 kinase activity, as well as p21 and p16 protein levels, were reduced markedly. These results suggest that the target of AG17 is inactivation of cdk2. Because lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) translocation and bcl-2 overexpression are resistant to chemotherapy, novel drugs selectively able to induce apoptosis in these cells could offer a new approach to the treatment of lymphoma patients.","['Palumbo, G A', 'Yarom, N', 'Gazit, A', 'Sandalon, Z', 'Baniyash, M', 'Kleinberger-Doron, N', 'Levitzki, A', 'Ben-Yehuda, D']","['Palumbo GA', 'Yarom N', 'Gazit A', 'Sandalon Z', 'Baniyash M', 'Kleinberger-Doron N', 'Levitzki A', 'Ben-Yehuda D']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '51601-81-1 (SF 6847)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/*pharmacology', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrphostins']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jun 15;57(12):2434-9.,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, three abstracts have described positive clinical outcomes for a small number of patients with advanced breast cancer treated with weekly infusions of either methotrexate or cisplatin and AZT. Consequently, we conducted a preclinical study of the anti-breast cancer and anti-mammary tumor activity of AZT. Here we have demonstrated that AZT, alone, has a preferential in vitro and in vivo effect on breast and mammary cancer cells. It is 1000 times as potent as an inhibitor of the in vitro growth of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (IC50 = 10 +/- 5 nM) than of the growth of the T-cell leukemia cell line CEM (IC50 = 14 +/- 2 microM). A novel mechanism for this preferential effect on growth is indicated by the 3-4-fold increase in production of phosphorylated AZT (mono-, di-, and triphosphate) in MCF-7 relative to CEM. We extended these in vitro observations to in vivo studies in rats and found that AZT is a potent in vivo inhibitor of the growth of methylnitrosourea-induced rat mammary tumors without any apparent toxic effects on internal organs. These preclinical results demonstrate, for the first time, that AZT has significant anti-breast cancer activity and strongly suggest that the clinical usefulness of this drug is worthy of investigation.","['Wagner, C R', 'Ballato, G', 'Akanni, A O', 'McIntee, E J', 'Larson, R S', 'Chang, S', 'Abul-Hajj, Y J']","['Wagner CR', 'Ballato G', 'Akanni AO', 'McIntee EJ', 'Larson RS', 'Chang S', 'Abul-Hajj YJ']","['Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Graduate Program in Microbial Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA. wagne003@maroon.tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/*pharmacology']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1997 Jun 15;57(12):2341-5.,,"['CA57615/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA61908/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM07994/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recipient and donor sera had been stored pre-BMT together with sequential sera thereafter. Approximately half of donors and recipients had anti-B19 IgG pre-BMT and thus the relative contributions of donor and recipient immunity to antibody production after transplantation could be assessed. For each patient, a serum taken 2 to 3 years after BMT was also tested and the results show that persistence of B19 antibody depends on prior recipient (P = .0003) but not on donor immunity (P = .8). The findings were similar in both sibling and (VUD) BMT volunteer unrelated donor patients. Analysis of sequential post-BMT sera from 41 of the patients, for whom appropriately timed samples were available, showed primary B19 infection in 3 seronegative individuals, whereas 5 others who were seropositive before BMT underwent recurrent infection. Sequential results from the remaining 33 patients without recent B19 infection showed no evidence for donor antibody transfer and confirmed that antibody persistence depends on prior recipient immunity. B19 IgG levels decreased variably with time and some patients eventually became seronegative. It is concluded that this long-term persistence of B19 antibody post-BMT is most probably due to the existence of long-lived recipient plasma cells.","['Ang, H A', 'Apperley, J F', 'Ward, K N']","['Ang HA', 'Apperley JF', 'Ward KN']","['Department of Virology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, University of London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/*blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia/complications/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/therapy', 'Parvoviridae Infections/epidemiology/*immunology/transmission', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Plasma Cells/immunology', 'Prevalence', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Seroepidemiologic Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 15;89(12):4646-51.,,,12,['S0006-4971(20)58205-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a therapeutic strategy against GVHD based on the selective destruction of these alloreactive T cells, while preserving a competent T-cell pool of donor origin. We generated transgenic mice expressing in their T lymphocytes the Herpes simplex type 1 thymidine kinase (TK) suicide gene that allows the destruction of dividing T cells by a ganciclovir treatment. T cells expressing the TK transgene were used to generate GVHD in irradiated bone marrow grafted mice. We show that a short 7-day ganciclovir treatment, initiated at the time of bone marrow transplantation, efficiently prevented GVHD in mice receiving TK-expressing T cells. These mice were healthy and had a normal survival. They maintained a T-cell pool of donor origin that responded normally to in vitro stimulation with mitogens or third party alloantigens, but were tolerant to recipient alloantigens. Our experimental system provides the proof of concept for a therapeutic strategy of GVHD prevention using genetically engineered T cells.","['Cohen, J L', 'Boyer, O', 'Salomon, B', 'Onclercq, R', 'Charlotte, F', 'Bruel, S', 'Boisserie, G', 'Klatzmann, D']","['Cohen JL', 'Boyer O', 'Salomon B', 'Onclercq R', 'Charlotte F', 'Bruel S', 'Boisserie G', 'Klatzmann D']","['CNRS ERS 107 Laboratoire de Biologie et Therapeutique des Pathologies Immunitaires, Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Paris France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/genetics/*prevention & control', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Depletion/*methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Transgenes', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 15;89(12):4636-45.,,,12,['S0006-4971(20)58204-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process requires engraftment of donor immuno-competent cells. The objective of this study was to assess the feasibility of achieving engraftment of allogeneic peripheral blood or bone marrow progenitor cell after purine analog containing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy. Patients with advanced leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) who were not candidates for a conventional myeloablative therapy because of older age or organ dysfunction were eligible. All patients had an HLA-identical or one-antigen-mismatched related donor. Fifteen patients were treated (13 with acute myeloid leukemia and 2 with MDS). The median age was 59 years (range, 27 to 71 years). Twelve patients were either refractory to therapy or beyond first relapse. Eight patients received fludarabine at 30 mg/m2/d for 4 days with idarubicin at 12 mg/m2/d for 3 days and ara-c at 2 g/m2/d for 4 days (n = 7) or melphalan at 140 mg/m2/d (n = 1). Seven patients received 2-chloro-deoxyadenosine at 12 mg/m2/d for 5 days and ara-C 1 at g/m2/d for 5 days. Thirteen patients received allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells and 1 received bone marrow after chemotherapy. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methyl-prednisolone. Treatment was generally well tolerated, with only 1 death from multiorgan failure before receiving stem cells. Thirteen patients achieved a neutrophil count of greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/L a median of 10 days postinfusion (range, 8 to 17 days). Ten patients achieved platelet counts of 20 x 10(9)/L a median of 13 days after progenitor cell infusion (range, 7 to 78 days). Eight patients achieved complete remissions (bone marrow blasts were < 5% with neutrophil recovery and platelet transfusion independence) that lasted a median of 60 days posttransplantation (range, 34 to 170+ days). Acute GVHD grade > or = 2 occurred in 3 patients. Chimerism analysis of bone marrow cells in 6 of 8 patients achieving remission showed > or = 90% donor cells between 14 and 30 days postinfusion, and 3 of 4 patients remaining in remission between 60 and 90 days continued to have > or = 80% donor cells. We conclude that purine analog-containing nonmyeloablative regimens allow engraftment of HLA-compatible hematopoietic progenitor cells. This approach permits us to explore the graft-versus-leukemia effect without the toxicity of myeloablative therapy and warrants further study in patients with leukemia who are ineligible for conventional transplantation with myeloablative regimens either because of age or concurrent medical conditions.","['Giralt, S', 'Estey, E', 'Albitar, M', 'van Besien, K', 'Rondon, G', 'Anderlini, P', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Khouri, I', 'Gajewski, J', 'Mehra, R', 'Claxton, D', 'Andersson, B', 'Beran, M', 'Przepiorka, D', 'Koller, C', 'Kornblau, S', 'Korbling, M', 'Keating, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Champlin, R']","['Giralt S', 'Estey E', 'Albitar M', 'van Besien K', 'Rondon G', 'Anderlini P', ""O'Brien S"", 'Khouri I', 'Gajewski J', 'Mehra R', 'Claxton D', 'Andersson B', 'Beran M', 'Przepiorka D', 'Koller C', 'Kornblau S', 'Korbling M', 'Keating M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Champlin R']","['Department of Hematology, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'FLAG protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/therapy', 'Cladribine/administration & dosage', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', '*Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 15;89(12):4531-6.,,['CA55164-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],12,['S0006-4971(20)58191-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzes 49 cases of nonnasal CD56+ lymphomas, the largest series to date, to characterize the clinicopathologic spectrum of these rare neoplasms. All patients were Chinese. Four categories could be delineated. (1) Nasal-type NK/T cell lymphoma (n = 34) patients were adults 21 to 76 years of age (median, 50 years), including 25 men and 9 women. They presented with extranodal disease, usually in multiple sites. The commonest sites of involvement were skin, upper aerodigestive tract, testis, soft tissue, gastrointestinal tract, and spleen. Only 7 cases (21%) apparently had stage I disease. The neoplastic cells were often pleomorphic, with irregular nuclei and granular chromatin, and angiocentric growth was common. The characteristic immunophenotype was CD2+ CD3/Leu4- CD3epsilon+ CD56+, and 32 cases (94%) harbored Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Follow-up information was available in 29 cases: 24 died at a median of 3.5 months; 3 were alive with relapse at 5 months to 2.5 years; and 2 were alive and well at 3 and 5 years, respectively. (2) Aggressive NK cell leukemia/lymphoma (n = 5) patients presented with hepatomegaly and blood/marrow involvement, sometimes accompanied by splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The neoplastic cells often had round nuclei and azurophilic granules in the pale cytoplasm. All cases exhibited an immunophenotype of CD2+ CD3/Leu4- CD56+ CD16- CD57- and all were EBV+. All of these patients died within 6 weeks. (3) In blastoid NK cell lymphoma (n = 2), the lymphoma cells resembled those of lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia. One case studied for CD2 was negative and both cases were EBV-. One patient was alive with disease at 10 months and one was a recent case. (4) Other specific lymphoma types with CD56 expression (n = 8) included one case each of hepatosplenic gammadelta T-cell lymphoma and S100 protein+ T-cell lymphoproliferative disease and two cases each of T-chronic lymphocytic/prolymphocytic leukemia, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and true histiocytic lymphoma. All of these cases were EBV-. Six patients died at a median of 6.5 months. Nonnasal CD56+ lymphomas are heterogeneous, but all pursue a highly aggressive clinical course. The nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma and aggressive NK cell leukemia/lymphoma show distinctive clinicopathologic features and a very strong association with EBV. Blastoid NK cell lymphoma appears to be a different entity and shows no association with EBV.","['Chan, J K', 'Sin, V C', 'Wong, K F', 'Ng, C S', 'Tsang, W Y', 'Chan, C H', 'Cheung, M M', 'Lau, W H']","['Chan JK', 'Sin VC', 'Wong KF', 'Ng CS', 'Tsang WY', 'Chan CH', 'Cheung MM', 'Lau WH']","['Department of Pathology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Kowloon, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'CD56 Antigen/*analysis', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Herpesviridae Infections/epidemiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', '*Killer Cells, Natural/chemistry', 'Life Tables', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/epidemiology/*pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification/epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/classification/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Organ Specificity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/epidemiology/pathology/virology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Virus Infections/epidemiology']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 15;89(12):4501-13.,84,,12,['S0006-4971(20)58188-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, other subtypes of acute myelogenous leukemia are resistant to the antiproliferative and differentiating effects of RA. In this report, we describe a novel retinoid 6-[3-(1-adamantyl)-4-hydroxyphenyl]-2-naphthalene carboxylic acid (AHPN; CD437) that not only totally inhibits the proliferation of RA-resistant leukemic cell lines HL-60R and K562 but also induces apoptosis in these cells. Exposure of HL-60R to CD437 results in the rapid (within 30 minutes) increase of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(waf1/cip1) as well as GADD45 mRNA. Manifestations of CD437-mediated programmed cell death are noted within 2 hours, as indicated by both the cleavage and activation of the CPP32 protease and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. This is followed by cleavage of bcl-2 and internucleosomal DNA degradation. HL-60R cells do not express the retinoid nuclear receptor RAR beta and RAR gamma and express a truncated RAR alpha. Thus, CD437 induction of p21(waf1/cip1) and GADD45 mRNAs and apoptosis occurs through a unique mechanism not involving the retinoid nuclear receptors.

To expand the clinical potential of a promising human-mouse chimeric antihuman B-cell MoAb (chCLL-1) constructed using the variable domains cloned from the murine Lym-2 (muLym-2) hybridoma, fusion proteins containing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (chCLL-1/GM-CSF) or interleukin (IL)-2 (chCLL-1/IL-2) were generated and evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity and in vivo tumor targeting. The glutamine synthetase gene amplification system was employed for high level expression of the recombinant fusion proteins. Antigenic specificity was confirmed by a competition radioimmunoassay against ARH-77 human myeloma cells. The activity of chCLL-1/GM-CSF was established by a colony formation assay, and the bioactivity of chCLL-1/IL-2 was confirmed by supporting the growth of an IL-2-dependent T-cell line. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against ARH-77 target cells demonstrated that both fusion proteins mediate enhanced tumor cell lysis by human mononuclear cells. Finally, biodistribution and imaging studies in nude mice bearing ARH-77 xenografts indicated that the fusion proteins specifically target the tumors.

In human B lymphocytes, IL-13 induces activation, stimulates proliferation in combination with anti-IgM or anti-CD40 antibodies, and directs Ig isotype switching towards IgE and IgG4 isotypes. We show here that IL-13 also regulates human B-cell apoptosis. IL-13 reduced spontaneous apoptosis of peripheral blood B cells in vitro, as shown by measurement of DNA fragmentation using the TUNEL and Nicoletti assays. The inhibition of cell death by IL-13 alone was significant but modest, but was potently enhanced in combination with CD40 ligand (CD40L), a survival stimulus for B cells by itself. Interestingly, IL-13 increased the expression of CD40 on peripheral blood B cells, providing a possible mechanism for the observed synergy. IL-13 alone was a less potent inhibitor of apoptosis than IL-4. Moreover, there was no additive effect of combining IL-4 and IL-13 at supraoptimal concentrations, which is consistent with the notion that the IL-4 and IL-13 binding sites share a common signaling subunit. The combination of IL-13 with CD40L augmented the expression of the Bcl-2 homologues Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, suggesting this as a possible intracellular mechanism of induced survival. By contrast, levels of Bcl-2, and two other Bcl-2 family members, Bax and Bak, remained unaltered. Given the importance of the CD40-CD40L interaction in B-cell responses, these results suggest a significant role of IL-13 in the regulation of B-cell apoptosis.","['Lomo, J', 'Blomhoff, H K', 'Jacobsen, S E', 'Krajewski, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Smeland, E B']","['Lomo J', 'Blomhoff HK', 'Jacobsen SE', 'Krajewski S', 'Reed JC', 'Smeland EB']","['Department of Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, The Norwegian Radium Hospital, Oslo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 15;89(12):4415-24.,,"['NCI-CA60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI-CS69381/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States']",12,['S0006-4971(20)58180-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although retinoic acid (RA) inhibits cell growth and induces differentiation in human APL cells, resistance to RA develops both in vitro and in patients. We have developed RA-resistant subclones of the human APL cell line, NB4, whose nuclear extracts display altered RA binding. In the RA-resistant subclone, R4, we find an absence of ligand binding of PML-RAR alpha associated with a point mutation changing a leucine to proline in the ligand-binding domain of the fusion PML-RAR alpha protein. In contrast to mutations in RAR alpha found in retinoid-resistant HL60 cells, in this NB4 subclone, the coexpressed RAR alpha remains wild-type. In vitro expression of a cloned PML-RAR alpha with the observed mutation in R4 confirms that this amino acid change causes the loss of ligand binding, but the mutant PML-RAR alpha protein retains the ability to heterodimerize with RXR alpha and thus to bind to retinoid response elements (RAREs). This leads to a dominant negative block of transcription from RAREs that is dose-dependent and not relieved by RA. An unrearranged RAR alpha engineered with this mutation also lost ligand binding and inhibited transcription in a dominant negative manner. We then found that the mutant PML-RAR alpha selectively alters regulation of gene expression in the R4 cell line. R4 cells have lost retinoid-regulation of RXR alpha and RAR beta and the RA-induced loss of PML-RAR alpha protein seen in NB4 cells, but retain retinoid-induction of CD18 and CD38. Thus, the R4 cell line provides data supporting the presence of an RAR alpha-mediated pathway that is independent from gene expression induced or repressed by PML-RAR alpha. The high level of retinoid resistance in vitro and in vivo of cells from some relapsed APL patients suggests similar molecular changes may occur clinically.","['Shao, W', 'Benedetti, L', 'Lamph, W W', 'Nervi, C', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Shao W', 'Benedetti L', 'Lamph WW', 'Nervi C', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

The malignant transformation is assumed to occur at the level of mature B lymphocytes. We asked whether CD34+ progenitor cells are involved in the malignant process in B-CLL. Furthermore, we investigated the possibility of aberrant CD34 expression by the malignant B-cell clone. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from 75 patients with B-CLL were tested for the presence of trisomy 12 and deletion of the retinoblastoma gene (Rb) by fluorescence in situ hybridization. CD34+ subpopulations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and analyzed for the presence of the informative genetic marker. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of 10 B-CLL patients were analyzed for coexpression of CD34/CD5/CD20. Trisomy 12 was detected in 15 of 75 (20%) and Rb-deletion was detected in 6 of 30 patients (20%). In 7 patients with trisomy 12, hematopoietic progenitor cells were sorted, with the sort purity being between 85% and 99.8%. The genetic marker was detected in the CD34+/CD38+ cells as well as in the CD34+/38- subsets in 3 patients. Progenitor cells were also sorted in 2 patients with Rb-deletion. In 1 patient, Rb-deletion was present in 10% of CD34+/38+ cells. In the other patient, Rb-deletion was neither detected in the CD34+/38+ nor in the CD34+/CD38- subsets. In all 10 patients investigated for coexpression of CD34/CD5/CD20, we could not find a subpopulation coexpressing these markers. We conclude that trisomy 12 and Rb-deletion are present in a considerable subset of patients with B-CLL. In part of these patients, the genetic marker was detected at the level of CD34+ stem cells. CD34 expression is not related to an aberrant phenotype of the malignant B-cell clone.

Using PAC clones for fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of leukemia cells with a del(5q), we have narrowed the commonly deleted segment to 1-1.5 Mb between D5S479 and D5S500. To search for allele loss, we used 7 microsatellite markers within and flanking the commonly deleted segment to examine leukemia cells from 28 patients with loss of 5q, and 14 patients without cytogenetically detectable loss of 5q. In the first group of patients, we detected hemizygous deletions, consistent with the cytogenetically visible loss; no homozygous deletions were detected. No allele loss was detected in patients without abnormalities of chromosome 5, suggesting that allele loss on 5q is the result of visible chromosomal abnormalities.

Alternative splicing of the AML-1 gene results in two major AML variants, AML-1 and AML-1B. We show here that the transcriptionally active AML-1B binds to the nuclear matrix, and the inactive AML-1 does not. The association of AML-1B with the nuclear matrix is independent of DNA binding and requires a nuclear matrix targeting signal (NMTS), a 31 amino acid segment near the C terminus that is distinct from nuclear localization signals. A similar NMTS is present in AML-2 and the bone-related AML-3 transcription factors. Fusion of the AML-1B NMTS to the heterologous GAL4-(1-147) protein directs GAL4 to the nuclear matrix. Thus, the NMTS is necessary and sufficient to target the transcriptionally active AML-1B to the nuclear matrix. The loss of the C-terminal domain of AML-1B is a frequent consequence of the leukemia-related t(8;21) and t(3;21) translocations. Our results suggest this loss may be functionally linked to the modified interrelationships between nuclear structure and gene expression characteristic of cancer cells.","['Zeng, C', 'van Wijnen, A J', 'Stein, J L', 'Meyers, S', 'Sun, W', 'Shopland, L', 'Lawrence, J B', 'Penman, S', 'Lian, J B', 'Stein, G S', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Zeng C', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Meyers S', 'Sun W', 'Shopland L', 'Lawrence JB', 'Penman S', 'Lian JB', 'Stein GS', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School and Cancer Center, 55 Lake Avenue North, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (CBFB protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone and Bones/metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1997/06/24 00:00,1997/06/24 00:01,['1997/06/24 00:00'],"['1997/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jun 24;94(13):6746-51. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.13.6746.,,"['R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AR42262/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",13,['10.1073/pnas.94.13.6746 [doi]'],,PMC21229,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening a lambdagt11 cDNA expression library with a 9ORF1 protein probe yielded a novel cellular PDZ domain-containing protein, 9BP-1, which binds to wild-type, but not a transformation-defective, C-terminal, mutant 9ORF1 protein. The fact that PDZ domains complex with specific sequences at the free C-terminal end of some proteins led to the recognition that the 9ORF1 C-terminal region contained such a consensus-binding motif. This discovery prompted investigations into whether the 9ORF1 protein associates with additional cellular proteins having PDZ domains. It was found that the 9ORF1 protein interacts directly, in vitro and in vivo, with the PDZ domain-containing protein hDlg/SAP97 (DLG), which is a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein and which also binds the adenomatous polyposis coli tumor suppressor protein. Of interest, in forming complexes, the 9ORF1 protein preferentially associated with the second PDZ domain of DLG, similar to adenomatous polyposis coli protein. Human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax and most oncogenic human papillomavirus E6 oncoproteins also possessed PDZ domain-binding motifs at their C termini and, significantly, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax and human papillomavirus 18 E6 proteins bound DLG in vitro. Considering the requirement of the 9ORF1 C-terminal region in transformation, these findings suggest that interactions with the cellular factor DLG may contribute to the tumorigenic potentials of several different human virus oncoproteins.","['Lee, S S', 'Weiss, R S', 'Javier, R T']","['Lee SS', 'Weiss RS', 'Javier RT']","['Division of Molecular Virology, Baylor College of Medicine, One Baylor Plaza, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DLG1 protein, human)', '0 (Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein)', '0 (Dlg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (E4 protein, Adenovirus 9)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.4.8 (Guanylate Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Discs Large Homolog 1 Protein', 'Drosophila', 'Guanylate Kinases', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis']",1997/06/24 00:00,1997/06/24 00:01,['1997/06/24 00:00'],"['1997/06/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/24 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jun 24;94(13):6670-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.13.6670.,,"['R01 CA058541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",13,['10.1073/pnas.94.13.6670 [doi]'],,PMC21216,,['GENBANK/AF000168'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analogues were evaluated in a panel of cell lines which included wild-type (JLC) and mutant (JLA and JLD) forms of the human Jurkat leukemia line. The latter mutant lines are resistant to topoisomerase II targeted agents due to lower levels of the enzyme. Structure-activity studies suggest that the electronic properties of the substituents do not markedly affect cytotoxicity, but steric bulk is important, with larger groups leading to loss of activity. The compounds fell broadly into two categories. The majority had cytotoxicities similar to (or lower than) that of DACA itself and were equitoxic in all the Jurkat lines, suggesting a relatively greater effect on topoisomerase I compared with topoisomerase II. Most of the 5-substituted derivatives and the 7-Ph compound were more cytotoxic than DACA, but were less effective against JLA and JLD cell lines than in the wild-type JLC, suggesting a mode of cytotoxicity largely mediated by effects on topoisomerase II.

The degenerate assays detected all major variants of the BLV/PTLV genus at a sensitivity of 10-100 copies of input DNA; the specific systems detected 1-10 copies of input target. Sensitivity was 100% in specific DNA-PCR assays done on peripheral blood from seropositive BLV-infected cattle and HTLV-I- or HTLV-II-infected humans, and 62% in RNA/DNA-PCR assays on sera from BLV seropositive cattle. The pol fragments from 21 different BLV strains, isolated from cattle in North and Central America, were cloned and sequenced, and compared to other published BLV and PTLV pol sequences. BLV and PTLV sequences differed by 42%. Sequence divergence was up to 6% among the BLV strains, and up to 36% among the PTLV strains (with PTLV-I and PTLV-II differing among themselves by 15% and 8%, respectively). Some cows were infected with several BLV strains. Among retroviruses, BLV and PTLV sequences formed a distinct clade. The data support the interpretation that BLV and PTLV evolved from a common ancestor many millennia ago, and some considerable time before the PTLV-I and PTLV-II strains diverged from each other. The dissemination of the BLV strains studied probably resulted from the export of European cattle throughout the world over the last 500 years. The relatively similar mutation rates of BLV and PTLV, after their various points of divergence, suggest that there could be a much wider genetic range of BLV than has currently been defined.","['Dube, S', 'Bachman, S', 'Spicer, T', 'Love, J', 'Choi, D', 'Esteban, E', 'Ferrer, J F', 'Poiesz, B J']","['Dube S', 'Bachman S', 'Spicer T', 'Love J', 'Choi D', 'Esteban E', 'Ferrer JF', 'Poiesz BJ']","['Department of Medicine, SUNY Health Science Center, Syracuse 13210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primates/*virology', 'Retroviridae/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1997 Jun;78 ( Pt 6):1389-98. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-78-6-1389.,,['N01 HB-67021/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,['10.1099/0022-1317-78-6-1389 [doi]'],,,,"['GENBANK/U45264', 'GENBANK/U45265', 'GENBANK/U45266', 'GENBANK/U45267', 'GENBANK/U45268', 'GENBANK/U45269', 'GENBANK/U45270', 'GENBANK/U45271', 'GENBANK/U45272', 'GENBANK/U45273', 'GENBANK/U45274', 'GENBANK/U45275', 'GENBANK/U45276', 'GENBANK/U45277', 'GENBANK/U45278', 'GENBANK/U45279', 'GENBANK/U45280', 'GENBANK/U45281', 'GENBANK/U45282', 'GENBANK/U45283', 'GENBANK/U45284']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, significantly higher risks were observed for all cancers except leukaemia, including cancers of the lung, colon and female breast. Comparison is made with RERF results regarding temporal changes in the relative risk. Although we observed slightly lower relative risks than RERF values for the cancer of the stomach and lung, and for all cancer except leukaemia, no marked trends for any cancer were observed in this study.

In view of its potential future use in cancer therapy, we investigated the tolerability and target-organ toxicity of these cells in various animal species. The acute toxicity of TALL-104 cell administrations was evaluated in: (a) healthy immunocompetent mice and immunodeficient (SCID) mice bearing human tumors using multiple (up to 15) intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections, and (b) healthy dogs, tumor-bearing dogs, and healthy monkeys using multiple (up to 17) intravenous (i.v.) injections. TALL-104 cells were gamma-irradiated (40 Gy) prior to administration to mice and dogs, but administered without irradiation in monkeys. Cell doses ranged from 5 x 10(7)/kg to 10(10)/kg for each injection. All regimens were well tolerated, the main clinical signs observed being transient gastrointestinal effects. Moderate and transient increases in liver transaminase levels were observed in all animal species. Discrete and transient leukocytosis with neutrophilia was also noted in dogs and monkeys after i.v. injections of TALL-104 cells. Histological analysis revealed foci of hepatic necrosis with lympho-/mono-/granulocytic infiltration in immunocompetent mice injected i.p. with 5 x 10(9)-10(10) cells/kg. In the same mice, the colon showed an increased number of muciparous cells and alterations in the villi structure: these alterations were completely reversed by 72 h after the last injection, while liver alterations reversed more slowly (1 week). No delayed or chronic toxicity was observed in any of the animals even when non-irradiated TALL-104 cells were administered: both immunocompetent mice and healthy dogs were found to be grossly and histopathologically normal when sacrificed (1 year and 1 month after the last TALL-104 injection respectively). TALL-104 cells did not persist in these hosts. In addition, monkeys showed no molecular signs of TALL-104-cell-induced leukemia in their blood 1 year after the last cell injection. Despite immunosuppression, most of the tumor-bearing dogs as well as the healthy dogs and monkeys developed both humoral and cellular immune responses against TALL-104 cells. The data derived from these preclinical studies suggest that administration of high doses of irradiated TALL-104 cells is well tolerated and would be unlikely to induce severe toxicity if applied in clinical trials to the treatment of patients with refractory cancer.","['Cesano, A', 'Visonneau, S', 'Wolfe, J H', 'Jeglum, K A', 'Fernandez, J', 'Gillio, A', ""O'Reilly, R J"", 'Santoli, D']","['Cesano A', 'Visonneau S', 'Wolfe JH', 'Jeglum KA', 'Fernandez J', 'Gillio A', ""O'Reilly RJ"", 'Santoli D']","['Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dogs', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/transplantation']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1997 May;44(3):125-36. doi: 10.1007/s002620050365.,,"['CA20794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-42707/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",3,['10.1007/s002620050365 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This agent is a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC). However, long exposure to TPA downregulates PKC in many cell types. We demonstrated that TPA treatment of Jurkat cells for more than 24 hr resulted in a sever depletion of this enzyme. Therefore, to explore the role of PKC in the effect of TPA on these LTRs, we transfected Jurkat cells with HIV-1 LTR-CAT or HTLV-I LTR-CAT construct after 72 hr of TPA pretreatment. While this TPA pretreatment considerably reduced the HIV-1 LTR basal expression, it strongly stimulated the expression of HTLV-I LTR. Furthermore, when TPA was added after transfection, a strong stimulation of HIV-1 LTR was observed, which could be abrogated by PKC inhibitors like H7 and chelerythryn. However, under these conditions TPA stimulated HTLV-I LTR to a lesser extent than did the long-term TPA pretreatment. Moreover, this stimulation was enhanced by the PKC inhibitors. Thus our data indicate that while the effect of TPA on HIV-1 LTR is strictly dependent on PKC activity, its effect on HTLV-I LTR is exerted via a different pathway that not only does not require PKC activation but rather seems to be antagonized by the activated PKC. Using a deletion mutant of HTLV-I LTR we mapped the PKC-independent effect of TPA to the c-ets responsive region 1 (ERR-1) located in U3 of this LTR.","['Mor-Vaknin, N', 'Torgeman, A', 'Galron, D', 'Lochelt, M', 'Flugel, R M', 'Aboud, M']","['Mor-Vaknin N', 'Torgeman A', 'Galron D', 'Lochelt M', 'Flugel RM', 'Aboud M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheve, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*drug effects', '*HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1997/06/09 00:00,1997/06/09 00:01,['1997/06/09 00:00'],"['1997/06/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/09 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1997 Jun 9;232(2):337-44. doi: 10.1006/viro.1997.8566.,,,2,"['S0042-6822(97)98566-4 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1997.8566 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The role of HCV infection in 54 children with primary malignant disease was evaluated in terms of the following aspects: prevalence of HCV infection, distribution of HCV subtype, the benefit of screening of blood donors, and the presence of chronic liver disease. The benefit of screening for HCV in a subset of patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was also evaluated. RESULTS: Seventeen patients (31.4%) of 54 tested were seropositive in a second-generation HCV antibody test. Thirteen patients (24.0%) were also positive for circulating HCV RNA. HCV subtype 1b and HCV subtype 2b were found in six and two patients, respectively. Multiple HCV genotypes were present in two patients. One of these two patients had relatively progressive liver disease. Before the introduction of blood screening with a second-generation HCV antibody test, 15 of 35 patients seroconverted, whereas none of 7 patients seroconverted after the screening was used (p = 0.032). For patients who underwent BMT, the screening drastically decreased the seroconversion rate, from 7 of 11 patients to 0 of 6 (p = 0.016). CONCLUSION: A considerable number of children with primary malignant disease who received multiple blood transfusions became infected by HCV before HCV screening was used. Patients who underwent BMT were at high risk for HCV infection. Screening with a second-generation HCV antibody test has proven to be remarkably beneficial in preventing HCV infection in these children.","['Tada, K', 'Tajiri, H', 'Kozaiwa, K', 'Sawada, A', 'Guo, W', 'Okada, S']","['Tada K', 'Tajiri H', 'Kozaiwa K', 'Sawada A', 'Guo W', 'Okada S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (Hepatitis Antibodies)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/immunology', 'Hepatitis Antibodies/blood', 'Hepatitis C/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Mass Screening', 'RNA/blood', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 1997 Jun;37(6):641-4. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37697335160.x.,,,6,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1997.37697335160.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using recombinant proteins, both Pbx1 and E2a-Pbx1 heterodimerize with Hox proteins on bipartite elements, Pbx1 binding a 5' TGAT core and Class I Hox proteins binding adjacent 3' TAAT, TTAT, or TGAT cores. In contrast to these in vitro results, nuclear extracts from E2a-Pbx1-transformed cells assemble an abundant Pbx-containing complex on TGATTGAT that excludes E2a-Pbx1, suggesting that an uncharacterized in vivo partner discriminates between E2a-Pbx1 and Pbx proteins, distinguishing it from Hox proteins. Here, we describe the DNA-binding properties of this complex, and identify TGATTGAC (PCE; Pbx Consensus Element) as its optimal recognition motif. In vitro, the PCE fails to bind heterodimers of Class I Hox proteins plus either Pbx1 or E2a-Pbx1. Likewise, in vivo, the PCE fails to mediate cooperative transactivation by E2a-Pbx1 plus Class I Hox proteins. Thus, the PCE binds a Pbx dimer partner that behaves unlike Class I Hox proteins. Competition analysis indicates that the Pbx-containing complex that binds the PCE also binds the TGATTGAT Pbx-Hox element and binds promoter elements required for tissue-specific expression of a number of cellular genes. Thus, different Pbx partners dictate targetting of Pbx heterodimers to related DNA motifs that differ in the sequence of their 3' half-sites, and E2a-Pbx1 heterodimerizes with only a subset of Pbx partners, restricting its potential DNA targets.","['Knoepfler, P S', 'Kamps, M P']","['Knoepfler PS', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '146150-85-8 (E2A-Pbx1 fusion protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/pharmacology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/29 00:00,1997/05/29 00:01,['1997/05/29 00:00'],"['1997/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 May 29;14(21):2521-31. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201097.,,"['2 PO1 CA50528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",21,['10.1038/sj.onc.1201097 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD11c expression is restricted to myeloid and activated B cells, is regulated during leukocyte differentiation, and constitutes a diagnostic tool for hairy cell leukemia. Mapping of in vivo DNA-protein interactions in the CD11c proximal promoter revealed three adjacent myeloid-specific interactions, one of which lies on an octamer consensus sequence, ATTT GCAT (Oct185). Oct185 disruption increased the CD11c promoter activity while decreasing its myeloid differentiation responsiveness, indicating that Oct185 contributes to the activity of the CD11c promoter and suggesting that Oct185 is a negative regulatory element whose function changes during myeloid differentiation. Oct185 is recognized by the ubiquitous Oct-1 factor in all cell lineages and by Oct-2 in B lymphoid lineage cells. Unexpectedly, Oct-2 binding to Oct185 was induced de novo upon monocytic differentiation of U937 and HL-60 cells but not during HL-60 granulocytic differentiation, as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and immunochemical studies, and Oct-2 complexes were also observed in cultured adherent monocytes. Western blotting showed that the pattern of Oct-2 isoforms in myeloid cells is similar to that seen in B cells. The Oct-2 up-regulated expression in differentiating myeloid cells and its binding to the Oct185 negative regulatory element suggests its involvement in the differentiation-regulated activity of the CD11c promoter and might represent an important parameter for the myeloid- and B cell-restricted expression of the CD11c/CD18 integrin and other molecules with similar patterns of expression.","['Lopez-Rodriguez, C', 'Zubiaur, M', 'Sancho, J', 'Concha, A', 'Corbi, A L']","['Lopez-Rodriguez C', 'Zubiaur M', 'Sancho J', 'Concha A', 'Corbi AL']","['Hospital de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Integrins)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'CD18 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/*genetics', 'Integrins/*genetics', 'Leukocytes/*cytology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1997 Jun 15;158(12):5833-40.,,,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since Tax does not bind to the 21 bp DNA repeats directly, it has been speculated that Tax interacts with cellular protein(s) which mediate binding to the enhancer. We employed the yeast two hybrid system to identify host proteins that are potentially relevant to Tax transactivation. We identified a Tax binding protein encoded from a cDNA expression library derived from peripheral blood lymphocytes. The corresponding cDNA has sequence identity with a known transcription factor, activating factor-4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 also binds to GST-Tax fusion protein in vitro. Tax mutants that did not transactivate the HTLV-1 LTR also failed to bind ATF-4. The critical domain for Tax binding resides in a 85 amino acid stretch in the C-terminus of ATF-4, which contains the basic domain and leucine zipper. We further demonstrated that both full length and N-terminal truncated ATF-4 were able to enhance Tax transactivation. Thus, ATF-4 may act as an adapter between Tax and the TRE (Tax responsive element), and play an important role in Tax-mediated transactivation.","['Reddy, T R', 'Tang, H', 'Li, X', 'Wong-Staal, F']","['Reddy TR', 'Tang H', 'Li X', 'Wong-Staal F']","['Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0665, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (ATF4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '145891-90-3 (Activating Transcription Factor 4)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 4', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Genomic Library', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/12 00:00,1997/06/12 00:01,['1997/06/12 00:00'],"['1997/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Jun 12;14(23):2785-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201119.,,"['P30-AI36214-03/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI31378/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR04050/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",23,['10.1038/sj.onc.1201119 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the Ets sites, which we refer to as EBS4, is located next to an NF-kappa B/Rel binding site, kB3, which is absolutely required for activity of the promoter in Jurkat T cells in response to activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), PMA/ionomycin, or the Tax protein from human T cell leukemia virus type I. We show that EBS4 is, required for the full response of the nfkb1 promoter to PMA or PMA/ionomycin in Jurkat cells. EBS4 is bound by Ets-1, Elf-1, and other species. Overexpression of Ets-1 augments the response to PMA/ionomycin and this is reduced by mutation of EBS4. Elf-1 has less effect in conjunction with PMA/ionomycin, but by itself activates the promoter 12-fold. This activation is only partly affected by mutation of EBS4, and a mutant promoter that binds Ets-1, but not Elf-1, at the EBS4 site responds to PMA/ionomycin as efficiently as the wild-type. Ets proteins may be responsible for fine-tuning the activity of the nfkb1 gene in a cell-type-specific manner.","['Lambert, P F', 'Ludford-Menting, M J', 'Deacon, N J', 'Kola, I', 'Doherty, R R']","['Lambert PF', 'Ludford-Menting MJ', 'Deacon NJ', 'Kola I', 'Doherty RR']","['Macfarlane Burnet Centre for Medical Research, Fairfield, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ephrin-A2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'COS Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ephrin-A2', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 1997 Feb;8(2):313-23. doi: 10.1091/mbc.8.2.313.,,,2,['10.1091/mbc.8.2.313 [doi]'],,PMC276082,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the effect of 15 uremic ultrafiltrate fractions obtained by HPLC on the uptake and toxicity of Al in mouse hepatocytes (MH) in culture, a model system in which Al is taken up bound to transferrin (Tf). Uremic fractions 4 to 8, 12, 14, and 15 increased cellular Al uptake and aspartate aminotransferase release and decreased cell growth when Tf-Al, not Al citrate, was added to culture media. Compounds that have been extracted previously from these ultrafiltrate fractions (p-cresol, xanthine, tryptophan, hippuric acid, and o-hydroxyhippuric acid) were then tested for their effect on Al uptake and toxicity in MH at concentrations found in uremic serum. Significant Al uptake by MH was observed only when p-cresol was added together with Tf-Al. Time-response curves showed increased Al uptake and toxicity at p-cresol concentrations of 3 mg/dl in culture media. Dose-response curves confirmed that Al uptake and cell toxicity were proportional to p-cresol from 1.5 mg/dl to 3 mg/dl in culture media. p-Cresol was not toxic to MH in the absence of Tf-Al in media. p-Cresol increased Tf-associated Al uptake only because there was no effect on Al uptake when Al citrate was substituted, and studies with Tf-I125-Al in the presence of this compound showed increased Tf-I125 taken up by MH. p-Cresol did not increase Tf saturation with Al. p-Cresol also increased Tf-Al uptake in Friend erythroleukemia and neuroblastoma cells in culture. Our studies suggest that p-cresol and uremic fractions 4 to 8, 12, 14, and 15 increase the uptake and toxicity of Al in cultured MH. These compounds may play a role in the accumulation and toxicity of Al in the liver of end-stage renal disease patients and possibly in all cells that express Tf receptors.","['Abreo, K', 'Sella, M', 'Gautreaux, S', 'De Smet, R', 'Vogeleere, P', 'Ringoir, S', 'Vanholder, R']","['Abreo K', 'Sella M', 'Gautreaux S', 'De Smet R', 'Vogeleere P', 'Ringoir S', 'Vanholder R']","['Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University School of Medicine, Shreveport 71130, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Soc Nephrol,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,9013836,"['0 (Cresols)', '0 (Transferrin)', '1MXY2UM8NV (4-cresol)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)']",IM,"['Aluminum/*pharmacokinetics/poisoning', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cresols/blood/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Transferrin/metabolism/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultrafiltration', 'Uremia/blood']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Soc Nephrol. 1997 Jun;8(6):935-42. doi: 10.1681/ASN.V86935.,,,6,['10.1681/ASN.V86935 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The combination of the immune costimulatory molecule B7.1 and IL-12 has been shown to be synergistic for T cell activation. By transfecting tumor cells with both IL-12 and B7.1 cDNAs, it may be possible to use these modified targets as vaccines. A major obstacle in designing a vector to deliver these genes results from the structure of IL-12. Functional IL-12 is a heterodimer composed of two distinct subunits that are encoded by separate genes on different chromosomes. Production of functional IL-12 requires the coordinated expression of both genes. This presents several problems in vectors, particularly those in which additional genes, either a co-stimulatory gene or a selectable marker, are inserted. Therefore, we have constructed a single cDNA that encodes a single-chain protein, called Flexi-12, which retains all of the biological characteristics of recombinant IL-12 (rIL-12). The monomeric polypeptide Flexi-12 is able to induce the proliferation of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) blasts, induce PHA blasts to secrete interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and additionally, by preincubation, enhance the killing of K562 targets by PBLs. These phenomena are in a dose-dependent manner comparable to that seen with rIL-12. We have also shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of the STAT 4 transcription factor, which has been shown to be unique to the IL-12 signaling pathway, occurs with Flexi-12 at levels similar to those seen with rIL-12. We have packaged Flexi-12 into a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) and used this vector to infect acute myeloid leukemic (AML) blasts. Infected AML blasts produced between 2 and 6 ng of IL-12/10(6) cells per ml per 48 hr. These studies also confirm that AAV is an efficient delivery vehicle for cytokines to leukemic cells. Direct analysis of these modified cells acting as tumor vaccines is underway.","['Anderson, R', 'Macdonald, I', 'Corbett, T', 'Hacking, G', 'Lowdell, M W', 'Prentice, H G']","['Anderson R', 'Macdonald I', 'Corbett T', 'Hacking G', 'Lowdell MW', 'Prentice HG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, Hampstead, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flexi-12 protein, human)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT4 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT4 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-12/*genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'STAT4 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/drug effects/immunology/metabolism']",1997/06/10 00:00,1997/06/10 00:01,['1997/06/10 00:00'],"['1997/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1997 Jun 10;8(9):1125-35. doi: 10.1089/hum.1997.8.9-1125.,,,9,['10.1089/hum.1997.8.9-1125 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We studied 41 patients (28 women, 13 men; mean age 52 yr) with primary idiopathic thombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (n = 20), secondary ITP (n = 9), HCV associated thrombocytopenia (n = 9), splenectomy (n = 1) and hairy-cell leukemia (n = 1). The patients were in a steady-state of platelet turnover. Initial platelet counts ranged from 19 to 302 x 10(9)/liter (mean value = 83). Platelet survival times (PST) were measured from the blood radioactivity disappearance curve of 111In-oxine-labeled autologus platelets following the recommendations of the International Committee for Standardization in Haematology: blood samples were taken at 30 min and 2 and 4 hr and thereafter daily for 7 days. PST was calculated by the weighted mean method and ranged from 18 to 219 hr (mean value = 98). PST was also calculated using only the data collected at 2, 48 and 96 hr. If the radioactivity in the blood at 96 hr exceeded 10% of the 2-hr value, the additional point at 168 hr was used. RESULTS: By using this reduced dataset, we obtained a correlation of r = 0.97 with the PST obtained from the whole dataset. In 24 patients, the difference was between +/- 10 hr and exceeded 1 day in only 4. CONCLUSION: About 94% of the data may be recovered with only three or four blood samples and the duration may be shortened to 4 days in a significant proportion of patients (48% of ITP patients).

In the present study, expression of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) or Moloney murine leukemia virus envelope glycoproteins was used for trans-complementation of an envelope-negative HIV-1.

The concentration and accessibility of these receptors are critical determinants in accomplishing successful gene transfer with retrovirus-based vectors. Murine retroviruses containing ecotropic glycoproteins do not infect human cells since human cells do not express the receptor that binds the ecotropic glycoproteins. To enable human cells to become permissive for ecotropic retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, we have developed a recombinant adeno-associated virus type 2 (AAV) vector containing ecotropic retroviral receptor (ecoR) cDNA under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter (vRSVp-ecoR). Established human cell lines, such as HeLa and KB, known to be nonpermissive for murine ecotropic retroviruses, became permissive for infection by a retroviral vector containing a bacterial gene for resistance to neomycin (RV-Neo(r)), with a transduction efficiency of up to 47%, following transduction with vRSVp-ecoR, as determined by the development of colonies that were resistant to the drug G418, a neomycin analog. No G418-resistant colonies were present in cultures infected with either vRSVp-ecoR or RV-Neo(r) alone. Southern and Northern blot analyses revealed stable integration and long-term expression, respectively, of the transduced murine ecoR gene in clonal isolates of HeLa and KB cells. Similarly, ecotropic retrovirus-mediated Neo(r) transduction of primary human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal bone marrow was also documented, but only following infection with vRSVp-ecoR. The retroviral transduction efficiency was approximately 7% without prestimulation and approximately 14% with prestimulation of CD34+ cells with cytokines, as determined by hematopoietic clonogenic assays. No G418-resistant progenitor cell colonies were present in cultures infected with either vRSVp-ecoR or RV-Neo(r) alone. These results suggest that sequential transduction of primary human cells with two different viral vectors may overcome limitations encountered with a single vector. Thus, the combined use of AAV- and retrovirus-based vectors may have important clinical implications for ex vivo and in vivo human gene therapy.","['Qing, K', 'Bachelot, T', 'Mukherjee, P', 'Wang, X S', 'Peng, L', 'Yoder, M C', 'Leboulch, P', 'Srivastava, A']","['Qing K', 'Bachelot T', 'Mukherjee P', 'Wang XS', 'Peng L', 'Yoder MC', 'Leboulch P', 'Srivastava A']","['Department of Medicine, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Dependovirus/*genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/virology', 'Humans', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Integration']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jul;71(7):5663-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.7.5663-5667.1997.,,"['DK-49218/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-48342/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-53586/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",7,['10.1128/JVI.71.7.5663-5667.1997 [doi]'],,PMC191813,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classification of this virus has been based on partial sequence analysis of cDNA from a virus-producing cell line, PH969. We obtained the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus with a proviral genome of 8,916 bp. All major genes, homologous in all human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-related viruses, and their corresponding mRNAs, including appropriate splicing, were identified. One additional nonhomologous open reading frame in the proximal pX region is accessible for translation through alternative splicing. Sequence comparison shows that STLV-PH969 is equidistantly related to HTLV type 1 (HTLV-1) and HTLV-2. In all coding regions, the similarity tends to be the lowest between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-1. However, in the long terminal repeat (LTR) region, the lowest similarity was found between STLV-PH969 and HTLV-2. The U3-R and R-U5 boundaries of the STLV-PH969 LTR were experimentally determined at nucleotides 268 and 524, respectively. This 695-bp LTR is 60 and 73 bp shorter than the LTRs of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, respectively, but its general organization is similar to the one found in the HTLV-bovine leukemia virus genus. In the long region between the polyadenylation signal and the poly(A) site, sequence similarity with the HTLV-1 Rex-responsive element (RexRE) core and secondary structure prediction suggest the presence of a RexRE. The presence of three 21-bp repeats is conserved within the U3 region of HTLV-1, HTLV-2, and BLV. Only two direct repeats with similarity to these Tax-responsive elements were found in the STLV-PH969 LTR, which might suggest differences in the Tax-mediated transactivation of this virus. We conclude that STLV-PH969 has all the genes and genomic regions to suggest a replication cycle comparable to that of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2.","['Van Brussel, M', 'Goubau, P', 'Rousseau, R', 'Desmyter, J', 'Vandamme, A M']","['Van Brussel M', 'Goubau P', 'Rousseau R', 'Desmyter J', 'Vandamme AM']","['Rega Institute for Medical Research and University Hospitals, Leuven, Belgium. vanbruss@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Papio/virology', 'Protein Precursors/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'RNA, Viral', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jul;71(7):5464-72. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.7.5464-5472.1997.,,,7,['10.1128/JVI.71.7.5464-5472.1997 [doi]'],,PMC191787,,['GENBANK/Y07616'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This viral protein is the product of alternate translation initiation 88 codons upstream of and in frame with the initiation codon of pr65gag, the precursor of the viral core proteins. Although expression of glycosylated Gag affects virus spread in the spleen, it appears not to affect virus spread in vitro in fibroblast cell lines (J. L. Portis et al., J. Virol. 68:3879-3887, 1994). The differential effects of this protein in vitro and in vivo have not been explained, and its function is unknown. We have here compared the in vitro processing of this molecule with that expressed in spleens of infected mice. In vitro, gp85gag was cleaved near the middle of the molecule, releasing the C-terminal half (containing capsid and nucleocapsid domains of pr65gag) as a secreted glycoprotein. The N-terminal half of the protein was associated with the plasma membrane as a approximately 55-kDa glycoprotein bearing the matrix domain of pr65gag as well as the N-terminal 88 residue L domain. This processing scheme was also observed in vivo, although two differences were seen. There were differences in N-linked glycosylation of the secreted form of the protein expressed in the spleen.

To identify features of central nervous system (CNS) infection that correlate with neurovirulence, we compared two neurovirulent MuLV, Fr98 and Fr98/SE, with a nonneurovirulent MuLV, Fr54. All three viruses utilize the polytropic receptor and are coisogenic, each containing a different envelope gene within a common genetic background. Both Fr98 and Fr98/SE induce a clinical neurologic disease characterized by hyperexcitability and ataxia yet differ in incubation period, 16 to 30 and 30 to 60 days, respectively. Fr54 infects the CNS but fails to induce clinical signs of neurologic disease. In this study, we compared the histopathology, regional virus distribution, and cell tropism in the brain, as well as the relative CNS viral burdens. All three viruses induced similar histopathologic effects, characterized by intense reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation associated with minimal vacuolar degeneration. The infected target cells for each virus consisted primarily of endothelial and microglial cells, with rare oligodendrocytes. Infection localized predominantly in white matter tracts of the cerebellum, internal capsule, and corpus callosum. The only feature that correlated with relative neurovirulence was viral burden as measured by both viral CA protein expression in cerebellar homogenates and quantification of infected cells. Interestingly, Fr54 (nonneurovirulent) and Fr98/SE (slow disease) had similar viral burdens at 3 weeks postinoculation, suggesting that they entered the brain with comparable efficiencies. However, spread of Fr98/SE within the brain thereafter exceeded that of Fr54, reaching levels of viral burden comparable to that seen for Fr98 (rapid disease) at 3 weeks. These results suggest that the determinants of neurovirulence in the envelope gene may influence the efficiency of virus spread within the brain and that a critical number of infected cells may be required for induction of clinical neurologic disease.","['Robertson, S J', 'Hasenkrug, K J', 'Chesebro, B', 'Portis, J L']","['Robertson SJ', 'Hasenkrug KJ', 'Chesebro B', 'Portis JL']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/cytology/*virology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Microglia/*virology', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virulence']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jul;71(7):5287-94. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.7.5287-5294.1997.,,,7,['10.1128/JVI.71.7.5287-5294.1997 [doi]'],,PMC191765,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its pathogenic properties are determined by the transcriptional enhancer of the U3 repeat region which shows preferential activity in T cells. Within the U3 repeats, the major determinant of T-cell specificity has been mapped to binding sites for the AML1 transcription factor family (also known as the core binding factor [CBF], polyomavirus enhancer binding protein 2 [PEBP2], and SL3-3 enhancer factor 1 [SEF-1]). SL3-3 viruses with AML1 site mutations have lost a major determinant of T-cell-specific enhancer function but have been found to retain a lymphomagenic potential, although disease induction is slower than for the SL3-3 wild type. To compare the specificities and mechanisms of disease induction of wild-type and mutant viruses, we have examined lymphomas induced by mutant viruses harboring transversions of three consecutive base pairs critical to AML1 site function (B. Hallberg, J. Schmidt, A. Luz, F. S. Pedersen, and T. Grundstrom. J. Virol. 65:4177-4181, 1991). Our results show that the mutated AML1 sites are genetically stable during lymphomagenesis and that ecotropic provirus numbers in DNA of tumors induced by wild-type and mutant viruses fall within the same range. Moreover, proviruses were found to be integrated at the c-myc locus in similar proportions of wild-type and mutant SL3-3-induced tumors, and the mutated AML1 sites of proviruses at c-myc are unaltered. In some cases, however, including one c-myc-integrated provirus, a single-base pair change was detected in a second, weaker AML1 binding site. By DNA rearrangement analysis of the T-cell receptor beta-locus, tumors induced by the AML1 site mutants are found to be of the T-cell type. Thus, although the AML1 site mutants have weakened T-cell-specific enhancers they are T-lymphomagenic, and wild-type- and mutant-virus-induced tumor DNAs are similar with respect to the number of overall ecotropic and c-myc-integrated clonal proviruses. The SL3-3 wild-type and AML1 site mutant viruses may therefore induce disease by similar mechanisms.","['Amtoft, H W', 'Sorensen, A B', 'Bareil, C', 'Schmidt, J', 'Luz, A', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Amtoft HW', 'Sorensen AB', 'Bareil C', 'Schmidt J', 'Luz A', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular and Structural Biology, University of Aarhus, Aarhus C, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*genetics', 'Vaccines, Attenuated', 'Virus Integration']",1997/07/01 00:00,1997/07/01 00:01,['1997/07/01 00:00'],"['1997/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1997 Jul;71(7):5080-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.71.7.5080-5087.1997.,,,7,['10.1128/JVI.71.7.5080-5087.1997 [doi]'],,PMC191741,,"['GENBANK/Y11798', 'GENBANK/Y11799', 'GENBANK/Y11800', 'GENBANK/Y11801', 'GENBANK/Y11802', 'GENBANK/Y11803', 'GENBANK/Y11804', 'GENBANK/Y11805', 'GENBANK/Y11806', 'GENBANK/Y11807', 'GENBANK/Y11808', 'GENBANK/Y11809', 'GENBANK/Y11810', 'GENBANK/Y11811', 'GENBANK/Y11812', 'GENBANK/Y11813']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, it has been shown that elevated H-2Dd expression on the infected thymocyte is a result of elevated mRNA transcription and that the transcriptional increase is correlated with elevated levels of a DNA binding activity, H-2 binding factor 1 (H-2 BF1), which recognizes the 5'-flanking sequences (5'-TGACGCG-3') of the H-2Dd gene. This target for transcription factor binding has been found to be identical in the 5'-regulatory region of 12 rodent class I genes, nine of which have been shown to be functional genes. Furthermore, this cis-element is found 5' of 20 primate class I genes (15 human genes), seven of which are known to be functional. Here, we demonstrate that activation transcription factor 1 (ATF-1) is one component of H-2 BF1. In addition, the levels of ATF-1 mRNA in uninfected and radiation leukemia virus-infected thymocytes parallel those of H-2Dd mRNA, and therefore, it is suggested that ATF-1 up-regulates the transcription of the H-2Dd gene after radiation leukemia virus infection of thymocytes. Transfection experiments also demonstrate that ATF-1 activates a reporter plasmid that contains the H-2 BF1 motif, but not a reporter lacking this motif. This is the first demonstration of the interaction of ATF-1 with 5'-regulatory sequences of major histocompatibility complex class I genes.","['Ishiguro, N', 'Brown, G D', 'Meruelo, D']","['Ishiguro N', 'Brown GD', 'Meruelo D']","['Department of Pathology and the Kaplan Cancer Center, New York University Medical Center, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Atf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 1', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, MHC Class I', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigen H-2D', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Radiation Leukemia Virus', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/virology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",1997/06/20 00:00,1997/06/20 00:01,['1997/06/20 00:00'],"['1997/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jun 20;272(25):15993-6001. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.25.15993.,,['CA22247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],25,"['10.1074/jbc.272.25.15993 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39425-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They both involve the gp130-transducing receptor, which dimerizes with either leukemia inhibitory receptor beta or with OSM receptor beta (OSMRbeta) to generate, respectively, type I and type II OSM receptors. Co-precipitation of gp130-associated proteins, flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, and tyrosine phosphorylation analyses allowed the characterization of both types of OSM receptors expressed on the surface of different cell lines. It also allowed the detection of a large size protein, p250, that specifically associates to the type II OSM receptor components and that is tyrosine-phosphorylated after the activation peak of the gp130.OSMRbeta heterocomplex. The restricted expression of type I OSM receptor by the JAR choriocarcinoma cell line, and type II receptor by the A375 melanoma cell line, permitted the characterization of their signaling machineries. Both type I and type II OSM receptors activated Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. The information is next relayed to the nucleus by the STAT3 transcriptional activator, which is recruited by both types of OSM receptors. In addition, STAT5b was specifically activated through the gp130.OSMRbeta type II heterocomplex.

Since minimal residual disease is regarded as the major cause for relapses of malignant diseases, immunotherapeutic strategies utilizing monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) or their conjugates to target 'dormant' tumor cells have increasingly attracted scientific interest. Immunotoxins (ITs) constructed by chemically linking plant or bacterial toxins to a MoAb can selectively kill their target cells when internalized after binding to specific cell surface receptors. Many different ITs against various blood-borne as well as solid malignancies have been successfully tested in vitro and in animal models. Chemically linked ITs and recombinant fusion toxins generated by using DNA technologies are currently being evaluated for their antitumor activity in several clinical phase I/II/III trials. While serious side effects are rare, there are still many problems to be solved, such as the immunogenicity of the toxin and/or antibody moiety or the poor capacity of ITs to penetrate large solid tumors. At the moment only heavily pretreated patients with massive tumor burden are admitted to early clinical studies, so that even minor responses after IT treatment are encouraging.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1960 and 1995, 2498 patients who were treated for Hodgkin's disease at Stanford University were evaluated. Survival, freedom from relapse, and important complications of therapy (cardiac disease and secondary cancers) were analyzed, and risk of mortality from all causes was calculated utilizing absolute excess risk calculations. RESULTS: The risk of death from Hodgkin's disease is 17% at 15 years of follow-up and increases only slightly thereafter. The risk of death from other causes is also 17% at 15 years, but increases sharply thereafter. The major causes of mortality (other than Hodgkin's disease) are secondary cancers and cardiac disease. Second cancers with significant increase in risk include leukemia (acute nonlymphocytic), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, lung/pleural cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, soft tissue and bone sarcomas, stomach cancer, salivary gland tumors, thyroid cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The absolute excess risk of death from causes other than Hodgkin's disease increases during each five-year follow-up interval for at least 25 years. However, the absolute excess risk of death during similar follow-up periods is less for patients treated in more recent years (1980-1995) than in the prior treatment era (1962-1980). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality for causes other than Hodgkin's disease is important in the long-term follow-up of patients. Causes of death are often treatment related.

In addition, immune disturbances such as hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune phenomena (particularly, autoimmune hemolytic anemia) are frequently found in CLL patients [1-2]. The etiology of CLL is unknown. In contrast with other leukemias, there is no relationship between CLL and exposure to radiation or other cytotoxic agents. A genetic basis is highly likely since there are differences in the incidence of CLL in different countries (e.g., CLL accounts for 30%-40% of all the leukemias in Western countries as compared to 5%-10% in Asian countries) and the risk of contracting CLL is higher among persons with first-degree relatives with the disease [3]. Because the incidence of CLL increases with age and the longer life expectancy of the general population, the age of patients at diagnosis is increasing. The median age at diagnosis is now about 70 years, with only one-third of the patients being less than 60 years of age. In the majority of the series, males predominate over females in a proportion of 1.5/1. The prognosis of patients with CLL is variable. However, clinical stages and other prognostic factors allow the individual risk of each patient to be assessed very accurately, which is useful for making treatment decisions.

With a previous protocol including CNS prophylaxis, 40% of our adult patients achieved CR and only 13% became long survivors. In 1988, following this poor experience, we adopted a very intensive pediatric-derived protocol. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients, 8 adults (median age 35, stage III: 1; IV: 7; leukemias: 6) and 13 children (median age 10, state III: 8; IV: 5; leukemias: 4) were treated with the same protocol (POG 8617), based on alternate two-phase cycles with sequential high-dose CTX, VCR, ADM + CNS chemoprophylaxis (phase A) and HD MTX + HiDAC (phase B). Adults received 6 cycles, children 8; i.t. prophylaxis in phase B was omitted in adults. RESULTS: Twenty of 21 (95%) patients achieved CR (adults 100%, children 92%). Two patients died early; 2 relapsed at 4 and 9 months. With a median follow-up of 28 months (4-96), 17 patients (81%) are event free (adults 75%, children 85%). Severe infections affected 62% of adults and 15% of children. CONCLUSIONS: (1) The prognosis of adult advanced BL definitely improved with this intensive protocol. (2) There were no differences in outcome between adults and children. (3) Outcome of lymphoma and leukemia was similar. (4) Severe infections occurred frequently in adults. This intensive pediatric protocol requires a careful supportive therapy.","['Todeschini, G', 'Tecchio, C', 'Degani, D', 'Meneghini, V', 'Marradi, P', 'Balter, R', 'Zanotti, R', 'Ricetti, M', 'Franchini, M', 'Perona, G']","['Todeschini G', 'Tecchio C', 'Degani D', 'Meneghini V', 'Marradi P', 'Balter R', 'Zanotti R', 'Ricetti M', 'Franchini M', 'Perona G']","['Department of Hematology, University of Verona School of Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1997;8 Suppl 1:77-81.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present report demonstrates the ability to advance this technology to an in situ assay.

METHODS: We randomly assigned 164 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (age range, 2 months to 17 years) to receive placebo or G-CSF (10 microg per kilogram of body weight per day subcutaneously), beginning one day after the completion of remission-induction therapy and continuing until the neutrophil count was greater than or equal to 1000 per cubic millimeter for two days. The clinical and laboratory effects of this therapy were documented for 21 days. The area under the plasma G-CSF concentration-time curve was measured on days 1 and 7 in both groups. RESULTS: Responses to the growth factor could be assessed in 148 patients (73 in the G-CSF group and 75 in the placebo group). G-CSF treatment did not significantly lower the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia (58 percent in the G-CSF group vs. 68 percent in the placebo group; relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 1.16), increase the likelihood of event-free survival at three years (83 percent in both groups), or decrease the number of severe infections (five in the G-CSF group vs. six in the placebo group). Patients treated with G-CSF had shorter median hospital stays (6 days vs. 10 days, P=0.011) and fewer documented infections (12 vs. 27, P=0.009). The median total costs of supportive care were similar in the G-CSF and placebo groups ($8,768 and $8,616, respectively). Among patients who did not have febrile neutropenia during the first week of G-CSF or placebo injections, higher systemic exposure to the growth factor on day 7 was significantly related to a lower probability of subsequent hospitalization (P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: G-CSF treatment had some clinical benefit in children who received induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but it did not reduce the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, prolong survival, or reduce the cost of supportive care.","['Pui, C H', 'Boyett, J M', 'Hughes, W T', 'Rivera, G K', 'Hancock, M L', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Synold, T', 'Relling, M V', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Crist, W M', 'Evans, W E']","['Pui CH', 'Boyett JM', 'Hughes WT', 'Rivera GK', 'Hancock ML', 'Sandlund JT', 'Synold T', 'Relling MV', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Crist WM', 'Evans WE']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and the University of Tennessee, Memphis, Colleges of Medicine, 38105-0318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Filgrastim', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction']",1997/06/19 00:00,1997/06/19 00:01,['1997/06/19 00:00'],"['1997/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1997 Jun 19;336(25):1781-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199706193362503.,,,25,['10.1056/NEJM199706193362503 [doi]'],"['N Engl J Med. 1997 Jun 19;336(25):1822-4.

The complex, named Bamet-H2, was characterized by elemental analysis, FT-IR, NMR, FAB-MS, and UV spectroscopy. The results indicate the following composition: C52H84N2O12ClNa Pt(II). Conductivity data suggest that the complex behaves as a sodium salt (1:1) of a complex of Pt(II) bound to one cl-, one bidentate CG moiety, and another monodentate CG moiety, i.e., Na[Pt(CG-O,N)(CG-O)Cl]. The compound is highly soluble (up to 10 mM) in water, ethanol, methanol, DMF, and DMSO. Bamet-H2 was stable in solution (either water or 150 mM NaCl solution), as measured by HPLC, up to 24 h. At this time, more than 90% of the platinum present in water or saline solutions was found to be Bamet-H2. Cytostatic activity against L1210 murine leukemia cells was found. This characteristic was stronger against rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Isolated in situ rat livers were perfused for 40 min with a recirculating medium containing 1 microM Bamet-H2, CG, or cisplatin. Uptake and excretion into bile were much greater for Bamet-H2 than for cisplatin, but less than for CG. Liver content was higher for Bamet-H2 than for cisplatin or CG. The results point to the potential usefulness of Bamet-H2 in the antitumoral therapy of neoplasias derived from liver parenchymal cells.","['Criado, J J', 'Herrera, M C', 'Palomero, M F', 'Medarde, M', 'Rodriguez, E', 'Marin, J J']","['Criado JJ', 'Herrera MC', 'Palomero MF', 'Medarde M', 'Rodriguez E', 'Marin JJ']","['Department of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', 'G59NX3I3RT (Glycocholic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Glycocholic Acid/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Rats']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1997 May;38(5):1022-32.,,,5,['S0022-2275(20)37226-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As oxidized LDL has been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis, its effect on macrophage apoE synthesis and secretion was examined. Human monocytic leukemia cells, THP-1, and human monocyte-derived macrophages were exposed to various forms of oxidatively modified LDL for determination of their effect on apoE mRNA and protein levels. Extensively copper oxidized (Cu-oxidized) LDL resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent increase in apoE mRNA and protein as compared to other forms of oxidized LDL, i.e., LDL modified by soybean lipoxygenase (SLO), azoamidinopropane HCl (AAPH), and hypochlorite (HOCl). Consistent with these results, experiments using THP-1 cells transfected with the apoE promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene indicated that Cu-oxidized LDL was the most potent stimulator of apoE transgene expression. Enhanced apoE expression due to Cu-oxidized LDL was shown to be due to cholesterol accumulation as well as additional factors. HPLC analysis of the various forms of modified LDL revealed that 7-ketocholesterol was the major oxysterol present in Cu-oxidized LDL. AAPH-oxidized LDL contained significantly less 7-ketocholesterol than Cu-oxidized LDL and virtually no 7-ketocholesterol was detected in SLO- or HOCl-oxidized LDL. Northern blot analysis indicated an increase in apoE mRNA in response to increasing concentrations of 7-ketocholesterol. These results elucidate a potential role of oxidized LDL, and specifically 7-ketocholesterol, in the stimulation of macrophage apoE secretion in atherosclerotic lesions.","['Cader, A A', 'Steinberg, F M', 'Mazzone, T', 'Chait, A']","['Cader AA', 'Steinberg FM', 'Mazzone T', 'Chait A']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-6426, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (oxidized low density lipoprotein)']",IM,"['Apolipoproteins E/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1997 May;38(5):981-91.,,"['DK 02456/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 07028/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 30086/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",5,['S0022-2275(20)37222-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). oncostatin M (OsM) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are members of a cytokine family, which are produced by activated macrophages and glomerular mesangial cells. These cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis of glomerular inflammation, but their action on glomerular cells is presently unclear. Therefore, we examined the effects of IL-6, OsM and LIF on chemokine synthesis of rat mesangial cells in culture. While LIF as well as IL-6 up-regulated monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA expression, OsM showed no such effect. The induction of MCP-1 mRNA by LIF and IL-6 was transient, peaking at one to two hours and two to three hours, respectively, and returning to background levels within several hours. Induction of MCP-1 mRNA by LIF and IL-6 was strongly inhibited by dexamethasone. LIF activated STAT factors in mesangial cells, suggesting their involvement in signal transduction pathways that lead to LIF-stimulated up-regulation of MCP-1 mRNA. By contrast, LIF. IL-6 and OsM failed to affect the expression of the chemokines, macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) and RANTES. The rapid, transient and differential regulation of MCP-1 expression induced by LIF and IL-6 contrasted with uniformly powerful effects of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta and TNF alpha that induced all tested chemokines for prolonged time periods. These results suggest that the selective and transient induction of MCP-1 by LIF and IL-6 may play a role in the preferential attraction of monocytes to the injured glomerulus.","['Hartner, A', 'Goppelt-Struebe, M', 'Hocke, G M', 'Sterzel, R B']","['Hartner A', 'Goppelt-Struebe M', 'Hocke GM', 'Sterzel RB']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaet Erlangen-Nuernberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL2)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Monokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/metabolism', 'Chemokine CCL5/metabolism', 'Chemokine CXCL2', 'Chemokines/*metabolism', 'Glomerular Mesangium/cytology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Monokines/metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Rats']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 1997 Jun;51(6):1754-60. doi: 10.1038/ki.1997.241.,,,6,"['S0085-2538(15)60081-3 [pii]', '10.1038/ki.1997.241 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though the number of cells belonging to the abnormal clone varied between individual cases, the percentage of clonal blasts was similar in MDS-AML and de novo AML patients. The erythropoietic cells appeared to be part of the abnormal clone in 13 of 14 patients with MDS-AML, but only in 1 of 6 with de novo AML. Similarly, clonal granulocytes were detected in 13 of 14 patients with MDS-AML, compared to 2 of 6 with de novo AML. Lymphocytes consistently displayed normal, diploid karyotype. The results suggest that it is possible to distinguish between MDS-AML and de novo AML by the use of MGG/FISH; in de novo AML the abnormal chromosomal clone is generally confined to the immature myeloid cells, while in MDS-AML mature granulocytes and erythroid cells are of clonal origin. It is, however, not possible to conclude that MDS-AML is a ""multipotent"" type of leukaemia, since it cannot be ruled out that the chromosomally aberrant erythroid cells and granulocytes represent surviving cells from the original MDS clone.","['Bernell, P', 'Arvidsson, I', 'Hast, R', 'Jacobsson, B', 'Stenke, L']","['Bernell P', 'Arvidsson I', 'Hast R', 'Jacobsson B', 'Stenke L']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute at Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/blood/classification/*genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*genetics/*pathology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1997 Apr;58(4):241-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb01661.x.,,,4,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1997.tb01661.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patients were given conventional induction treatment with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Patients not entering complete remission (CR) after 1 course of daunorubicin/cytarabine were given 1 course of amsacrine/etoposide/cytarabine. Those entering complete remission received 3 consolidation courses using mitoxantrone, etoposide, amsacrine and cytarabine. One hundred and eighteen patients were enrolled. Complete remission was attained after 1-2 courses in 90 patients (76%). Another 6 patients reached CR after 3-4 induction courses for a total CR rate of 81%. If feasible, patients were offered either allogeneic or unpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation. Twenty-four patients underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation; 15 in first remission, 8 in second remission, 1 in early relapse. Thirty patients below 56 yr of age underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in first remission. The overall probability of survival at 4 yr was 34%, and for patients below 40 yr of age 50%. Leukemia-free survival was 35% for the whole cohort of patients; 52% for patients below 40 yr of age. Patients undergoing allogeneic or autologous bone marrow transplantation in first remission had an overall survival of 86% and 47%, respectively, while the probability of leukemia-free survival in these groups was 87% vs. 40% at 4 yr.

S., Wojchowski, D. M., and Sytkowski, A. J., J. Biol. Chem. 262, 2933, 1987; Choi, H. S., Bailey, S. C., Donahue, K. A., Vanasse, G. J., and Sytkowski, A. J., J. Biol. Chem. 265, 4143, 1990). We have now demonstrated this effect in intact cells and have obtained further information regarding pp43 function during erythropoietin stimulation. 32P-phosphorylated membranes were subjected to conditions of increasing pH. [32P]pp43 dissociated readily into solution, reaching half-maximal dissociation at pH approximately 9. This dissociation was enhanced markedly by increasing the ionic strength up to a maximum of 0.5 M KCl. These biochemical properties characterize pp43 as a membrane-associated protein. Addition of [gamma-32P]ATP to an aqueous supernatant prepared from unlabeled membranes resulted in the 32P-phosphorylation of pp43 in solution, after dissociation from the plasma membrane. Furthermore, erythropoietin treatment of unlabeled, intact cells followed by fractionation and 32P-phosphorylation resulted in a striking erythropoietin- and time-dependent increase in [32P]pp43 found in the supernatant and a concomitant decrease in [32P]pp43 found in the membrane pellet. This strongly suggests that erythropoietin stimulates the dissociation of pp43 from the plasma membrane and promotes translocation into the supernatant (cytoplasm). Using a renaturation kinase assay, we demonstrated that pp43 is capable of autophosphorylation on serine and threonine, thus identifying it as a new protein serine/threonine kinase. The results suggest a role for pp43 in transmembrane signaling.","['Lunn, E D', 'Sytkowski, A J']","['Lunn ED', 'Sytkowski AJ']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '660YQ98I10 (Potassium Chloride)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*enzymology', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Potassium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1997 Jun 15;342(2):344-50. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1997.0122.,,['DK38841/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],2,"['S0003-9861(97)90122-3 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1997.0122 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, they have been used in the treatment of certain forms of cancer, such as chronic myelogenous leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. However, there is little evidence that IFNs would be effective in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia, and molecular mechanisms underlying IFN unresponsiveness have not been clarified. Here we have studied the activation and induction of IFN-specific transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1, STAT2, and p48 in all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-differentiated myeloid leukemia cells using promyelocytic NB4, myeloblastic HL-60, and monoblastic U937 cells as model systems. These cells respond to ATRA by growth inhibition and differentiation. We show that in undifferentiated NB4 cells, 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase and MxB gene expression is not activated by IFN-alpha, possibly due to a relative lack of signaling molecules, especially p48 protein. However, during ATRA-induced differentiation, steady-state STAT1, STAT2, and especially p48 mRNA and corresponding protein levels were elevated both in NB4 and U937 cells, apparently correlating to an enhanced responsiveness of these cells to IFNs. ATRA treatment of NB4 cells sensitized them to IFN action as seen by increased IFN-gamma activation site DNA-binding activity or by efficient formation of IFN-alpha-specific ISGF3 complex and subsequent oligoadenylate synthetase and MxB gene expression. Lack of p48 expression could be one of the mechanisms of promyelocytic leukemia cell escape from growth-inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha.","['Matikainen, S', 'Ronni, T', 'Lehtonen, A', 'Sareneva, T', 'Melen, K', 'Nordling, S', 'Levy, D E', 'Julkunen, I']","['Matikainen S', 'Ronni T', 'Lehtonen A', 'Sareneva T', 'Melen K', 'Nordling S', 'Levy DE', 'Julkunen I']","['National Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (MX2 protein, human)', '0 (Myxovirus Resistance Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', '*GTP-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit', 'Interferon-alpha/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Myxovirus Resistance Proteins', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/*drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Jun;8(6):687-98.,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological activities of OM can be mediated by two different heterodimeric receptor complexes, the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)/OM shared receptor and the OM-specific receptor. In this study, we have examined the growth-regulatory effect of OM on 10 breast cancer cell lines derived from human tumors. The cellular proliferation of seven of these breast cancer cell lines was inhibited by OM. The three cell lines that did not respond to OM treatment lacked the expression of OM receptors. The growth-inhibitory activity of OM is examined further in the H3922 breast cancer cell line, which expresses the high-affinity OM receptor at a relatively higher level. We found that the cellular proliferation of H3922 cells was induced strongly by extrogenous epidermal growth factor (EGF), EGF-like factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor. The proliferative activities of these growth factors can be abolished totally by cotreatment of H3922 cells with OM. Treatment of H3922 cells with OM for 24 h did not block EGF binding or the induction of EGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation. This finding suggests that OM interferes with the mitogenic signal at steps distal to the EGF receptor. Examination of proto-oncogene expression demonstrated that OM down-regulates the c-myc gene in H3922 cells. The biological effects reported herein are not shared by the OM-related cytokines interleukin 6 or LIF, as demonstrated by the inability of these proteins to inhibit cell growth or modulate c-myc gene expression in breast cancer cells. Additionally, the high-affinity binding of labeled OM cannot be displaced by LIF. Together, these data suggest that OM is a growth inhibitor for breast cancer cells. The inhibitory activity is mediated predominantly through the OM-specific receptor, and activation of this receptor abrogates growth factor stimulation and down-regulates the c-myc proto-oncogene.","['Liu, J', 'Spence, M J', 'Wallace, P M', 'Forcier, K', 'Hellstrom, I', 'Vestal, R E']","['Liu J', 'Spence MJ', 'Wallace PM', 'Forcier K', 'Hellstrom I', 'Vestal RE']","['Mountain States Medical Research Institute, Boise, Idaho, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/antagonists & inhibitors', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc/genetics/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/agonists', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Receptors, Cytokine/agonists/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1997 Jun;8(6):667-76.,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BE2-78 positivity of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tumor cells is a useful diagnostic and prognostic determinant in evaluating patients with that disorder. The BE2-78 protein was isolated from Epstein Barr virus-transformed B cells, purified by 1- and 2-dimensional electrophoresis and then sequenced. The sequence of 4 isolated peptide fragments was highly homologous with the 78-kDa heat shock protein, BiP, an endoplasmic reticulum chaperone. The similarity between BiP and BE2-78 was supported by the demonstration that BE2-78, like BiP, avidly binds to ATP. However, polyclonal and monoclonal reagents that recognize cytoplasmic 70- and 78-kDa heat shock proteins do not detect the BE2-78 antigen on the cell surface of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or Epstein Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes, and peptide mapping demonstrates sequence divergence, suggesting that either they are distinct or conformationally different molecules. Our results indicate that BE2-78 is a cell surface heat shock protein. The possibility that malignant or transformed lymphocytes may express cell surface molecules with the capacity to bind a spectrum of exogenous or endogenous peptides has potential implications for tumor immunology.","['Berger, C L', 'Dong, Z', 'Hanlon, D', 'Bisaccia, E', 'Edelson, R L']","['Berger CL', 'Dong Z', 'Hanlon D', 'Bisaccia E', 'Edelson RL']","['Department of Dermatology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510-8059, USA.

We sought to study the relevance of these apoptotic regulating gene products in leukaemia. In a panel of leukaemia and lymphoma cell lines (HL60, DoHH2, CEM C7, L1210 and S49), the Bax alpha-to-Bcl-2 ratio as assessed by Western-blot analysis correlated with sensitivity to dexamethasone treatment. In addition, in HAbax alpha-transfected CEM C7 clones, a similar correlation was found for dexamethasone and thapsigargin sensitivity. In bone-marrow aspirates from patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic or myelocytic leukaemia (ALL, n = 48; AML, n = 8), the Bcl-2 and Bax alpha levels were highly variable, but well within the range found in the Bax alpha transfectants and in the established cell lines. Bcl-2 levels were lower in T- than in B-lineage ALL, which could be ascribed to simultaneous inverse relation between Bcl-2 and WBC. By contrast, Bax alpha:Bcl-2 was independent of any presenting feature and was largely dependent on Bax alpha levels.

The autocrine production of GMCSF is believed to be responsible for the spontaneous proliferation of JMML cells. A nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB)/Rel binding site within the GM-CSF gene promoter, termed the kappaB element, plays an important role in controlling transcription from the GM-CSF gene. We investigated the effect of an oligonucleotide GM3, directed to form a DNA triple helix across this kappaB element, on growth and GM-CSF production by JMML cells. Treatment of these cells, either unstimulated or induced by TNFalpha, with GM3 led to a significant and specific inhibition of both GM-CSF production and spontaneous colony formation. This constitutes the first report linking specific triplex-mediated inhibition of gene transcription with a functional outcome; i.e., cell growth. We observed the constitutive presence of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins in the nucleus of JMML cells. The constitutive and TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB/Rel complexes were identical and were composed mainly of p50 and c-Rel proteins. Treatment of the cells with a neutralizing anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody completely abrogated constitutive nuclear expression of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins. These results indicate that the aberrant, constitutive GM-CSF gene activation in JMML is maintained by TNFalpha-mediated activation of NF-kappaB/Rel proteins. Our findings identify the molecular basis for the autocrine TNFalpha activation of the GM-CSF gene in JMML and suggest potential novel and specific approaches for the treatment of this aggressive childhood leukemia.","['Kochetkova, M', 'Iversen, P O', 'Lopez, A F', 'Shannon, M F']","['Kochetkova M', 'Iversen PO', 'Lopez AF', 'Shannon MF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, 5000 South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (triplex DNA)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/analysis/metabolism', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Jun 15;99(12):3000-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI119495.,,,12,['10.1172/JCI119495 [doi]'],,PMC508152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, stimulation of gp130 by IL-6-related cytokines is known to exert a cytoprotective effect. In the present study, we investigated the possibility that activation of gp130 initiates activation of the cytoprotective genes in cardiac myocytes. Incubation of cardiac myocytes with LIF induced the expression of bcl-x, and the isoform that was induced by LIF was identified as bcl-xL. Induction of bcl-xL protein was also identified by Western blotting. Antisense oligonucleotide against bcl-x mRNA inhibited protective effect of LIF accompanied with the reduction in bclxL protein. We constructed bcl-x promoter-luciferase reporter gene plasmids (-639/+10- or -161/+10-luciferase), and transfected them to cardiac myocytes. LIF stimulation increased the luciferase activity of -639/+10-luciferase plasmids. Although -161/+10-luciferase plasmids presented comparable responsiveness to LIF, the basal transcription level was impaired. The LIF-responsive cis-element was localized to a DNA fragment (positions -161 to +10) that contains an interferon-gamma activation site (GAS) motif (GGA) at position -41 of the bcl-x gene promoter. This motif bound to STAT1, not to STAT3, and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that this motif was essential for LIF-responsive promoter activity. These data suggest that LIF induces bcl-x mRNA via STAT1 binding cis-element in cardiac myocytes, presenting cytoprotective effect.","['Fujio, Y', 'Kunisada, K', 'Hirota, H', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, K', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Fujio Y', 'Kunisada K', 'Hirota H', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K', 'Kishimoto T']","['Department of Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Osaka 565, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Norepinephrine/pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1997 Jun 15;99(12):2898-905. doi: 10.1172/JCI119484.,,,12,['10.1172/JCI119484 [doi]'],,PMC508141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the neuropsychological test panel including verbal and performance IQ the survivors had significantly lower scores. Early onset of the disease and receiving radiotherapy correlated with impaired test results most significantly, especially on memory functions. One in five of the survivors reported having suffered from reading and writing problems that interfered with success in school and the subjects of the study group had progressed to high school less often than control subjects. The social indices indicated delayed development of sexuality and separation from parents. Overt mental problems appearing at a one-off interview were the same as in the control group. In conclusion, up to two thirds of the childhood cancer survivors as young adults still have physical or neuropsychological health problems and half showed delayed psychosexual maturation. This magnitude of various disorders indicates a long-term but individually oriented follow-up of this small group with the opportunity of physical, social, or psychological management of their main problem.","['Kokkonen, J', 'Vainionpaa, L', 'Winqvist, S', 'Lanning, M']","['Kokkonen J', 'Vainionpaa L', 'Winqvist S', 'Lanning M']","['Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Learning Disabilities', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Memory', 'Neoplasms/physiopathology/*psychology/therapy']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1997 May-Jun;14(3):223-32. doi: 10.3109/08880019709009492.,,,3,['10.3109/08880019709009492 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation of the human macrophage cell line THP-1 with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) resulted in maximal induction of both Tap-1 and Tap-2 mRNA within 24 hr. Nuclear run-on analyses showed that the increased expression of Tap-1 and Tap-2 was controlled at the level of transcription. Half-life studies demonstrated that mRNAs for both genes became destabilized after stimulation of THP-1 cells with IFN-gamma for 24 hr, suggesting that a posttranscriptional mechanism down-regulates TAP gene expression following activation. Treatment of cells with both IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) altered the kinetics and amount of Tap-1 mRNA and protein expression, compared to those with stimulation with IFN-gamma alone.

Our early observation revealed that IL-10 had B cell growth factor (BCGF) activity in human B cells preactivated with SAC or anti-Ig. The responsiveness of the preactivated B cells to IL-10 greatly increased when B cells were activated in the presence of IL-2, whereas IL-10 has no BCGF activity when added at the initiation of activation by SAC. To investigate the dual effects (proliferation and apoptosis) of IL-10 on B cells, the expression of a panel of bcl-2 protoncogene family members, bcl-2, bcl-x, mcl-1, and bax, was analyzed when B cells were activated by SAC. Bcl-xL protein was not expressed in the small resting B cells but was induced by SAC stimulation, reaching its peak at 48 hr. The addition of IL-2 further augmented the Bcl-xL expression with the same kinetics, whereas Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 were expressed by resting B cells and enhanced by SAC stimulation. However, the addition of IL-10 at the initiation of activation down-regulated Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, and Mcl-1 expression. At the same time, B cell proliferation was inhibited and apoptotic cell number increased, suggesting the growth arrest and/or apoptosis of B cells. The apoptosis of SAC-activated B cells by IL-10 was further confirmed by propidium iodide-staining and Annexin V-FITC-staining methods. In contrast, IL-10 failed to down-regulate the Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 expression but rather augmented the expression of Mcl-1 of B cells after preactivation for 48 hr with SAC and IL-2. Under this culture condition, B cells responded to IL-10 to proliferate and differentiate, while IL-2 and IL-10 had an additive or synergistic effect. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-10 acts on the induction stage of Bcl-xL expression and regulates the apoptosis and proliferation of SAC-activated B cells through their bcl-2 family gene expression.","['Li, L', 'Krajewski, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Choi, Y S']","['Li L', 'Krajewski S', 'Reed JC', 'Choi YS']","['Laboratory of Cellular Immunology, Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, Louisiana 70121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Staphylococcus aureus/*immunology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1997/05/25 00:00,1997/05/25 00:01,['1997/05/25 00:00'],"['1997/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1997 May 25;178(1):33-41. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1997.1129.,,"['CA-42006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69381/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",1,"['S0008-8749(97)91129-1 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1997.1129 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up-regulation of ICAM-1 by mAb YH384 was further confirmed by Northern blotting analysis at the mRNA level, and the maximal message of ICAM-1 was observed 4 hr after stimulation. mAb YH384-induced upregulation of cell surface expression was ICAM-1-specific, and the expression of the other nine molecules tested was not augmented. Up-regulation of ICAM-1 was also observed following stimulation with other mAb specific for CD11a (S6F1), CD11b (JML-H11), and CD18 (IB4); all of these mAb recognized members of the beta 2-integrin family, but not with isotype-matched control mAb. The mAb 4B4 (specific for beta 1-integrin) similarly, but more weakly, augmented ICAM-1 expression. The effect of mAb YH384 on expression of ICAM-1 was dose-dependently suppressed by treatment with herbimycin A or genistein, both inhibitors of tyrosine kinase.

The IL-6/sIL-6R complex was also able to rapidly induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the IL-6 transducer, gp130. Neutralizing antibodies directed against either IL-6 or gp130 blocked protein S upregulation by the IL-6/sIL-6R complex. It was also observed that exogenous sIL-6R could also upregulate protein S by forming a complex with IL-6 constitutively produced by the endothelial cell. Two other cytokines which also utilize the gp130 receptor, oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), were also able to upregulate endothelial cell protein S.

These molecules share a basic-helix-loop-helix leucine zipper domain (bHLHZip) and bind DNA at the E box (CANNTG) consensus by forming heterodimers with Max. We report the isolation, characterization and mapping of a human gene and its mouse homolog encoding a new member of this family of proteins, named Rox. Through interaction mating and immunoprecipitation techniques, we demonstrate that Rox heterodimerizes with Max and weakly homodimerizes. Interestingly, bandshift assays demonstrate that the Rox-Max heterodimer shows a novel DNA binding specificity, having a higher affinity for the CACGCG site compared with the canonical E box CACGTG site. Transcriptional studies indicate that Rox represses transcription in both human HEK293 cells and yeast. We demonstrate that repression in yeast is through interaction between the N-terminus of the protein and the Sin3 co-repressor, as previously shown for the other Mad family members. ROX is highly expressed in quiescent fibroblasts and expression markedly decreases when cells enter the cell cycle. Moreover, ROX expression appears to be induced in U937 myeloid leukemia cells stimulated to differentiate with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. The identification of a novel Max-interacting protein adds an important piece to the puzzle of Myc/Max/Mad coordinated action and function in normal and pathological situations. Furthermore, mapping of the human gene to chromosome 17p13.3 in a region that frequently undergoes loss of heterozygosity in a number of malignancies, together with the biochemical and expression features, suggest involvement of ROX in human neoplasia.","['Meroni, G', 'Reymond, A', 'Alcalay, M', 'Borsani, G', 'Tanigami, A', 'Tonlorenzi, R', 'Lo Nigro, C', 'Messali, S', 'Zollo, M', 'Ledbetter, D H', 'Brent, R', 'Ballabio, A', 'Carrozzo, R']","['Meroni G', 'Reymond A', 'Alcalay M', 'Borsani G', 'Tanigami A', 'Tonlorenzi R', 'Lo Nigro C', 'Messali S', 'Zollo M', 'Ledbetter DH', 'Brent R', 'Ballabio A', 'Carrozzo R']","['Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine (TIGEM), San Raffaele Biomedical Science Park, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (MNT protein, human)', '0 (MXD1 protein, human)', '0 (Mad protein, mouse)', '0 (Mnt protein, mouse)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '137468-70-3 (Max protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Binding Sites', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylases', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1997 May 15;16(10):2892-906. doi: 10.1093/emboj/16.10.2892.,,"['TGM06S01/Telethon/Italy', 'TGM94000/Telethon/Italy', 'TGM97000/Telethon/Italy']",10,['10.1093/emboj/16.10.2892 [doi]'],,PMC1169897,,"['GENBANK/X96401', 'GENBANK/Y07609']",,['EMBO J 1997 Oct 1;16(19):6055'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A nested case-control study from a large cohort of UK oil distribution workers followed up since 1950 was carried out to investigate the association between leukaemia, in particular acute myeloid leukaemia, and exposure to benzene. Ninety-one cases occurring before 1993 were identified from death certificates or cancer registrations (available from 1971). Histopathology departments were contacted to obtain material that might confirm the diagnosis of leukaemia and this was received for 39 (43%) cases. The majority of the cases (88) were identified primarily from death certificates, with a cancer registration also being received for 56 (90%) of the 62 deaths occurring after 1971. Discrepancies in the diagnoses from these two sources were found for 12 cases, five being acute myeloid leukaemia. For the majority, the diagnosis on the death certificate was more specific than that on the cancer registration. Histology reports were received for nine of the discrepancies, all confirming the death certificate diagnosis. Although leukaemia appears to be regularly registered as a cancer, records may not be routinely updated when new clinical information becomes available.

In the BL lines, the highly sensitive ones always lacked Bcl-2(bcl-2 protein), while the DX resistant ones expressed Bcl-2. Black93 is the first BL cell-line derived from a ATLS patient, proving that cell lines can be established in vitro from ATLS patients. Since some pre-B ALL lines expressing Bcl-2 were DX-sensitive, the relationship between Bcl-2 and DX-sensitivity is not straight-forward. In the BL cells, however, the absence of Bcl-2 appears to be responsible for the DX-sensitivity. The DX-sensitivity and the absence of Bcl-2 is a major characteristic carried by t(8;14) neoplasms. In addition, there may be a stage of B-lineage differentiation without Bcl-2. While rare BL cases have been reported to express TdT (terminal desoxynucleotidyl transferase), Tree92 is the first such line, expressing S-Ig(mu, lambda), TdT and RAG (recombination activating gene)-1. When surface mu is ligated with antibody, RAG-1 was suppressed in expression, indicating that the signal through S-Ig can modulate the expression of RAG-1 in the Tree92 cells. Chromosome translocation is known to be associated with a specific stage of differentiation. Such specific stage for t(8;14), however, is broad enough to cover S-Ig(+), TdT(+) and RAG-1(+) stage, too. The phenotypic classification of leukemia/lymphoma and the delineation of differentiation scheme of normal hematopoietic cells, are dependent on each other. The documentation of the properties such as DX-sensitivity, the absence of Bcl-2, the expression of RAG-1 and its modulation by the signal through S-Ig is an example in which the diverse properties of human t(8;14) neoplasms can contribute for delineating the differentiation scheme of normal hematopoietic cells more precisely.","['Tani, A', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Nakamura, F', 'Kumagai, S']","['Tani A', 'Tatsumi E', 'Nakamura F', 'Kumagai S']","['Dept Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications', 'Cell Line', 'Child', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, RAG-1', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*etiology']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 1996 Dec;9(4):337-44.,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the structural requirement of BCR-ABL for the interactions with SH2-containing signaling molecules, we examined a series of BCR-ABL mutants which include the Grb2 binding site deleted BCR-ABL (1-63 BCR/ABL), the tetramerization domain deleted BCR-ABL (64-509 BCR/ABL), and the SH2 domain deleted BCR-ABL (BCR/ABL delta SH2). These BCR-ABL mutants were previously shown to reduce the transforming activity in fibroblasts. We found that the tetramerization domain deleted BCR-ABL did not induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 and the interactions of BCR-ABL, SHP-2, and Grb2. In vitro kinase assays have also shown the tetramerization domain deleted BCR-ABL mutant did not phosphorylate GST-SHP-2 in vitro. SHP-2 was co-immunoprecipitated with P13Kinase in BCR/ABL p210 transformed cells, however this interaction was not observed in the tetramerization domain deleted BCR-ABL mutant.

In a series of 70 children enrolled in a single program of chemotherapy, cell growth on stroma was a powerful and independent prognostic indicator. Second, a culture system capable of maintaining the majority of ALL blast cells at high levels of viability is also ideally suited for testing antileukemic drugs. Promising results were obtained with 2-chloro-deoxyadenosine and interleukin-4, leading to clinical trials of these two compounds in children with refractory ALL. In addition, we compared the direct antileukemic activities of dexamethasone and prednisolone and found that dexamethasone is five to six times more cytotoxic (on a molar basis) than prednisolone, in agreement with the anti-inflammatory activities of these drugs.

The identification of the orphan cytokine receptor MPL led to the cloning of the primary regulator of platelet production, termed thrombopoietin (TPO). TPO promotes both the proliferation of megakaryocytic progenitor cells and their differentiation into platelet-producing megakaryocytes. Expression and function of this new cytokine ligand-receptor pair were also examined in primary and cultured leukemia cells. Among the large panel of human leukemia cell lines studied, MPL expression occurred predominantly in lines with erythro-megakaryocytic phenotypes. The MPL receptor was also found in a large percentage of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. MPL expression was not limited to certain morphological subtypes, although the highest percentages were seen in the erythroid and megakaryocytic subclasses. A significant portion of AML cases and of erythroid, megakaryocytic and myeloid leukemia cell lines co-expressed TPO and MPL and mRNA transcripts, although no biologically active TPO appeared to be secreted by these cells. Recombinant TPO induced clearly in vitro proliferation of a significant percentage of primary AML cases, predominantly of the megakaryocytic subtype. TPO significantly enhanced the cytokine-induced growth of AML cells in a substantial fraction of cases responsive to GM-CSF, IL-3, or SCF. While none of 30 growth factor-independent erythro-megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines responded to TPO with increased proliferation, TPO strongly augmented the growth of several constitutively cytokine-dependent cell lines (HU-3, M-07e, M-MOK, OCI-AML-1, TF-1) which can be made TPO-dependent and used as bioassays. Neither in primary cells nor in cell lines did TPO appear to induce morphological, functional or immunological differentiation. Expression of the MPL receptor is not correlated with a proliferative response to TPO. The data reviewed here document the wide expression of the MPL receptor on myeloid leukemia cells and also suggest some proliferative effects on certain leukemia cells, apparently on non-megakaryocytic leukemia cells as well TPO-responsive cell lines represent powerful tools for further (patho-)physiological analyses.","['Drexler, H G', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Quentmeier H']","['German Collection of Microorganisms & Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschwieg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 1996 Dec;9(4):309-16.,36,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thrombophlebitis often occurs during the course of a known cancer, but sometimes constitutes the presenting sign. Based on a series of 10 cases of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) revealing an underlying cancer, the authors analyse the various aspects of this association and the elements which help to guide the diagnosis towards a cancer. A simple assessment comprising clinical examination, full blood count and differential white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, protein electrophoresis, chest x-ray and abdomino-pelvic ultrasonography was performed on admission in 75 cases of presumably idiopathic DVT and revealed a cancer in 10 cases: 6 women and 4 men with a mean age of 53 years. Cancers were located in the urogenital tract in 5 cases, in the bronchi in 2 cases, in the stomach in one case, and there was one case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) and another case of liposarcoma of the left iliac fossa. The histological type most frequently encountered was adenocarcinoma in 6 cases. In 9 out of 10 cases, the cancer was discovered at the stage of metastases. However, a localized cancer was detected in one case, in which surgical treatment allowed cure of the patient. Comparison of the various characteristics of DVT between the group of DVT revealing a cancer and the group of DVT which remained idiopathic did not reveal any statistically significant difference. A simple, inexpensive assessment looking for a cancer must be systematically performed in all cases of idiopathic DVT in patients between the ages of 50 and 85 years. Other more elaborate examinations may be requested on the basis of the results of the preliminary assessment.","['Chraibi, S', 'Bennis, A', 'Kemmou, O', 'Fadouach, S', 'Tahiri, A', 'Chraibi, N']","['Chraibi S', 'Bennis A', 'Kemmou O', 'Fadouach S', 'Tahiri A', 'Chraibi N']","['Service de Cardiologie, CHU lbn Rochd, Casablanca, Maroc.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris),Annales de cardiologie et d'angeiologie,0142167,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombophlebitis/*etiology', 'Time Factors']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Cardiol Angeiol (Paris). 1997 Mar;46(3):145-9.,19,,3,,,,Thromboses veineuses profondes et cancers occultes.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fas and Fas ligand also influence the ability of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells to eliminate tumor cells. However, by inducing apoptosis in activated T cells, the Fas/Fas ligand system may protect some tumor cells from clearance by the immune system. Anticancer drugs enhance Fas ligand expression on the surface of Fas receptor-expressing leukemia cells, thus suggesting that apoptosis caused by these drugs may be mediated via the Fas/Fas ligand system. PURPOSE: This study was conducted to further investigate the relationship between the modulation of Fas receptor gene and protein expression by treatment of cells with cytotoxic drugs and the immune clearance of tumor cells. METHODS: Fas expression on human HT29 colon carcinoma cells treated with a variety of anticancer drugs (cisplatin, doxorubicin, mitomycin C, fluorouracil, and camptothecin) was analyzed by use of quantitative flow cytometry. Human HCT8R and HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and human U937 leukemia cells were treated with cisplatin only and analyzed in the same way. Fas ligand messenger RNA and protein levels were studied by use of a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and by flow cytometry. Fas gene expression and messenger RNA levels in cisplatin-treated HT29 cells were characterized by use of in vitro nuclear run-on and northern blot hybridization assays. The cytotoxic activities of agonistic anti-Fas antibodies, Fas ligand, and allogeneic peripheral blood leukocytes, in the absence or presence of Fas-blocking monoclonal antibodies, against tumor cells were assessed by methylene blue staining and chromium-51 release assays. RESULTS: Clinically relevant concentrations of cisplatin, doxorubicin, mitomycin C, fluorouracil, or camptothecin enhanced Fas receptor expression on the plasma membrane of HT29 cells. Cisplatin-mediated increases in Fas expression were confirmed in HCT8R, HCT116, and U937 cells. The enhancement of Fas protein expression was associated with an increased sensitivity of cisplatin-treated tumor cells to agonistic anti-Fas antibodies, to soluble Fas ligand, and to allogeneic peripheral blood leukocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. Each of these effects was blocked by co-treatment of the cells with antagonistic anti-Fas antibody. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In addition to their direct cytotoxic effects, chemotherapeutic drugs sensitize tumor cells to Fas-mediated cytotoxicity and Fas-dependent immune clearance. On the basis of these findings, new strategies might be developed to improve the efficacy of these drugs.","['Micheau, O', 'Solary, E', 'Hammann, A', 'Martin, F', 'Dimanche-Boitrel, M T']","['Micheau O', 'Solary E', 'Hammann A', 'Martin F', 'Dimanche-Boitrel MT']","[""Contrat Jeune Formation de l'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) 94-08, Unite de Formation et de Recherchede Medecine, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HT29 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/drug effects/metabolism/*physiology']",1997/06/04 00:00,1997/06/04 00:01,['1997/06/04 00:00'],"['1997/06/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/04 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/04 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1997 Jun 4;89(11):783-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/89.11.783.,,,11,['10.1093/jnci/89.11.783 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels for IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM were determined by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. RESULTS: Cells isolated from the synovium of RA patients expressed mRNA for IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM at higher levels than did synovial cells from osteoarthritis (OA) patients, and spontaneously released greater quantities of these proteins in culture. Fibroblast cell lines derived from RA synovium were able to produce IL-6, IL-11, and LIF, but not OSM, when stimulated with IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. OSM was found to be produced spontaneously by synovial tissue macrophages. IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM were present in synovial fluid from the RA patients; levels of IL-6, LIF, and OSM were present in significantly greater quantities in RA patients than in OA patients. However, only IL-6 was significantly elevated in the serum of RA patients and correlated with the serum CRP level, while other IL-6-type cytokines were not detected. CONCLUSION: IL-6, IL-11, LIF, and OSM are all produced in large amounts at the site of disease activity, but IL-6 derived from synovial fibroblasts may be the major hormone-like mediator that induces the hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins in RA.","['Okamoto, H', 'Yamamura, M', 'Morita, Y', 'Harada, S', 'Makino, H', 'Ota, Z']","['Okamoto H', 'Yamamura M', 'Morita Y', 'Harada S', 'Makino H', 'Ota Z']","['Okayama University Medical School, Shikato-cho, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*blood', 'C-Reactive Protein/analysis', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/blood', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Joints/chemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncostatin M', 'Osteoarthritis/blood', 'Peptides/blood', 'Synovial Membrane/*chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1997 Jun;40(6):1096-105. doi: 10.1002/art.1780400614.,,,6,['10.1002/art.1780400614 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that the CD5- B cells were excellent stimulators, whereas stimulation of AMLR by B cells enriched for CD5+ cells resulted in significantly reduced proliferative responses (P < 0.005).

Combination treatment demonstrates additive effects between either D3 and atRA or D3 and rTGF-beta2, resulting in a cell population with mixed characteristics since individual cells exhibit both monocytic as granulocytic cell features. The capacity of single and combined treatments to induce a permanent differentiation was investigated. Therefore, cells were preincubated with the drugs during six days, test drugs were removed and cell number was monitored. The total cell count of populations treated with single agents remains constant for only a few days and then increases rapidly. rTGF-beta2 cooperated with D3 in inducing a long-lasting differentiation state (3 weeks). Addition of atRA to this combination did not significantly alter proliferation or differentiation, but some cells underwent apoptosis. Therefore, a total and permanent differentiation of leukemic cells may be achieved by repeated exposure to a combination of differentiation inducing agents.","['Verlinden, L', 'Verstuyf, A', 'Mathieu, C', 'Tan, B K', 'Bouillon, R']","['Verlinden L', 'Verstuyf A', 'Mathieu C', 'Tan BK', 'Bouillon R']","['Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Endocrinology (LEGENDO), Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/drug effects/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1997 Jan;60(1-2):87-97. doi: 10.1016/s0960-0760(96)00174-4.,,,1-2,['10.1016/s0960-0760(96)00174-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two MRP-overexpressing cell lines (HL60/AR and H69/AR) and two P-gP-overexpressing cell lines (HL60/Tax and P388/ADR) were cultured with different concentrations of daunorubicin (DNR) or vincristine (VCR) in the presence or absence of various concentrations of probenecid (0.01-10 mM). Drug sensitivity was determined using an MTT assay. DNR accumulation and subcellular distribution were determined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy respectively. VCR accumulation was determined by scintillation spectrometry. RESULTS: Probenecid, in a concentration-dependent manner, reversed resistance to DNR and VCR in HL60/AR and H69/AR tumor cell lines. This effect of probenecid on MDR was associated with an increased accumulation of DNR and VCR and correction of the altered subcellular distribution of DNR.

Different samples of MIBG were assayed for possible contamination with benzyl guanidine (BG). Fast-atom-bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) analysis showed a prominent but variable m/z 150 signal, corresponding to a protonated BG. The MS/MS fragmentation pattern of these [M + H]+ ions was similar to that obtained from FAB-MS-generated, protonated BG, confirming the proposed molecule and associated structures. RP-HPLC analysis of both guanidines, however, excluded the possibility of contamination of MIBG with BG. It was therefore concluded that the BG signal was an artifact of the FAB-MS procedure. In addition, the importance of the meta-substituted iodine for the biological activity of MIBG was investigated. Three different biochemical and cell-biological properties of MIBG were compared with those of its precursor MIBA and BG. The assays used were: inhibition of the catecholamine ""Uptake I"" system in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and general cytotoxicity in L1210 leukemia cells. Of the drugs tested, MIBG was the most efficient in Uptake I inhibition and was more toxic in survival assays, but as compared with BG it was almost equipotent in inhibiting mitochondrial respiration. These findings contribute to a further elucidation of the mechanism by which MIBG exerts its various actions.","['Van den Berg, J D', 'Smets, L A', 'Rutgers, M', 'Grummels, A', 'Fokkens, R', 'Jonkergouw, P', 'van Rooij, H']","['Van den Berg JD', 'Smets LA', 'Rutgers M', 'Grummels A', 'Fokkens R', 'Jonkergouw P', 'van Rooij H']","['Department of Experimental Therapy, The Netherlands Cancer Institute/Antoni van Leeuwenhoekhuis, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Catecholamines)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodobenzenes)', '35MRW7B4AD (3-Iodobenzylguanidine)']",IM,"['3-Iodobenzylguanidine', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Catecholamines/metabolism', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Guanidines/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Iodobenzenes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1997;40(2):131-7. doi: 10.1007/s002800050637.,,,2,['10.1007/s002800050637 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether KSHV/HHV-8 is involved in the pathogenesis of mycosis fungoides (MF) and related disorders, we used a genomic PCR assay followed by confirmatory Southern blot analysis with a nested oligonucleotide probe to analyze cases for the presence of this virus. The specimens studied included fresh-frozen lesional tissues obtained from 16 patients with MF, seven with lymphomatoid papulosis, seven with primary cutaneous CD30+ large cell lymphoma of T-cell lineage, and five with Hodgkin's disease. Two T-cell tumor lines were also studied: MT4 (derived from a patient with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma) and Jurkat (derived from a patient with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia). All cases were uniformly negative for KSHV/HHV-8, whereas Kaposi's sarcoma-positive controls and human beta-globin DNA integrity controls were appropriately positive.

We compare the risk of noncutaneous cancer in our cohort with that expected based on general population incidence rates. The overall risk of noncutaneous cancer was nearly identical to that expected in general population. For three separate sites, we noted significant increases: thyroid cancer (RR = 3.57, 95% CI = 1.16-8.34), breast cancer (RR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.19-2.64), and central nervous system neoplasms (RR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.13-5.57). Since 1987, however, the risk of central nervous system neoplasms has not been elevated (RR = 0.00, 95% CI = 0.00-3.35) and the relative risk of breast cancer was lower than in the prior decade and not statistically significant. There was no association between higher levels of exposure to PUVA and the risk of any of these cancers. We did not detect any significant increase in the risk of lymphoma or leukemia.

The redundant action of these cytokines has been ascribed to the involvement of the common signal-transducing receptor subunit, gp130, in combination with cytokine-specific, ligand-binding subunits. To define the specificity of the signal transduction by the LIF/OSM receptor (a heterodimer of gp130 and LIF receptor (LIFR)) and the OSM-specific receptor (a heterodimer of gp130 and OSM receptor (OSMR)), we reconstituted the receptor function by transfection into receptor-negative Hep3B hepatoma cells. Both receptors activate DNA binding activity of STAT1, -3, and -5B and induce gene transcription through IL-6-responsive elements. The signaling-competent cytoplasmic domain regions of OSMR and LIFR were defined by the analysis of progressive carboxyl-terminal deletion constructs. The 36 residue carboxyl-terminal region containing the distal box 3 sequence motif of OSMR is required for signal transduction by the OSM-specific receptor. In contrast, signaling by LIFR did not display the same requirement for receptor domains and was not strictly dependent on the box 3 elements. The signaling by endogenous LIF and OSM receptors differed from that by IL-6R by the prominent activation of STAT5 as shown in the mouse hepatoma cell line, Hepa-1. The data suggest that the signaling specificity of the receptors for the three cytokines is determined by the composition of the cytoplasmic domains associated in the signal-competent receptor complex and that the signaling is not identical among these cytokine receptors.","['Kuropatwinski, K K', 'De Imus, C', 'Gearing, D', 'Baumann, H', 'Mosley, B']","['Kuropatwinski KK', 'De Imus C', 'Gearing D', 'Baumann H', 'Mosley B']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Receptors, Oncostatin M)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'COS Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Receptors, Oncostatin M', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",1997/06/13 00:00,1997/06/13 00:01,['1997/06/13 00:00'],"['1997/06/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/13 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jun 13;272(24):15135-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.24.15135.,,['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],24,"['10.1074/jbc.272.24.15135 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)39456-0 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic study was performed on bone marrow aspirate material. RESULTS: M1 and M2 FAB subtypes were the most frequent (61.6%). The patients' median age was 38 years. Cytogenetic analysis showed abnormal karyotype in 61.5% of the cases and 15.3% of whom had abnormalities considered as good prognosis [t(15;17) and t(8;21)]. At the evaluation day there were 3 patients alive, two in continuous complete remission and 1 in a second remission. The median total survival time was 7 months. Patients were divided into two groups: a ""good prognosis"" one, that joined 5 patients with normal karyotype and 2 with the translocations t(15;17) and t(8;21) and another, the ""bad prognosis"" one, with 8 patients with unfavorable chromosomal abnormalities. The good prognosis group had a median survival time of 9 months versus 6.2 months in the other, but this was not statistically significant (p = 0.18), probably owing to the small number of cases in the groups. But when one observes the cases separately see that patients with translocations (8;21) and (15;17), known as good prognosis, had longer survivals. CONCLUSION: The different survival time between the two groups showed the importance of cytogenetic study to distinguish the patient who will have favorable evolution.","['Chauffaille, M L', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Moncau, J E', 'Braga, G W', 'Souto, E X', 'Kerbauy, J']","['Chauffaille ML', 'Yamamoto M', 'Moncau JE', 'Braga GW', 'Souto EX', 'Kerbauy J']","['Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo.']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Brazil,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992),Revista da Associacao Medica Brasileira (1992),9308586,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1996/10/01 00:00,1996/10/01 00:01,['1996/10/01 00:00'],"['1996/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Assoc Med Bras (1992). 1996 Oct-Dec;42(4):200-4.,,,4,,,,Alteracoes citogeneticas como fatores prognosticos em leucemias mieloides agudas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level, this translocation results in the activation of the ABL oncogene of chromosome 9, which becomes contiguous with the 5' end of the BCR gene on chromosome 22. The breakpoint usually occurs between exons 2 and 3 (b2-a2 rearrangement), or 3 and 4 (b3-12 rearrangement) of the major breakpoint cluster region (M-BCR) of the BCR gene. The aim of the present study was to characterize the type of BCR-ABL transcript in 32 patients with CML using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and to determine if this type of rearrangement is related to the survival of the patients. Our results confirmed that RT-PCR is more sensitive than cytogenetic analysis for identifying the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome (96.9% vs 79.3%). The frequencies of b2-a2 and b3-a2 rearrangements were 28.1% and 65.7%, respectively. The survival of patients presenting the b2-a2 or the b3-a2 rearrangement was not significantly different (P = 0.27750).

This dysregulated expansion of cells is often accompanied by altered adherence to the bone marrow microenvironment and abnormalities in endogenous cytokine production by neoplastic cells. Proteoglycans (PGs) synthesized by neoplastic cells may interact with extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules and/or locally produced cytokines. It is believed that these events may be mediated by the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) moiety of PGs such as heparan or chondroitin sulfate, and depends on its charge. The strength of GAG-cytokine binding may be determined by the extent of sulfation of the GAG chains. The synthesis, metabolism and biological role of PGs in hematopoietic malignancies have not been clearly defined. In order to study how alterations of GAGs in leukemic cells may alter cellular behavior, we treated the murine myeloid leukemic cell line WeHi-3B with sodium chlorate. This drug reduces the sulfation of GAGs, since chlorate is a potent inhibitor of sulfate adenylyltransferase. The undersulfated GAGs produced by WeHi-3B cells were not efficient in controlling the mitotic rate of the cells, since a decrease in cell proliferation was observed in vitro. These data suggest that the complexes formed by GAGs with ECM components and/or cytokines may have an important role in the induction of leukemic cell proliferation. It is possible that the stimulatory activity elicited by this binding may be dependent upon the organization of these complexes.","['Alvarez-Silva, M', 'Trentin, A G']","['Alvarez-Silva M', 'Trentin AG']","['Departamento de Microbiologia e Parasitologia, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianopolis, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Sulfates)']",IM,"['Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/metabolism', 'Sulfates/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/09/01 00:00,1996/09/01 00:01,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 1996 Sep;29(9):1239-42.,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She exhibited abnormal eye movements, ataxia, lethargy, enuresis and amnesia. MR examination showed T2-weighted images with increased signal in the thalami (pulvinar) and periaqueducal region. The symptoms improved dramatically with thiamine therapy. Omission of the usual vitamin supplementation between the courses of chemotherapy was responsible for this encephalopathy.

Part II: Conventional EEG recordings in asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood ALL--an evaluation of the interferences between neurophysiology, neurology, psychology, and CNS morphology. German Late Effects Working Group.",121-31,"Monitoring of therapy-related late effects after acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) therapy in childhood has become an increasingly important area in posttherapeutic patient surveillance. The usefulness of conventional electro-encephalographic (EEG) investigations as part of these attempts is controversially discussed. However, EEG recordings have become a popular approach for judgement on the functional integrity of the central nervous system in this subject group. The present report focuses on this problem and discusses the question whether and to what extent conventional EEG recordings were correlated with further measures of central nervous system (CNS) integrity and therapeutic differences. EEGs were recorded in 110 subjects, asymptomatic long-term survivors of ALL in childhood, during a large retrospective multicenter study evaluating CNS late sequelae following antileukemic therapy in Germany and Austria. EEG findings were correlated with demographic data, illness- and treatment-related parameters, as well as with data on the morphological, neurological and psychological status of the participating subjects. At the time of follow-up the EEG was abnormal in 47 cases (42.7%). The most frequent EEG abnormalities observed were disturbances of the background activity (n = 45, 95.8%), followed by hypersynchrone activities (n = 1.0, 21.3%) and interhemispheric differences/focal slowing (n = 6, 12.8%). With exception of age at diagnosis, none of the observed EEG abnormalities showed a correlation with any of the aforementioned illness- or treatment-related parameters. Eighty percent of the observed EEG abnormalities were found in children younger than 5 years at diagnosis. Children less than 2 years of age as well as those above 5 years at onset of disease showed a significantly reduced prevalence of EEG disturbances compared to subjects between 2 and 5 years at diagnosis. Neither the degree of illness nor therapy-specific differences showed any relationship to EEG outcome. There was no specific EEG finding for a specific morphological substrate, neurological or psychological deficiency and vice versa.

Separations were performed with a continuous flow blood separator (Fen-wall CS 3000 plus), running a specially adopted separation-program. In 7 children (5 with neuroblastoma IV, 1 with multifocal Ewing's sarcoma, and 1 with rhabdomyosarcoma IV), stem cells were mobilized by application of G-CSF at a dosage of 15-27.7 micrograms/kg body weight (median 16.25) subcutaneously following high-dose chemotherapy, according to the disease-related protocols, whereas 2 children had PBMNCS to induce graft vs. leukemia (GvL)-reaction in the HLA-identical sibling suffering from relapsed chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML: n = 1), or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML: n = 1) after allogeneic BMT. In all cases, the collecting procedure was performed after filling the cell separator with priming solution consisting of 2 U of irradiated and washed packed red cells, 250 ml human albumin, and 0.9% NaCl. In the 7 patients with solid tumors between 0.45 and 62.7 x 10(6) CD-34 positive cells/kg body weight were separated; the patient who had the lowest yield was separated twice after another mobilizing course. Three patients (2 with neuroblastoma IV and 1 with multifocal Ewing's-sarcoma) underwent a double transplantation with 1-3 portions of the collected stem cells within a 5- to 6-week interval. Two children had a rapid engraftment on both peripheral blood stem cell transplantations (PBSCTs). The third child, who had the lowest yield and was separated twice had prompt engraftment at the first PBSCT but delayed and incomplete engraftment at the second PBSCT. One patient after adoptive immunotransfer with PBMNCs for relapsed CML is now 40 months in complete cytogenetic and molecular biological remission, whereas the other patient treated for relapsed CMML did not respond to the PBMNC-transfusion.

A dilemma arises when confronted with a patient with a low CSF white blood cell (WBC) chamber count and lymphoblasts. We utilized a scoring system to review lymphoblast morphology in 12 such patients. A cell was defined as a lymphoblast if it could not be easily categorized as a lymphocyte, monocyte. histiocyte, or granulocyte. Each lymphoblast was scored on four parameters: presence of nucleoli, homogeneous distribution of chromatin, nucleocytoplasmic ratio greater than 75%, and nuclear irregularity. Cells were scored without knowledge of the patients' out come. Seven patients eventually developed MR by current criteria and five patients never relapsed. The mean lymphoblast scores for patients that did and did not relapse were 2.35 and 1.53, respectively (P < .001). The percent of cells scored as lymphoblasts was also significantly higher in patients that relapsed, 36.9% vs. 19.4% (P = .01). Our study shows that careful cytomorphologic analysis can predict which patients with low chamber counts and ""blasts"" on cytocentrifuge examination will progress to meningeal relapse.

The incorporation of 5-AZA-CdR into DNA blocks DNA methylation and can result in the activation of specific genes, such as tumor suppressor genes. This novel mechanism of action of 5-AZA-CdR stimulated our interest in its potential for cancer therapy in patients with lung cancer. Using a colony assay we observed that 5-AZA-CdR showed a potent antineoplastic effect against two human lung carcinoma cell lines. The objective of this preliminary phase I-II study was to evaluate the toxicity and clinical efficacy of 5-AZA-CdR in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung carcinoma. There were 15 patients that entered the clinical study. For nine assessable patients that received 5-AZA-CdR by a single 8 h i.v. infusion of 200-660 mg/m2 for one or more cycles, the median survival duration was 6.7 months, with three patients surviving more than 15 months. The steady-state plasma concentration of 5-AZA-CdR during the infusion was estimated in some patients and was in the same range that produced activation of a tumor suppressor gene in human lung tumor cell lines as reported by other investigators. The major side effect of 5-AZA-CdR was hematopoietic toxicity which required a 5-6 week recovery period before the next cycle of therapy. This study suggests that 5-AZA-CdR may have some clinical activity against metastatic lung carcinoma using this type of dose schedule.","['Momparler, R L', 'Bouffard, D Y', 'Momparler, L F', 'Dionne, J', 'Belanger, K', 'Ayoub, J']","['Momparler RL', 'Bouffard DY', 'Momparler LF', 'Dionne J', 'Belanger K', 'Ayoub J']","['Centre de recherche pediatrique, Hopital Ste-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/blood/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1997 Apr;8(4):358-68. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199704000-00008.,,,4,['10.1097/00001813-199704000-00008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because cellular glutathione (GSH) and glutathione S-transferases (GST) are reported to interfere with the antitumor activity of cisplatin, we analyzed the effect of EdSm and cisplatin on GSH and GST activity in selected tumor cells. For this purpose we used three murine leukemia tumors with different sensitivities towards EdSm and cisplatin: L1210-WT, sensitive to both drugs, L1210-Sm, resistant to EdSm, and L1210-CDDP, resistant to cisplatin. No significant differences were detectable between these three cell lines regarding the population doubling time, the cell size, and the cellular level of protein and glutathione. Neither of the resistant L1210 subclones showed P-glycoprotein expression. Drug exposure, however, changed the intracellular dynamics. Exposure to EdSm strongly decreased the amount of cellular protein, decreased the overall GST activity and led to GSH depletion, whereas exposure to cisplatin induced a rise in the amount of protein, in GSH, and in the total GST activity. These effects are dose-dependent and correlate well with the sensitivity of the tumor cells for EdSm or cisplatin. In addition, exposure to EdSm lowered the V(max) of GST in L1210-WT and L1210-Sm; however, in L1210-CDDP both the V(max) and the K(m) were increased. That this was not a direct effect of EdSm on GST was shown in a cell-free system, where EdSm did not influence the GST activity nor could it act as a substrate for GST. Our results suggest that the synergistic combination of EdSm and cisplatin might be explained by EdSm switching off the cellular detoxification mechanism for cisplatin, i.e. by inhibition of de novo synthesis and subsequent depletion of GSH and GST.","['Hofs, H P', 'Wagener, T D', 'de Valk-Bakker, V', 'van Rennes, H', 'Doesburg, W H', 'Ottenheijm, H C', 'de Grip, W J']","['Hofs HP', 'Wagener TD', 'de Valk-Bakker V', 'van Rennes H', 'Doesburg WH', 'Ottenheijm HC', 'de Grip WJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Nijmegen University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '119410-38-7 (ethyldeshydroxysparsomycin)', '6C940P63E7 (Sparsomycin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'ULW86O013H (Glutathione Disulfide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Glutathione Transferase/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Sparsomycin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 1997 Apr;8(4):349-57. doi: 10.1097/00001813-199704000-00007.,,,4,['10.1097/00001813-199704000-00007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were exposed to 450 kHz ultrasound at an intensity of 500 mW/cm2. The survival rate of MT-2 cells exposed to ultrasound alone for 80 s was 20.1 +/- 4.8%, whereas survival rates exposed to ultrasound in combination with 25, 50 and 100 microg/ml of Pf resulted in 11.5 +/- 2.9, 3.2 +/- 1.6 and 1.6 +/- 1.4%, respectively. There was a significant difference of cell survival between the group exposed to ultrasound alone and the Pf-combined groups (n = 6, p < 0.05). On the other hand, in the normal human PMNCs, no significant differences of cell survival rates were found between ultrasound-treated groups with and without Pf. We similarly examined the survival rate of PMNCs in the peripheral blood of five acute-type ATL patients (n = 5) after ultrasound (60 s, 300 mW/cm2) exposure with or without 100 microg/ml of Pf. Comparison of cell survival rate between ultrasound alone and ultrasound plus Pf showed significant differences (69.4 +/- 22.5 and 30.0 +/- 23.0%, respectively). There were no significant cytotoxicities in all Pf alone treated groups of the MT-2 cells, the normal PMNCs and the ATL patients' PMNCs (p < 0.05). It was suggested from this study that there was a specific selectivity of sonodynamic effects to MT-2 cell lines and ATL patients' PMNCs.

We investigated 25 cases (18 at primary diagnosis and seven during the course of disease) of MZBCL by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and compared these results with cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and Southern blot data. Twenty of the 25 cases (80%) showed gains (total 49) or losses (total 15) of genetic material. In extranodal, nodal, and splenic MZBCL, material of chromosomes 3 (52% of cases), 18 (32%), X (24%), and 1q (16%) was most frequently gained, whereas losses predominantly involved chromosomes 17 (16%) and 9 (12%). High-level amplifications involving the regions 18q21-23 and 18q21-22, respectively, were detected in two cases. Gains of chromosomes 1q and 8q and losses of chromosome 17 or 17p occurred more frequently in relapsed or progressive lymphomas. For all of the frequently affected chromosomes, CGH allowed narrowing of the relevant subregions including 3q21-23, 3q25-29 and 18q21-23. By Southern blot analysis, the BCL2, BCL6, and CMYC proto-oncogenes were found to be a part of the over-represented regions in two cases, one case, and two cases, respectively, with gains involving 18q, 3q or 8q. In 13 cases, CGH revealed chromosomal imbalances which were not detected by cytogenetic analysis but could be confirmed by FISH or Southern blot analysis in all cases investigated. On the other hand, CGH failed to detect trisomy 3, trisomy 18, and deletion 7q in three cases with a low proportion of tumor cells bearing these abnormalities, as shown by interphase FISH.

We reviewed medical records and histopathologic studies of 98 children treated for NHL from 1980 to 1987 at a major pediatric cancer center in Recife, Brazil. Treatment outcome was evaluated in relation to tumor burden (stage and serum LDH) and type of therapy (LSA2L2 vs other multiagent chemotherapy). There was a striking predominance of the small noncleaved cell (Burkitt) subtype, which occurred in 92 of the 98 children and adolescents diagnosed with NHL. Subsequent analyses focused on these patients. The majority (n = 84) had advanced (stage III/IV) disease at diagnosis. The abdomen was the most common site of disease (84 cases); jaw involvement was rare (three cases). Five-year event-free survival (excluding treatment refusals) was significantly better for patients with limited vs advanced stage disease (75 +/- 14% vs 42 +/- 6%; P < 0.04). Elevated serum LDH (>500 U/l) was associated with a poorer outcome (P = 0.008). The type of chemotherapy did not affect EFS (P = 0.95). Only 39% of patients are long-term survivors, reflecting the high rate of septic deaths (25% of patients) and parental refusal/abandonment of therapy (10%). Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was detected in tumor cells from eight of the 11 cases studied. In clinical presentation, these cases resemble sporadic Burkitt lymphoma, yet in their apparent responsiveness to LSA2L2 therapy and association with EBV, they do not. Childhood NHL in northeastern Brazil is predominantly of the Burkitt subtype, and is associated with clinical features that appear to distinguish it from the endemic and sporadic forms of this tumor. These cases may represent a third or intermediate subtype of Burkitt lymphoma.","['Sandlund, J T', 'Fonseca, T', 'Leimig, T', 'Verissimo, L', 'Ribeiro, R', 'Lira, V', 'Berard, C W', 'Sixbey, J', 'Crist, W M', 'Mao, L', 'Chen, G', 'Pui, C H', 'Heim, M', 'Pedrosa, F']","['Sandlund JT', 'Fonseca T', 'Leimig T', 'Verissimo L', 'Ribeiro R', 'Lira V', 'Berard CW', 'Sixbey J', 'Crist WM', 'Mao L', 'Chen G', 'Pui CH', 'Heim M', 'Pedrosa F']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, the University of Tennessee, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/*epidemiology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):743-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400609.,,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400609 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A primitive myeloid leukemia was induced in 21% of GMT mice, but none of the littermates. To characterize further the nature of the leukemic cells, a factor-dependent cell line (DGM36) was derived. DGM36 cells were tumorigenic, capable of differentiation to neutrophils, macrophages and eosinophils, and contained a partial deletion of chromosome 2. A subline arose spontaneously that was factor-independent and produced GM-CSF in an autocrine manner (IGM36 cells). Stimulation of the IGM36 cells with TNF alpha and IFNgamma resulted in increased expression of B7-1, class I MHC and class II MHC and consequent presentation of antigen in allogeneic MLRs. IGM36 cells thereby satisfy many of the criteria of dendritic cells and consequently may be used to examine antigen presentation by leukemic cells.

In the present study, we tested the optimal conditions for activation by interleukin-2 (IL-2) of endogenous bone marrow effector cells to develop cytotoxicity against solid tumor and leukemia cells and the effects of IL-2 treatment on eradication of malignant cells from the marrow product while preserving hematopoiesis. Normal donor bone marrow was contaminated with 10% A549 lung cancer cells, MCF-7 breast cancer, or EM2 leukemia cells, and then combined with peripheral blood-derived lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells which had been incubated in the presence of IL-2, 6000 IU/ml, for 5 days. Eradication (A549 and MCF-7) or >90% reduction in tumor cell number (EM2) was achieved upon exposure of the marrow to LAK cells but not to control, non-IL-2-exposed PBMC. The non-cross-resistance of chemotherapy and cell-mediated cytotoxicity were tested by using chemoresistant target cells for LAK cytotoxicity assays. Ara-C-resistant K562 cells were sensitive to LAK cytotoxicity, similar to sensitive controls. Similar effects were seen in daunomycin-resistant HL60 leukemia cells and VP-16-resistant K562 cells. The daunomycin-resistant K562 cells were also sensitive to LAK cell killing similar to sensitive controls. Activation of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) with IL-2, 6000 IU/ml for 24 h, significantly enhanced cytotoxicity against the NK-resistant, LAK-sensitive Daudi cell line. This procedure did not result in significant loss of total BMMC or hematopoietic colony-forming units. We then studied the possibility that the effector cell activity of the IL-2-activated BMMC which is diminished after removal of the IL-2 at 24 h could be recovered upon re-exposure of the marrow to IL-2. We found that the optimum conditions for preserving cytotoxicity were prolonged continuous exposures to IL-2 but that re-exposure of the 24-h IL-2-activated BMMC to IL-2 after a 1- or 2-week IL-2 withdrawal was associated with full recovery of cytotoxicity. These experiments also demonstrated that the overall recovery of viable cells from the BMMC was over 100%, possibly due to a proliferative effect of the IL-2 exposure on BMMC. These results demonstrate that the use of IL-2-activated marrow in patients with acute leukemia in remission undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (aBMT) may overcome the obstacles of clonogenic, drug-resistant minimal residual disease. The effector cell activity and hematopoietic capacity of the activated bone marrow product can also be maintained even if optimal clinical care requires an interruption in the in vivo exposure to IL-2. This therapeutic approach is currently being tested in acute leukemia patients undergoing IL-2-activated aBMT followed by prolonged IL-2 treatment before and after hematologic reconstitution.","['Margolin, K A', 'Wright, C', 'Forman, S J']","['Margolin KA', 'Wright C', 'Forman SJ']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010-3000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/toxicity', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/toxicity', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):723-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400646.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400646 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study suggesting direct elimination of immature T cells by contact with some HIV-1-infected T cells, may provide a novel insight into the mechanism responsible for the mature CD4+ T cell depletion in HIV-1 infection.","['Minowada, J', 'Nishizaki, C', 'Toki, M', 'Kinzl, P', 'Otani, T', 'Matsuo, Y']","['Minowada J', 'Nishizaki C', 'Toki M', 'Kinzl P', 'Otani T', 'Matsuo Y']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc, Okayama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/physiology', '*Apoptosis', 'CD4 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/*physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology/*virology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):714-22. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400615.,,['CA 14413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400615 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The line has been growing in RPMI 1640 media for 18 months and can be maintained without addition of growth factors. Ei501 is positive for myeloperoxidase and negative for esterase and PAS. Cytogenetic analysis revealed the FAB M3 associated t(15;17) translocation and a translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 8: 46 XX, -7, +t(7;8)(q32;q13), t(15;17)(q22;q12). This karyotype was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Ei501 cells express AML-associated surface markers such as CD13, CD33 and CD38. Although 42% of the patient's blast cells were CD34-positive, the line lacks surface expression of CD34. Furthermore the line has a number of characteristics which are detectable in blasts from AML patients, such as surface adhesion molecules, cytokines such as TGF-beta, cytokine receptors such as the IL-2 receptor beta and gamma chains or the IL-4 receptor and the genes for the transcription factor wt-1 (Wilms' tumor gene) and for the proto-oncogene bcl-2, both shown to be present in the majority of patients with AML. Additionally the line can be used as target in cytotoxicity assays using IL-2 activated cytotoxic lymphocytes as effector cells. In conclusion, besides a rare karyotype the Ei501 cell line has several features common in AML, and may therefore be used as a model to study pathogenetic mechanisms in acute myeloid leukemia.","['Weidmann, E', 'Brieger, J', 'Karakas, T', 'Maurer, U', 'Pascheberg, U', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Bergmann, L']","['Weidmann E', 'Brieger J', 'Karakas T', 'Maurer U', 'Pascheberg U', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Bergmann L']","['Medical Clinic III, Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Johann-Wolfgang Goethe University, Frankfurt/M, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):709-13. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400630.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400630 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Continuous human leukemia cell lines represent powerful tools to investigate these mechanisms. Most cell lines grow autonomously in standard culture media (containing fetal bovine serum) independent of externally added growth stimuli. Over the last 5-10 years a battery of myeloid leukemia-derived cell lines has been established that is constitutively dependent on the addition of cytokines to the culture. Such factor-dependent cell lines die rapidly by apoptosis when deprived of the appropriate growth factor. We determined the cytokine response profiles of 19 absolutely growth factor-dependent leukemia cell lines with myelomonocytic, erythroid or megakaryocytic phenotypes with regard to enhanced or suppressed cellular proliferation. Cells were incubated in liquid culture with optimal concentrations of various recombinant human cytokines known to have effects on the growth of hematopoietic cells. A proliferative or anti-proliferative response to these 41 cytokines was assessed by the short-term 3H-thymidine uptake assay. A proliferative response was considered as positive when the stimulation index (SI) was >2; inhibition was regarded as significant with an SI <0.5. The response profile of each cell line to these 41 cytokines was different and individual. None of the cell lines responded to one or two factors only (minimum to at least five cytokines). Proliferation of most (n = 13-17), but not of all cell lines was significantly enhanced by GM-CSF, IL-3, PIXY-321, SCF and IFN-gamma. TGF-beta1 consistently inhibited proliferation (in 11/19 cell lines). IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, TNF-alpha and TNF-beta had either stimulatory or inhibitory effects. The cell lines responding most often proliferatively (to 15-19 different cytokines) were UCSD/AML1, HU-3, TF-1 and M-07e. In summary, these factor-responsive human leukemia cell lines represent extremely useful model systems for the analysis of cytokine effects on hematopoietic cells. The cytokine response profiles of the individual cell lines provide guidelines for the selection of the appropriate cell culture for such experiments.","['Drexler, H G', 'Zaborski, M', 'Quentmeier, H']","['Drexler HG', 'Zaborski M', 'Quentmeier H']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood', 'Cattle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):701-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400633.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400633 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then, with an assumption that the BCL-6 gene expression may be related to the differentiation of myeloid cells, we analyzed the inducibility of BCL-6 gene expression along monocytic lineage differentiation in HL-60 and U-937 cells by treating them with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Although the expression of BCL-6 transcripts was very low or undetectable in untreated HL-60 or U-937 cells, treatment of these cells with TPA to induce monocytic differentiation resulted in an apparent increase of BCL-6 mRNA, suggesting that BCL-6 gene expression is not limited to B cells and it is closely associated with monocytic lineage differentiation. The BCL-6 transcripts in TPA-treated U-937 cells were superinduced by the treatment with cycloheximide (CHX) and the half-life of the BCL-6 mRNA was apparently prolonged when TPA-treated U-937 cells were exposed to CHX in the presence of actinomycin D (ACD). Furthermore, the nuclear run-on assay revealed that the BCL-6 transcription signals were enhanced by TPA treatment. These results suggest that the increase of BCL-6 mRNA in U-937 cells stimulated with TPA to induce monocytic lineage differentiation is mediated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.","['Yamochi, T', 'Kitabayashi, A', 'Hirokawa, M', 'Miura, A B', 'Onizuka, T', 'Mori, S', 'Moriyama, M']","['Yamochi T', 'Kitabayashi A', 'Hirokawa M', 'Miura AB', 'Onizuka T', 'Mori S', 'Moriyama M']","['Department of Pathology, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Minato-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):694-700. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400631.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400631 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to confirm this hypothesis, we attempted to transfer human B-CLL with AIHA to immunodeficient mice. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 11 B-CLL patients suffering from AIHA were transplanted into the peritoneal cavity of lethally irradiated Balb/c mice reconstituted with SCID bone marrow. Chimeric mice generated from PBMC of these patients (in stage III-IV of the disease) exhibited an engraftment profile with dominance of tumor cells and minuscule levels of T cells. Eighty-five percent of the chimeric mice generated from 10 out of the 11 B-CLL patients with Coombs'-positive AIHA, produced human Ig with anti-human red cell specificity as detected by indirect anti-globulin test. In addition, anti-red cell auto-antibodies were produced in 36% of chimeric mice generated from PBMC of Coombs'-negative B-CLL. In contrast, control experiments in which splenic cells from idiopathic AIHA or PBMC from normal donors were transplanted, failed to produce anti-RBC.

Cytotoxicity was determined in MTT assay. Increased cytotoxicity occurred in Mo-7 cells preincubated with 24h IL-3 followed by 1 h MX (cell survival: 85% +/- 6 vs 68% +/- 2, at 0.05 microM MX, P < 0.005) or DAU (79% +/- 8 vs 62% +/- 9 at 0.8 microg/ml DAU, P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for the GF-D8 cell line. In this cell line, at 0.5 microM MX the cell survival decreased from 84% +/- 13 to 61% +/- 19 (P < 0.05) and at 5.0 microg/ml DAU from 102% +/- 8 to 69% +/- 5, (P < 0.002). The IL-3 administration did not affect the P-gp and bcl-2 protein expression, cellular MX concentration or MX efflux but coincided with an increased percentage of cells in S-phase and topoisomerase II (topo II)-alpha mRNA and topo II activity especially in the Mo-7 cell line. PSC 833 enhanced DAU cytotoxicity in both cell lines. The administration of IL-3 plus PSC 833 in the Mo-7 cell line resulted in an additive effect on DAU cytotoxicity. At 0.8 microg/ml DAU and 2 microg/ml PSC 833, the percentage surviving cells decreased from 62% +/- 9 in the absence of IL-3 to 37% +/- 3 in the presence of IL-3 (P < 0.01). The additive effect of combined treatment was most pronounced in GF-D8 cells which also had the highest P-gp expression. In contrast, PSC 833 did not modulate the MX effects, irrespective of the presence of IL-3. In summary, the results demonstrate that the combined administration of IL-3 and PSC 833 can enhance the cytotoxic effects of DAU but not MX in these P-gp positive cell lines whereas the effects of MX could be modulated by factors which influence topo II activity.","['Asschert, J', 'de Vries, E', 'van der Kolk, D', 'Muller, M', 'Vellenga, E']","['Asschert J', 'de Vries E', 'van der Kolk D', 'Muller M', 'Vellenga E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*toxicity', 'Daunorubicin/*toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*toxicity', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Mitoxantrone/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):680-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400639.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400639 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data of our group and others provide evidence that in AML malignant transformation may regularly occur at the level of stem cells. These cells can be discriminated by function and specific surface molecules. CD34, a glycophosphoprotein, is a cellular surface antigen characteristically expressed by stem cells. CD34+ stem cells can be further subdivided by the expression of additional surface molecules like CD38 and CD117. In this article we present results from cytogenetic examinations of FACS-isolated stem cell subpopulations in eight patients (four AML and four MDS). Six of them displayed clonal karyotype abnormalities at the time of first diagnoses in the native bone marrow (5q-; 5q- and complex abnormalities; +8; inv(16) and +8; i(17q) and -21; i(21q)). We used CD117, the receptor for the stem cell factor (also KIT oncogene) as a new cellular surface marker. CD34+/CD117+/- stem cell subpopulations were examined in two patients with AML and three patients with MDS. We found leukemic stem cells in every type of stem cell subpopulation examined (CD34+/CD38-, CD34+/CD38+, CD34+/CD117-, CD34+/CD117+). Secondary, progression-associated chromosome abnormalities likewise were demonstrable in CD34+ cells. In three patients a mosaic of normal and abnormal metaphases was found in the highly purified stem cell subpopulations. We conclude that in AML and MDS stem cells are the target of leukemogenic genetic defects. CD117 as a new marker to isolate different CD34+ subpopulations was not sufficient to discriminate between normal and leukemic stem cells. Our findings have implications for autologous stem cell transplantation, high-dose chemotherapy and the pathogenetic concept of leukemogenesis.","['Haase, D', 'Feuring-Buske, M', 'Schafer, C', 'Schoch, C', 'Troff, C', 'Gahn, B', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Wormann, B']","['Haase D', 'Feuring-Buske M', 'Schafer C', 'Schoch C', 'Troff C', 'Gahn B', 'Hiddemann W', 'Wormann B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Georg-August-University, Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis/biosynthesis', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Centromere', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*biosynthesis']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):674-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400638.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400638 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether ATRA could potentiate the inhibitory effects of IFN alpha on the proliferation of leukemic progenitors in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). CD34+ cells from chronic phase, newly diagnosed patients, were incubated in short-term liquid culture with ATRA, IFN alpha or a combination of both molecules and then plated on semi-solid cultures for colony-forming cell assay. IFN alpha was found to inhibit preferentially the generation of late progenitors. ATRA at a concentration of 10(-8) M was found strongly to inhibit CFU-M colonies. Addition of ATRA to IFN alpha dramatically potentiated the inhibitory effects of INF alpha on CFU-GM growth. In the presence of both molecules the inhibition of day 14 CFU-GM from CD34+ cells was lowered to 27 +/- 4% of control. CFU-M colonies were completely inhibited. RT-PCR analysis of the colonies resulting from the action of the combination IFN alpha plus ATRA showed the presence of an increased number of BCR-ABL-negative colonies relatively to what was observed with IFN alpha alone.

All patients were enrolled in an EORTC study and received low-dose Ara-C with or without growth factors according to the study protocol. Thirty patients (67%) were characterized by different clonal markers, such as various gene rearrangements (eg Ig-JH, tcR-beta, bcr, GM-CSF, G-CSF or IL-3) and/or chromosomal markers at the time of diagnosis or early in the course of the disease. In 23 of 30 cases that could be studied in the course of the disease, a statement about the clonal situation was possible: in three cases (8%) the clonal situation did not change, in nine cases (39%) at least a transient reduction of clonal cells could be demonstrated, suggesting partial or complete response to therapy. In eight cases (35%) a change for the worse could be seen. In four cases (17%) involvement of multiple clones could be demonstrated with the clones exhibiting different susceptibilities to treatment. Clinical evaluation showed that patients without clonal markers at diagnosis had a better prognosis as compared to patients who presented with clonal markers.

Three patients (10%) had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Cells in apoptosis were examined on semithin slides and expressed as the apoptotic index (AI) (percent counted on at least 1000 cells). An overall increase in apoptosis in patients with MDS was found (median AI in patients vs controls, 3.13% vs 1.05%, P < 0.01 by Mann-Whitney U test). Also, negative correlation between AI and white blood cell count was found (linear r= -0.53, or Spearman rank R= -0.52, both P < 0.01). In patients with evident karyotype changes AI was not higher than in patients with normal karyotype. This suggests that discrete alterations in apoptosis are present even in karyotypically 'normal' clones.

The percentages of patients showing these features were significantly (P < 0.01) lower in the t(8;21)- group. Among these morphological features, homogeneous pink-colored cytoplasm of mature neutrophils is most characteristic of t(8;21)+ AML-M2, because it was seen in 90% of the t(8;21)+ patients but in only 2% of the t(8;21)- patients.

No correlation was found between WT1 gene expression and age, FAB type, LDH and karyotype at diagnosis. All patients were treated with standard induction chemotherapy.

Using Kaplan and Meier plot analysis we found no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients displaying the WT1 transcript and WT1-negative patients. Furthermore, no significant interactions between WT1 PCR results and age, FAB type, LDH and karyotype on DFS and OS were demonstrable using Cox regression analysis. Eight patients who were WT1 PCR positive at diagnosis and achieved complete hematological remission following chemotherapy were monitored during the course of the disease. Based on our limited data demonstrating a heterogeneity of WT1 PCR results in CR we cannot draw any conclusions regarding the usefulness of WT1 PCR analysis for the early detection of relapse.

In this study, a total of 82 bone marrow samples were analyzed. Metaphase-FISH identified chromosome morphology, even banding, in cells from which FISH signals were studied. Thus, it is as reliable as standard karyotype analysis and does not cause false positive results. Furthermore, more than 1000 cells can be analyzed in 3-6 h which equals the time it takes to analyze 20 metaphases by standard karyotype. The time span before the first positive sample seems to be insignificant with regard to the outcome of relapse. All six patients, who had more than 1% of abnormal cells detected at any sampling or whose consecutive follow-up samples showed an increasing frequency (up to 1%) of abnormal cells, relapsed.

Thirteen patients were untreated and 27 had previously received alpha-interferon. Thirty out of 40 patients (75%) achieved complete remission (CR) and 10 (25%) partial remission (PR). The median follow-up duration for patients in CR has been 48 months (range 30-66). Five of the complete responders (17%) relapsed at 12, 24, 26, 30 and 36 months after treatment as documented by the increase of hairy cells (Hc) in the bone marrow and two of them, who were retreated with 2-CdA after showing an initial impairment of peripheral blood values, obtained a second CR. The remaining three relapsed patients were never retreated and still show normal peripheral counts after 30, 38 and 40 months. Twelve of the continuous complete responder patients are still in CR after more than 5 years. In contrast, 8 out of 10 partial responders progressed after 8-36 months and all of them were retreated with 2-CdA at a dose of 0.15 mg/kg/day for 5 days i.v. Four of them (50%) achieved a CR, three a better PR and one patient died 6 months after the second 2-CdA course because of infectious complications. Two additional patients, both in CR, died after 28 and 37 months because of a second neoplasm. Toxic side-effects consisted of febrile episodes recorded in 16 patients: in seven of them, fever lasted only 24-48 h after the end of treatment and was apparently not infection-related. In the remaining nine patients, showing in addition severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 1.0 x 10(9)/l), fever was related to bacterial infection requiring systemic antibiotics in all of them and G-CSF in three cases. In conclusion, 2-CdA induces a very high proportion of complete and long-lasting remissions in patients with HCL. In a number of cases relapse at bone marrow level may not affect peripheral blood values for prolonged time. However, in those patients with initial pancytopenia a retreatment with 2-CdA is still effective in inducing a durable second CR.","['Lauria, F', 'Rondelli, D', 'Zinzani, P L', 'Bocchia, M', 'Marotta, G', 'Salvucci, M', 'Raspadori, D', 'Ventura, M A', 'Birtolo, S', 'Forconi, F', 'Tura, S']","['Lauria F', 'Rondelli D', 'Zinzani PL', 'Bocchia M', 'Marotta G', 'Salvucci M', 'Raspadori D', 'Ventura MA', 'Birtolo S', 'Forconi F', 'Tura S']","['Department of Hematology, University of Siena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', ""JYW18Y92UP (2-chloro-3'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Deoxyadenosines/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/mortality', 'Splenomegaly', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):629-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400619.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400619 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a single agent, it resulted in effectively controlling leukocytosis and in producing sporadic karyotypic conversions; its clinical use in combination with interferon (IFN-alpha) for the treatment of CML could thus be considered. In this study we evaluated the growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis determined by HHT alone and in combination with IFN-alpha and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) on normal and CML (both in chronic, CML-CP and in blastic phase; CML-BP) hematopoietic progenitors. HHT is able to determine a dose-dependent cell growth inhibition; evaluation of cytotoxic activity on semisolid cultures showed an activity significantly higher on CML-CP than on normal cells (P = 0.02 for HHT 50 ng/ml and P = 0.01 for HHT 200 ng/ml). HHT exerted a synergistic effect with IFN-alpha, Ara-C and IFN-alpha + Ara-C in inhibiting CML-CP colony growth; the same activity was demonstrated by the combination of HHT with Ara-C and by the triple combination, but not by HHT + IFN-alpha, on normal myeloid progenitors. The triple combination only was able to exert a synergistic effect in CML-BP. The induction of apoptosis resulted HHT dose-dependent in CML-CP and normals; at higher drug concentrations (100-200-1000 ng/ml), HHT induced a significant increase of apoptotic cells (for normals: P = 0.04, P = 0.02 and P = 0.04; for CML-CP: P = 0.01, P = 0.01 and P = 0.04, respectively); no significant changes were observed in CML-BP. In conclusion, the differences in cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induction observed, depending on the various phases of CML, add experimental evidence to the different clinical results between the chronic phase, where the clone is responsive to HHT, and the acute phase, where the drug is ineffective. The in vitro synergism of HHT with Ara-C and IFN-alpha in CML-CP suggests further evaluation in the clinical setting.","['Visani, G', 'Russo, D', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Tosi, P', 'Damiani, D', 'Michelutti, A', 'Manfroi, S', 'Baccarani, M', 'Tura, S']","['Visani G', 'Russo D', 'Ottaviani E', 'Tosi P', 'Damiani D', 'Michelutti A', 'Manfroi S', 'Baccarani M', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11(5):624-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400608.,,,5,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400608 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) encodes neurofibromin, a protein that negatively regulates signals transduced by Ras proteins. Genetic and biochemical data support the hypothesis that NF1 functions as a tumor-suppressor gene in immature myeloid cells, but inactivation of both NF1 alleles has not been demonstrated in leukemic cells from patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. METHODS: Using an in vitro transcription and translation system, we screened bone marrow samples from 18 children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and myeloid disorders for NF1 mutations that cause a truncated protein. Mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing of genomic DNA from the patients, and from their affected parents, in cases of familial neurofibromatosis type 1. RESULTS: Specimens from 9 of the 18 children contained abnormal peptide fragments, and truncating mutations of the NF1 gene were found in specimens from 8 of these children. The normal NF1 allele was absent in bone marrow samples from five of the eight children. We detected the same mutation in DNA from the affected parent of each child with familial neurofibromatosis type 1. CONCLUSIONS: Both alleles of the NF1 gene are inactivated in leukemic cells in some patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. NF1 appears to function as a tumor-suppressor gene in immature myeloid cells.","['Side, L', 'Taylor, B', 'Cayouette, M', 'Conner, E', 'Thompson, P', 'Luce, M', 'Shannon, K']","['Side L', 'Taylor B', 'Cayouette M', 'Conner E', 'Thompson P', 'Luce M', 'Shannon K']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0519, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Neurofibromin 1)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology/*genetics', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/complications/*genetics', 'Neurofibromin 1', 'Proteins/*genetics']",1997/06/12 00:00,1997/06/12 00:01,['1997/06/12 00:00'],"['1997/06/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/12 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1997 Jun 12;336(24):1713-20. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199706123362404.,,"['CA72614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01271-13S1/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",24,['10.1056/NEJM199706123362404 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The physiological role of AAG is unknown, however, the time course of AAG production in the acute phase response together with its strong affinity for basic compounds suggests that AAG may function as an immune modulator to bind both exogenous and endogenous inflammatory mediators. Using E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an initiator of the acute inflammatory response associated with septic shock, we demonstrate that AAG-LPS complexes can activate mouse macrophages in vitro. In a mouse animal model of sepsis, AAG was shown to protect against meningococcal endotoxin. To pursue the mechanism of AAG action we demonstrated that AAG interacts directly with LPS using dynamic light scattering particle sizing and particle mobility. We also determined the enthalpy of interaction of AAG and LPS and showed that AAG leads to agglutination of LPS impregnated rabbit red blood cells. These studies suggest that AAG may function as an immune-modulator in the acute phase response, possibly by counter-regulating the activity of macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokines.","['Moore, D F', 'Rosenfeld, M R', 'Gribbon, P M', 'Winlove, C P', 'Tsai, C M']","['Moore DF', 'Rosenfeld MR', 'Gribbon PM', 'Winlove CP', 'Tsai CM']","['Department of Neurology, Cornell University Medical Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Inflammation,Inflammation,7600105,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Orosomucoid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*blood/*prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*metabolism', 'Macrophages', 'Meningococcal Infections/blood/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Orosomucoid/*metabolism/physiology', 'Rabbits', 'Shock, Septic/*blood/*prevention & control', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Inflammation. 1997 Feb;21(1):69-82. doi: 10.1023/a:1027342909423.,,,1,['10.1023/a:1027342909423 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human breast tumors, a striking association between HSP27 overexpression and a shorter disease-free survival period was reported. In this paper, we evaluated the expression levels of HSP27 in the cell lines of human breast and other tumors. Western blotting of HSP27 has shown the correlation of HSP27 expression and metastasis and tumorigenicity of mammary and prostate tumors. Thus the biological significance of HSP27 in aggressive mammary and prostate tumors was indicated.

Dogs with T-cell lymphomas were at significantly higher risk of relapse and early death compared with B-cell lineage lymphoma following therapy (52 vs. 160 days; p < 0.001 and 153 vs. 330 days; p < 0.001, respectively).

An update of its pharmacology and use in the treatment of haematological malignancies.,1005-37,"Fludarabine is an antineoplastic agent which has been studied in patients with a variety of lymphoproliferative malignancies. Clinical evidence from comparative studies in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) suggests that fludarabine is at least as effective as CAP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone) or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and prednisone) in previously treated or chemotherapy-naive patients and significantly more effective than chlorambucil in terms of response rate and duration and survival in chemotherapy-naive patients. Promising results have also been reported with fludarabine-based combination therapy in the treatment of patients with CLL. In addition, sequential therapy with fludarabine and cytarabine has demonstrated good efficacy in the treatment of acute leukaemias, as has fludarabine monotherapy and combination therapy in low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. A favourable cytoreductive response has been reported in patients with lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma and in a smaller number of patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas, CLL of T cell origin or prolymphocytic leukaemia. Recent data also support the use of fludarabine, either as a component of a nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen or in the attainment of minimal residual disease, in patients undergoing peripheral blood stem cell or bone marrow transplantation. The tolerability profile of fludarabine is similar to that of CAP, with the most common adverse events being granulocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia and infection. Alopecia and nausea/vomiting appear to be less frequent with fludarabine therapy than with CAP although the development of immune cytopenias is more frequent with fludarabine. Severe neurotoxicity has been reported with fludarabine but this is mostly confined to the use of high doses. Clinical experience therefore indicates that fludarabine is an effective and generally well-tolerated antineoplastic agent for the second-line treatment of advanced CLL. Recent data from comparative studies also support the earlier use of fludarabine in the treatment of chemotherapy-naive patients with CLL. Furthermore, results of available studies are increasingly highlighting an important future role for fludarabine in the treatment of acute leukaemias and low grade NHL and possibly other lymphoproliferative disorders, particularly when used as a component of combination chemotherapy.","['Adkins, J C', 'Peters, D H', 'Markham, A']","['Adkins JC', 'Peters DH', 'Markham A']","['Adis International Limited, Auckland, New Zealand. demail@adis.co.nz']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drugs. 1997 Jun;53(6):1005-37. doi: 10.2165/00003495-199753060-00007.,259,,6,['10.2165/00003495-199753060-00007 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This may, in part, be because of the inability of cancer cells to function as efficient antigen-presenting cells. For full activation, T cells must receive two signals delivered by antigen-presenting cells. The first is antigen-specific and is delivered by presentation of antigenic peptide by the major histocompatibility complex molecules to the T-cell receptor. This signal, although necessary, is in itself insufficient to mediate T-cell activation, cytokine release, and subsequent T-cell proliferation and function. For full T-cell activation, T cells require delivery of a secondary, costimulatory signal, such as that delivered by members of the B7 family to their receptor on the T-cell, CD28. Delivery of an antigen signal in the absence of costimulation does not result in productive immunity, but rather in anergy, a state of antigen-specific T-cell nonresponsiveness. To induce T-cell proliferation against B-cell malignancies, the tumor cell must first be induced to express B7 or the tumor antigen must be presented by an efficient antigen-presenting cell. Simple expression of B7 on the tumor cell alone, however, cannot reverse anergy. Reversal of anergy is a complex process involving stepwise repair of the T-cell defect and can be accomplished by prolonged exposure to interleukin-2, signaling through the CD2 pathway, followed by antigen presentation with B7-mediated costimulation. Successful immunotherapeutic strategies in the B-cell malignancies will likely require steps to reverse established anergy in the tumor-bearing host as well as effective tumor-antigen presentation.","['Gribben, J G', 'Cardoso, A A', 'Schultze, J L', 'Nadler, L M']","['Gribben JG', 'Cardoso AA', 'Schultze JL', 'Nadler LM']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/therapy', 'CD28 Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11 Suppl 4:S31-3.,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it can't be seen in the surface markers or in the nucleus of these diseases, so there is a need to develop ways to identify these cases. Good and potentially curable subsets of ALL patients are beginning to be identified by combining traditional phenotypic and immunologic markers with molecular and genetic approaches.

Childhood ALL mostly occurs in industrialized countries, with a unique peak in incidence between the ages of 2 and 8 years. It is associated with features conferring a favorable response to therapy, including early pre-B cell disease and a hyperdiploid karyotype or a cryptic t(12;21) translocation. The lymphoblasts of childhood ALL appear to arise in a developmental compartment that is ""poised"" for apoptotic death and are particularly sensitive to glucocorticoids, antimetabolites, and other cytotoxic agents. In contrast, adult ALL commonly possesses the poor-prognosis Philadelphia chromosome and is often drug-resistant. A far higher proportion of adults with ALL present with high initial white blood cell count and high-risk immunophenotypes, and exhibit a slow induction of remission with greater therapy-related toxicity. Improved supportive care measures with current intensive therapies and the development of novel leukemia-targeted biotherapies will be required to improve the cure rates of adults with ALL.","['Perentesis, J P']",['Perentesis JP'],"['Pediatric High-Risk Malignancies Program, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis 55455-0392, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/epidemiology/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 May;11 Suppl 4:S4-7.,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Further, targeted infusion of LIF in both normal and LIF knockout animals stimulated muscle regeneration, but the stimulation observed was much greater in the mutant animals than in controls. In contrast, interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-alpha, which also stimulate myoblast proliferation in vitro, had no effect on regeneration.

In general, treatment is comprised of systemic retreatment and local radiotherapy to one or both affected tests. METHODS: In this study, the authors report five boys with a late isolated testicular recurrence of ALL during sustained bone marrow remission, in whom radiotherapy had been omitted. High dose methotrexate was included in the treatment regimen. RESULTS: No further recurrences occurred after cessation of therapy. The follow-up period ranged from 1-15 years (median, 8 years). CONCLUSIONS: These cases show that there is a subpopulation of boys with recurrence of testicular leukemia who can be treated without radiotherapy. Therefore, the authors propose a treatment regimen for boys with late isolated recurrence of testicular leukemia in which conventional reinduction maintenance treatment is given in combination with high dose methotrexate.

Therefore, the objective of this multi-institutional, cooperative group Phase II trial was to determine the efficacy of dihydro-5-azacytidine (DHAC), a pyrimidine analogue, in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma. METHODS: Forty-one patients with histologically confirmed malignant mesothelioma received 120-hour continuous infusions of DHAC (1,500 mg/m2/day every 21 days) until maximal response, intolerable toxicity, or disease progression. RESULTS: One patient had a complete response, two had objective partial responses, and four had regression of evaluable disease. The overall response rate was 17%. The one complete responder remains without disease progression at 6 years. Chest pain and nausea were the most common toxicities. Supraventricular tachycardia and pericardial effusion occurred in 20% and 15% of patients, respectively. In most patients, gastrointestinal effects were manageable. There was no significant hematologic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: In malignant mesothelioma, a disease that is refractory to chemotherapy, dihydro-5-azacytidine has definite antitumor activity.

Results of an international multicenter randomized trial. International Society for Chemo-Immunotherapy, Vienna.",2107-14,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, much attention has been paid to the possible efficacy of intensive chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced, progressive B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. For this reason, the International Society for Chemo-Immunotherapy, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Cooperative Group, has begun a randomized multicenter trial comparing Binet's modified cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regimen with continuous high dose chlorambucil (HD-CLB). METHODS: During the period January 1987 to May 1993, 228 previously untreated CLL patients from 7 cooperative institutions were randomized to this trial. Advanced and/or progressive disease was defined by high Total Tumor Mass (TTM) score (> 9), and/or short doubling time (DT) (< 12 months), and/or bone marrow failure. The response to therapy was defined by reduction of the initial TTM score. The end points of the trial were response rate, survival, and toxicity. RESULTS: HD-CLB resulted in a higher response rate than CHOP in evaluable cases, with 89.5% overall responses (complete response+partial response) versus 75%, respectively (P < 0.001). At the time of an analysis performed in July 1995 (after a median follow-up period of 37 months), overall survival was also longer in the HD-CLB treatment arm (median survival, 68 months) than in the CHOP treatment arm (median survival, 47 months) (P < 0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: The current study showed that HD-CLB is an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic option for patients with advanced and/or progressive CLL. Therefore, the authors recommend its wider use, possibly in comparison with and/ or in combination with new therapeutic agents, such as purine analogues.","['Jaksic, B', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Krc, I', 'Losonczi, H', 'Holowiecki, J', 'Planinc-Peraica, A', 'Kusec, R', 'Morabito, F', 'Iacopino, P', 'Lutz, D']","['Jaksic B', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Krc I', 'Losonczi H', 'Holowiecki J', 'Planinc-Peraica A', 'Kusec R', 'Morabito F', 'Iacopino P', 'Lutz D']","['Internal Medicine Department, University Hospital, Merkur, Zagreb, Croatia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chlorambucil/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1997/06/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1997 Jun 1;79(11):2107-14.,,,11,['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19970601)79:11<2107::AID-CNCR7>3.0.CO;2-L [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strong cytotoxic activity against L1210 cells was found in 47 species of algae, also showing similar cytotoxicity to mouse NIH-3T3 normal cells. However, four species of green algae showed strong activity specifically against L1210 cells, with low cytotoxicity to normal cells. Such selective activity was conspicuous in two brown and two green algae extracts. In particular, methanol extracts from the green alga, Cladophoropsis vaucheriaeformis, exhibited high viability (86%) to normal cells, showing selective cytotoxicity to tumor cells. This alga extract was no cytocidalic, but cytostatic against L1210 cells.

Tax can upregulate expression of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta, as well as potentiate apoptosis in activated T-cells and in serum starved murine fibroblasts. To examine the role of CD95 (APO-1/Fas) and ICE-proteases in Tax-mediated active T-cell death, Jurkat T cells expressing (APO(S)) or lacking (APO(R)) cell surface expression of CD95 (APO-1/Fas) were genetically modified to express hormone-inducible HTLV-1 Tax constructs. Hormone-inducible action of Tax alone was sufficient to promote programmed cell death in CD95-expressing Jurkat T-cell clones. In contrast, clones lacking CD95 surface expression were resistant to the antiproliferative action of Tax. Both APO(S) and APO(R) clones exhibited Tax-dependent upregulation of CD95 ligand and TNF-alpha. Blocking experiments suggested that while the apoptotic action of Tax critically required ICE-protease function it was largely independent of cell surface interaction of CD95 ligand or TNF-alpha with their corresponding receptors. These observations strongly implicate ICE-proteases in Tax-induced T-cell death, and suggest a possible involvement of CD95 in this process.","['Chlichlia, K', 'Busslinger, M', 'Peter, M E', 'Walczak, H', 'Krammer, P H', 'Schirrmacher, V', 'Khazaie, K']","['Chlichlia K', 'Busslinger M', 'Peter ME', 'Walczak H', 'Krammer PH', 'Schirrmacher V', 'Khazaie K']","['Tumorimmunology Program, German Cancer Research Center.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 1', 'Clone Cells', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 May 15;14(19):2265-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201070.,,,19,['10.1038/sj.onc.1201070 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have generated stable transfectants of K562 constitutively expressing two c-Myc inhibitory mutants: D106-143, that carries a deletion in the transactivation domain of the protein, and In373, that carries an insertion in the DNA-interacting region. We show here that In373 is able to compete with c-Myc for Max binding and to inhibit the transformation activity of c-Myc. K562 cells can differentiate towards erythroid or myelomonocytic lineages. K562 transfected with c-myc mutants showed a higher expression of erythroid differentiation markers, without any detectable effects in the myelomonocytic differentiation. We also transfected K562 cells with a zinc-inducible max gene. Ectopic Max overexpression resulted in an increased erythroid differentiation, thus reproducing the effects of c-myc inhibitory mutants. We also studied the role of c-myc mutants and max in apoptosis of K562 induced by okadaic acid, a protein phosphatases inhibitor. The expression of D106-143 and In373 c-myc mutants and the overexpression of max reduced the apoptosis mediated by okadaic acid. The common biochemical activity of D106-143 and In373 is to bind Max and hence to titrate out c-Myc to form non-functional Myc/Max dimers. Similarly, Max overexpression would decrease the relative levels of c-Myc/Max with respect to Max/Max. The results support a model where a threshold of functional c-Myc/Max is required to maintain K562 cells in an undifferentiated state and to undergo drug-mediated apoptosis.","['Canelles, M', 'Delgado, M D', 'Hyland, K M', 'Lerga, A', 'Richard, C', 'Dang, C V', 'Leon, J']","['Canelles M', 'Delgado MD', 'Hyland KM', 'Lerga A', 'Richard C', 'Dang CV', 'Leon J']","['Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Medicina, Santander, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Okadaic Acid/pharmacology', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/20 00:00,1997/03/20 00:01,['1997/03/20 00:00'],"['1997/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Mar 20;14(11):1315-27. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1200948.,,"['CA51497/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM07814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",11,['10.1038/sj.onc.1200948 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EWS-erg and EWS-Fli-1, which are involved in greater than 95% of Ewing family of tumors, were shown to function as transcriptional activators. TLS/FUS-erg, which is involved in human myeloid leukemias also functions as a transcriptional activator. Expression of these fusion proteins (EWS-erg and EWS-Fli-1) are shown to be essential for maintaining the oncogenic and tumorigenic properties of tumor cells. Cancer is thought to be caused not only by uncontrolled cell proliferation but also by deregulation of programmed cell death. Therefore, we have studied the role of normal (Fli-1 and erg) and aberrant fusion proteins (EWS-erg, EWS-Fli-1 and TLS/FUS-erg) in apoptosis. We have found that expression of normal (Fli-1 and erg) and aberrant fusion proteins inhibit the apoptosis of NIH3T3 cells induced by either serum deprivation or by treatment with calcium ionophore. We have also observed similar suppression of apoptosis in Ewing's sarcoma cells expressing EWS-Fli-1 and EWS-erg proteins suggesting that these fusion proteins may be responsible for the decreased ability of these tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. Inhibition of the expression of these aberrant fusion proteins by antisense RNA technique resulted in increased susceptibility to apoptosis leading to the death of tumor cells. Therefore, our results suggest that one can use therapeutic agents which can down regulate the expression of fusion proteins in combination with chemotherapeutic agents as an effective treatment for these human solid tumors and leukemias.","['Yi, H', 'Fujimura, Y', 'Ouchida, M', 'Prasad, D D', 'Rao, V N', 'Reddy, E S']","['Yi H', 'Fujimura Y', 'Ouchida M', 'Prasad DD', 'Rao VN', 'Reddy ES']","['Department of Human Genetics, Allegheny University of the Health Sciences, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*pathology', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/03/20 00:00,1997/03/20 00:01,['1997/03/20 00:00'],"['1997/03/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1997 Mar 20;14(11):1259-68. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1201099.,,"['CA51083/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57322/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",11,['10.1038/sj.onc.1201099 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike in all other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas sex distribution demonstrates a striking preponderance of males over females with a ratio of 3:1.

In generalized disease, clinical course is characterized by continuous progression with a median survival probability of 3-4 years within most series. Overall response rates of 56-88% with complete remissions in the range of 9-58% are attainable but relapse occurs predominantly within 20 months. At present there is no evidence that any conventional regimen is curative. Prospective multicenter studies are mandatory to overcome this therapeutic dilemma. Patients suitable for some form of maintenance or consolidation therapy should initially be treated intensively by anthracycline-containing regimens. Whether maintenance with interferon or intermittent chemotherapy including new agents, like purine analogues or (un)conjugated monoclonal antibodies are able to influence overall survival is a matter of (ongoing) investigations. Further experimental approaches arise from antisense oligonucleotides or ribozymes blocking the overexpression of bcl-1 especially in this lymphoma entity.

T-PLL is morphologically characterized by a prominent central nucleolus in a medium-sized cell expressing a mature T cell immunophenotype. Clonal genetic changes involving chromosome 14 and T cell receptor gene rearrangements are characteristics of these diseases. They are usually progressive and there is no efficient treatment available. The classification of some cases presenting with a morphological picture similar to B-CLL, but with immunophenotypic and clinical features resembling T-PLL, as T-CLL is still controversial. The phenotypic profiles and the establishment of clonality are the hallmarks of defining T-LGL leukemia and NK-LGL leukemia. The CD3+/CD57+/CD56- immunophenotype and the clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor genes characterize T-LGL leukemia, which presents clinically with a rather indolent course of disease, complicated by frequent infections secondary to neutropenia.

Clinicians have observed an increasing frequency of life-threatening opportunistic infections but only some of these may be explained by fludarabine-induced impairment of cell-mediated immunity.

Thus, G-CSF supplementation may improve the rate of infectious complications by reducing the duration of fludarabine-induced neutrocytopenia.

It interferes with the intranuclear machinery of DNA regulation, and causes death to proliferative active, as well as resting lymphocytes. Interruption of crucial pathways that are evident for cell survival translates into high clinical response rates in CLL. CR and PR rates comparable to those reported on fludarabine are achieved in relapsed or refractory CLL. Even though trials on previously untreated CLL are still ongoing, a consistent trend towards durable, high CR rates becomes apparent. The toxicity is comparable to that of fludarabine and consists of infections, as well as thrombocytopenia. Clinical as well as in vitro studies suggest a crossresistance between the two purine analogues, indicating that sequential treatment is not useful. Given these data, although preliminary in case of de novo CLL, 2-CDA has to be recognized as one of the most effective cytostatic drugs currently available for CLL treatment. Large prospective trials (in comparison with fludarabine) will assess the role of 2-CDA as standard treatment. Such trials should also have the aim to substantiate the potential of 2-CDA as induction treatment followed by high-dose consolidation.","['Mitterbauer, M', 'Hilgenfeld, E', 'Wilfing, A', 'Jager, U', 'Knauf, W U']","['Mitterbauer M', 'Hilgenfeld E', 'Wilfing A', 'Jager U', 'Knauf WU']","['Universitatsklinik fur Innere Medizin I, Abt Hamatologie und Hamostaseologie, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 2:S35-7.,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the high activity of nucleoside analogs as fludarabine (FAMP), 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) and 2-deoxycoformycin (DCF) in low-grade NHLs has caused a new reawakening interest in CLL concerning new treatment strategies, the biology and prognostic factors of this disease. Predominantly FAMP has widely been studied in CLL with impressive remission rates of 30-70%, including some complete remission (CR) in refractory or relapsed CLL. In previously untreated patients, the remission rate is about 80% with a CR rate of up to 60%. These results open new treatment strategies, even with a curative intention such as high-dose chemotherapy combined with autologous stem cell support or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The clinical experience with 2-CDA in CLL is limited, but the preliminary results suggest a similar efficacy as FAMP, whereas DCF seems to be less effective. The major treatment-related morbidity is due to myelo- and immunosuppression by long-lasting T cell depletion, which may facilitate a greater susceptibility of infections including those with opportunistic organisms as herpes simplex or herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis carinii, mycobacteria, listeriosis, candida and aspergillus in pretreated patients. However, in previously untreated patients no increased incidence of infections has been reported compared with other schedules. Whether FAMP treated patients have any advantage for overall or progression-free survival has to be answered by ongoing randomized trials. Presently, the position of FAMP and 2-CDA as two extremely active single agents in CLL is that of second-line therapy. Their appropriate indication in the first-line strategy of CLL has, however, still to be defined by clinical studies in progress.","['Bergmann, L']",['Bergmann L'],"['Medical Clinic III, University Hospital, JW Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 2:S29-34.,77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complex karyotypes, trisomy 12, and a '14q+' abnormality have been associated with inferior prognosis, whereas aberrations of 13q have been found in patients with a favorable outcome. However, the cytogenetic analysis of B-CLL by conventional banding techniques has remained a difficult task mainly due to the low in vitro mitotic activity of the tumor cells. Although B cell mitogens are used for cell culture, clonal chromosome aberrations are detected in only half of the B-CLL tumors. 'Interphase cytogenetics' by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) circumvents this problem, because there is no need to induce the malignant cells to proliferate in vitro. Numerical and structural chromosome aberrations can be detected in non-dividing interphase cells as well as in metaphase spreads. By FISH, the most common chromosome abnormalities are deletions of 13q followed by deletions of 11q, trisomy 12, and deletions of 17p. Except for the TP53 gene at 17p13, no candidate gene affected by these aberrations has so far been identified. FISH will be instrumental for the identification of such genes because the recurrent aberrations, especially deletions, can be systematically delineated to the resolution level of several kb. Furthermore, based on the sensitive detection of chromosome abnormalities by FISH, more accurate correlations between chromosome abnormalities and prognosis can be performed. Deletion of the TP53 gene at 17p13 have already been shown to be one of the most important independent prognostic factors for survival. Other specific aberrations of clinical significance will likely be identified by the systematic application of interphase cytogenetics on a large series of patients.","['Dohner, H', 'Stilgenbauer, S', 'Fischer, K', 'Bentz, M', 'Lichter, P']","['Dohner H', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Fischer K', 'Bentz M', 'Lichter P']","['Medizinische Klinik and Poliklinik V, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cytogenetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Apr;11 Suppl 2:S19-24.,65,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steroids should be generally reserved, therefore, for the management of complications such as hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia or other autoimmune manifestations. CLB can still be considered standard therapy for advanced CLL, since polychemotherapy protocols as well as newer agents such as fludarabine have failed to show an improvement in survival compared to CLB. However, the results regarding response and survival of the CLB-treated patients seem to depend on dosage intensity and treatment duration. Biological response modifiers such as interferons, interleukins, and monoclonal antibodies have not improved responses or remission duration. Because experiences with CLL patients are limited, the indications and procedure of bone marrow transplantation are not yet clear. However, since results of current treatment protocols are unsatisfactory, regardless of age, patients should be involved in clinical studies that address the question whether high-dose CLB, fludarabine or the combination of fludarabine with other active agents can improve patients' outcome.

The present study describes the effects of activators of protein kinase C (PKC) on GGO-induced apoptosis in various lines of leukemia cells. Both 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and diacylglycerol (DG) inhibited the GGO-induced morphological changes that are characteristic of apoptosis and the DNA fragmentation. Similar effects were observed with other lines of human and murine leukemia cells such as ML1, U937, M1 and P388. Flow cytometric analysis also revealed that both TPA and DG prevented GGO-induced DNA degradation in a dose-dependent manner. These inhibitory effects of TPA and DG were antagonized by inhibitors of PKC such as H-7 and staurosporin, and by amiloride, an inhibitor of Na+/H+ antiporter. In contrast to the inhibitory effects of TPA and DG on GGO-induced apoptosis, 4alpha-TPA, which is unable to activate PKC, failed to prevent GGO-induced DNA fragmentation. However, the selective activator of PKC-beta, 12-deoxyphorbol 13-phenylacetate 20-acetate, significantly inhibited GGO-induced DNA fragmentation.

Although phagocytosis was normal in most transplant recipents, the oxidative burst of granulocytes was significantly impaired in recipients early after autologous and allogeneic transplants. Patients who underwent tests in later stages after transplant had normal leukocyte function test results.

Normal progenitors adhere through a variety of receptors to stroma and extracellular matrix components, including fibronectin. Adhesion through beta1-integrin receptors to fibronectin not only anchor progenitors to the stroma but also result in direct adhesion-mediated signaling that inhibits progenitor proliferation. In contrast to normal hematopoiesis, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized not only by abnormal, premature circulation of primitive progenitors in the blood but also by continuous progenitor proliferation. Although CML progenitors express the same integrin receptors as normal progenitors, they fail to adhere to stroma and fibronectin, suggesting structural or functional abnormalities of these receptors. Furthermore, CML cells present in contact with stroma or fibronectin continue to proliferate, suggesting that failure to adhere through integrin receptors may also underlie the abnormal proliferation of CML progenitors. The observation that integrin-mediated adhesion and proliferation-inhibitory signaling can be restored through treatment with interferon-alpha or an activating anti-beta1-integrin antibody suggests a functional rather than structural defect that may be related to the presence of the BCR/ABL gene rearrangement in these cells. Insights into the role of integrins as adhesion molecules but also receptors that instruct hematopoietic progenitors to survive, proliferate, and possibly differentiate will not only further our understanding of the normal hematopoietic process but also provide insights into diseases characterized by deranged adhesion and proliferation that may lead to novel therapeutic approaches.","['Verfaillie, C M', 'Hurley, R', 'Zhao, R C', 'Prosper, F', 'Delforge, M', 'Bhatia, R']","['Verfaillie CM', 'Hurley R', 'Zhao RC', 'Prosper F', 'Delforge M', 'Bhatia R']","['Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Integrins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*physiopathology', 'Models, Biological']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1997 Jun;129(6):584-91. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2143(97)90192-x.,52,"['P01-CA-65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-49930/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",6,"['S0022-2143(97)90192-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2143(97)90192-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This 'hybrid' biosensor, constructed with mast cells interfaced to a microfabricated thermoelectric device with the use of biomolecular linkages, is capable of detecting antigens in real time by transducing minute heat changes arising from antigen-induced mast cell activation processes. The thermoelectric approach was selected based upon preliminary bioenergetic calculations which indicated that metabolic changes arising from mast cell antigen recognition result in a significant increase in exothermic heat relative to basal metabolic conditions. Experimental studies confirmed that mast cell activation and degranulation can be discriminated theramally from basal metabolic activity. Results obtained from microcalorimetry experiments using cultured mast cells (MC/9) mucosal-like mast cell line), and harvested mast cells (rat peritoneal mast cells) indicated that detectable increases in heat output (-3 +/- 0.5 pW/cell, mean peak output) immediately followed cell activation. The construction of a miniature hybrid immunobiosensor device was made possible by bioelectronic coupling achieved with the use of cellular adhesive proteins that immobilized non-adherent (MC/9) cells as well as adherent (RBL-2H3 rat basophilic leukemia) cells to the thermopile. Results from preliminary tests conducted on a hybrid biosensor prototype validated the design feasibility of a miniature, living cell immunodiagnostic biosensor.

However, in contrast to Hox induction, Pbx upregulation is predominantly a result of post-transcriptional mechanisms. Interestingly, Pbx1, Pbx2, and Pbx3 exhibit different profiles of upregulation, suggesting possible functional divergence.

An investigation was undertaken using several techniques to characterize fully the physicochemical changes L-Asparaginase is undergoing during freeze-thaw cycling leading to the loss of its activity. A total protein assay suggested that the loss of some enzyme activity was a result of protein precipitation. Circular dichroism (CD) studies showed a decrease of alpha-helical structure with a concomitant increase in beta sheet and random coil content, suggesting alterations in the secondary structure leading to unfolding, the first step of denaturation processes. The elution profiles obtained from size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) studies indicated the formation of several species during the process of freezing and thawing. Sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) studies showed bands corresponding to 1-3 kDa and 32 kDa, suggesting that some of the species are fragments and shortened monomers resulting from cleavage of monomers. The molecular weight distribution obtained using SEC-linked light scattering indicated a substantial fraction of polydispersed fragments ranging from 900 Da to 3 kDa and a small fraction of aggregates corresponding to 300 kDa. A scheme was proposed to explain the cascade of events leading to the loss of soluble protein and accompanying loss of enzyme activity. Tetramers of the enzyme dissociate into monomers some of which are cleaved into small fragments. The shortened monomers then aggregate and precipitate.","['Jameel, F', 'Bogner, R', 'Mauri, F', 'Kalonia, D']","['Jameel F', 'Bogner R', 'Mauri F', 'Kalonia D']","['School of Pharmacy, University of Connecticut, Storrs 06269, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/enzymology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Freezing', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Solubility', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 1997 May;49(5):472-7. doi: 10.1111/j.2042-7158.1997.tb06826.x.,,,5,['10.1111/j.2042-7158.1997.tb06826.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During a leukopenic period, the patient suffered from pericarditis with massive pericardial effusion in which human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) DNA was detected. Although complete remission of AML was achieved, fever persisted and atypical skin rash followed by generalized lymphadenopathy along with polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia appeared. A diagnosis of AILD was made on a biopsy specimen of the inguinal lymph node. The patient died of fulminant hepatitis and the autopsy showed lymphomatous infiltrates involving the liver, bone marrow, lungs, spleen, kidneys and heart. HHV-6 DNA sequences were identified in the biopsy specimen of the lymph node and in the involved organ tissues. HHV-6 in this patient was variant B. It is known that HHV-6 can be reactivated in immunocompromised patients and causes severe complications. This unusual clinical course suggests that the immunosuppression associated with AML and the additional iatrogenic immunosuppression following cytopenia-inducing chemotherapy predisposed the patient to reactivated HHV-6 infection. The sequential detection of this virus before and after manifestation of AILD may support the evidence that HHV-6 infection could directly or indirectly trigger AILD. This is the first time that such a sequence of events has been reported to our knowledge. The possibility of HHV-6 infection should be considered when unexplained fever and generalized lymphadenopathy are seen in patients with leukemia, and administration of antiviral agents should be considered for the diagnostic evaluation.","['Daibata, M', 'Ido, E', 'Murakami, K', 'Kuzume, T', 'Kubonishi, I', 'Taguchi, H', 'Miyoshi, I']","['Daibata M', 'Ido E', 'Murakami K', 'Kuzume T', 'Kubonishi I', 'Taguchi H', 'Miyoshi I']","['Department of Medicine, Kochi Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Autopsy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Fever', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*complications/pathology', '*Herpesvirus 6, Human/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Hypergammaglobulinemia/complications', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*complications/immunology/pathology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericarditis/complications', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications/pathology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):882-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400671.,,,6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400671 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study reviews a 5 year experience of genotyping as an assessment of clonality in a central referral laboratory. Patients were referred for assessment if abnormal hemopoietic populations were identified and where standard morphology, cytochemistry or immunophenotyping techniques were equivocal and unable to establish the diagnosis. Analysis of the antigen receptor genes (IgH gene and TCR gamma locus) was performed in 230 patients by either Southern blotting or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clonal rearrangements of either loci could be demonstrated in 91/230 patients: 56/161 patients analyzed by Southern blotting and 48/125 analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. A subgroup of patients (n = 88) was analyzed for rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene by both techniques. Discordant results were observed in 18 of these patients (20%). Analysis of the TCR gamma locus in a separate group demonstrated discordant results in eight of 40 patients examined (20%). Clinical outcome could be available in 61 patients (median time: 42 months, range 1-68 months): for those in whom a rearrangement was detected approximately 80% went on to develop a lymphoproliferative disorder although this diagnosis was not able to be made at the time the sample was taken. In a subset of patients (n = 14) who presented with lymphocytosis after bone marrow transplantation (seven) or solid organ transplant (seven), clonal lymphoid populations were demonstrated in approximately 50% of cases. The majority of these cases demonstrated the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by PCR. The clonality of EBV infection was assessed by Southern blotting and the significance of these findings are discussed. This study explores the differences between Southern blotting and PCR as applied to the study of antigen receptor rearrangement studies. We conclude that detecting a clonal population is valuable in patients where standard diagnostic techniques are equivocal. However, the inability to detect a clonal population should be treated with caution and interpreted in light of other investigations.","['Rockman, S P']",['Rockman SP'],"['Department of Diagnostic Haematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):852-62. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400678.,61,,6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400678 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported a strong expression of B7-1 on Reed-Sternberg cells and anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells. We report here our findings on B7-2 expression by malignant lymphomas (n = 70). B7-2 was present on the neoplastic cells of anaplastic large cell lymphoma in two of three cases studied, and on a subpopulation of the malignant cells in one out of four cases of follicular lymphoma. B7-2 was not expressed by the neoplastic cells of the other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (n = 32), including T cell-rich B cell lymphoma. In contrast, Reed-Sternberg cells in lymph nodes affected by Hodgkin's disease are strongly positive for B7-2 (n = 31). Evidence for a functional correlate of this expression was obtained by our findings that the combination of anti-B7-1 and anti-B7-2 monoclonal antibodies was more effective than each separately in blocking allogeneic T cell activation (proliferation and cytokine secretion) by Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines as stimulators. The possible role of B7-1 and B7-2 expression for the course and symptomatology of Hodgkin's disease is discussed.","['Van Gool, S W', 'Delabie, J', 'Vandenberghe, P', 'Coorevits, L', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Ceuppens, J L']","['Van Gool SW', 'Delabie J', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Coorevits L', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Ceuppens JL']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Hodgkin Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):846-51. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400683.,,,6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400683 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied Fas (CD95/Apo-1) antigen expression in 27 MDS patients (RARS 4, RA 3, RAEB 13; RAEB-t 3, CMML 4) and three AML secondary to MDS. We found that the Fas antigen was not expressed on normal bone marrow (BM) CD34+, CD14+, or glycophorin+ cells, and only slightly on CD33+ cells. Patients with MDS had upregulation of Fas expression on total bone marrow nuclear cells (BMMC) (t-test, P = 0.04), CD34+ (P = 0.013), CD33+ (P = 0.04), and glycophorin+ (P = 0.032) BM cells compared to controls. Fas expression did not correlate to the FAB subtype, the Bournemouth score, or to peripheral cytopenias. However, Fas expression intensity on CD34+ cells negatively correlated to the BM blasts number (Spearman, P = 0.01) suggesting that leukemic blasts cells lose Fas antigen expression with progression of myelodysplasia. Using both proliferation assays in liquid cultures and clonogenic progenitor assays in the presence of an agonist anti-Fas MoAb (CH11), we showed that the Fas protein was functional in some patients. Dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed in three out of seven patients studied. CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies suppression in some patients suggested that Fas can induce apoptosis in myeloid and erythroid BM progenitors of MDS patients. The TUNEL technique on BM smears gave a mean of 12.6% +/- 2.5 of bone marrow apoptotic cells in five controls. Patients with MDS had increased bone marrow apoptosis (mean 39% +/- 5.7, t-test, P = 0.012). Four out of 15 (26%) patients studied with a sensitive radiolabeled DNA ladder technique had typical DNA ladders indicative of advanced stages of apoptosis. Massive BM suicide was observed in patients with RA (2/2) and RAEB (8/11), whereas apoptosis rates were normal or low in patients with RAEB-t (3/3) or secondary AMLs (3/3). Moreover, high rates of apoptosis correlated to low Bournemouth score (Spearman, P = 0.01). No statistical correlation could be found between Fas expression and apoptosis rates. Our results confirm the importance of programmed cell death in MDS. The Fas antigen is clearly upregulated on BM cells, but its role in the pathophysiology of apoptosis in myelodysplasia is still unclear, indicating that many factors positively or negatively interfere with the Fas-mediated pathway of apoptosis in vivo and in vitro.","['Bouscary, D', 'De Vos, J', 'Guesnu, M', 'Jondeau, K', 'Viguier, F', 'Melle, J', 'Picard, F', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Fontenay-Roupie, M']","['Bouscary D', 'De Vos J', 'Guesnu M', 'Jondeau K', 'Viguier F', 'Melle J', 'Picard F', 'Dreyfus F', 'Fontenay-Roupie M']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Inserm U363, ICGM, Hopital Chochin, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*biosynthesis', '*Apoptosis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/*pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'fas Receptor/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):839-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400654.,,,6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400654 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 1% of the CD34+ progenitors were CD34+ CD38+ in AML-M7 compared to 72% in other AML subtypes (P < 0.000). These findings suggest that the CD34+ cell compartment in AML-M7 consists of early lineage-specific progenitors.

Aside from anchoring progenitors in the marrow microenvironment, beta1 integrin-dependent adhesion of normal CFC is associated with inhibition of their proliferation. In contrast to normal CFC, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) Ph+ CFC adhere significantly less to either stroma or FN. CML Ph+ CFC proliferation is also not inhibited by coculture with stroma or FN. However, equal numbers of alpha4, alpha5, and beta1 integrins and CD44 are present on CML and normal CD34+ cells. We have previously demonstrated that beta1-dependent adhesion to and subsequent proliferation inhibition by FN can be restored when CML Ph+ CFC are incubated with the beta1 integrin activating antibody, 8A2, and demonstrated a role for the alpha5beta1 integrin in this phenomenon. Since the integrin alpha4beta1 and the proteoglycan form of CD44 may cooperate in establishing normal CFC adhesion to FN, we examined if treatment of CML Ph+ CFC with 8A2 also restores the cooperativity between beta1 integrins and CD44. We demonstrate that 8A2 induces adhesion of CML Ph+ CFC not only to intact FN but also to alpha4beta1, alpha5beta1, and proteoglycan binding fragments of FN. 8A2-induced adhesion to these fragments and peptides also results in a significant inhibition of the proliferation of CML Ph+ CFC. Addition of antibodies to either the alpha5, alpha4, or beta1 integrins, antibodies against the CD44 receptor, or removal of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans from the surface of CML CD34+ HLA-DR+ cells significantly reduced the 8A2-induced adhesion to and adhesion-mediated inhibition of proliferation by FN. These studies demonstrate that activation of beta1 integrins on CML Ph+ CFC not only results in upregulation of beta1 integrin-dependent adhesion and adhesion-mediated inhibition of proliferation, but also in the restoration of cooperation between beta1 integrins and CD44. These studies suggest that decreased beta1 integrin avidity may also affect the function of the proteoglycan adhesion receptor CD44, both of which may contribute to the abnormal circulation and expansion of malignant progenitors in CML.","['Lundell, B I', 'McCarthy, J B', 'Kovach, N L', 'Verfaillie, C M']","['Lundell BI', 'McCarthy JB', 'Kovach NL', 'Verfaillie CM']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin beta1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*physiology', 'Integrin beta1/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):822-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400653.,,"['R01-CA-4581401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-48738-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL-49930-01A2/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400653 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the same time, the uptake of [S]ODNs by mononuclear and purified CD34+ cell populations and the cross-hybridization of 26- and 16-mer [S]ODNs with the complementary sequences were evaluated. After incubation for 120 h with 26-mer antisense [S]ODNs on mononuclear cells, overall mean colony recovery was 41.9% of the untreated control samples; in particular, a significant reduction in colony formation was observed in 22 of the 35 cases tested.

Hybridization experiments confirmed a partial cross-reactivity when the 26-mer ODNs were hybridized with their complementary sequence; this did not occur when 16-mer ODNs were similarly tested. Experiments aimed at evaluating the effect of the incubation time showed a significant increase in anti-leukaemic effect after a 120 h incubation period compared to that measured after a 24 h incubation period; this was parallelled by a progressive increase in the intracellular concentrations of [S]ODNs from day 1 to day 5.

The down-regulation of p210(bcr-abl) levels following treatment with [S]ODNs showed a correlation between the effect of antisense [S]ODNs on leukaemic colony formation and protein expression.

Little attention, however, has been given to the relationship between prognosis and IgH gene rearrangement in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In this study, we examined IgH gene rearrangement in 35 untreated AML patients by PCR. PCR was performed using consensus heavy chain complimentarity-determining region (CDR)-3 primers. Clonal IgH gene rearrangement was detected in 14 patients (40%). Four of five patients (80%) who were positive for B cell markers had clonal IgH gene rearrangement. Ten of 30 B cell antigen-negative patients (33%) also showed IgH rearrangement. All patients were treated with a daunorubicin-based regimen, resulting in complete remission for 29 patients (83%). Sixty-four percent of those with IgH rearrangement and 95% of those without rearrangement had complete remission. Overall survival of IgH-PCR positive and negative patients at 25 months was 29 and 88%, respectively. IgH-PCR positivity may be a poor prognostic factor in AML.","['Kyoda, K', 'Nakamura, S', 'Matano, S', 'Ohtake, S', 'Matsuda, T']","['Kyoda K', 'Nakamura S', 'Matano S', 'Ohtake S', 'Matsuda T']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kanazawa University School of Medicine, Kanazawa City, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/*immunology/mortality', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):803-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400662.,,,6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400662 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the molecular pathology of childhood T cell ALL. Oncogenesis is a multistep process that involves alterations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Recently, a mutator phenotype detectable by microsatellite instabilities was shown to be associated with predisposition to cancer. This new mechanism for human carcinogenesis is caused by defects in the DNA replication/repair system. To study the involvement of some of these mutational events in the development of T cell ALL, we have initiated a systematic search for losses of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instabilities in children affected with this disease. These patients were allelotyped by PCR using 56 microsatellite markers located near known or putative tumor suppressor genes. The microsatellite patterns were altered in more than 80% of the patients. LOH were detected in chromosomes 6p, 12p and 9p. Two third of the patients were deleted for chromosome 9p21, suggesting the involvement of a tumor suppressor gene, probably the p16 gene. The only patient refractory to chemotherapy was shown to be associated with a mutator phenotype. This is the first documented case of a childhood neoplasia associated with genomic instabilities. Our results suggest that defects in DNA replication/repair components are involved in the development of a subset of childhood T cell ALL.","['Baccichet, A', 'Benachenhou, N', 'Couture, F', 'Leclerc, J M', 'Sinnett, D']","['Baccichet A', 'Benachenhou N', 'Couture F', 'Leclerc JM', 'Sinnett D']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Centre de Cancerologie Charles Bruneau, and Sainte-Justine Hospital, Montreal (Quebec) Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 6', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA Repair', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):797-802. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400650.,,,6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400650 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the clinical records and panoramic radiographs of 423 survivors of ALL who were treated on one of four consecutive protocols (1975-1991). Dental abnormalities included root stunting, microdontia, hypodontia, taurodontia (enlarged pulp chambers), and over-retention of primary teeth. The frequency of these factors was determined in relation to age at initiation of treatment (< or = 8 years vs > 8 years), addition of cranial irradiation, and chemotherapeutic protocol. A total of 423 patients met the study criteria. The abnormalities comprised root stunting in 24.4% (n = 103), microdontia in 18.9% (n = 80), hypodontia in 8.5% (n = 36), taurodontia in 5.9% (n = 25), and over-retention of primary dentition in 4.0% (n = 17). Patients who were < or = 8 years old at diagnosis or who received cranial irradiation therapy developed more dental abnormalities than did those > 8 years and those who did not receive cranial irradiation (42 vs 32%). Survivors of childhood ALL often have dental abnormalities that may affect their quality of life. Dental evaluation at diagnosis and frequent follow-up may help to ensure appropriate preventive measures and minimize dental and periodontal disease.","['Kaste, S C', 'Hopkins, K P', 'Jones, D', 'Crom, D', 'Greenwald, C A', 'Santana, V M']","['Kaste SC', 'Hopkins KP', 'Jones D', 'Crom D', 'Greenwald CA', 'Santana VM']","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St Jude's Children's Research Hospital, and University of Tennessee, Memphis 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Injuries', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survivors', 'Tooth Abnormalities/chemically induced/*etiology']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1997 Jun;11(6):792-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2400670.,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",6,['10.1038/sj.leu.2400670 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two patients were in late chronic phase and two in accelerated phase. All had previously failed therapy with interferon-alpha (IFN-A). Nine patients were treated with fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day for 5 days every 28 days. Three had Ph-positive CML, and six Ph-negative disease. Five patients were in accelerated phase and four in late chronic phase. Three patients treated with DCF had normalization of WBC counts while on the weekly schedule but progressed when changed to every other week. The fourth patient had no objective response. There were no cytogenetic responses. DCF was well tolerated with only mild nausea and vomiting in all patients. Patients treated with fludarabine received a median of two courses (range 1-4). In two patients (both Ph-positive), disease progressed to blastic phase upon recovery. Two other patients died of hemorrhagic complications secondary to thrombocytopenia. In all other cases fludarabine produced a transient reduction of WBC counts, but counts recovered to levels equal to or greater than the pre-treatment values. There were no cytogenetic responses.

The human C/EBPepsilon gene is transcribed by two alternative promoters, Palpha and Pbeta. A combination of differential splicing and alternative use of promoters generates four mRNA isoforms, of 2.6 kb and 1.3-1.5 kb in size. These transcripts can encode three proteins of calculated molecular mass 32.2 kDa, 27.8 kDa, and 14.3 kDa. Accordingly, Western blots with antibodies specific for the DNA-binding domain, that is common to all forms, identify multiple proteins. C/EBPepsilon mRNA was greatly induced during in vitro granulocytic differentiation of human primary CD34(+) cells. Retinoic acid treatment of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells for 24 hr induced C/EBPepsilon mRNA levels by 4-fold, while prolonged treatment gradually reduced mRNA expression to pretreatment levels.

Since FasL has been implicated in the existence of immunologically privileged body sites by inducing apoptosis of activated T lymphocytes, we investigated the expression of FasL in human colon cancers. We found that two out of seven primary tumors and all four hepatic metastatic tumors of surgically obtained colonic adenocarcinoma expressed FasL mRNA and protein, detected by reverse transcription-coupled PCR and by immunohistochemical staining, respectively. Expression of FasL was not detected in normal colonic epithelial cells. FasL mRNA was also expressed in some human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines including SW480, SW1116, and LS180 cells. Cell-surface-associated FasL was detected in these human colon cancer cells by fluorescence immunocytochemical staining. In addition, the expressed FasL was demonstrated to be functional, since coculture experiments using FasL-expressing SW480 cells resulted in apoptosis of Jurkat T leukemia cells that are sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis, and this process was specifically inhibited by the neutralizing anti-human FasL antibody. Thus, our findings and other data suggest an alternative mechanism that enables tumors to evade immune destruction by inducing apoptosis in activated T lymphocytes. Furthermore, constitutive expression of FasL in hepatic metastatic tumors suggests that FasL may also be important in their colonization in the liver through induction of apoptosis in the surrounding Fas-expressing hepatocytes.","['Shiraki, K', 'Tsuji, N', 'Shioda, T', 'Isselbacher, K J', 'Takahashi, H']","['Shiraki K', 'Tsuji N', 'Shioda T', 'Isselbacher KJ', 'Takahashi H']","['Gastrointestinal Unit and Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02114, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*immunology/pathology', '*Apoptosis', 'Colon', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'DNA Primers', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Intestinal Mucosa/immunology/pathology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Liver Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*secondary', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Models, Biological', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor']",1997/06/10 00:00,1997/06/10 00:01,['1997/06/10 00:00'],"['1997/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1997 Jun 10;94(12):6420-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.94.12.6420.,,"['CA57584/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIDDK43351/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",12,['10.1073/pnas.94.12.6420 [doi]'],,PMC21065,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe 28 patients (incidence 6.3%) with a median age of 39 years, 24 of whom were on remission induction and 4 on postremission chemotherapy. All patients had CVC and empiric antimicrobial therapy, 4 had been given prophylactic antifungal drugs, and 2 had parenteral nutrition. Neutropenia was profound (median leukocyte nadir 200/microliters, median duration 19 days). Candida was isolated in blood cultures 10 days (median) after the start of neutropenia.

DESIGN: Ten women were given 200 mg mifepristone and an additional 10 women 400 mg of onapristone 48 hours after the LH surge in urine (LH + 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Biopsies were assessed for histologic dating and the immunolocalization of [1] leukemia inhibitory factor, [2] 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase, and [3] the cell proliferation marker Ki 67. Hormonal measurements in blood and urine were used to monitor the effects on the ovarian cycle. Glycodelin (placental protein 14) concentrations were measured in blood taken on LH + 12. RESULT(S): Treatment with antiprogestins retarded the development of secretory changes without affecting the length of the luteal phase. In addition, there was reduced immunostaining for 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase within glands and a significant reduction in serum levels of glycodelin. Reduced immunostaining for leukemia inhibitory factor also was apparent within glands in biopsies taken on LH + 6 of the treatment cycle. Increased Ki 67 immunostaining was observed on both cycle days after treatment, consistent with P antagonism. CONCLUSION(S): Administration of mifepristone and onapristone adversely affects uterine receptivity.

The data presented demonstrate that, in both nonleukemic (rat Fao hepatoma cells) and human leukemia cells (MOLT-4, NALL-1, and BALL-1), AS mRNA levels, protein content, and enzymatic activity are induced after incubation in an otherwise complete tissue culture medium that is deficient in a single amino acid or in medium that has been depleted of the amino acid asparagine by the addition of asparaginase. Complete amino acid deprivation results in a concerted increase in AS mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity, which, in conjunction with previously published research, suggests that the mechanism of this cellular response involves transcriptional control of the AS gene. Asparaginase treatment is a standard component of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy for which the effectiveness is related to the inability of these cells to upregulate AS activity to a sufficient level. With regard to the asparaginase sensitivity of the three human leukemia cell lines, there was a trend toward an inverse relation to the degree of AS expression. Selection for asparaginase-resistant MOLT-4 sublines resulted in enhanced AS mRNA and protein content regardless of whether the cells had been selected by asparaginase treatment directly or asparagine was removed from the culture medium. Collectively, the data illustrate that further advances in asparaginase therapy will require additional knowledge of amino acid-dependent regulation of AS gene expression and, conversely, that asparaginase resistance represents a model system for investigating metabolite control in a clinically relevant setting.","['Hutson, R G', 'Kitoh, T', 'Moraga Amador, D A', 'Cosic, S', 'Schuster, S M', 'Kilberg, M S']","['Hutson RG', 'Kitoh T', 'Moraga Amador DA', 'Cosic S', 'Schuster SM', 'Kilberg MS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville 32610-0245, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/deficiency/metabolism/*physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Histidine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/metabolism', 'Leukemia/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1997 May;272(5 Pt 1):C1691-9. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1997.272.5.C1691.,,"['CA-28725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-28374/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",5 Pt 1,['10.1152/ajpcell.1997.272.5.C1691 [doi]'],['Am J Physiol. 1998 Apr;274(4 Pt 1):C1185-6.

Thus, lipoproteins may condition NK cytokine secretion and cell activation.","['De Sanctis, J B', 'Blanca, I', 'Bianco, N E']","['De Sanctis JB', 'Blanca I', 'Bianco NE']","['Institute of Immunology, Central University of Venezuela, Caracas, Venezuela.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology', 'Interleukins/biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lipoproteins/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1997 Apr;90(4):526-33. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1997.00174.x.,,,4,['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1997.00174.x [doi]'],,PMC1456702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of two cell-permeable ceramides, C2-ceramide and C6-ceramide, on human monocyte functions. After monocytes were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) for 18 hr in suspension culture, they produced a high amount of superoxide (O2-) when triggered by phorbol myristate acetate. C2- or C6-ceramide inhibited O2- release from monocytes primed with LPS (1 ng/ml) or IFN-gamma (100 U/ml), but did not affect unprimed monocytes. An analogue, C2-dihydroceramide, was inactive. C2-ceramide was most effective at 6 microM, and C6-ceramide at 60 microM. C2- or C6-ceramide at these concentrations was not toxic for monocytes, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion and by the 3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay which measures the ability of live cells to produce formazan. C2-ceramide (20 microM) had no effect on the killing of leukaemic cells (HL-60 and K562 cells) by monocytes treated with IFN-gamma, LPS, or both for 18 hr, with killing assessed by an 111 Indium-releasing assay. C2-ceramide (20 microM) induced secretion of low amounts of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) from the monocytes. But C2-ceramide did not alter the higher secretion of TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta from monocytes treated with IFN-gamma or LPS. Thus the cell-permeable ceramides acted like antagonists of LPS, rather than analogues of LPS, as has been proposed. The results here showed that the signal transduction pathway for O2- release by monocytes differed from that for the cytolysis of leukaemic cells, and confirmed that oxygen radicals are not involved in cytolysis.","['Nakabo, Y', 'Pabst, M J']","['Nakabo Y', 'Pabst MJ']","['Department of Oral Biology, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (N-acetylsphingosine)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '038753E78J (N-caproylsphingosine)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/*blood', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1997 Apr;90(4):477-82. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2567.1997.d01-2189.x.,,"['DE05474/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'DE11125/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",4,['10.1046/j.1365-2567.1997.d01-2189.x [doi]'],,PMC1456677,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although risk factors for the development of veno-occlusive disease have been postulated, there is no precise method for accurately identifying those patients who are at risk and for whom early intervention and treatment would have maximum potential benefit. Liver transplantation has been advocated as a treatment for veno-occlusive disease in selected patients. METHODS: In this report, we describe a patient who underwent liver transplantation for life-threatening veno-occlusive disease after autologous bone marrow transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. RESULTS: Liver engraftment was achieved, but the patient developed Pneumocystis pneumonia, which failed to respond to pentamidine. The patient died 6 months after liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: While acknowledging the limited experience of orthotropic liver transplantation in this patient population, we suggest its consideration as a feasible, potentially beneficial treatment option in patients with severe veno-occlusive disease after bone marrow transplantation.","['Norris, S', 'Crosbie, O', 'McEntee, G', 'Traynor, O', 'Nolan, N', 'McCann, S', 'Hegarty, J']","['Norris S', 'Crosbie O', 'McEntee G', 'Traynor O', 'Nolan N', 'McCann S', 'Hegarty J']","[""Department of Histopathology, St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin 4, Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/*etiology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', '*Liver Transplantation', 'Male', 'Thrombolytic Therapy']",1997/05/27 00:00,1997/05/27 00:01,['1997/05/27 00:00'],"['1997/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1997 May 27;63(10):1521-4. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199705270-00026.,,,10,['10.1097/00007890-199705270-00026 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A human LIM-HOX gene, namely hLH-2, was highly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and located on chromosome 9q33-34.1, in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the Bcr-Abl chimera of Philadelphia chromosome [Wu et al. (1996) Oncogene 12, 1205]. To elucidate the mechanism of hLH-2 transcriptional activation, we studied the methylation status of hLH-2 in normal bone marrow and CML cells. When blots containing genomic DNA digested with Hpa II or Msp I were hybridized with full-length cDNA probe, it was discovered that hLH-2 was methylated in normal bone marrow cells in which hLH-2 was not expressed; in contrast, both alleles of hLH-2 locus in CML cells were heavily hypomethylated. Furthermore, using the sensitive RT-PCR technique, we examined the expression of LH-2 in mouse x human hybrids and a wide array of mouse cell lines containing Abl or Bcr-Abl and failed to identify a consistent expression pattern in the cell lines tested. These results suggest that the transcriptional activation of hLH-2 in CML is likely due to a cis-acting effect, but not a trans-acting effect of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Because hypomethylated genes generally are transcribed more efficiently than hypermethylated genes, the high level of hLH-2 mRNA in CML cells probably is a consequence of the low level of methylation of the gene in the leukemic cells.","['Wu, H K', 'Minden, M D']","['Wu HK', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Medicine, Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LHX2 protein, human)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Lhx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA Methylation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/29 00:00,1997/05/29 00:01,['1997/05/29 00:00'],"['1997/05/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/29 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 May 29;234(3):742-7. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6592.,,,3,"['S0006-291X(97)96592-X [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6592 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their growth-inhibitory effects could not be related to their effects on cAMP levels. In addition, although PDE type III and IV inhibitors potentiated cAMP formation due to adenylycyclase activation, no potentiation could be observed when considering their antiproliferative effect. Separation and characterization of PDE of Dami cells revealed the existence of types III, IV, and V isoenzymes. The PDE inhibition found for the PDE inhibitors could not explain their antiproliferative effects. The lack of correlation with cAMP concentrations or PDE inhibition and the high concentrations needed to elicit antiproliferative effects suggest the implication of other parameters, such as cytotoxicity or lipophilicity, or other targets in addition to PDE for the PDE inhibitors tested. Lipophilicity did not seem to be of importance in antiproliferative effects. In contrast, cytotoxic effects, in particular those of trequinsin and MY-5445, could partially explain their negative action on cell growth.","['Zurbonsen, K', 'Michel, A', 'Vittet, D', 'Bonnet, P A', 'Chevillard, C']","['Zurbonsen K', 'Michel A', 'Vittet D', 'Bonnet PA', 'Chevillard C']","['INSERM U.300, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phthalazines)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrrolidinones)', '0 (Tetrahydroisoquinolines)', '29925-17-5 (4-(3-Butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone)', '739I2958C1 (trequinsin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'F8CSS73B6A (MY 5445)', 'JU9YAX04C7 (Milrinone)', 'K676NL63N7 (Rolipram)']",IM,"['4-(3-Butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone/pharmacology', 'Alprostadil', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Milrinone', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Phthalazines/pharmacology', 'Pyridones/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidinones/pharmacology', 'Rolipram', '*Tetrahydroisoquinolines', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",1997/04/25 00:00,1997/04/25 00:01,['1997/04/25 00:00'],"['1997/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/25 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1997 Apr 25;53(8):1141-7. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(96)00822-2.,,,8,"['S0006-2952(96)00822-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(96)00822-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a transgenic mouse system employing a lambda shuttle vector allowing mutations (in the lacI gene) to be analysed in vitro, we have investigated the possibility that preconceptional paternal irradiation can lead to such transgenerational transmission of genomic instability. We have examined the mutation frequencies in vector recovered from the bone-marrow cells of the F1 offspring of male parents exposed to doses of gamma-rays of 0.1-4 Gy. Our results show that as parental dose increases there is a trend towards higher mutation frequency in vector recovered from the DNA of bone-marrow of F1 progeny. At 4 Gy the frequency of mutations was increased by a factor of approximately two (control mutation frequency, 2.39 x 10(-5); mutation frequency in offspring of 4 Gy male group, 4.26 x 10(-5); P < 0.001). We were unable to confirm reports of spermatogenesis stage sensitivity. The 2-fold increase in mutation frequency was evident in offspring derived from stored spermatozoa (irradiated transgenic males mated with unirradiated non-transgenic females 1-7 days after irradiation). Our data indicates that there exists a route for transgenerational transmission of factor(s) leading to genomic instability in F1 progeny, resulting from preconceptional paternal irradiation.","['Luke, G A', 'Riches, A C', 'Bryant, P E']","['Luke GA', 'Riches AC', 'Bryant PE']","['School of Biological and Medical Sciences, University of St Andrews, Fife, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic System/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/genetics', 'Paternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Spermatogenesis/genetics/radiation effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1997 May;12(3):147-52. doi: 10.1093/mutage/12.3.147.,,,3,['10.1093/mutage/12.3.147 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the clinical use of rhGM-CSF in patients affected by lymphoid malignancies is widely accepted, its utility and safety in the management of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is still controversial. The three main schedules adopted for clinical application of GM-CSF in AML are as follows: A) post-chemotherapy, in order to shorten the duration of neutropenia and/or monocytopenia; B) prechemotherapy to recruit blast cells into active cell cycle phases, and to increase their sensitivity to cell cycle-dependent cytotoxic drugs; C) as a mobilizing agent to induce the release of progenitor cells from bone marrow into circulation (peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation-PBPC). The objective of this paper is to analyze the potential clinical applications of rhGM-CSF in AML. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The material examined in the present review includes several personal papers in this field and articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index. STATE OF THE ART: Based on current knowledge, it may be argued that rhGM-CSF should be used only in a subset of AML patients at high risk of infection mortality, including elderly subjects, and/or in those AML patients who relapse or are resistant to induction treatment. However, the risk of stimulating the leukemic clone following GM-CSF therapy should be kept in mind when using this growth factor in the clinical setting, even though the great majority of the reported papers on this subject have shown that GM-CSF therapy does not affect relapse rates, frequency of remissions or patient life expectancy. PERSPECTIVES: It is likely that new data from controlled clinical trials will clarify the therapeutic role of GM-CSF in myeloid-derived malignancies, allowing the establishment of consensus guidelines for its use.","['Lanza, F', 'Rigolin, G M', 'Castagnari, B', 'Moretti, S', 'Castoldi, G']","['Lanza F', 'Rigolin GM', 'Castagnari B', 'Moretti S', 'Castoldi G']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Advanced Therapies, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):239-45.,60,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GEIL (Groupe d'Etude Immunologique des Leucemies).,205-10,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: CD10, initially known as cALLA, was identified as one of the earliest markers expressed by leukemic cells of the lymphoblastic lineage. This review summarizes what has been discovered about this ubiquitous molecule since anti-cALLA antibodies allowed its detection on leukemic cells. It also attempts to specify the selectivity of CD10 in acute leukemias as a subclassification or prognostic tool. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The material used for this review includes articles identified as relevant through a meta-analysis in the Medline database, as well as personal publications or data issued within the French Study Group on the Immunology of Leukemias (GEIL). STATE OF ART: CD10 now stands as much more than a mere leukemic marker. It belongs to a rather large family of exopeptidases expressed in a variety of tissues and mostly involved in the activation or deactivation of peptides through the removal of terminal amino acids. CD10 expression on leukemic cells remains a useful subclassification tool for B-lineage leukemias, but it can also be found on other types of leukemic cells. PERSPECTIVES: Much remains to be discovered regarding the physiological role of CD10 during the maturation of normal B-lineage lymphocytes and about its functions-or lack of activity-on leukemic cells. It could also provide a valuable tool for further dissecting B-lineage leukemias when the quantitative aspect of its expression on blast cells is taken into account.","['Bene, M C', 'Faure, G C']","['Bene MC', 'Faure GC']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, Faculte de Medecine, CHU de Nancy, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France. bene@grip.u-nancy.fr""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Neprilysin/*immunology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):205-10.,49,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, the common manifestations include peripheral blood cytopenias of one or more lineages and a normal to hyperplastic marrow. MDS has been defined on the basis of morphological criteria, namely the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow, by the French-American-British study group. Scoring systems have been developed to include such factors as hemoglobin, leukocyte count and age in the evaluation of MDS prognosis. Although useful in the prediction of clinical course and design of therapy regimens, our understanding of the basis of MDS has come from recent advances in molecular analysis of these disorders. This review describes some of the established and recent contributions to our understanding of the molecular basis of the myelodysplastic syndromes. EVIDENCE AND INFORMATION SOURCES: The authors of the present review have been working in the field of myelodysplastic syndromes for several years and have contributed original papers on the molecular pathogenesis of these disorders. In addition, in the present review they have critically examined articles and abstracts published in journals covered by the Science Citation Index and Medline. STATE OF ART AND PERSPECTIVES: Cytogenetic anomalies and proto-oncogene abnormalities point to new understanding of the pathogenesis of MDS as a sequence of DNA lesions leading to the evolution of the pre-malignant clone. The prognostic significance of these factors in predicting leukemic transformation and survival remains controversial. Characterization of MDS cells in vitro in response to combinations of exogenous growth factors have not only provided valuable information regarding ineffective hematopoiesis in MDS but have provided a new insight into treatment of MDS. One major development in our understanding of MDS is the possible explanation for the apparent paradox of a cellular marrow in combination with peripheral cytopenias. Extensive premature programmed cell death or apoptosis has been reported to be at least partly responsible. It will remain to be seen whether this fundamental characteristic of myelodysplastic hematopoiesis will play a central role in the drug or genetic based therapy in the myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Gallagher, A', 'Darley, R L', 'Padua, R']","['Gallagher A', 'Darley RL', 'Padua R']","['Leukemia Research Fund Preleukemia Unit, University of Wales, College of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):191-204.,202,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When it persists, it raises the question of whether this disorder is an early manifestation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). If it is accompanied by bone marrow infiltration, it can be safely considered as a sign of CLL. The aim of this study was to analyze retrospectively the usefulness of immunophenotyping and immunogenotyping for early detection of lymphocyte clonality in ambiguous cases of lymphocytosis without bone marrow infiltration. Twenty-six healthy individuals, 47 to 77 years old, with an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) at the ""onset"" of the disorder between 4 x 10(9)/L and 9 x 10(9)/L, without marrow infiltration, were studied and followed for a period of 31 to 51 months. CD19, CD20, CD5, CD2, CD4, CD8 surface markers and amplification of the Ig heavy chain CDR-3 locus were used for immunophenotypic and genotypic analysis, respectively. Our studies indicate that immunophenotyping alone is sufficient and superior to CDR-3 locus amplification for the early detection of lymphocyte clonality in peripheral blood. Furthermore, the high frequency of CLL development in individuals with established monoclonality strongly suggests that patients with mild borderline lymphocytosis, even without bone marrow infiltration, have to be followed for progression to CLL and its possible complications.","['Ritis, K', 'Tsironidou, V', 'Martinis, G', 'Kartalis, G', 'Sideras, P', 'Bourikas, G']","['Ritis K', 'Tsironidou V', 'Martinis G', 'Kartalis G', 'Sideras P', 'Bourikas G']","['Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocytosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):184-6.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, identifying whether the hematopoietic stem cells are of donor or recipient origin may be a difficult task. DNA studies using Southern blotting techniques or the amplification by PCR of regions in the human genome with high polymorphic neutral sequence variation showing Mendelian inheritance as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) can detect the origin of host bone marrow after BMT. We have tried to apply these sensitive systems of detection to the early stages of BMT when small numbers of regenerated cells are available for analysis. METHODS: We used in vitro polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of three single-locus simple repetitive DNA sequences, all of which vary extensively in their repeat number among different individuals (VNTR D1S80, ApoB, and D17S5), to evaluate post transplant engraftment in six patients who showed no signs of peripheral blood engraftment at 2-3 weeks after transplant. We tested 2 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), 2 with B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), 1 with T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), and 1 with aplastic anemia (SAA), all in prolonged aplasia following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). RESULTS: In a sequential analysis protocol with the different loci, the donor was distinguishable from the recipient in all pairs with at least one of the three markers used. After 16 days (median 16.2; range 15 to 20 days) we found that complete chimerism was present in 5 patients: 4 of donor origin (= engraftment) and one of host origin (= rejection), this last case being one of mixed chimerism. In the 2 cases in which the presence (one complete and one partial) of host DNA was detected, rejection of the donor bone marrow followed, and in 1 patient a second BMT was necessary. The other 4 patients with complete chimerism of donor origin achieved hematological reconstitution and we documented complete engraftment of donor bone marrow a few months later. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing PCR to document early post-transplant engraftment and chimerism in the first month after BMT has the advantage over Southern blotting of being more sensitive and requiring small amounts of sample. It may also be useful for guiding subsequent therapeutic decisions.","['Martinelli, G', 'Trabetti, E', 'Farabegoli, P', 'Testoni, N', 'Bandini, G', 'Motta, M R', 'Vittone, A', 'Terragna, C', 'Pignatti, P F', 'Tura, S']","['Martinelli G', 'Trabetti E', 'Farabegoli P', 'Testoni N', 'Bandini G', 'Motta MR', 'Vittone A', 'Terragna C', 'Pignatti PF', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Medical Oncology Seragnoli, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'DNA/*analysis/genetics', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):156-60.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We report follow-up data on 44 HCL patients who underwent alpha-IFN as first-line treatment between 1985 and 1990.

Of the 44 patients, 8 achieved a CR, 28 a PR and 8 a MR, with an overall response rate of 82%. Thirty-eight (86%) of these patients showed disease progression and were retreated with alpha-IFN (2 pts), 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (35 pts), or pentostatin (1 pt). So far, all 38 patients are alive and in good unmaintained second response, except for two patients who developed a second neoplasm. RESULTS: Six of the 8 first complete responders are alive and have not required further treatment after completing alpha-IFN. These long responders most often (5/6) presented a hairy cell index (HCI) < 0.50 at diagnosis; all 6 registered a significant reduction in bone marrow infiltration (HCI < 0.10) after induction therapy and underwent alpha-IFN maintenance treatment. These three parameters turned out to be statistically significant when the long-term responders were compared with the failure patients subset (p = 0.003 for HCI at diagnosis; p = 0.001 for HCI at the end of the induction phase; p = 0.003 for the maintenance phase). The median progression-free survival of these 6 long-term responders was 75 months (range, 62 to 78). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, alpha-IFN represents an excellent palliative treatment for most HCL patients. A small subset of these patients could become long-term responders following first-line alpha-IFN therapy alone.","['Zinzani, P L', 'Lauria, F', 'Salvucci, M', 'Rondelli, D', 'Raspadori, D', 'Bendandi, M', 'Magagnoli, M', 'Tura, S']","['Zinzani PL', 'Lauria F', 'Salvucci M', 'Rondelli D', 'Raspadori D', 'Bendandi M', 'Magagnoli M', 'Tura S']","['Institute of Hematology and Oncology Seragnoli University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (Interferon-alpha)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):152-5.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results of a multivariate survival analysis.,148-51,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although less specific than sCD23, sCD54 levels have clinico-prognostic relevance in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Since serological markers are now emerging as potentially important in CLL, we tried to verify whether sCD54 might complement clinical stages. METHODS: Serum levels of sCD54 were determined at the time of diagnosis in 115 previously untreated CLL patients. Results were correlated with clinicobiological parameters as well as with survival. RESULTS: Life-expectancy was significantly shorter in patients with higher serum levels of sCD54 (p < 0.001); however, in a Cox's multivariate survival analysis, the only variables which entered the regression model at a significant level were bone marrow (BM) histology (p = 0.03) and lymphocyte doubling time (LDT) (p = 0.04). Interestingly, when LDT was excluded from analysis the only significant variables were clinical stages (p < 0.05) and sCD54 (p < 0.05). These results suggest that sCD54 and LDT give similar prognostic information. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: In CLL, sCD54 is a reliable prognostic parameter whose value is independent of clinical stages. When investigated in relation to clinical outcome, serum levels of sCD54 were able to predict progression to a more advanced clinical stage. On the basis of these data, an integrated clinico-biological classification which separates intermediate risk into two prognostic subgroups is proposed.","['Molica, S', 'Levato, D', ""Dell' Olio, M"", 'Cascavilla, N', 'Matera, R', 'Minervini, M', 'Dattilo, A', 'Carotenuto, M', 'Musto, P']","['Molica S', 'Levato D', ""Dell' Olio M"", 'Cascavilla N', 'Matera R', 'Minervini M', 'Dattilo A', 'Carotenuto M', 'Musto P']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Aged', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):148-51.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pgp overexpression is negatively related to treatment response. Alternative drugs may be required to overcome the MDR problem. METHODS: Arabinosylcytosine (ara-C) and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoro-adenine monophosphate (fludarabine, F-ara) were tested alone and in combination in four pairs of leukemia and tumor non-MDR and MDR cell lines. Toxicity was assayed by growth inhibition with the microcultured MTT assay. RESULTS: MDR cells were more sensitive than or as sensitive as non-MDR cells to ara-C and to F-ara alone. The resistance index to ara-C was decreased upon pre-exposure of the MDR cells to low-dose F-ara (10 ng/mL), showing that the combination of ara-C and F-ara was more active on MDR cells than on non-MDR parental ones. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Neither sensitivity to ara-C nor sensitivity to F-ara was influenced by Pgp overexpression. These data provide a rationale for more extensive and more intensive testing of combinations of ara-C and F-ara in Pgp-mediated MDR acute leukemia. In relapsed/resistant and in secondary acute leukemias, increasing the dose of ara-C and combining ara-C with F-ara might be more rewarding than administering anthracyclines or other Pgp-processable compounds.","['Michelutti, A', 'Michieli, M', 'Damiani, D', 'Melli, C', 'Ermacora, A', 'Grimaz, S', 'Candoni, A', 'Russo, D', 'Fanin, R', 'Baccarani, M']","['Michelutti A', 'Michieli M', 'Damiani D', 'Melli C', 'Ermacora A', 'Grimaz S', 'Candoni A', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R', 'Baccarani M']","['Department of Clinical and Morphological Research, University Hospital, Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Mar-Apr;82(2):143-7.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of malignant lymphoma was suspected by cytology and then confirmed by TCR beta chain (TCR beta) gene rearrangement. The rearrangement of TCR beta gene revealed by Southern blot technique implied a T-monoclonal lymphoid population which is most likely malignant. Immunophenotypic studies revealed expression of TdT and T cell antigens indicating a T lymphoblastic lymphoma. As shown in this case, antigen receptor gene analysis can be conducted with a much smaller number of cells to identify a malignant clone among a heterogeneous cell population.","['Change, K E', 'Liu, J H', 'Lin, S H', 'Zhau, S Z', 'Chen, P M']","['Change KE', 'Liu JH', 'Lin SH', 'Zhau SZ', 'Chen PM']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans General Hospital-Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei),Zhonghua yi xue za zhi = Chinese medical journal; Free China ed,0005327,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Za Zhi (Taipei). 1997 Feb;59(2):132-5.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional systems for assaying the activity of reverse transcriptase enzymes have relied upon the use of radioactive nucleotides for monitoring complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. Moreover, such assays have also typically been programmed by the addition of synthetic template-primers. The recent trend, however, is towards the use of more natural nucleic acid template-primer-directed systems, which provides for a more realistic estimation of the activity of potential therapeutic anti-reverse transcriptase agents. A novel agarose gel-electrophoretic method originally developed to evaluate DNA polymerase activity during enzyme purification was adapted for screening purposes. The system was modified so that one can detect the synthesis of non-radioactively labeled cDNA synthesized in both DNA and RNA template-directed reverse transcription reactions. Such assays are programmed with either M13mp9 single-stranded DNA or rabbit globin mRNA as appropriate templates. Following incubation of reaction mixtures, agarose gels are used to determine the activity of the DNA-dependent DNA polymerase and RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities of Maloney murine leukemia virus. This is done through a detection of the amount of double-stranded nucleic acid molecules (either DNA:DNA or RNA:DNA hybrids) generated by the enzyme in the presence and absence of various known enzyme inhibitors. The assay systems that have been developed will be useful in initial, general, rapid, inexpensive and safer screening programs for potential inhibitors of both the DNA- and RNA-dependent DNA-polymerase functions of reverse transcriptase enzymes. The system was tested and evaluated with potent inhibitors of reverse transcription, such as aurintricarboxylic acid and with several plant flavonoids known to be moderately potent inhibitors of reverse transcriptases. The details concerning the RNA-dependent DNA polymerizing system and some of our results are presented.","['Spedding, G']",['Spedding G'],"['Department of Chemistry, Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana 46208, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Mol Recognit,Journal of molecular recognition : JMR,9004580,"['0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '4431-00-9 (Aurintricarboxylic Acid)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aurintricarboxylic Acid/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Mice', 'Plants/chemistry', 'RNA', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Rabbits', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Templates, Genetic']",1996/09/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/09/01 00:00'],"['1996/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Recognit. 1996 Sep-Dec;9(5-6):499-502. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1099-1352(199634/12)9:5/6<499::aid-jmr291>3.0.co;2-y.,,,5-6,"['10.1002/(SICI)1099-1352(199634/12)9:5/6<499::AID-JMR291>3.0.CO;2-Y [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1099-1352(199634/12)9:5/6<499::aid-jmr291>3.0.co;2-y [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The BCR/ABL oncogene is generated from the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) translocation, t(9;22)(q34;q11), and creates a constitutively active tyrosine kinase. There is clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells of several different lineages in CML. CML patients in stable phase usually have high white blood counts and immature cells of granulocytic lineages. Stable phase CML evolves to a more aggressive phase typically within 3.5-5 years, where differentiation is blocked and acute leukemia ensues. The transition of CML stable phase to blast phase is reflected in the loss of growth factor requirement of CML cells and correlates with additional cytogenetic alterations. Some biological effects reported in primary CML cells include reduced apoptosis and altered adhesion to fibronectin; however, the cells are dependent on hematopoietic growth factors. On a molecular level, the BCR/ABL translocation is well characterized. However, the actual mechanism of transformation by the BCR/ABL oncogene of hematopoietic cells is largely unknown. Enhancement of the c-ABL tyrosine kinase activity in BCR/ABL appears to be crucial for transformation. This tyrosine kinase activity leads to activation of several signal transduction pathways that are also utilized by hematopoietic growth factors, including steel factor, thrombopoietin, interleukin-3, and granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor. In several model systems, BCR/ABL has overlapping biological effects with hematopoietic growth factors, and transformation of hematopoietic growth factor-dependent cell lines leads to growth factor independence. In this review, we will describe the molecular and biological abnormalities in CML and several signal transduction mechanisms utilized by BCR/ABL as compared to hematopoietic growth factors.","['Sattler, M', 'Salgia, R']","['Sattler M', 'Salgia R']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

Recently, oligonucleotide-primed in situ synthesis (PRINS) has become established as a method of labelling centromeric regions of chromosomes in metaphase spreads. We tested the suitability of PRINS in detecting the exact copy number of chromosomes 1, 3, 7 and 8 in intact interphase cells of 17 cytological preparations derived from normal and neoplastic tissues. Control procedures consisted in preparation of metaphase spreads of lymphocytes of healthy donors, conventional cytogenetics in some of the specimens, and omission of the primers or Taq polymerase from the reaction mixture. All specimens were additionally examined by FISH and analysed blind by two experienced observers. Both PRINS and FISH revealed a corresponding distribution of hybridization signals for all chromosomes examined in specimens of normal bone marrow (n = 5), normal liver cells (n = 5), three samples of acute nonlymphocytic leukaemia in which conventional chromosome analyses had shown monosomy 7 or trisomy 8, and in four hepatocellular carcinomas that displayed trisomy 1. Overall, statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in the signal distribution between the two techniques. Our results demonstrate that PRINS is as reliable as FISH for detecting chromosome copy numbers in interphase nuclei of intact cells. The PRINS method, however, is easier to perform, faster and less expensive, holding great potential for future applications in diagnostic pathology.","['Werner, M', 'Wilkens, L', 'Nasarek, A', 'Tchinda, J', 'Komminoth, P']","['Werner M', 'Wilkens L', 'Nasarek A', 'Tchinda J', 'Komminoth P']","['Institute of Pathology, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,['0 (DNA Primers)'],IM,"['Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'DNA Primers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', '*Interphase', '*Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Liver/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Trisomy']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virchows Arch. 1997 May;430(5):381-7. doi: 10.1007/s004280050047.,,,5,['10.1007/s004280050047 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced CD43 expression was accompanied by a strong increase in anti-CD43-mediated, LFA-1-dependent homotypic aggregation of HMC-1 cells, demonstrating that newly synthesized CD43 is functionally active in transmitting signals across the plasma membrane which result in enhanced cellular adhesion. CD43 expression was also enhanced in response to retinoic acids on isolated human skin mast cells and human monocytes, but not on cells of the basophilic cell line KU-812 and promyelocytic HL-60 cells, indicating that these agents might act in a cell-type specific manner.

Immunophenotyping of BM and peripheral blood (PB) cells revealed a CD34+/ CD13+/CD33-/CD19-blast cell population and a CD19+/CD5+ B-cell population with kappa light chain restriction. Molecular analysis of PB and BM demonstrated the presence of an immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangement by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of genomic DNA with three different pairs of consensus primers. Cell-sorting experiments showed that the IgH gene rearrangement was present only in the CD19+/CD34- B-cell population, but not in the CD34+/CD19- blast cells.

These potential mechanisms were explored in cells that expressed alpha(2A)AR endogenously (HEL cells), permanently transfected CHO cells, and transiently transfected COS-7 cells. Each cell type displayed agonist (UK14304)-dependent increases in [Ca2+]i that were blocked by yohimbine, ablated by pertussis toxin, and largely unaffected by chelation of extracellular calcium. Furthermore, calcium release was associated with IP3 accumulation and was blocked by an inhibitor of phospholipase C (PLC). When expressed in CHO cells, a mutated alpha(2A)AR which has the amino and carboxyl termini of the third intracellular loop substituted with beta 2AR sequence poorly coupled to Gi in adenylyl cyclase assays, and likewise displayed virtually no coupling to increased [Ca2+]i. These results all point toward a Gi- versus a Gq-mediated coupling pathway triggering release of intracellular calcium stores. The possibility that G(beta gamma) subunits released from alpha(2A)AR-Gi coupling is the mechanism of PLC activation was explored in COS-7 cells by coexpressing alpha(2A)AR with the G(beta gamma) inhibitors transducin or a carboxy-terminal portion of the beta AR kinase. Both beta gamma inhibitors markedly inhibited alpha(2A)AR modulation of [Ca2+]i while not affecting thromboxane A2 receptor mediated stimulation of [Ca2+]i via Gq coupling. Thus, alpha(2A)AR couple to calcium release via Gi-associated G(beta gamma) subunits. This coupling is present in multiple cell types and should be considered a major signal transduction pathway of this receptor.","['Dorn, G W 2nd', 'Oswald, K J', 'McCluskey, T S', 'Kuhel, D G', 'Liggett, S B']","['Dorn GW 2nd', 'Oswald KJ', 'McCluskey TS', 'Kuhel DG', 'Liggett SB']","['Division of Cardiology, University of Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0564, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Calcium/*metabolism/physiology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2/*physiology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/physiology']",1997/05/27 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/05/27 00:00'],"['1997/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1997 May 27;36(21):6415-23. doi: 10.1021/bi970080s.,,"['HL41496/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49267/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53436/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",21,"['10.1021/bi970080s [doi]', 'bi970080s [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme is subject to inhibition by purine nucleoside 5'-monophosphates (AMP, IMP, and GMP), by dihydrofolate polyglutamates, and by the antifolate piritrexim [Sant, M. E., Lyons, S. D., Phillips, L., & Christopherson, R. I. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 11038-11045). Using a coupled radioassay, we have determined the substrate dissociation constants as 80.4 +/- 13.2 microM for 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP) and 421 +/- 193 microM for L-glutamine with P-Rib-PP bound first with positive cooperativity for interaction with a second site on the catalytically active dimer (interaction factor of 0.247 +/- 0.042). Analysis of inhibition patterns for amido PRTase shows that the antifolate piritrexim is a noncompetitive inhibitor bound with positive cooperativity at two allosteric sites of an inactive dimer with a dissociation constant of 66.0 +/- 17.8 microM for interaction with the free enzyme and an interaction factor of 0.187 +/- 0.113 with P-Rib-PP as the varied substrate. With L-glutamine as the varied substrate, a dissociation constant of 62.3 +/- 15.6 microM for interaction with the enzyme-P-Rib-PP complex and an interaction factor of 0.0958 +/- 0.0585 microM were obtained. AMP binds as a competitive inhibitor with respect to P-Rib-PP with a dissociation constant of 40.0 +/- 8.1 microM for interaction with the free enzyme and as a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to L-glutamine with a dissociation constant of 16.4 +/- 5.2 mM for interaction with the enzyme-P-Rib-PP complex. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of partially purified amido PRTase showed three molecular forms of the enzyme: an inactive tetramer (10.2 S) formed in the presence of AMP, an active dimer (6.7 S) formed with P-Rib-PP, and an inactive dimer (7.2 S) with piritrexim. The latter species may predominate in cells containing high levels of dihydrofolate polyglutamates.","['Schoettle, S L', 'Crisp, L B', 'Szabados, E', 'Christopherson, R I']","['Schoettle SL', 'Crisp LB', 'Szabados E', 'Christopherson RI']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.14 (Amidophosphoribosyltransferase)', 'MK2A783ZUT (piritrexim)']",IM,"['Adenosine Monophosphate/*pharmacology', 'Amidophosphoribosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Substrate Specificity']",1997/05/27 00:00,1997/05/27 00:01,['1997/05/27 00:00'],"['1997/05/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/27 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1997 May 27;36(21):6377-83. doi: 10.1021/bi962598m.,,,21,"['10.1021/bi962598m [doi]', 'bi962598m [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PBMCs isolated from the blood of healthy volunteers were stimulated by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (10 microg/ml) for 72 h. Stimulated PBMCs (3 x 10(6) cells/plate) were then incubated with [3H]d4T (0.65 microCi; 3 microM) and either acyclovir, dapsone, ddC, ddI, fluconazole, foscarnet, ganciclovir, itraconazole, lobucavir, ranitidine, ribavirin, rifampin, sorivudine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, lamivudine (3TC), zidovudine, or thymidine (30 and 300 microM) for 24 h. Doxorubicin and drugs showing some evidence of inhibition were also studied at 0.3 and 3 microM. Cells were extracted overnight with 60% methanol prior to analysis by radiometric high-performance liquid chromatography. Additional data for nine of the drugs were obtained by incubation with [3H]d4T in U937 cells for 24 h. The effect of d4T (0.2 to 20 microM) on zidovudine (0.65 microCi; 0.018 microCi) phosphorylation was also studied. Zidovudine significantly reduced d4T total phosphates in PBMCs and U937 cells (in PBMCs to 33% [P < 0.001] and 17% [P < 0.001] of that in control cells at 3 and 30 microM, respectively). A small reduction in zidovudine phosphorylation was seen with d4T but only at d4T:zidovudine ratios of 100 and 1,000. Of the other compounds screened, only thymidine, ribavirin, and doxorubicin produced inhibition of d4T phosphorylation in both PBMCs and U937 cells. However, doxorubicin was cytotoxic at 3 microM. The decrease in d4T phosphorylation in the presence of ribavirin is consistent with previous findings with zidovudine. Although ddC significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of d4T in PBMCs, this was not seen in U937 cells, and it is probable that the findings in PBMCs are related to mitochondrial toxicity [based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide cytotoxicity assay].

DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiological study based on cancer registry data. SETTING: Comprehensive Cancer Centre Amsterdam. The Netherlands. METHODS: Using noise levels expressed as Kosten-cenheden (Ke) of the air traffic around Schiphol (Amsterdam International Airport) as well as 4-digit postal code areas, two study areas were defined, a central area and an adjacent zone. All cancer cases diagnosed in 1988-1993 in the study areas were selected from the population-based Amsterdam Cancer Registry. Observed numbers of cancer cases were compared with expected numbers on the basis of national and regional cancer incidence rates. RESULTS: Cancer incidence (4535 cases) in 1988-1993 in the Schiphol region was slightly higher than national incidence rates (observed/expected (O/E) ratio: 1.93; 95% confidence interval; 1.00-1.06) and almost equal to regional rates. This was largely due to relatively high rates for breast (O/E ratio: 1.08) and prostate (O/E ratio: 1.11) cancer in the Schiphol region as well as in the total area covered by the Amsterdam Cancer Registry. In addition, leukaemia, lymphoma/multiple myeloma and bladder cancer were more frequent, the last-named especially in males. The incidence of cancer of the respiratory tract was not the same in the central area and the adjacent zone. As compared with national rates, it was increased in the central area (O/E ratio: 1.19), while it was decreased in the adjacent zone (O/E ratio: 0.86). The incidence of cancer of all sites (O/E ratio: 1.10) was also increased in the central area, largely due to smoking related cancers. CONCLUSION: During 1988-1993, cancer incidence in the area surrounding Schiphol was a little higher than the national incidence rates and almost equal to the regional incidence. We could not demonstrate an association between air traffic and increased cancer risk. It is most likely that the differences for certain types of cancer as well as those between the two study areas were due to differences in lifestyle, such as smoking habits.","['Visser, O', 'van Wijnen, J H', 'Benraadt, J', 'van Leeuwen, F E']","['Visser O', 'van Wijnen JH', 'Benraadt J', 'van Leeuwen FE']",['Integraal Kanker Centrum Amsterdam.'],['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd,Nederlands tijdschrift voor geneeskunde,0400770,['0 (Air Pollutants)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Air Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Aircraft', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Registries']",1997/03/08 00:00,1997/03/08 00:01,['1997/03/08 00:00'],"['1997/03/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1997 Mar 8;141(10):468-73.,,,10,,"['Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd. 1997 May 24;141(21):1071-2.

Many attempts have thus been made to identify new drugs that could be active in these diseases. We wanted to evaluate whether gemcitabine (dFdC), a pyrimidine analogue widely employed in lung cancer chemotherapy, was able to block in vitro proliferation of bcr/abl-positive and bcr/abl-negative blast cells in primary culture. We already showed that gemcitabine is active in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of HL60 cells. METHODS: We studied the influence of dFdC on the proliferative potential of blasts by means of tritiated thymidine uptake, colony formation in semisolid medium and cell cycle parameters at flow cytometry. The efficacy of dFdC in inducing apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry (A0 peak) and by DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that dFdC already inhibits tritiated thymidine uptake at doses of 10 microM after 72 hours of culture, and that this effect is dose dependent. The addition of Ara-C 5 microM in the culture medium of dFdC provoked a synergistic inhibitory effect. Consistent results were obtained when cell cycle distribution was studied. In fact, cell incubation in the presence of dFdC resulted in a significant decrease of cells in S phase, although with a certain heterogeneity among cases. The antileukemic activity of dFdC appeared to be specific since it was mediated through apoptosis. We could demonstrate the appearance of the pre-G1 apoptotic peak at cytofluorimetric analysis, and the characteristic DNA fragmentation pattern at agarose electrophoresis in all 10 cases after treatment with different doses of dFdC. Induction of apoptosis was maximal for the highest doses of dFdC (100 mM) and for the combination of dFdC and Ara-C. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Following incubation with Gemcitabine leukemic blasts from chronic myeloproliferative disorders are induced to accumulate intracytoplasmatic and nuclear Ara-C and undergo apoptosis. These observations suggest that gemcitabine could be considered a candidate drug, capable of being used in polychemotherapy of refractory acute phase chronic myeloproliferative disorders.","['Santini, V', 'Bernabei, A', 'Gozzini, A', 'Scappini, B', 'Zoccolante, A', ""D'Ippolito, G"", 'Figuccia, M', 'Ferrini, P R']","['Santini V', 'Bernabei A', 'Gozzini A', 'Scappini B', 'Zoccolante A', ""D'Ippolito G"", 'Figuccia M', 'Ferrini PR']","['Department of Hematology, University of Florence-Azienda Ospedaliera Careggi, Firenze, Italy. santini@cesit1.unfi.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*pathology', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1997 Jan-Feb;82(1):11-5.,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(9;22), t(4;11) and t(1;19) which are most commonly found in adult ALL with a B-precursor phenotype were molecularly analyzed by similar RT-PCR based protocols. BCR-ABL transcripts generated by the t(9;22) translocation were demonstrated in 36 patients (25%) and were restricted to the 109 patients with B precursor ALL (33% of this group). Of 83 patients showing a, common phenotype (CD10+), 34 were BCR-ABL positive (41%) whereas only 2 out of 26 with Null ALL (HLADr+, CD19+, CD10) were positive. Interestingly, the percent of BCR-ABL positive CD1O+ ALL increases significantly with age being 20% in patients less than 30 years old and more than 50% in older patients. None of the T-ALL (24 patients) and B-ALL (8 patients) were positive. The majority of cases (67%) showed the p190 gene subtype. The cytogenetic diagnosis of Philadelphia chromosome was always confirmed by the molecular analysis and this approach allowed for the detection of the presence of the BCR-ABL rearrangement in 26 patients when a negative result or no metaphases were obtained. The complete remission rate was similar among BCR-ABL positive and negative patients but a shorter remission duration was observed in those showing molecular evidence of t(9;22) and this finding was significantly evident in CD1O+ ALL patients. By means of comparison, in most of the same adult ALL patients, we analyzed the yet unrecognized prevalence of the t(4;11) and t(1;19) translocations by the molecular analysis of their chromosomal breakpoints. Rearrangements of the ALL-1 gene on 11q23 band and ALL- l1AF.4 fusion transcripts specific for the t(4;11) were demonstrated in 7 out of the 21 Null ALL investigated, with no additional positive cases found among the other ALL subgroups. Overall the clinical behavior of t(4; 11) positive patients was dismal with a very short CR duration. Chimeric E2A-PBX1 transcripts generated by the t(1;19) were found in only two of the 87 B-precursor ALL analyzed.

However, its affinity for hyaluronan is not constitutive, since it depends on the cell type, the stage of differentiation and on activation by external stimuli including certain anti-CD44 antibodies and phorbol esters. Except for a few lymphoid cell lines, hematopoietic cells do not spontaneously bind hyaluronan and initial studies reported that, contrary to lymphocytes, myeloid cells could not be activated to bind hyaluronan. Because CD44 plays an important role in the initial phases of hematopoiesis, as shown by experiments using blocking anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies, its capacity to mediate adhesion of primitive myeloid cells has been investigated. It was found that CD44 could mediate spontaneous adhesion to hyaluronan of immature myeloid cell lines KG1, KG1a, and TF1, which serve as a model for hematopoietic progenitors. However, despite expressing high amounts of CD44, no more than 15% of bone marrow progenitors could adhere to hyaluronan. Recent experiments have shown that a very important feature of CD44 is its capacity to be rapidly activated by certain antibodies and cytokines (GM-CSF and KL) from a low affinity to a high affinity state for hyaluronan. These data shed light on striking similarities in the functional regulation of CD44 and of the two integrin receptors VLA-4 (a4b1), and VLA-5 (a5b1), which are also expressed on hematopoietic progenitors. The relevance of these data to the regulation of normal hematopoiesis and mobilization of CD34+ progenitors in the view of cell grafting is analyzed. In addition, we show that in idiopathic myelofibrosis, the amount of hyaluronan is markedly increased in the extracellular matrix from the myeloproliferative spleen. Considering that the production of cytokines is enhanced in this disease, we discuss whether CD44-hyaluronan interaction may have a role in the pathophysiology of this myeloproliferative syndrome.","['Smadja-Joffe, F', 'Legras, S', 'Girard, N', 'Li, Y', 'Delpech, B', 'Bloget, F', 'Morimoto, K', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles, C', 'Clay, D', 'Jasmin, C', 'Levesque, J P']","['Smadja-Joffe F', 'Legras S', 'Girard N', 'Li Y', 'Delpech B', 'Bloget F', 'Morimoto K', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles C', 'Clay D', 'Jasmin C', 'Levesque JP']","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Appliquee, Inserm U268, Hopital Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Movement', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Hyaluronic Acid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/physiology', 'Spleen/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 May;21(5-6):407-20, color plates following 528. doi: 10.3109/10428199609093438.",112,,5-6,['10.3109/10428199609093438 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Amplification of the MDM2 gene was found in more than a third of sarcomas and in a subset of malignant gliomas. Despite the absence of amplification, the MDM2 gene was overexpressed in some types of leukemias and lymphomas. Overexpression was significantly more frequent in the low-grade type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) than in the intermediate/high grade types of lymphoma and the overexpression was also significantly more frequent in the advanced rather than the earlier stages of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and B-NHL. This suggests that MDM2 could play a role, via the p53 pathway, in tumorigenicity and/or in disease progression in some hematological malignancies. However, in the light of our findings that, in a few cases, both the overexpression of MDM2 and mutant-type p53 was seen, it is possible that MDM2 overexpression may also promote neoplastic growth by mechanisms other than inactivation of the p53 protein.","['Watanabe, T', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Saito, H', 'Hotta, T']","['Watanabe T', 'Ichikawa A', 'Saito H', 'Hotta T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Mdm2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/genetics/pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 May;21(5-6):391-7, color plates XVI following 5. doi: 10.3109/10428199609093436.",49,,5-6,['10.3109/10428199609093436 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cultures, these cells die spontaneously by apoptosis. Interleukin (IL) 4 inhibits spontaneous apoptosis (SA) and promotes survival of B-CLL B cells in vitro. No such effect is observed in PB B cells from normal healthy donors. The anti-apoptotic effect of IL4 is independent of mitogen-induced cell activation but depends on the concentration of IL4. The protective effect of IL4 is specific and it is significantly reduced or abolished with anti-IL4 antibody. Interferon (IFN)-gamma and alpha- IFN also protect B-CLL B cells from apoptosis in vitro. Sera from B-CLL patients have increased levels of IFN-gamma when compared with sera from healthy donors. In addition, B-cells in B-CLL express detectable levels of IFN-gamma mRNA. Other cytokines, namely ILl, IL2, IL6 and IL7 do not affect SA of B-CLL B cells. By contrast, IL5 and antibody to apolipoprotein-1 (APO- 1) receptor increase SA significantly and in a dose-dependent manner. Interleukin 4 protects B-CLL B cells from IL5-, anti(alpha) APO-1- and steroid-induced apoptosis. The mode of action of the cytokines inducing apoptosis or protecting B-CLL B cells from dying is largely unknown. Recently the bcl-2 proto-oncogene has been associated with prolonged cell survival. However, the involvement of bel-2 in spontaneous, cytokine-induced or steroid-induced apoptosis in B-CLL has been controversial. Some authors have reported down-regulation of bcl-2 protein expression in B-CLL B-cells undergoing SA or in steroid-treated cells with IL4 preventing this down-regulation. By contrast, others observed no significant loss of bcl-2 protein expression in steroid-, alpha-APO-1 - and IL5-treated cells when compared with untreated or fresh cells. Also, no correlation between bcl-2 protein expression and protection with IL4 has been reported. In conclusion, in B-CLL IL4, IFN-gamma and alpha-IFN promote the survival of the leukaemic cells. These cytokines may therefore be involved in the pathogenesis of the B-CLL.","['Mainou-Fowler, T', 'Prentice, A G']","['Mainou-Fowler T', 'Prentice AG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Victoria Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (apolipoprotein A-I A-II receptor)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/physiology', 'Receptors, Lipoprotein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 May;21(5-6):369-77. doi: 10.3109/10428199609093434.,126,,5-6,['10.3109/10428199609093434 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methotrexate is a key component in ALL consolidation and maintenance therapies and is administered intrathecally in the prophylaxis and treatment of central nervous system leukemia. Critical determinants of methotrexate sensitivity and resistance (dihydrofolate reductase levels, methotrexate membrane transport, methotrexate polyglutamylation) previously described in cultured cells have recently been identified in lymphoblasts from children with ALL. Heterogenous expressions of increased dihydrofolate reductase or impaired methotrexate transport can be detected in both diagnostic and relapsed ALL specimens by flow cytometry with fluorescent methotrexate analogues. Lymphoblasts from children with ALL synthesize long chain polyglutamates and correlations have been established between the accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates in ALL blasts and characteristic patient prognostic features. Variations in methotrexate polyglutamate accumulation may reflect changes in polyglutamate synthetic or degradative enzymes, or may be secondary to changes in methotrexate influx or dihydrofolate reductase levels. Other critical elements in treatment response to methotrexate include the dose and route of methotrexate administration, its catabolism to 7-hydroxymethotrexate, and the rate of methotrexate plasma clearance. A unique relationship exists between chromosome 21 and ALL leukemogenesis, and response to treatment including methotrexate. A better understanding of the molecular bases of methotrexate response and the development of methotrexate resistance in childhood ALL should facilitate further improvements in the effectiveness of methotrexate-based chemotherapy for this disease.","['Matherly, L H', 'Taub, J W']","['Matherly LH', 'Taub JW']","['Karmanos Cancer Institute, Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport', 'Biotransformation', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', '*Membrane Proteins', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Remission Induction', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1996 May;21(5-6):359-68. doi: 10.3109/10428199609093433.,70,"['R01 CA076641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",5-6,['10.3109/10428199609093433 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report includes employees who worked more than 6 months before January 1, 1994 and pensioners who were alive as of January 1, 1973. Vital status was ascertained through 1993. Regardless of the comparison population used to calculate expected numbers (United States, Louisiana, or the surrounding tri-parish area), significantly fewer deaths were observed for all causes combined, all malignant neoplasms, heart disease, nonmalignant respiratory disease, and cirrhosis of the liver among male employees after 10 or more years' latency. With the United States as comparison, the all causes combined standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was 0.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.65 to 0.79), and the SMR for all cancer was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.61 to 0.92). The brain cancer rate for this group was nonsignificantly increased, with five observed deaths and three expected deaths, whereas mortality from leukemia was consistently lower than expected. The overall favorable mortality experienced by employees at this refinery and chemical plant is probably a result of a combination of factors, such as the healthy worker effect, relatively low risks related to the workplace, and the beneficial effects of continuing employment.","['Tsai, S P', 'Gilstrap, E L', 'Colangelo, T A', 'Menard, A K', 'Ross, C E']","['Tsai SP', 'Gilstrap EL', 'Colangelo TA', 'Menard AK', 'Ross CE']","['Shell Medical Department, Shell Oil Company, Houston, TX 77252-2463, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Occup Environ Med,Journal of occupational and environmental medicine,9504688,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', '*Cause of Death', '*Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Industrial Oils/*adverse effects', 'Louisiana/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Occup Environ Med. 1997 May;39(5):448-54. doi: 10.1097/00043764-199705000-00011.,,,5,['10.1097/00043764-199705000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Y-25510 also stimulated the mRNA expression for IL-6 in both types of the cells, however, the stimulation required the presence of LPS. In THP-1 cells, the stimulation of IL-1 beta mRNA expression by Y-25510 was suppressed by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. This phenomenon indicates that the stimulation requires de norv protein synthesis. In contrast, the stimulation of mRNA expression for IL-6 by Y-25510 was not suppressed by cycloheximide but suppressed by N alpha-p-tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK), an inhibitor of nuclear transcription factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) activation, in the presence of LPS, suggesting that the stimulation requires NF-kappa activation. These results demonstrate that Y-25510 stimulates the mRNA expression for IL-1 beta and IL-6 by different mechanisms. Dexamethasone suppressed the LPS-induced expression of mRNA for IL-1 beta and IL-6 in THP-1 cells, whereas the drug never suppressed the mRNA expression for these cytokines in the presence of Y-25510. The result indicates that Y-25510 stimulates the mRNA expression for IL-1 beta and IL-6 by different mechanisms from those of LPS.","['Kusuhara, H', 'Komatsu, H', 'Hisadome, M', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Kusuhara H', 'Komatsu H', 'Hisadome M', 'Ikeda Y']","['Research Laboratories, Yoshitomi Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Int J Immunopharmacol,International journal of immunopharmacology,7904799,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '145194-32-7 (Y 25510)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Culture Media/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/12/01 00:00,1996/12/01 00:01,['1996/12/01 00:00'],"['1996/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopharmacol. 1996 Dec;18(12):719-28. doi: 10.1016/s0192-0561(97)85554-3.,,,12,"['S0192056197855543 [pii]', '10.1016/s0192-0561(97)85554-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple regions of non-random sequence loss and gain were observed in 8/8 primary advanced stage tumors and 13/13 cell lines. Identification of sequence copy number changes was facilitated by statistical analyses that reduce subjectivity associated with identification of copy number changes and by requiring that sequence changes are visible using both red- and green-labeled tumor DNA. Loss of sequence on 13q and 14q and gain of sequence on 1q and chromosome 7 occurred in 50-60% of the population. In general, cell lines carry more and larger regions of sequence gain and loss than primary tumors. Regions of sequence copy number change that recur among MM cell lines and primary tumors include, in order of prevalence, enh(1q12qter), dim(13), enh(7), enh(3q22q29), enh(11q13.3qter), dim(14q11.2q31), enh(8q21qter), enh(3p25pter), dim(17p11.2p13), and dim(6q22.1q23).

Genomic changes detected using CGH are consistent with those identified using banding analyses, although recurrent involvement of additional regions of the genome are also evident.

One of sixty cytogenetically aberrant myeloid malignancies, an AML with a complex karyotype including del(5q) and del(20q), showed a hemizygous interstitial deletion of the ETV6 and CDKN1B loci. No concomitant rearrangement of the other ETV6 allele was detected. Two of nineteen cytogenetically normal AML displayed a hemizygous interstitial deletion involving CDKN1B, but not ETV6. Thus, cryptic deletions of these genes seem to be rare in cytogenetically abnormal myeloid malignancies without 12p aberrations (2%), whereas they may be more frequent in karyotypically normal AML (10%). Furthermore, the present findings show that the deletions may be narrow, not including the ETV6 gene, and indirectly suggest that CDKN1B, or a closely located genomic segment, is the target of 12p deletions.","['Andreasson, P', 'Johansson, B', 'Arheden, K', 'Billstrom, R', 'Mitelman, F', 'Hoglund, M']","['Andreasson P', 'Johansson B', 'Arheden K', 'Billstrom R', 'Mitelman F', 'Hoglund M']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/06/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1997 Jun;19(2):77-83. doi: 10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199706)19:2<77::aid-gcc2>3.0.co;2-x.,,,2,"['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199706)19:2<77::AID-GCC2>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(sici)1098-2264(199706)19:2<77::aid-gcc2>3.0.co;2-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of two subunits, p40 and p35. Coordinate expression of the IL-12 p40 and p35 genes in several solid tumor models has been found to induce strong and specific antitumor immune responses. In the interest of obtaining high level IL-12 expression in leukemia/lymphoma cells for use as vaccines in cancer immunotherapy, we evaluated three IL-12 retroviral vector designs based on the murine stem cell virus (MSCV) vector which efficiently transduces functional genes into normal hematopoietic cells. MSCVpac-mlL-12 and MIPV-mIL-12 contain an encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosome entry site for internal translation of bicistronic mRNA transcripts, while MDCVpac-mIL-12 carries an expression cassette in the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat. We found that the MSCVpac-mIL-12 vector directed robust expression of both p40 and p35 genes in several murine tumor cell lines of hematopoietic origin, including a T-cell lymphoma, a B-cell lymphoma, and a plasmacytoma/myeloma. In contrast, genomic instability or promoter interference hampered p40 gene expression in cells transduced with the MIPV-mIL-12 and MDCVpac-mIL-12 vectors, respectively. These findings provide the basis for the design of IL-12 retroviral vectors for the treatment of hematologic malignancies in humans.","['Lieu, F H', 'Hawley, T S', 'Fong, A Z', 'Hawley, R G']","['Lieu FH', 'Hawley TS', 'Fong AZ', 'Hawley RG']","['Oncology Gene Therapy Program, Toronto Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Interleukin-9)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (puromycin N-acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/genetics', 'Animals', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes', '*Genetic Therapy', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Interleukin-12/*genetics/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-9', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1997 May-Jun;4(3):167-75.,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A requirement in these studies is ex vivo genetic marking of malignant cells present in autografts which are derived from patients exposed to significant prior chemotherapy. We evaluated gene marking of cloonogenic myeloma cells in marrow aspirates from 14 patients with MM. To effect gene transfer we utilized a long-term marrow culture (LTMC) system previously shown to facilitate gene transfer into a spectrum of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells. Transduction of cells in LTMC was performed by multiple supernatant exposure. At LTMC initiation and after 21 days of culture malignant cells were assessed by morphology, flow cytometry, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The mean number of day 21 LTMC adherent layer-derived granulocyte/macrophage progenitors as a percentage of the original inoculum was within the normal range for this technique. The efficiency of transduction of normal hematopoietic progenitors as determined by the number of colonies positive for proviral DNA by PCR, G418 resistance, and X-gal staining was also within the expected range; 65%, 44% and 23%, respectively. Thus, there was no evidence that prior chemotherapy exposure or malignant cell contamination compromised cell survival or gene transfer efficiency in LTMC. All patients retained plasma cells in LTMCs for the duration of the 21-day culture period. Molecular analysis confirmed the persistence of clonal IgVH gene rearrangements in day 21 LTMC-derived DNA from 6 of 12 informative patients (50%). PCR using allele-specific primers when available confirmed the specificity of IgVH rearrangements for the myeloma clone. In 2 of the 14 patients, expansion of clonogenic cells was demonstrated in LTMC. In both cases there was strong evidence for transfer of reporter genes (neo and LacZ) into the myeloma clone: morphologically abnormal G418-resistant colonies demonstrated intense staining for beta-galactosidase, and cytospin preparations showed 100% plasma cells with monoclonal heavy and light chain restriction. In one patient, individual colonies positive for beta-galactosidase bore a cytogenetic abnormality characteristic of the patient's myeloma clone. PCR of DNA from pooled plasma cell colonies using tumor-specific CDR3 primers was positive. Our results demonstrate the maintenance of myeloma cells in vitro for up to 21 days in LTMC. They further illustrate that these cells can be genetically marked using transduction protocols currently being tested in clinical trials of hematopoietic cell gene transfer.","['Stewart, A K', 'Prince, H M', 'Cappe, D', 'Chu, P', 'Lutzko, C', 'Sutherland, D R', 'Dube, I D']","['Stewart AK', 'Prince HM', 'Cappe D', 'Chu P', 'Lutzko C', 'Sutherland DR', 'Dube ID']","['Toronto Hospital Oncology Gene Therapy Program, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Clone Cells', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Vectors', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Plasma Cells/cytology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 1997 May-Jun;4(3):148-56.,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adenosine (Ado)-5'-carboxaldehyde and its 4'-epimer are potent inhibitors of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase. They bind efficiently to the enzyme and undergo oxidation at C3' to give 3'-keto analogues with concomitant reduction of the NAD+ cofactor to give an inactive, tightly bound NADH-enzyme complex (type I cofactor-depletion inhibition). Potent type I inhibition was observed with 5'-carboxaldehydes that contain a ribo cis-2',3'-glycol. Their oxime derivatives are ""proinhibitors"" that undergo enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis to release the inhibitors at the active site. The 2'-deoxy and 2'-epimeric (arabinosyl) analogues were much weaker inhibitors, and the 3'-deoxy compounds bind very weakly. Ado-5'-carboxaldehyde oxime had potent cytotoxicity in tumor cell lines and was toxic to normal human cells. Analogues had weaker cytotoxic and antiviral potencies, and the 3'-deoxy compounds were essentially devoid of cytotoxic and antiviral activity.","['Wnuk, S F', 'Yuan, C S', 'Borchardt, R T', 'Balzarini, J', 'De Clercq, E', 'Robins, M J']","['Wnuk SF', 'Yuan CS', 'Borchardt RT', 'Balzarini J', 'De Clercq E', 'Robins MJ']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah 84602-5700, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (9-(ribo-pentodialdo-1,4-furanosyl)adenine oxime)', '0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Carbohydrates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oximes)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Aldehydes/*chemical synthesis', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Antiviral Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Carbohydrates/chemistry', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Oximes/*chemical synthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccinia virus/drug effects']",1997/05/23 00:00,1997/05/23 00:01,['1997/05/23 00:00'],"['1997/05/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/23 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/23 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1997 May 23;40(11):1608-18. doi: 10.1021/jm960828p.,,['GM-29332/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],11,"['10.1021/jm960828p [doi]', 'jm960828p [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While cooperative cancer groups carry out large-scale phase III clinical evaluations of these agents, few cooperative group studies incorporate economic analyses because of concerns over overburdening of data management, investigators, and statistical center personnel. In this study, we describe the results and operational considerations of one of the first completed economic analyses of a phase III cooperative group trial of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). We developed an economic model estimating economic benefits of yeast-derived granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) as adjunct therapy for adult patients (56-70 years) with acute myelogenous leukemia. Clinical data were based on prospectively collected information from a recently reported double-blind phase III multi-institutional study carried out by ECOG. Retrospective economic data were obtained from financial information systems at our hospital, one of the study sites. The cost-minimization analyses were based on the perspective of a third-party payer. Indirect costs related to loss of earnings by patients and caregivers as well as quality-of-life adjustments were not incorporated into the model. Clinical trial results indicated that patients treated with GM-CSF had shorter times to recovery of absolute neutrophil count of 500 cells/mm3 and 1000 cells/mm3 and fewer serious infections than patients who received placebo following induction chemotherapy, while no significant differences were noted in red blood cell and platelet transfusion dependency, toxicities, and duration of hospitalization. The economic model estimated that the group treated with GM-CSF was estimated to have lower costs of care, associated with lower frequencies of serious infections and lower overall infection-related costs. Sensitivity analyses indicated that these results held true over a wide range of estimates of costs and infection rates. Prospective economic analyses of phase III cooperative cancer group clinical trials have not been completed to date. Strategies that are not likely to overburden data managers and statistical center personnel are possible to devise. However, these studies require careful planning and coordination between clinical trialists, economists, and health services researchers.","['Bennett, C L', 'Golub, R', 'Waters, T M', 'Tallman, M S', 'Rowe, J M']","['Bennett CL', 'Golub R', 'Waters TM', 'Tallman MS', 'Rowe JM']","['Lakeside VA Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic/*economics/methods', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Insurance, Health, Reimbursement', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/*economics/methods', 'Probability', 'Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'United States']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1997;15(3):227-36. doi: 10.3109/07357909709039720.,,,3,['10.3109/07357909709039720 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Planning for the case management program involved interdisciplinary inpatient staff and personnel from the ambulatory oncology clinics. After program implementation, data on patients with a diagnosis of chemotherapy without acute leukemia (DRG 410) were collected throughout 1 year (March 1995-February 1996).

Its N-terminal 125 amino acids function as an independent transcriptional activation domain. Analyses of the primary amino acid sequence of the activation domain predict the presence of three alpha-helices, each with a high proportion of acidic residues. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we found that two of these predicted alpha-helices are required for full transcriptional activation by CIITA. Moreover, a CIITA protein in which both functional alpha-helices have been deleted displays a dominant negative phenotype. This activation domain of CIITA interacts with the 32 kDa subunit of the general transcription complex TFIID, TAFII32. Decreased transcriptional activation by N-terminal deletions of CIITA is correlated directly with their reduced binding to TAFII32.

To gain insight into the mechanism of globin gene activation by NF-E2, an NF-E2 null MEL cell line was used to map regions of NF-E2 required for beta-globin expression. Within the transactivation domain, two discrete proline-rich regions were required for rescue of beta-globin expression. The first was located at the N-terminus of NF-E2, while the second was located N-terminal of the cap 'n collar (CNC) domain. Other proline-rich sequences were dispensable, indicating that proline content per se does not determine NF-E2 activity. Mutations within the conserved CNC domain markedly diminished rescue of beta-globin expression. This domain was required, in addition to the basic leucine zipper domain, for DNA binding activity. The requirement for discrete proline-rich sequences within the transactivation domain suggests that globin gene expression in MEL cells depends on specific interactions between NF-E2 and downstream effector molecules.","['Bean, T L', 'Ney, P A']","['Bean TL', 'Ney PA']","[""Department of Biochemistry, Saint Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale, Memphis, TN 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (Nfe2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proline', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Jun 15;25(12):2509-15. doi: 10.1093/nar/25.12.2509.,,['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],12,"['gka378 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/25.12.2509 [doi]']",,PMC146763,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe a modified approach, termed stable tag-exchange, which incorporates an additional positive selection (stability) cassette to circumvent this limitation. HPRT (tag) and neo (stability) cassettes, separated by 4.9 kb of homologous DNA, were introduced efficiently into the LIF locus of ES cells. The tag cassette was substituted for abeta-galactosidase gene in exchange step targeting. Direct comparison of the tag-and-exchange and stable tag-exchange approaches indicated respective targeting efficiencies of 21% and 88%. The increased stable tag-exchange targeting efficiency resulted from elimination of >75% of background lines which survived tag-and-exchange selection due to physical loss of the tag gene. These resulted from reversion of the tagged allele to wild-type which is therefore a major contributor to tag-and-exchange targeting background. Our results extend the application of gene targeting by demonstrating a rationale for single-step integration of multiple regions of extended non-homology, and providing an efficient system for the repeated introduction of precise alterations into the mammalian genome.","['Whyatt, L M', 'Rathjen, P D']","['Whyatt LM', 'Rathjen PD']","['Department of Biochemistry, The University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA 5005, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology']",1997/06/15 00:00,1997/06/15 00:01,['1997/06/15 00:00'],"['1997/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1997 Jun 15;25(12):2381-8. doi: 10.1093/nar/25.12.2381.,,,12,"['gka417 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/25.12.2381 [doi]']",,PMC146761,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From November 1992 to August 1994, we prospectively studied five pediatric patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia, a unique finding in Taiwan, who were treated with allogeneic BMT at different stages of the disease. Their ages at diagnosis ranged from 2 to 10 years. Four donors were HLA-matched siblings and the other was an HLA-matched unrelated donor. All patients received busulfan (4 mg/kg/day for 4 days) followed by cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg/day for 2 successive days) as the conditioning regimen. Engraftment was documented within 22 days after transplantation in all five patients. Two out of the four patients in the sibling donor group, both of whom had BMT in the first chronic phase, achieved event-free survival after follow-up for 41 months and 17 months. The other two patients, who had BMT in the second lymphoblastic crisis and the second chronic phase, died within 6 months after transplantation due to lymphoid blastic crisis and complication of cytomegaloviral pneumonitis, respectively. The patient who received marrow from the unrelated donor underwent BMT in the accelerated phase and died within 6 months after transplantation due to myeloid blastic crisis. In conclusion, allogeneic BMT performed in the first chronic phase of childhood Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia seems to have better results than BMT after the first chronic phase.","['Lin, Y T', 'Lin, D T', 'Jou, S T', 'Lin, K S', 'Lin, K H']","['Lin YT', 'Lin DT', 'Jou ST', 'Lin KS', 'Lin KH']","['Department of Pediatrics, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1997 May;96(5):320-4.,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HIV-seropositive subjects (n = 28) with afebrile neutropenia (< 1000 neutrophils/microliter) showed low G-CSF serum levels (i.e., median was below the detection limit) not different from those of healthy volunteers (n = 66) or nonneutropenic HIV-seropositive controls (n = 75). In contrast, patients with acute myeloid leukemia and afebrile neutropenia from chemotherapy (n = 17) demonstrated markedly elevated G-CSF levels (median, 264 pg/ml; p < 0.0001). However, HIV-seropositive patients with pneumonia (n = 17) showed increases of G-CSF serum levels (median, 152 pg/ml; p < 0.0001) similar to HIV-seronegative patients (n = 17) with pneumonia (median, 123 pg/ml; p = 0.97). The results suggest that there may be a contribution of low G-CSF serum levels to persistent neutropenia in HIV-seropositive individuals.

Intact FHIT mRNA was not detected in two patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and in one patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The three cases expressed only an aberrant FHIT mRNA lacking exons 3 to 6 (FHIT delta 3-6 mRNA), which could encode a polypeptide of 13 amino acids. Southern blot analysis on two samples from these cases showed no rearrangements of the FHIT gene. Although intact FHIT mRNA was detected as the main band in the remaining 37 samples, 33 of them (14 of 14 AML, 11 of 13 chronic myeloid leukemia, five of five acute lymphocytic leukemia, and three of five CLL) expressed aberrant FHIT delta 3-6 mRNA. We barely detected the FHIT delta 3-6 mRNA in only one of 25 normal control samples.

The skin, however, counteracts ROS by both constitutional and newly produced antioxidants. One such antioxidant, adult T cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF), a human homologue of thioredoxin (TRX), was shown to be efficiently produced in and released from cultured normal human keratinocytes after UVB irradiation by Northern and Western blot analyses and enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Recombinant ADF (rADF) did not rescue UVB-induced melanocyte death, either when added pre- or post-UV irradiation. However, further addition of neutralizing antibody caused cell death of both keratinocytes and melanocytes. rADF was shown to induce higher expression in melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) mRNA accompanied by increased binding activity using 125I labeled [Nle4, D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH in melanocytes, leading to the enhanced increment of DNA synthesis. Taken together, it was shown that released ADF from UVB-irradiated keratinocytes acts as a survival factor for both keratinocytes and melanocytes but does not rescue UV-induced melanocyte death. Further, it may work as one of the stimulatory factors for UVB-induced melanogenesis by upregulating MSH-R binding activity in combination with the enhanced DNA synthesis by alpha-MSH.","['Funasaka, Y', 'Ichihashi, M']","['Funasaka Y', 'Ichihashi M']","['Department of Dermatology, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan. funasaka@med.kobe-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Pigment Cell Res,Pigment cell research,8800247,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Pituitary Hormone)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (adult T cell leukemia-derived factor)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', '810S9KV11R (MSH receptor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism/*radiation effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Pituitary Hormone/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pigment Cell Res. 1997 Feb-Apr;10(1-2):68-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0749.1997.tb00469.x.,,,1-2,['10.1111/j.1600-0749.1997.tb00469.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in neuropeptide expression are a prominent feature of these axotomized neurons. For example, while sympathetic, sensory, and motor neurons do not normally express the neuropeptides galanin and vasoactive intestinal peptide, they begin to do so within days after axotomy. In contrast, the expression of other peptides, which these neurons normally express, such as neuropeptide Y in sympathetic neurons and substance P in sensory neurons, is decreased. Recent studies in sympathetic neurons have demonstrated that leukemia inhibitory factor plays an important role in triggering these changes in neuropeptide phenotype in adult neurons.

The changes in neurotransmitter choice are retrogradely specified by interactions with the target tissue that are mediated by a secreted differentiation factor. Production of the target-derived differentiation factor requires noradrenergic innervation. The switch from noradrenergic to cholinergic and peptidergic is reproduced in culture when neonatal sympathetic neurons are treated with members of the neuropoietic cytokine family, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), suggesting that these cytokines might be responsible for the target-induced change in neurotransmitter properties. Analysis of transgenic mice that lack either LIF or CNTF or both, however, does not support their candidacy: the transmitter properties of the sweat gland innervation is indistinguishable from that of wild-type mice.

This lower recurrence rate may be due to a variety of other mechanisms. We aimed to evaluate the role of graft-versus-lymphoma effects in patients in whom lymphomas recur after allogeneic transplantation. At the time of recurrence, immunosuppressive therapy was withheld. Patients with non-responding disease received an infusion of donor lymphocytes. Patients were observed for response and graft-versus-host disease. Disease in four of nine patients responded to withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy. A minor response was observed in one of three recipients of donor lymphocyte infusions. Responses were observed among two patients with follicular lymphoma, one with large cell lymphoma and one with lymphoblastic lymphoma.

In this paper we demonstrate that oxidative stress, caused by agents acting at different steps in the biochemical pathway controlling the intracellular redox status, determines the increase in G6PD-specific activity in human cell lines of different tissue origins. The intracellular level of G6PD-specific mRNA also increases, with kinetics compatible with the induction of new enzyme synthesis. We carried out experiments in which cells were exposed to oxidative stress in the presence of inhibitors of protein or RNA synthesis. These demonstrated that increased G6PD expression is mainly due to an increased rate of transcription, with a minor but significant contribution of regulatory mechanisms acting at post-transcriptional levels. These results provide new information on the defence systems that eukaryotic cells possess in order to prevent damage caused by potentially harmful oxygen derivatives.","['Ursini, M V', 'Parrella, A', 'Rosa, G', 'Salzano, S', 'Martini, G']","['Ursini MV', 'Parrella A', 'Rosa G', 'Salzano S', 'Martini G']","['Istituto Internazionale di Genetica e Biofisica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Via Guglielmo Marconi 12, 80125 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Catalase/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Diamide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 May 1;323 ( Pt 3):801-6. doi: 10.1042/bj3230801.,,,,['10.1042/bj3230801 [doi]'],,PMC1218385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the multiple pathways responsible for their breakdown is probably initiated by calpains, which are cytoplasmic calcium-dependent cysteine proteases. The c-fos gene has been transduced by two murine oncogenic retroviruses called Finkel-Biskis-Jenkins murine sarcoma virus (FBJ-MSV) and Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MSV); c-jun has been transduced by the chicken avian sarcoma virus 17 (ASV17) retrovirus. Using an in vitro degradation assay, we show that the mutated v-FosFBR, but not v-FosFBJ or v-JunASV17, is resistant to calpains. This property raises the interesting possibility that decreased sensitivity to calpains might contribute to the tumorigenic potential of FBR-MSV by allowing greater accumulation of the protein that it encodes in infected cells. It has also been demonstrated that resistance to cleavage by calpains does not result from mutations that have accumulated in the Fos moiety of the viral protein but rather from the addition of atypical peptide motifs at its both ends. This observation raises the interesting possibility that homologous regions in viral and cellular Fos either display slightly different conformations or are differentially accessible to interacting proteins.","['Steff, A M', 'Carillo, S', 'Pariat, M', 'Piechaczyk, M']","['Steff AM', 'Carillo S', 'Pariat M', 'Piechaczyk M']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire/UMR 9942, CNRS, BP5051, Route de Mende, 34033 Montpellier Cedex 01, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun))', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Calpain)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Avian Sarcoma Viruses/genetics/*metabolism', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Calpain/*metabolism', 'Genes, fos', 'Genes, jun', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein p65(gag-jun)/classification/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins v-fos/classification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 May 1;323 ( Pt 3):685-92. doi: 10.1042/bj3230685.,,,,['10.1042/bj3230685 [doi]'],,PMC1218371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In neonatal rat cardiac myocytes, ANP induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent and cell type-specific manner. Maximum effects occurred at 1 microM ANP, with a 4-5-fold increase in apoptotic cells, reaching a maximum apoptotic index of 19%. In contrast, the maximum apoptotic index of ANP-treated non-myocytes was 1.1 +/- 0.2%, equivalent to control cultures. ANP treatment also sharply reduced levels of Mcl-1 mRNA, a Bcl-2 homologue, coincident with the increase in the incidence of apoptosis. ANP induction of apoptosis was receptor-dependent and mediated by cyclic GMP: the effect was mimicked by 8-bromo-cGMP, a membrane-permeable analog, and by sodium nitroprusside, an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase, and was potentiated by a cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor, zaprinast. Interestingly, norepinephrine, a myocyte growth factor, inhibited ANP-induced apoptosis via activation of the beta-adrenergic receptor and elevation of cyclic AMP. These results show that ANP is a specific effector of cardiac myocyte apoptosis in culture via receptor-mediated elevation of cGMP. Furthermore, at least in this model, ANP and norepinephrine may have opposing roles in the modulation of cardiac myocyte growth and survival.","['Wu, C F', 'Bishopric, N H', 'Pratt, R E']","['Wu CF', 'Bishopric NH', 'Pratt RE']","['Falk Cardiovascular Research Center, Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists)', '0 (Desmin)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Purinones)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31356-94-2 (8-bromocyclic GMP)', '85637-73-6 (Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', '8L5014XET7 (Terazosin)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', ""EC 3.1.4.35 (3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases)"", 'EC 4.6.1.2 (Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor)', 'GXT25D5DS0 (zaprinast)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'X4W3ENH1CV (Norepinephrine)', 'XM03YJ541D (Prazosin)']",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases/antagonists & inhibitors"", 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Atrial Natriuretic Factor/*pharmacology', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic GMP/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Desmin/analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Heart/*drug effects/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myocardium/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Norepinephrine/pharmacology', 'Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prazosin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Propranolol/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Purinones/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Atrial Natriuretic Factor/physiology']",1997/06/06 00:00,1997/06/06 00:01,['1997/06/06 00:00'],"['1997/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1997 Jun 6;272(23):14860-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.272.23.14860.,,"['HL07708/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL42663/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL49891/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",23,"['10.1074/jbc.272.23.14860 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)62470-1 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many of these malignancies, oncogenic activation of C-MYC and BCL2 is seen. Abnormalities of the tumor suppressor p53, which exerts growth-suppressing and apoptosis-enhancing functions through the transcriptional regulation of downstream genes including CDKN1, GADD45, and BCL2, are also often found. The goal was to determine the modulation of expression of the oncogenes (C-MYC and BCL2), the p53 pathway described above, and the apoptosis marker TGF-beta 1 in the human Raji lymphoma following MP treatment. Raji xenografts were grown in nude mice and growth curves characterized by sequential measurement. Mice were treated daily for 8 days with MP. Tumors were harvested untreated, or at 1 or 8 days after cessation of MP treatment, and the RNA was extracted. RT-PCR was used to determine the level of mRNA expression of the genes. Tumor growth was greatly reduced in the MP-treated mice. Gene expression levels for C-MYC and BCL2 were reduced at 1 day following MP and approached control levels 8 days after MP treatment. Expression levels of p53, CDKN1, and GADD45 were moderately and coordinately decreased at 1 day after cessation of MP treatment and remained repressed a week later. TGF-beta 1 exhibited no change in expression levels. These results suggest that decreased expression of C-MYC and BCL2 may play a role in the molecular events that initiate and are responsible for the growth inhibition of Raji lymphoma xenografts by MP.","['Morris, G', 'DeNardo, S J', 'DeNardo, G L', 'Leshchinsky, T', 'Wu, B', 'Mack, P C', 'Winthrop, M D', 'Gumerlock, P H']","['Morris G', 'DeNardo SJ', 'DeNardo GL', 'Leshchinsky T', 'Wu B', 'Mack PC', 'Winthrop MD', 'Gumerlock PH']","['Section of Radiodiagnosis and Therapy, University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, Sacramento 95817, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Mol Med,Biochemical and molecular medicine,9508702,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Genes, bcl-2/drug effects', '*Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Methylprednisolone/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Mol Med. 1997 Apr;60(2):108-15. doi: 10.1006/bmme.1997.2568.,,"['P01-CA47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA55792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",2,"['S1077315097925680 [pii]', '10.1006/bmme.1997.2568 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case demonstrates that TEL gene deletions may be relevant in cases of mature B-lymphoproliferative diseases.","['Conchon, M', 'McManus, A P', 'Min, T', 'Maljaie, S H', 'Crawford, A', 'Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Conchon M', 'McManus AP', 'Min T', 'Maljaie SH', 'Crawford A', 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Hematology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1997 Jun;95(2):137-40. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00257-9.,,,2,"['S0165460896002579 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00257-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, poor in vitro growth of the malignant cells and suboptimal quality of metaphase spreads may sometimes cause false-negative findings (normal karyotype). We used comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to study whether this new method is able to detect and characterize genetic aberrations not detected by karyotyping. CGH showed clonal genetic aberrations in 8 of 13 cases, most of which showed gains of several chromosomes, indicating hyperdiploidy. The sensitivity of CGH was sufficient to detect a small interstitial deletion of 6q. One karyotypically complex case was resolved by CGH showing a high-level amplification of DNA sequences originating from the 12p12-13. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses confirmed the CGH findings in 2 cases, validating the accuracy of CGH. In conclusion, CGH experiments established the known fact that hyperdiploidy is the most common finding in pediatric ALLs and that CGH may detect aberrations that are not seen in the G-banded karyotype. CGH was also able to further characterize genetic aberrations such as gene amplification, which is occasionally involved in pediatric ALL as well as in other leukemias.","['Karhu, R', 'Siitonen, S', 'Tanner, M', 'Keinanen, M', 'Makipernaa, A', 'Lehtinen, M', 'Vilpo, J A', 'Isola, J']","['Karhu R', 'Siitonen S', 'Tanner M', 'Keinanen M', 'Makipernaa A', 'Lehtinen M', 'Vilpo JA', 'Isola J']","['Laboratory of Cancer Genetics, Tampere University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1997 Jun;95(2):123-9. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00242-7.,,,2,"['S0165460896002427 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(96)00242-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study shows that SPP mobilizes intracellular calcium in U937 cells and demonstrates for the first time the ability of SPP to activate the transcription factor NF-kappa B in these cells. Furthermore, calcium release from the internal stores by thapsigargin (TG), an inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ pump, was associated with activation of NF-kappa B. Moreover, we have shown that while an intracellular calcium chelator BAPTA/AM was able to inhibit both SPP- and TG-induced NF-kappa B activation, it had no effect on TNF-induced NF-kappa B activation. In addition, SPP-induced NF-kappa B activation was blocked both by cyclosporin A, known to inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity, and by the antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole. These observations suggest that intracellular calcium mobilization is required for SPP-induced NF-kappa B activation, which may involve calcineurin- and redox-dependent mechanisms.","['Shatrov, V A', 'Lehmann, V', 'Chouaib, S']","['Shatrov VA', 'Lehmann V', 'Chouaib S']","['CJF 94-11 INSERM Cytokines et Immunite Antitumorale, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lysophospholipids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Sphingolipids)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '25013-16-5 (Butylated Hydroxyanisole)', '26993-30-6 (sphingosine 1-phosphate)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'N18RMK75W1 (indo-1)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Butylated Hydroxyanisole/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA Probes', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Luciferases/metabolism', '*Lysophospholipids', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Sphingosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/05/08 00:00,1997/05/08 00:01,['1997/05/08 00:00'],"['1997/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 May 8;234(1):121-4. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6598.,,,1,"['S0006-291X(97)96598-0 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6598 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since in man no abnormalities have yet been found in either the genes for leptin or its receptor, the mechanism of leptin resistance in obesity remains unknown. To determine if resistance might be related to leptin binding by a serum component, we assessed the carrier status of leptin in serum. The presence of a specific leptin binding factor in human serum has been established by (1) demonstrating [125I]-leptin binding to a serum component that is saturable and specifically displaceable only by unlabeled leptin and not by human growth hormone, pork insulin, insulin-like growth factors I and II, luteinizing or follicle stimulating hormones, transforming growth factor-beta 1, interleukin-6, or leukemia inhibiting factor; (2) fractionating the leptin bound serum complex and the serum leptin binding component on a molecular sieving column revealing a mass of approximately 450 kDa; and (3) identifying an inverse correlation between the concentration of serum leptin and the quantity of the leptin binding component. It is suggested that binding of leptin by this serum component may influence the physiologic response to leptin.","['Diamond, F B Jr', 'Eichler, D C', 'Duckett, G', 'Jorgensen, E V', 'Shulman, D', 'Root, A W']","['Diamond FB Jr', 'Eichler DC', 'Duckett G', 'Jorgensen EV', 'Shulman D', 'Root AW']","['Department of Pediatric, University of South Florida, College of Medicine, Tampa 33612, USA. fdiamond@allkids.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (LEPR protein, human)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Leptin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carrier Proteins/*blood/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leptin', 'Molecular Weight', 'Obesity/blood', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Leptin']",1997/04/28 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/04/28 00:00'],"['1997/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Apr 28;233(3):818-22. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6538.,,['K08 DK 01980/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],3,"['S0006-291X(97)96538-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6538 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A human LIM-HOX gene, namely hLH-2, was highly expressed in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and located on chromosome 9q33-34.1, in the same region as the reciprocal translocation that creates the Bcr-Abl chimera of Philadelphia chromosome (H.-K. Wu et al., 1996, Oncogene 12, 1205-1212). To elucidate the mechanism of hLH-2 transcriptional activation, we studied the methylation status of hLH-2 in normal bone marrow and CML cells. When blots containing genomic DNA digested with Hpa II or Msp I were hybridized with full-length cDNA probe, it was discovered that hLH-2 was methylated in normal bone marrow cells in which hLH-2 was not expressed; in contrast, both alleles of the hLH-2 locus in CML cells were heavily hypomethylated. Furthermore, using a sensitive RT-PCR technique, we examined the expression of LH-2 in mouse x human hybrids and a wide array of mouse cell lines containing Abl or Bcr-Abl, and we failed to identify a consistent expression pattern in the cell lines tested. These results suggest that the transcriptional activation of hLH-2 in CML is likely due to a cis-acting effect, but not a trans-acting effect, of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Because hypomethylated genes generally are transcribed more efficiently than hypermethylated genes, the high level of hLH-2 mRNA in CML cells probably is a consequence of the low level of methylation of the gene in the leukemic cells.","['Wu, H K', 'Minden, M D']","['Wu HK', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Medicine, Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LHX2 protein, human)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM-homeodomain protein LH-2)', '0 (Lhx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1997/04/28 00:00,1997/04/28 00:01,['1997/04/28 00:00'],"['1997/04/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/28 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1997 Apr 28;233(3):806-12. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1997.6546.,,,3,"['S0006-291X(97)96546-3 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1997.6546 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human leukemia HL60 cells respond to the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D3) by expressing a number of markers of the monocyte/macrophage phenotype and become arrested predominantly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. We have recently reported a series (A) of 1,25D3-resistant variants of HL60 cells which proliferate in the presence of 1,25D3 and do not express differentiation markers (Exp. Cell Res. 224, 312, 1996). We now describe another series (B) of such variants, which differ from A series cells grown in similar concentrations of 1,25D3 in that they express the CD14 antigen and nonspecific esterase, characteristic of the monocyte, while continuing to proliferate and they develop hypotetraploid DNA (4C) content at higher concentrations of ambient 1,25D3 than the A series cells. Cells in the B series with 4C DNA content (100B and 200B) also differed from the A series 4C cells by the absence of DNA binding by the full-length Sp1 transcription factor. However, B series cells resembled the A series cells in exhibiting faster growth rates than the parental HL60 cells and showed high levels of vitamin D receptor and retinoid receptor X proteins. These results show that the initial steps in the 1,25D3 signaling pathway are intact in B series resistant cells and lead to the appearance of early markers of monocytic differentiation. However, the progression to subsequent events which comprise terminal differentiation and cell cycle arrest is halted during the adaptation to the presence of 1,25D3 in these cells. Thus, the availability of these variant cells should provide a system for studying the link between differentiation and cell cycle arrest.","['Studzinski, G P', 'Rathod, B', 'Wang, Q M', 'Rao, J', 'Zhang, F']","['Studzinski GP', 'Rathod B', 'Wang QM', 'Rao J', 'Zhang F']","['Department of Pathology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'HL-60 Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 May 1;232(2):376-87. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3484.,,['R01-CA 44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],2,"['S0014-4827(97)93484-4 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3484 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By an approach of random mutagenesis and selection we established clones from the human acute lymphatic leukemia cell line HPB-ALL with (i) constitutively active LFA-1 and (ii) with no apparent integrin-beta 1 cell surface expression. Thirty-seven of 42 clones selected for activated LFA-1 were found to have lost apparent integrin-beta 1 expression. Conversely, 7 of 21 clones selected for lack of beta 1 expression were found to have activated LFA-1. Since this pointed toward a possible coupling between beta 1 expression and LFA-1 activity, we further analyzed at which level beta 1 expression was blocked. We focused on one clone, HAP4, with activated LFA-1 and no detectable beta 1 cell surface expression and found, surprisingly, that it expressed wild-type levels of beta 1 mRNA and, in Western blots of whole cell lysates, apparently normal levels of beta 1 protein. However, in addition to beta 1 of the expected molecular weight, HAP4 expressed a unique 48-kDa band recognized by the polyclonal anti-beta 1 antiserum. Immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that the epitope recognized by the anti-beta 1 antibody 4B4 was hidden or lost. The alpha 4-chain was found in its precursor form but it did not associate with any beta-chain, and it was not processed to its mature form. Instead alpha 4-chains were eventually degraded. Taken together this showed that beta 1-chains were produced but not properly processed in HAP4. From this we propose that HAP4 is deficient in a gene product required both for proper beta 1 folding and for repression of LFA-1 adhesiveness.","['Hedman, H', 'Alenius, M', 'Lundgren, E']","['Hedman H', 'Alenius M', 'Lundgren E']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, University of Umed, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Clone Cells/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 May 1;232(2):270-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3489.,,,2,"['S0014-4827(97)93489-3 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3489 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MOLT-3 cells express approximately 58,000 hemopexin receptors per cell (apparent Kd 20 nM), of which about 20% are on the cell surface. Binding is dose- and temperature-dependent, and growth in serum-free IMDM medium is stimulated by 100-1000 nM heme-hemopexin, consistent with the high affinity of the receptor for hemopexin, and maximal growth is seen in response to 500 nM complex. Growth was similar in defined minimal medium supplemented with either low concentrations of heme-hemopexin or iron-transferrin, and either of these complexes were about 80% as effective as a serum supplement. Heme-hemopexin, but not apo-hemopexin, reversed the growth inhibition caused by desferrioxamine showing that heme-iron derived from heme catabolism is used for cell growth. Cobalt-protoporphyrin (CoPP)-hemopexin, which binds to the receptor but is not transported intracellularly [Smith et al., (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7365], also stimulated cell proliferation in serum-free IMDM but did not ""rescue"" the cells from desferrioxamine. Furthermore, CoPP-hemopexin effectively competed for the hemopexin receptor with heme-hemopexin and diminished its growth stimulatory effects. In addition, protein kinase C (PKC) is translocated to the plasma membrane within 5 min after heme-hemopexin is added to the medium, reaches maximum activity within 5-10 min, and declines to unstimulated levels by 30 min. Heme-hemopexin and CoPP-hemopexin both augmented MOLT-3 cell growth stimulated by serum. Thus, heme-hemopexin not only functions as an iron source for T-cells but occupancy of the hemopexin receptor itself triggers signaling pathway(s) involved in the regulation of cell growth. The stimulation of growth of human T-lymphocytes by heme-hemopexin is likely to be a physiologically relevant mechanism at sites of injury, infection, and inflammation.","['Smith, A', 'Eskew, J D', 'Borza, C M', 'Pendrak, M', 'Hunt, R C']","['Smith A', 'Eskew JD', 'Borza CM', 'Pendrak M', 'Hunt RC']","['Division of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, School of Biological Sciences, University of Missouri-Kansas City 64110-2499, USA. annsmith@cctr.umkc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (hemopexin receptor)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '63AAN3JDZE (cobaltiprotoporphyrin)', '9013-71-2 (Hemopexin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Heme/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Hemopexin/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Iron/physiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Protoporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Peptide/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 May 1;232(2):246-54. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3526.,,['DK 37463/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],2,"['S0014-4827(97)93526-6 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3526 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This disease is much more common in clams inhabiting polluted waters, suggesting an environmental component to its pathogenesis. In this study, leukemia cells were identified using a murine monoclonal antibody, 1E10, which recognizes a leukemia-specific protein expressed by tumor cells. Mutant p53 protein was detected using a murine monoclonal antibody (PAb 240) which reacts with mutant p53. Using immunofluorescence, the reactivity of clam cells to the 1E10 antibody was evaluated along with mutant p53 protein reactivity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions followed by sequence analyses were utilized to examine clams with hemocytes reacting with the p53 antibody for possible p53 gene mutations. Mutant p53 protein was expressed by tumor cells from five animals with advanced disease (in which greater than 90% of cells reacted with 1E10). A C-->G transversion was detected at the end of exon 6 from two of the five animals that reacted with both the mutant p53 antibody and 1E10. This substitution changes the amino acid of this codon from proline to alanine. Overall, our results suggest that environmentally induced alterations in p53 can contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemia in soft-shell clams inhabiting polluted water and/or sediment.","['Barker, C M', 'Calvert, R J', 'Walker, C W', 'Reinisch, C L']","['Barker CM', 'Calvert RJ', 'Walker CW', 'Reinisch CL']","['Department of Comparative Medicine, Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, North Grafton, Massachusetts 01536, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Water Pollutants)', '0 (Xenobiotics)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bivalvia/*genetics', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', '*Genes, p53', 'Hemocytes/chemistry/*pathology', 'Hemolymph/*cytology', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/genetics/*veterinary', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/blood', 'Water Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Xenobiotics/adverse effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1997 May 1;232(2):240-5. doi: 10.1006/excr.1997.3513.,,['CA 44307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],2,"['S0014-4827(97)93513-8 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1997.3513 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three groups had different median DFS of 6 months, 9 months and 15 months respectively (P = 0.017). In summary, Ida-AraC is an efficient salvage regimen for AML.

More biological information regarding MDS in children is clearly needed and in vitro culture studies provide one possibility for gaining further pathophysiological insights into this malignancy. Here, we incubated bone marrow samples from 30 children with MDS in liquid suspension culture in order to grow the transformed cells in vitro. In most cultures, the hematopoietic cells died quickly and only fibroblastic (stromal) background layers proliferated temporarily; several normal Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) were established. Only in one instance, albeit from the peripheral blood and not from the bone marrow, could we establish a cell line, termed MUTZ-1, from the malignant cells of a 5-year-old girl with MDS (FAB subtype refractory anemia with excess of blasts). The MDS arose from a pre-existing Fanconi anemia and progressed quickly to an acute myeloid leukemia (FAB M2). Despite positivity for EBV, MUTZ-1 is not an EBV + B-LCL and further characterization of MUTZ-1 confirmed the derivation from the transformed clonal cells. Immunophenotyping showed a pre B-cell surface marker profile (CD10+ CD19+ cytoplasmic IgM+); receptor gene rearrangement analyses underlined the clonal B-cell nature of MUTZ-1 cells. MUTZ-1 cells exhibit a highly rearranged, unstable karyotype with a high frequency of spontaneous chromatid breaks and exchanges; del(5q) and additional rearrangements involving chromosome 5 [der(15)t(5;15)] were detected. The present data and results from a few other MDS-derived cell lines suggest that the transforming event in MDS seems to occur in an immature pluripotent progenitor cell. The new MDS-derived continuous cell line MUTZ-1 provides a useful in vitro model system for studies on the pathogenetic events leading to MDS.","['Steube, K G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Hu, Z B', 'Teepe, D', 'Harms, D', 'Kabisch, H', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Hansen-Hagge, T', 'Macleod, R A', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Drexler, H G']","['Steube KG', 'Gignac SM', 'Hu ZB', 'Teepe D', 'Harms D', 'Kabisch H', 'Gaedicke G', 'Hansen-Hagge T', 'Macleod RA', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Dept. of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/virology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/genetics', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/*pathology', 'Oncogenes/genetics', 'Prospective Studies', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Apr;25(3-4):345-63. doi: 10.3109/10428199709114174.,,,3-4,['10.3109/10428199709114174 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined this mechanism in an erythromegakaryocytic cell line, HEL, using a protein kinase inhibitor K252a or a phorbol-ester TPA. HEL cells treated with K252a showed a marked increase in the proportion of CD41 positive cells and polyploid cells as well as in cellular size and nuclear size. TPA showed similar results but induced multi-nucleation instead of enlargement of nuclear size. K252a added at the G1/S boundary phase did not inhibit the first and second round DNA synthesis, but inhibited cell division. K252a did not inhibit the expression of genes involved in mitosis such as cyclin B, cdc25B and cdc2, in the first round S phase. However, the cyclin B associated Cdc2 kinase activity needed for mitosis during the G2/M phase was reduced by K252a. TPA delayed DNA synthesis and expression of these genes, and suppressed Cdc2 kinase activity in the second round G2/M phase. These results suggest that the polyploidization induced by K252a results from inhibiting mitosis possibly caused by suppression of Cdc2 kinase activity. TPA may induce the multi-nucleation through a different mechanism.","['Yokoe, H', 'Masumi-Fukazawa, A', 'Sunohara, M', 'Tanzawa, H', 'Sato, K', 'Sato, T', 'Fuse, A']","['Yokoe H', 'Masumi-Fukazawa A', 'Sunohara M', 'Tanzawa H', 'Sato K', 'Sato T', 'Fuse A']","['Department of Safety Research on Biologics, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indole Alkaloids)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '97161-97-2 (staurosporine aglycone)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (CDC25B protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/drug effects/metabolism', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/drug effects/metabolism', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Indole Alkaloids', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIIb-IIIa Complex/drug effects/metabolism', '*Polyploidy', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*cdc25 Phosphatases']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Apr;25(3-4):333-43. doi: 10.3109/10428199709114173.,,,3-4,['10.3109/10428199709114173 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used genetic engineering based on the elucidated molecular structures of human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and diphtheria toxin (DT) to produce a recombinant fusion toxin, DTctGMCSF, that targets diphtheria toxin to high affinity GMCSF receptors expressed on the surface of blast cells from a large fraction of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DTctGMCSF was specifically immunoreactive with antidiphtheria toxin and anti-GMCSF antiseras, and exhibited the characteristic catalytic activity of diphtheria toxin, catalyzing the in vitro ADP-ribosylation of purified elongation factor 2. The cytotoxic effects of DTctGMCSF were examined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-tetrazolium (MTT) bromide assay of cell viability and in vivo assays of protein synthesis inhibition. DTctGMCSF were specifically cytotoxic to human leukemia cell lines bearing high affinity receptors for human GMCSF with IC50 of 10(-9) to 10(-11) M. It was not toxic to mammalian hematopoietic cell lines lacking human GMCSF (hGMCSF) receptors. In receptor positive cells, cytotoxicity can be specifically blocked by a large excess of hGMCSF, confirming that its cytotoxicity is mediated through the hGMCSF receptor. THough DTctGMCSF inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony formation by committed myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM), it did not significantly affect erythroid burst formation by committed erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E), or mixed granulocyte-erythroid-macrophage-megakaryocyte colony formation by pluripotent multilineage progenitor cells (CFU-GEMM). DTctGMCSF holds promise for the treatment of myeloid lineage malignancies, and is a useful reagent to study hematopoiesis.","['Bendel, A E', 'Shao, Y', 'Davies, S M', 'Warman, B', 'Yang, C H', 'Waddick, K G', 'Uckun, F M', 'Perentesis, J P']","['Bendel AE', 'Shao Y', 'Davies SM', 'Warman B', 'Yang CH', 'Waddick KG', 'Uckun FM', 'Perentesis JP']","['Biotherapy Institute, University of Minnesota Academic Health Center, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Apr;25(3-4):257-70. doi: 10.3109/10428199709114165.,,"['AI-00793/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",3-4,['10.3109/10428199709114165 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Drug resistance in AML is multifactorial but can be associated with the overexpression of transmembrane transporter molecules, including P-glycoprotein (Pgp) or the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP), or associated with inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, as well as overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2. We are investigating if novel recombinant biotherapeutics can circumvent these resistance mechanisms to effectively treat refractory AML. To target the lethal action of diphtheria toxin (DT) to high affinity granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) receptors on AML blasts, we have produced a recombinant chimeric fusion toxin, DTctGMCSF. Since DTctGMCSF enters and kills its target cells by unique mechanisms (GMCSF-receptor binding and protein synthesis inhibition) and is not similar in structure to Pgp or MRP substrates, we postulated that it would be an active agent against therapy-resistant AML. DTctGMCSF was selectively cytotoxic (IC50 1-10ng/ml) to GMCSF-receptor positive AML cells expressing the Pgp- or MRP-associated multi-drug resistant phenotypes, despite high level resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. DTctGMCSF also efficiently killed AML cells deficient in p53 expression, as well as radiation-resistant AML cells and mixed lineage leukemia cells expressing high levels of bcl-2. In addition, DTctGMCSF killed > 99% of primary leukemic progenitor cells from therapy-refractory AML patients under conditions that we have previously found to not adversely affect the proliferative capacity or differentiation of pluripotent normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. DTctGMCSF may prove useful in treating myeloid leukemias that are otherwise resistant to a wide range of conventional therapies.","['Perentesis, J P', 'Bendel, A E', 'Shao, Y', 'Warman, B', 'Davies, S M', 'Yang, C H', 'Chandan-Langlie, M', 'Waddick, K G', 'Uckun, F M']","['Perentesis JP', 'Bendel AE', 'Shao Y', 'Warman B', 'Davies SM', 'Yang CH', 'Chandan-Langlie M', 'Waddick KG', 'Uckun FM']","['Biotherapy Institute, University of Minnesota Academic Health Center, Minneapolis, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Diphtheria Toxin/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Apr;25(3-4):247-56. doi: 10.3109/10428199709114164.,,"['AI-00793/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-53586/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",3-4,['10.3109/10428199709114164 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes for a hybrid protein with the capacity of oncogenic transformation of hematopoietic cells. Nonetheless, very few myeloproliferative disorders (about 10%) included under the generic term of CML have no Ph chromosome.

C-kit is expressed on leukemic cells of the erythroid, myeloid, and mast-cell lineage and SCF has a proliferative effect on some of these cells. The role of SCF and c-kit in lymphoid malignancies is much less clear. Here we review the role of c-kit in normal lymphopoiesis and summarize its role in lymphoid malignancies. C-kit is expressed in normal lymphopoiesis and its ligand SCF synergizes with IL-7 to enhance the proliferation of B- and T-cell progenitors. In malignant lymphopoiesis, c-kit can also be expressed in B and T-lymphoblastic cells from children with non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when analyzed by the highly sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). While c-kit receptors were detected by flow cytometric (FCM) analysis on about 40% of fresh T-lymphoblastic biopsy tumor cell preparations or T-lymphoblastic cell lines, no receptors were detected on B-lymphoblastic fresh cells or cell lines from children with B-ALL or Burkitt's lymphoma (BL). Almost all of the lymphoblastic cells expressing c-kit protein responded to recombinant human (rh)SCF with a downregulation of c-kit receptors. A proliferative response was detected only in a minority of these cells. B-ALL or BL cell lines showed no response to rhSCF. Upregulation of c-kit in T-lymphoblastic cells could be demonstrated by the addition of IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta or A23187, and downregulation by rhSCF or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Despite upregulation of c-kit mRNA, protein remained undetectable on B-ALL or BL cells in the presence of A23187. The metabolic state of the cells seemed to influence c-kit expression, since c-kit was upregulated in T-lymphoblastic cells by the addition of new medium. C-kit appears to play a role in the growth of some malignant T-lymphoblastic but not B-lymphoblastic cells.","['Sykora, K W', 'Tomeczkowski, J', 'Reiter, A']","['Sykora KW', 'Tomeczkowski J', 'Reiter A']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Child', 'Cytokines/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*physiology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Apr;25(3-4):201-16. doi: 10.3109/10428199709114160.,94,,3-4,['10.3109/10428199709114160 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reasoned that myeloid leukemic cells can become sensitized to the Fas pathway of cell death if CD95 expression is restored by gene transfer. As a model, we utilized the cell line K562 which does not express CD95 on their cell surface. The gene for CD95 was introduced into K562 cells (by electroporation). As a control, the gene coding for beta-galactosidase was used. The CD95 transfected K562 cells stably expressed CD95, and had a growth pattern comparable to untransfected cells, but still remained resistant to Fas-triggering (tested using recombinant Fas-ligand). Our experiment shows that antigen expression is not a critical determinant of Fas-mediated apoptosis, but further down-stream mechanisms determine the fate of the cells. The transfected cells also had a comparable susceptibility to NK-mediated lysis which shows that the expression of CD95 does not interfere with NK-mediated lysis of target cells.","['Munker, R', 'Marini, F', 'Jiang, S', 'Savary, C', 'Owen-Schaub, L', 'Andreeff, M']","['Munker R', 'Marini F', 'Jiang S', 'Savary C', 'Owen-Schaub L', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",France,Hematol Cell Ther,Hematology and cell therapy,9613253,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Division/genetics/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis/*genetics/immunology']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Cell Ther. 1997 Apr;39(2):75-8. doi: 10.1007/s00282-997-0075-7.,,,2,['10.1007/s00282-997-0075-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy, risk factors and medium-term toxicities are reported. PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS: Stage I or II with at least one of the following factors, mediastinal involvement, histological type 3, age > 40 years, ESR rate > 50 mm, or stage IIIA. 189 patients with newly diagnosed HD were treated between 01/89 and 01/94 (stage I, n = 33; stage II, n = 129, stage IIIA, n = 27). Three courses of an ABVD-like regimen (adriamycin 25 mg/m2, bleomycin 10 mg, vindesine 2 mg/m2 and dacarbazine 250 mg/m2 day 1 and 8) were given before STNI at 36/40 grays. At diagnosis, prognostic factors were distributed as follows: B symptoms (n = 54), bulky mediastinum (n = 41), hemoglobin < 12 g/dl (n = 37), ESR > 50 (n = 65), age > 45 (n = 24). RESULTS: After chemotherapy, 90% had an objective response (partial response > 75%) and 98% were in complete remission (CR) at the end of RT. Three patients had primary refractory disease and 13 patients (7%) relapsed, 3 at the initial site, 4 at previously uninvolved sites and 6 at both. With a median follow-up of 60 months, 170 patients are in 1st CR, 5 in 2nd or greater CR and 11/14 patients have died from HD. Bulky mediastinum (p = 0.009), age > 45 years (p = 0.03) and EST > 50 mm (p = 0.05) were adverse prognostic factors for survival. Bulky mediastinum (p = 0.009) was the only prognostic factor for freedom from progression. TOXICITIES: Two patients died from treatment related toxicity and one patient died with an osteogenic sarcoma. No secondary leukemia has so far been detected. 24 pregnancies were reported. Cardiopulmonary toxicity was always < grade 1 (WHO) in 95 patients evaluated. Two patients over 45 years old had a myocardial infarction.

Different entities may be observed: the childhood form, Juvenile Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JCML) shows in vitro a typical pattern with constitutive growth of only macrophagic colonies and hypersensitivity to GM-CSF; in the adult form at least two patterns may be observed one close to the JCML form and one more heterogeneous with absence of GM-CSF sensitivity and spontaneous growth of both CFU-GM and CFU-M colonies. Chemotherapy reduces all myeloid colonies in vitro whereas retinoic acid has a selective effect on monocytic colonies with a concomitant increase of CFU-G colonies forwarding an explanation for the correction of pancytopenia observed in some patients.

Report of a case with diagnosis by fine needle biopsy.,823-9,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with transformation into large cell lymphoma (Richter's syndrome) is a well-documented phenomenon. Only rarely does CLL terminate in Hodgkin's disease (HD) as Richter's syndrome. Reports of Hodgkin's variant of Richter's syndrome proven by histologic and immunohistologic evaluation have been published, but no cytologic reports of this entity exist. Distinguishing between large cell lymphoma and HD as variants of Richter's syndrome is essential because of recent reports of improved prognosis in HD. CASE: We report a case of a 65-year-old male previously diagnosed with CLL who subsequently developed fever, fatigue, an intraabdominal mass and enlarged periaortic lymph nodes. Fine needle biopsy (FNB) and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry of the mass revealed cytologic and immunophenotypical cells of CLL admixed with binucleate and multinucleate cells with prominant eosinophilic nucleoli consistent with Reed-Sternberg cells. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of HD variant of Richter's syndrome diagnosed by FNB. As FNB becomes more common in the follow-up of lymphoreticular diseases, cytologists should be aware of this unusual HD variant of Richter's syndrome.","['Simpson, J L', 'Moriarty, A T', 'Earls, J', 'Snyder, W', 'McCloskey, D W']","['Simpson JL', 'Moriarty AT', 'Earls J', 'Snyder W', 'McCloskey DW']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Methodist Hospital of Indiana, Inc., Indianapolis 46206-1367, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Biopsy, Needle/methods', 'CD5 Antigens/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/cytology', 'Syndrome', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1997 May-Jun;41(3):823-9. doi: 10.1159/000332710.,,,3,['10.1159/000332710 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

None of the abnormalities is specific for MDS but, when combined with active or hyperactive haemopoiesis and refractory cytopenia in an elderly person, they suggest the diagnosis. The French-American-British co-operative group divided MDSs into five types: refractory anaemia; refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts; refractory anaemia with excess of blasts; refractory anaemia with excess of blasts in transformation; and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. The classification was based on the number of blasts in the bone marrow, dysplastic features in one or more cell lines, ringed sideroblasts, blasts in the peripheral blood, Auer rods in the granulocyte precursors and absolute monocytosis. MDS can be a primary condition and of unknown aetiology or develop secondary to the action of a known agent such as an alkylating agent, chemical or recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The pathogenesis of MDS is thought to be a multi-step process which begins with a somatic mutation in the pluripotential stem cell, is irreversibly altered and acquires a survival advantage. The abnormal clone expands at the expense of normal haemopoiesis and undergoes further genetic change to give a progressively more malignant phenotype. Present theories of the development of MDS are speculative but further research could cast light on the development of other haematological disorders.","['Masey, J A']",['Masey JA'],"['Haematology Department, Eastbourne District General Hospital, England, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Biomed Sci,British journal of biomedical science,9309208,,IM,"['Anemia, Refractory/classification', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Genes, fms', 'Genes, p53', 'Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/etiology/*genetics']",1997/03/01 00:00,1997/03/01 00:01,['1997/03/01 00:00'],"['1997/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Biomed Sci. 1997 Mar;54(1):65-70.,17,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually, both LDH and ALP activities were obviously higher in the bone marrow blood of patients with megaloblastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and chronic myeloid leukemia than in samples taken from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a disease characterized by a slower proliferation rate. While the expected increased LDH activity is the result of an accelerated turnover of bone marrow cells implying the release of this enzyme from the dividing and/or decaying cells, the much higher activity of the heat-labile alkaline phosphatase found in the bone marrow blood would reflect an enhanced local remodeling of bone structures, probably related to an expanded proliferating bone marrow.

However, criteria for patient and donor selection and the most effective transplant procedures, including the number of hematopoietic cells, remain to be defined. We tested factors influencing outcome of 174 patients with primary acute leukemia receiving non-T-cell depleted marrow from unrelated donors. Median patient age was 20 years (range, 0.5 to 54 years). A multivariable analysis found that leukemia in remission at the time of transplantation was associated with improved leukemia-free survival (relative risk [RR] of treatment failure: 0.5, confidence interval [CI]: 0.3 to 0.7), and presence of blasts in the peripheral blood, as opposed to marrow involvement only or isolated extramedullary relapse, was associated with impaired outcome (RR of treatment failure: 2.5, CI: 1.7 to 5.0).

In patients transplanted in remission, the use of a marrow cell dose above the median translated into less nonleukemic death (RR: 0.2, CI: 0.1 to 0.4) and better leukemia-free survival (RR of treatment failure: 0.3, CI: 0.2 to 0.6).

Our preliminary findings on eight pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suggested that the survival of patients carrying a homozygous p16 gene deletion was significantly inferior to that of those without a deletion. The present study on 48 patients tested the hypothesis that the clinical outcome for pediatric ALL patients is correlated with the presence or absence of the p16 gene. Overall, nine of 48 children (18.3%) carried a homozygous p16 deletion. Such deletions were significantly more common (P = .003) among T-ALL patients (five of eight, 62.5%) than among precursor-B-ALL patients (four of 40, 10.0%). Of nine patients exhibiting p16 deletions, eight (88.9%) were classified as high-risk patients by the recognized prognostic factors of age, white blood cell count, and T-cell phenotype. The 4-year event-free survival in the study population as a whole was 72.7%. Without adjustment for other risk factors (univariate model), the presence of a homozygous p16 deletion was associated with a markedly increased probability of both relapse (P = .0003) and death (P = .002). These findings raise the question of whether the p16 deletion itself confers an increased risk of relapse after adjusting for the known risk factors. In this analysis, the estimated risk multiplier factor for relapse in patients carrying the p16 deletion was 14.0 (P = .0004) and for the risk of death 15.6 (P = .0008). We therefore conclude that the presence of a homozygous p16 deletion may well be an important risk factor for both relapse and death in childhood ALL, and that its prognostic effect is not a consequence of confounding by other factors already known to influence outcome in this disease.","['Kees, U R', 'Burton, P R', 'Lu, C', 'Baker, D L']","['Kees UR', 'Burton PR', 'Lu C', 'Baker DL']","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, TVW Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Perth, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/physiopathology', 'Prognosis']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 1;89(11):4161-6.,,,11,['S0006-4971(20)58249-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within this definition, there is heterogeneity among cases in cell morphology, karyotypic abnormalities, and clinical course. Trisomy 12, the most frequent karyotypic abnormality, is commonly found in a subset of CLL with atypical morphology. It has also been associated with advanced disease, and possibly with a less favorable prognosis. A further subset of cases with abnormalities involving chromosome 13q14 have typical lymphocyte morphology. Occasionally, the two abnormalities are found together. To assess the clonal history of the cell of origin in disease subsets defined by these two chromosomal abnormalities, we investigated the usage of V(H) genes and the pattern of somatic mutation in 10 cases of trisomy 12 with atypical morphology and eight cases of 13q14 abnormality with typical morphology. In addition, four cases with both chromosomal abnormalities were analyzed. Results confirm a common usage of the V(H)1 family in all subsets. However, the patterns of somatic mutation were distinct, with cases of trisomy 12 showing a minimal level of mutation (mean +/- SD, 0.34% +/- 0.86%) and cases of 13q14 abnormality showing significant levels (6.5% +/- 1.67%). The four cases with both abnormalities showed a mixed pattern. All mutated cases had intraclonal homogeneity, and three of 10 had a pattern indicative of antigen selection.

However, the cellular or molecular factors responsible for a delay in B-CLL cell death are unknown. B-CLL cells do express receptors for interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and IFN-gamma, and activation of both has been shown to promote B-CLL survival in vitro by preventing apoptosis. The interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor is another member of the IFN receptor family, but its ligand, IL-10, has been reported to induce apoptosis in B-CLL cells. In the current study, we undertook a biochemical analysis of IL-10 receptor expression on freshly isolated B-CLL cells and characterized the functional responsiveness of IL-10 binding to its constitutively expressed receptor. We show that B-CLL cells bind IL-10 with significant specificity and express between 47 and 127 IL-10 receptor sites per cell, with a dissociation constant in the range of 168 to 426 x 10(-12) mol/L. Ligand binding and activation of the IL-10 receptor expressed on B-CLL cells results in the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT3 proteins. This pattern of STAT protein phosphorylation is identical to IL-10 receptor activation on normal cells and similar to IFN-alpha (STAT1 and STAT3) and IFN-gamma (STAT1) receptor activation in CLL. Further, in consecutive samples of fresh blood obtained from patients with B-CLL cells, the addition of IL-10 inhibited B-CLL proliferation, enhanced B-CLL differentiation, but did not induce apoptosis. Indeed, IL-10, like IFN-gamma, was able to significantly reduce the amount of B-CLL cell death caused by hydrocortisone-induced apoptosis. We conclude that cytokines, which signal through the interferon family of receptors, have comparable functional effects on B-CLL cells.","['Jurlander, J', 'Lai, C F', 'Tan, J', 'Chou, C C', 'Geisler, C H', 'Schriber, J', 'Blumenson, L E', 'Narula, S K', 'Baumann, H', 'Caligiuri, M A']","['Jurlander J', 'Lai CF', 'Tan J', 'Chou CC', 'Geisler CH', 'Schriber J', 'Blumenson LE', 'Narula SK', 'Baumann H', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-10)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-10', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Trans-Activators/immunology/metabolism']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 1;89(11):4146-52.,,"['CA26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA65670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK33886/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",11,['S0006-4971(20)58247-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We isolated a novel subline, UT-7/GM after long-term culture of UT-7 with GM-CSF. The hemoglobin concentration and gamma-globin and EPO-receptor mRNA levels were significantly higher in EPO-treated UT-7/GM cells than in untreated cells. In contrast, the platelet factor 4 and glycoprotein IIb mRNA levels were much higher in thrombopoietin (TPO)-treated UT-7/GM cells than in untreated cells. Some TPO-treated cells had morphologically mature megakaryocytic characteristics such as a developed demarcation membrane in the cytoplasm and multilobular nuclei. These findings indicate that UT-7/GM is a bipotential cell line that can be induced to differentiate into erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages by EPO and TPO, respectively. Moreover, a minority of UT-7/GM cells acquired a high hemoglobin concentration by treatment with TPO, suggesting that TPO in part induced the erythroid differentiation of the UT-7/GM cells. Interestingly, GM-CSF inhibited the EPO- or TPO-induced erythroid differentiation and the TPO-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of UT-7/GM cells. These results support the hypothesis that cytokines influence the programming of gene expression required for lineage commitment or differentiation.","['Komatsu, N', 'Kirito, K', 'Shimizu, R', 'Kunitama, M', 'Yamada, M', 'Uchida, M', 'Takatoku, M', 'Eguchi, M', 'Miura, Y']","['Komatsu N', 'Kirito K', 'Shimizu R', 'Kunitama M', 'Yamada M', 'Uchida M', 'Takatoku M', 'Eguchi M', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Minamikawachi-machi, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Erythrocytes/*pathology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Thrombopoietin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 1;89(11):4021-33.,,,11,['S0006-4971(20)58231-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyploidization of UT-7 cells was induced by the microtubule-depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), but the effect was much more striking with nocodazole. By contrast, induction of cytoplasmic maturation, as judged by beta-thromboglobulin production and platelet factor 4 expression, was more prominent in TPA-treated cells than in nocodazole-treated cells. Nocodazole and TPA could act synergistically to increase ploidy and to enhance the expression of mature phenotypes. Human thrombopoietin induced functional maturation but not polyploidization in UT-7 cells and also acts synergistically with nocodazole. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 was upregulated at the early stage of megakaryocytic differentiation, and overexpression of p21 resulted in an increase in ploidy of UT-7 cells. This suggests that p21 is implicated in polyploidization via suppression of CDC2 activity at mitosis. UT-7 but not HL-60 cells could incorporate [3H]thymidine in the presence of TPA, indicating the presence of megakaryocyte-specific licensing factor to allow DNA replication during differentiation. Taking these data together, we propose that megakaryocytic differentiation consists of two distinct processes, polyploidization and functional maturation, and that these two processes are independently regulated.","['Kikuchi, J', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Iwase, S', 'Terui, Y', 'Nakamura, M', 'Kitagawa, S', 'Kitagawa, M', 'Komatsu, N', 'Miura, Y']","['Kikuchi J', 'Furukawa Y', 'Iwase S', 'Terui Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Kitagawa S', 'Kitagawa M', 'Komatsu N', 'Miura Y']","['Department of Hematology, Jichi Medical School, Kawachi-gun, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology/physiology', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', '*Polyploidy']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 1;89(11):3980-90.,,,11,['S0006-4971(20)58226-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty consecutive patients, median age, 40 years (21 to 54) and diagnoses of chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (n = 5), acute myeloblastic leukemia (n = 7), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 2), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (n = 1), refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (n = 3), histiocytosis X (n = 1), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1), were conditioned with cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) and total body irradiation (13 Gy; 4 fractions). HLA identical sibling donors received G-CSF at 10 microg/kg/d subcutaneously (SC); on days 5 and 6 (19 cases) and days 5 to 8 (1 case) donors underwent 10 L leukapheresis. PBPC were purified by positive selection of CD34+ cells using immunoadsorption biotin-avidin method (Ceprate SC) and were infused in the patients as the sole source of progenitor cells. No growth factors were administered posttransplant. The median recovery of CD34+ cells after the procedure was of 65%. The median number of CD34+ cells infused in the patients was 2.9 (range, 1.5 to 8.6) x 10(6)/kg. The median number of CD3+ cells administered was 0.42 x 10(6)/kg (range, 0.1 to 2). All patients engrafted. Neutrophil counts >500 and >1,000/microL were achieved at a median of 14 days (range, 10 to 18) and 15 days (range, 11 to 27), respectively. Likewise, platelet counts >20,000 and >50,000/microL were observed at a median of 10 days (range, 6 to 23) and 17 days (range, 12 to 130), respectively. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine plus methylprednisolone. No patient developed either grade II to IV acute or extensive chronic GVHD. After a median follow-up of 7.5 months (range, 2 to 22) three patients have relapsed, and one of them is again in hematologic and cytogenetic remission after infusion of the donor lymphocytes.

Sixteen of the 20 patients are alive in remission after a median follow-up of 7.5 months (range, 2 to 22).

A Pediatric Oncology Group Study.,3960-6,"This report describes the prognostic significance of the intensity of surface membrane antigen expression in a series of 1,231 children older than 1 year with newly diagnosed B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated on Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) treatment protocols. All patients had dual-color flow cytometric immunophenotyping performed at a central reference laboratory with a standard panel of monoclonal antibodies. The flow cytometers used in the study were calibrated with a standard fluorescence microparticle that permitted conversion of relative fluorescence channels to standard units of mean equivalents of soluble fluorochrome (MESF). In univariate analysis, fluorescence intensity of CD45 and CD20 was significantly associated with event-free survival (EFS), whereas other markers showed no significant correlation with outcome. Patients whose blasts were greater than the 75th percentile of intensity for CD45 (corresponding to 18,000 MESF units with CD45-FITC, or about 8% of the intensity of normal lymphocytes) fared significantly worse than those with lower-density CD45, and those whose blasts were greater than the 25th percentile of intensity for CD20 (corresponding to 17,900 MESF units with CD20-PE) had a poorer EFS. The intensity of both CD45 and CD20 was independently correlated with outcome. There was no significant correlation between intensity of expression of either antigen and traditional clinical risk factors, ploidy, or t(9;22) or t(1;19). All patients with t(4;11) had CD45 intensity greater than the 75th percentile, but CD45 intensity retained its prognostic significance after adjusting for t(4;11). In multivariate analysis, both CD45 intensity greater than the 75th percentile and CD20 intensity greater than the 25th percentile were significantly correlated with poor outcome independently of previously reported poor prognostic factors including National Cancer Institute (NCI) risk group, ploidy, trisomies of 4 and 10, and adverse translocations including t(1;19), t(9;22), and t(4;11). We conclude that in childhood B-precursor ALL, the intensity of expression of CD20 and CD45 provides prognostic information not available from simple consideration of antigen expression as positive or negative, and adds to that obtained from traditional clinical and biologic risk factors.","['Borowitz, M J', 'Shuster, J', 'Carroll, A J', 'Nash, M', 'Look, A T', 'Camitta, B', 'Mahoney, D', 'Lauer, S J', 'Pullen, D J']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Shuster J', 'Carroll AJ', 'Nash M', 'Look AT', 'Camitta B', 'Mahoney D', 'Lauer SJ', 'Pullen DJ']","['Pediatric Oncology Group, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 Jun 1;89(11):3960-6.,,,11,['S0006-4971(20)58223-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the interactions of a zinc finger peptide, p10-ZF, comprising residues 24-41 of p10, and a doubly mutated 24-41 peptide, p10-ZF' in which the positions of Y and W are interchanged, also are reported. The measurements focus on the direct involvement of the sole W residue in the nucleic acid interaction. Fluorescence quenching and salt-back titrations indicate complex formation of p10 with several octanucleotides--(dT)8, (dI)8, (dU)7dT, and (5-BrdU)7dT--and with the polynucleotides poly(dT) and poly(dI). Poly(dI) binds with the highest affinity. Apparent binding constants and salt-back midpoints are reported. Neither p10-ZF nor p10-ZF' exhibits significant fluorescence quenching by these DNA substrates. Binding of p10-ZF to fluorescent poly(ethenoadenylic acid) was detected with greatly reduced affinity relative to p10, but binding of p10-ZF' was undetectable. These results are in general agreement with phosphorescence and ODMR measurements monitoring W. Addition of poly(I) to p10 leads to a phosphorescence red shift, reduction in the zero-field splitting (ZFS) parameters D and E, and a significantly reduced phosphorescence lifetime, each consistent with aromatic stacking interactions between W and the nucleobases. These effects are smaller with p10-ZF and undetectable with p10-ZF'. Poly(U) produces no significant changes in the triplet state parameters of W; no stacking interactions are observed even for p10. (5-BrdU)7dT yields large phosphorescence red shifts in p10 and p10-ZF, and reductions of D, but no significant heavy atom effects. These effects probably are due to enhanced local polarizability caused by Br, but any stacking interactions in these complexes would exclude van der Waals contacts between W and the Br atoms.","['Wu, J Q', 'Maki, A H', 'Ozarowski, A', 'Urbaneja, M A', 'Henderson, L E', 'Casas-Finet, J R']","['Wu JQ', 'Maki AH', 'Ozarowski A', 'Urbaneja MA', 'Henderson LE', 'Casas-Finet JR']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', '25249-22-3 (Poly I)', '8DUH1N11BX (Tryptophan)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Luminescent Measurements', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*metabolism', 'Poly I/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tryptophan/metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/*metabolism', '*Zinc Fingers']",1997/05/20 00:00,1997/05/20 00:01,['1997/05/20 00:00'],"['1997/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1997 May 20;36(20):6115-23. doi: 10.1021/bi962951o.,,['ES-02662/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],20,"['10.1021/bi962951o [doi]', 'bi962951o [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of the success of this drug in the treatment of human cancers, a significant proportion of patients treated with etoposide eventually develop secondary leukemias that are characterized by translocations at chromosome band 11q23. Since similar translocations are associated with primary leukemias in previously untreated infants, we questioned whether they could also be triggered by the actions of ""endogenous topoisomerase II poisons"". Recent studies, which demonstrated that several forms of spontaneous DNA damage stimulate cleavage mediated by Drosophila topoisomerase II, suggest that DNA lesions may act as these endogenous poisons. Therefore, to determine whether the ability to recognize spontaneous DNA damage has been conserved from this lower eukaryote to mammalian species, the effects of apurinic sites, apyrimidinic sites, and deaminated cytosine residues on human topoisomerase IIalpha were assessed. All three lesions were potent poisons of the human enzyme and stimulated cleavage when located within the four-base overhang generated by enzyme-mediated DNA scission.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients with acute leukemia received an allogeneic T-depleted bone marrow transplant from an HLA-matched (n=52) or one locus mismatched (n=2) sibling donor between June 1989 and November 1993. Nineteen acute myeloid leukemia patients and 17 acute lymphoid leukemia patients were in complete remission, and 11 acute myeloid leukemia patients and 7 acute lymphoid leukemia patients were in relapse. Patients were preconditioned with hyperfractionated total body irradiation of 1.2 Gy three times a day on days -9 to -6 (total 14.4 Gy), 10 mg/kg thiotepa on day -5, 4 mg/kg rabbit antithymocyte globulin on days -4 to -1, and 50 mg/kg cyclophosphamide on days -3 and -2. RESULTS: All patients were fully engrafted at a median of 15 days after transplant. No patient rejected the transplant or developed acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease. Of 19 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in complete remission, 14 survive. Four of the 11 patients with acute myeloid leukemia in relapse survive. Twelve acute myeloid leukemia patients died (three of relapse, eight of toxicity, one of other causes). Eleven of 24 patients with acute lymphoid leukemia (one treated in relapse) are alive in complete remission; the other 13 died (nine of relapse, four of toxicity). Interstitial pneumonia, the main cause of toxic death, occurred in 9.26% of total patients. The median follow-up time at this writing is 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of rejection and graft-versus-host disease and the relatively low relapse and toxicity rates are evidence for the efficacy of our conditioning regimen.","['Aristei, C', 'Aversa, F', 'Raymondi, C', 'Marsella, A R', 'Panizza, B M', 'Perrucci, E', 'Piro, F', 'Maranzano, E', 'Lupattelli, M', 'Martelli, M F', 'Latini, P']","['Aristei C', 'Aversa F', 'Raymondi C', 'Marsella AR', 'Panizza BM', 'Perrucci E', 'Piro F', 'Maranzano E', 'Lupattelli M', 'Martelli MF', 'Latini P']","['Institute of Radiotherapy Oncology, General Hospital and Perugia University, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer J Sci Am,The cancer journal from Scientific American,9513568,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/11/01 00:00,2006/10/25 09:00,['1996/11/01 00:00'],"['1996/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '1996/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer J Sci Am. 1996 Nov-Dec;2(6):330-4.,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both chains belong to the superfamily of cytokine receptors characterized by a common structural feature, i.e., the presence of at least two fibronectin-like folds in the extracellular domain, which was first identified in the growth hormone receptor. The GM-CSF receptor (GMR)-alpha chain confers low affinity binding only (5-10 nM), whereas the other chain, betac, does not bind GM-CSF by itself but confers high affinity binding when associated with GMR-alpha (25-100 pM). The present study was designed to define the assembly of the GMR complex at the molecular level through site-directed mutagenesis guided by homology modeling with the growth hormone receptor complex. In our three-dimensional model, R280 of GMR-alpha, located in the F'-G' loop and close to the WSSWS motif, is in the vicinity of the ligand Asp112, suggesting the possibility of electrostatic interaction between these two residues. Through site directed mutagenesis, we provide several lines of evidence indicating the importance of electrostatic interaction in ligand-receptor recognition. First, mutagenesis of GMR-alphaR280 strikingly ablated ligand binding in the absence of beta common (betac); ligand binding was restored in the presence of betac with, nonetheless, a significant shift from high (26 pM) toward low affinity (from 2 to 13 nM). The rank order of the dissociation constant for the different GMR-alphaR280 mutations where Lys > Gln > Met > Asp, suggesting the importance of the charge at this position. Second, a mutant GM-CSF with charge reversal mutation at position Asp112 exhibited a 1,000-fold decrease in affinity in receptor binding, whereas charge ablation or conservative mutations were the least affected (10-20-fold). Third, removal of the charge at position R280 of GMR-alpha introduced a 10-fold decrease in the association rate constant and only a 2-fold change in the dissociation rate constant, suggesting that R280 is implicated in ligand recognition, possibly through interaction with Asp112 of GM-CSF. For all R280 mutants, the half-efficient concentrations of GM-CSF required for membrane (receptor binding) to nuclear events (c-fos promoter activation) and cell proliferation (thymidine incorporation) were in the same range, indicating that the threshold for biologic activity is governed mainly by the affinity of ligand-receptor interaction. Furthermore, mutation of other residues in the immediate vicinity of R280 was less drastic. Sequence alignment and modeling of interleukin (IL)-3R and IL-5R identified an arginine residue at the tip of a beta turn in a highly divergent context at the F'-G' loop, close to a conserved structural element, the WSXWS motif, suggesting the possibility of a ligand association mechanism similar to the one described herein for GMR.","['Rajotte, D', 'Cadieux, C', 'Haman, A', 'Wilkes, B C', 'Clark, S C', 'Hercus, T', 'Woodcock, J A', 'Lopez, A', 'Hoang, T']","['Rajotte D', 'Cadieux C', 'Haman A', 'Wilkes BC', 'Clark SC', 'Hercus T', 'Woodcock JA', 'Lopez A', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Laboratory of Hemopoiesis and Leukemia, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/metabolism', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Software', 'Transfection/genetics']",1997/06/02 00:00,1997/06/02 00:01,['1997/06/02 00:00'],"['1997/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1997 Jun 2;185(11):1939-50. doi: 10.1084/jem.185.11.1939.,,,11,['10.1084/jem.185.11.1939 [doi]'],,PMC2196330,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fusion protein is able to direct the cytocidal action of the DT enzymatic region only to cells which bear the IL-2R. The human IL-2R exists in three forms: low, intermediate and high affinity. The high-affinity form is believed to be the biologically relevant form on mature, activated T-lymphocytes, B-lymphocytes and monocytes. DAB389IL-2 is able to bind selectively to the high-affinity IL-2R in a concentration-dependent manner, and once bound is internalised via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Upon acidification of the formed vesicle, the enzymatic portion of the fusion protein is believed to pass into the cytosol where it ultimately inhibits protein synthesis by inactivation of elongation factor-2, resulting in cell death. The constitutive expression of the IL-2R on certain leukaemic and lymphomatous cells of T and B cell origin has been reported to occur in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL), Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). A multicentre DAB389IL-2 dose-escalation study of patients with IL-2R expressing lymphomas has been conducted. A 10-fold range of doses were evaluated on a five-daily dose schedule. Patients received up to six courses, with an additional two courses permitted for patients with partial responses that appeared to be still improving after six courses. Most adverse experiences were transient and mild. Preliminary assessment of response indicated five complete responses (CR, duration ongoing at 20, 11, 7, 5 and 4 months) and seven partial responses (PR, duration 3-20 months) in the 35 patients with CTCL. One CR (duration > 20 months) in a patient with NHL (Lennett's lymphoma) and two PR (duration 9 and 2 months) in 17 patients with B-cell NHL have been observed.

High-performance liquid chromatography with mercury cathode electrochemical detection was used for determining lipid oxidation products, including the following cholesterol-derived hydroperoxides: 5 alpha-OOH, 6 alpha-OOH, 6 beta-OOH, and unresolved 7 alpha, 7 beta-OOH. Among these species, 5 alpha-, 6 alpha-, and 6 beta-OOH (singlet oxygen adducts) were predominant in the early stages of photooxidation, whereas 7 alpha- and 7 beta-OOH (products of free radical reactions) became so after prolonged irradiation or during dark incubation after exposure to a light dose. These mechanistic changes were studied in a unique way by monitoring shifts in the peroxide ratio, i.e., 7-OOH/5 alpha-OOH, or 7-OOH/6-OOH. When cells (10(7)/ml) were exposed to a visible light fluence of 0.6 J/cm2 in the presence of 10 microM merocyanine 540, 7-OOH/5 alpha-OOH increased by approximately 100% after 2 h of dark incubation at 37 degrees C. The increase was much larger (approximately 250%) when cells were photooxidized after treatment with 1 microM ferric-8-hydroxyquinoline, a lipophilic iron donor, whereas no increase was observed when cells were pretreated with 100 microM desferrioxamine, an avid iron chelator/redox inhibitor. Correspondingly, postirradiation formation of thiobarbituric acid-reactive material was markedly enhanced by ferric-8-hydroxyquinoline and suppressed by desferrioxamine, as was the extent of cell killing. When added to cells after a light dose, chain-breaking antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene and alpha-tocopherol strongly protected against cell killing and slowed the increase in 7-OOH/5 alpha-OOH ratio. It is apparent from these results that (1) the 7-OOH/5 alpha-OOH or 7-OOH/6-OOH ratio can be used as a highly sensitive index of singlet oxygen vs. free radical dominance in photodynamically stressed cells; and (2) that postirradiation chain peroxidation plays an important role in photodynamically initiated cell killing.","['Geiger, P G', 'Korytowski, W', 'Lin, F', 'Girotti, A W']","['Geiger PG', 'Korytowski W', 'Lin F', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Iron Compounds)', '0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', '7J48214Z9H (cholesterol hydroperoxide)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cholesterol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Free Radicals/metabolism', 'Iron Compounds/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', '*Light', '*Lipid Peroxidation', 'Lipid Peroxides/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidinones/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 1997;23(1):57-68. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(96)00587-4.,,['P01-CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],1,"['S0891-5849(96)00587-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(96)00587-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metallothionein gene expression is transcriptionally regulated by dietary zinc and thus could serve as an assessment parameter based on zinc-dependent function. We used semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to establish that MT mRNA is increased in a human monocytic cell line by addition of zinc to the medium. To examine this response in human subjects, a dietary supplement of 50 mg zinc gluconate/d was given for 15 d. Monocytes were purified from venous blood using NycoPrep 1.068. Monocyte purity was determined by flow cytometry using fluorescent anti-human monocyte CD14 antibodies. Total monocyte RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA by reverse transcription. Competitive RT-PCR was used to analyze differences between cDNA levels that are proportional to MT mRNA levels in monocytes from zinc-supplemented and control subjects. RT-PCR oligonucleotide primers were designed to amplify both a 201 bp segment of the human MT cDNA and a 180 bp competitor cDNA template. The 180 bp competitor cDNA template was used for MT cDNA quantitation. The RT-PCR data show that there was a significant increase in monocyte MT mRNA in subjects within 6 d of zinc supplementation, which remained elevated at d 15 of supplementation. In contrast, plasma zinc was greater at d 6 of zinc supplementation, but by d 15 of supplementation, while still elevated, was close to control levels. These data suggest that monocyte MT mRNA levels respond to zinc supplementation and that the response could serve as a more useful assessment variable than plasma zinc for the measurement of zinc status in humans.","['Sullivan, V K', 'Cousins, R J']","['Sullivan VK', 'Cousins RJ']","['Food Science and Human Nutrition Department, Center for Nutritional Sciences, University of Florida, Gainesville 32611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Complementary/analysis/chemistry/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Food, Fortified', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Metallothionein/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 1997 May;127(5):694-8. doi: 10.1093/jn/127.5.694.,,"['DK07667/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK31127/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",5,['10.1093/jn/127.5.694 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using cells prelabelled to equilibrium with [14C]acetate, it was shown that the amount of ceramide approximately doubled after 24 h incubation with anti-Fas, but the time course of ceramide changes was slower than that of anti-Fas-induced cell death. Complete inhibition of the effects of anti-Fas on cell death and on ceramide production was observed when the caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-(O-methyl)fluoromethane (zVAD.fmk) was added together with anti-Fas, but N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Ala-fluoromethane (a structurally similar cathepsin B inhibitor) had no effect. Treatment of cells with the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 also doubled ceramide levels, but in this case the effect was complete within 2 h, was not blocked by zVAD.fmk and was not associated with increases in nuclear fragmentation. These results suggest that ceramide is not an upstream messenger in Fas-mediated apoptosis and may instead be produced as a consequence of processes downstream of the activation of caspases and increases in cytosolic calcium concentration.","['Sillence, D J', 'Allan, D']","['Sillence DJ', 'Allan D']","['Department of Physiology, University College London, Rockefeller Building, University Street, London WC1E 6JJ, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acetates/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/immunology/*physiology']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1997 May 15;324 ( Pt 1):29-32. doi: 10.1042/bj3240029.,,,,['10.1042/bj3240029 [doi]'],,PMC1218397,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allergic manifestations in recipients long after bone marrow transplantation have been reported. A case involving transfer of atopy manifested as food allergy-induced-atopic dermatitis is reported. METHODS: The donor and the patient were investigated by prick tests and RAST to the same food allergens. Single blind, oral challenge to egg documented food allergy in the recipient. RESULTS: A 5-year-old boy without history of atopy developed severe atopic dermatitis after bone marrow transplantation from his HLA-identical sister for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient's course had been marked previously by acute graft versus host disease and cytomegalovirus infection. Immunoallergic evaluation showed an exquisite sensitization to egg, peanut, and soybean. Total IgE was 6400 KIU/L. Concomitantly, the donor showed the same sensitizations. Absolute avoidance resulted in the regression of atopic dermatitis. Subsequently, new sensitization to wheat flour, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, birch, and plantain pollens was detected. The donor developed asthma. CONCLUSIONS: This case gives evidence of the transfer of sensitization from donor to recipient. The passive transfer of memory cells within the bone marrow inoculum is a possible mechanism. The current concept of allergy supports down regulation of Th1 cells to the benefit of Th2 cells. Additional deregulation induced by acute graft versus host disease, cytomegalovirus infection, and immunosuppression is possible.","['Bellou, A', 'Kanny, G', 'Fremont, S', 'Moneret-Vautrin, D A']","['Bellou A', 'Kanny G', 'Fremont S', 'Moneret-Vautrin DA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Immunology, Allergology, University Hospital and Medical Center, Nancy, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol,"Annals of allergy, asthma & immunology : official publication of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology",9503580,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Food Hypersensitivity/complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Radioallergosorbent Test', 'Skin Tests']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Allergy Asthma Immunol. 1997 May;78(5):513-6. doi: 10.1016/s1081-1206(10)63240-1.,,,5,['10.1016/s1081-1206(10)63240-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein and mineral concentrations of the NIH-07 diet may have increased some diet- and age-associated lesions such as nephropathy. A number of experimental nonpurified diets with lower protein and higher fat and fiber (approximately 15% protein, 7-8.5% fat, and 9-14% crude fiber) than the NIH-07 diet were formulated and evaluated in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Decreasing protein content of the diet decreased protein consumption by approximately 30% and decreased severity of nephropathy without affecting growth. Increased fat intake seemed to have decreased the incidence or severity of leukemia, a lethal neoplasm of F344 rats. Increasing fiber content without decreasing the caloric density lowered body weight gain and slowed growth of mammary tumors. Higher fat and/or fiber intake decreased the incidences of adrenal pheochromocytomas and medullary hyperplasia in male rats. Nonpurified diets with lower protein and higher fat and fiber concentrations than the NIH-07 diet decreased or delayed diet- and age-associated lesions and increased survivals in 2-y studies. On the basis of these results, a new cereal-based nonpurified diet, designated as NTP-2000, was formulated with approximately 14.5% protein, approximately 8.2% fat, approximately 9.3% fiber and a calcium:phosphorus molar ratio of approximately 1.3. The NTP-2000 diet was compared with the NIH-07 diet in a 13-wk study in F344 rats. The NTP-2000 diet was adequate for growth, did not affect the hematological parameters and did not cause substantial changes in blood chemistry, serum enzyme or serum electrolyte values. The NTP-2000 diet decreased liver and kidney weights, prevented nephrocalcinosis and decreased the severity of diet- and possibly age-associated lesions.","['Rao, G N']",['Rao GN'],"['National Toxicology Program, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,,IM,"['*Animal Feed', 'Animals', '*Diet', 'Female', '*Food, Formulated', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', '*Rodentia', '*Toxicology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 1997 May;127(5 Suppl):842S-846S. doi: 10.1093/jn/127.5.842S.,22,,5 Suppl,['10.1093/jn/127.5.842S [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/jn/127.5.842S [doi],

In preclinical studies, we previously demonstrated that carboxypetidase-G2 (CPDG2) rapidly hydrolyzes methotrexate to nontoxic metabolites. A protocol for the compassionate use of CPDG2 in patients who develop nephrotoxicity while receiving high-dose methotrexate was therefore developed. The pharmacologic and clinical outcome of CPDG2 rescue administered with thymidine and leucovorin in 20 patients is presented here. METHODS: Patients with high-dose methotrexate-induced renal dysfunction received one to three doses of CPDG2, 50 U/kg body weight intravenously (i.v.), thymidine 8 g/m2/d by continuous i.v. infusion, and standard pharmacokinetically guided leucovorin rescue. Plasma concentrations of methotrexate and its inactive metabolite 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) were measured before and after CPDG2 using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Tolerance of CPDG2 and thymidine, development of methotrexate toxicities, and recovery of renal function were monitored. RESULTS: Twenty patients who received high-dose methotrexate for osteosarcoma (n = 11), lymphoid cancers (n = 8), and gastric cancer (n = 1) developed nephrotoxicity (median serum creatinine, 3.2 mg/dL) and elevated plasma methotrexate concentrations (median, 201 mumol/L at hour 46). CPDG2 and thymidine rescue was well tolerated and resulted in a rapid 95.6% to 99.6% reduction in the plasma methotrexate concentration. Methotrexate-related toxicity was mild to moderate. Serum creatinine returned to normal values at a median of 22 days. CONCLUSION: CPDG2, thymidine, and leucovorin rescue was highly effective in 20 patients at high risk for developing life-threatening methotrexate toxicity after the onset of methotrexate-induced nephrotoxicity and delayed methotrexate excretion.","['Widemann, B C', 'Balis, F M', 'Murphy, R F', 'Sorensen, J M', 'Montello, M J', ""O'Brien, M"", 'Adamson, P C']","['Widemann BC', 'Balis FM', 'Murphy RF', 'Sorensen JM', 'Montello MJ', ""O'Brien M"", 'Adamson PC']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1928, USA. widemanb@pbmac.nci.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antidotes)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.- (Carboxypeptidases)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antidotes/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood', 'Carboxypeptidases/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/prevention & control', 'Leucovorin/*therapeutic use', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma/blood/drug therapy', 'Thymidine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):2125-34. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.2125.,,,5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.2125 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Children's Leukemia Cooperative Group.,1824-30,"PURPOSE: The in vivo response to prephase corticosteroid therapy for 1 week has been described as a major prognostic factor in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with less than 1,000 blasts/microL at day 8 are considered responders and have a better prognosis. This prephase therapy is usually considered as an evaluation of glucocorticoid sensitivity. In fact, it also includes one intrathecal (IT) injection of methotrexate (MTX). In this study, we try to clarify the influence of this injection of IT MTX on the response to the prephase therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed the response to prephase therapy in 1,044 children with ALL entered onto the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) trial 58881 of the Children's Leukemia Cooperative Group (CLCG). Analysis was restricted to 732 cases with an initial blast count greater than 1,000/microL. The following variables were tested to analyze response to prephase therapy: age, sex, evaluated risk factor (RF), blast count on day 0, actual dose of prednisolone administered, immunophenotype (T v non-T), and day of IT MTX. For statistical analysis, the variable day of IT MTX (D) was stratified into three groups: group 1 if D less than 2, group 2 if D > or = 2 but < or = 6, and group 3 if D greater than 6. RESULTS: All variables tested had a significant influence on response to the prephase therapy. This was especially true for IT MTX: 90.4% responders in group 1, 76.9% in group 2, and 70% in group 3 (P < .001). Immunophenotype was also a major predictor of response to the prephase: 88% responders in B-lineage ALL versus 56.2% in T-lineage ALL. IT MTX had a significant influence in B-lineage ALL (96% responders in group 1, 90% in group 2, and 79% in group 3; P < .001), whereas the influence could not be detected in T-lineage ALL. CONCLUSION: These results clearly demonstrate a therapeutic systemic effect of low doses of IT MTX in childhood ALL, and response to prephase therapy should not be considered as an in vivo test for cortico-sensitivity only. Earlier use of IT MTX leads to a higher percentage of responders.","['Thyss, A', 'Suciu, S', 'Bertrand, Y', 'Mazingue, F', 'Robert, A', 'Vilmer, E', 'Mechinaud, F', 'Benoit, Y', 'Brock, P', 'Ferster, A', 'Lutz, P', 'Boutard, P', 'Marguerite, G', 'Plouvier, E', 'Michel, G', 'Plantaz, D', 'Munzer, M', 'Rialland, X', 'Chantraine, J M', 'Norton, L', 'Solbu, G', 'Philippe, N', 'Otten, J']","['Thyss A', 'Suciu S', 'Bertrand Y', 'Mazingue F', 'Robert A', 'Vilmer E', 'Mechinaud F', 'Benoit Y', 'Brock P', 'Ferster A', 'Lutz P', 'Boutard P', 'Marguerite G', 'Plouvier E', 'Michel G', 'Plantaz D', 'Munzer M', 'Rialland X', 'Chantraine JM', 'Norton L', 'Solbu G', 'Philippe N', 'Otten J']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/administration & dosage', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):1824-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1824.,,"['5U10CA11488-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10CA11488-26/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1824 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have therefore examined the incidence of second cancers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 350 HCL patients was obtained from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Cancer Registry's computerized data base and from chart review. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) (observed/expected [O/E]) were calculated with the expected number determined using age, sex, and calendar-year-specific rates from the Connecticut Tumor Registry and from national mortality data, respectively. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 50 years and the median follow-up duration was 6 years. Twenty-six patients developed a second cancer at least 6 months after the HCL diagnosis (O/E ratio, 1.34; P = .08). There was no excess of malignancy among patients treated with interferon alfa (IFN-alpha; P = .27), 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CDA; P = .37), or deoxycoformycin (DCF; P = .7). However, an excess of myeloma-related neoplasms (O/E, 13.04; P < .001) and lymphomas (O/E, 8.7; P = .03) was observed. Survival from the advent of systemic therapy for HCL was better than before this time (P = .0009). Nevertheless, mortality remained excessive (O/E, 6.17; P < .001), mainly because of HCL-related infections and secondary malignancy. CONCLUSION: Among 350 patients with HCL, there was an increase in the number of second cancers; however, it did not reach statistical significance and was not associated with therapy. The incidence of lymphoid neoplasms was significantly higher than expected. Survival since the advent of effective systemic therapy was excellent, although excess mortality was still observed.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Strom, S S', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Keating, M J', 'Jiang, H', 'Adams, T', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Strom SS', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating MJ', 'Jiang H', 'Adams T', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Referral and Consultation/statistics & numerical data', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):1803-10. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1803.,,,5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1803 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I study using the nonimmunosuppressive MDR1 blocker SDZ PSC-833 (PSC) in combination with mitoxantrone (MITO) and etoposide (VP) was performed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Starting doses (LVL0) of MITO (3.25 mg/m2/d on days 1 and 3 to 6) and VP (210 mg/m2/d on days 1 and 3 to 5) were 40% of the maximal-tolerated dose (MTD) from a prior study. A 1.5-mg/kg loading dose of PSC was followed by a 120-hour continuous infusion of 10 mg/kg/d on days 2 to 6. Blood samples for PSC, MITO, and VP pharmacokinetics (PK) were taken on days 1 and 3, and samples for MDR1 expression were taken on day 0. RESULTS: Severe mucositis developed in all patients at LVL0; therefore, MITO and VP doses were reduced to 2.5 and 170 mg/m2 (LVL-1) for the next seven patients, and this dose proved to be MTD. All LVL0 and three LVL-1 patients had transient elevations in the serum bilirubin level to > or = 4 mg/dL. Serum creatinine level increased to greater than 2 mg/dL in one case. There were no other grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities observed. The peripheral blood was cleared of leukemia in three LVL0 and four LVL-1 patients. The marrow was cleared of leukemic cells in one LVL0 and five LVL-1 patients, and a significant reduction in marrow leukemic infiltrate was observed in eight of 10. No patient achieved complete remission (CR), and all died of progressive disease (n = 8) or infection (n = 2). MDR1 expression was detected by fluorescent-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis in five of seven cases. An elevated MDR1 mRNA level was detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) in six of eight cases studied. Clearing of leukemia cells from the marrow occurred in four of six MDR1-positive and one of three MDR1-negative patients. Despite the fact that LVL0 doses had to be reduced due to toxicity, coadministration of PSC did not produce a consistent effect on MITO PK; however, it did repeatedly lead to increased levels of VP in the serum. CONCLUSION: We conclude that PSC-MITO-VP is a tolerable regimen with antileukemic activity. Addition of PSC necessitated a 66% reduction in MITO and VP doses from a prior study without PSC.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Estey, E', 'Madden, T', 'Tran, H T', 'Zhao, S', 'Consoli, U', 'Snell, V', 'Sanchez-Williams, G', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Keating, M', 'Newman, R A', 'Andreeff, M']","['Kornblau SM', 'Estey E', 'Madden T', 'Tran HT', 'Zhao S', 'Consoli U', 'Snell V', 'Sanchez-Williams G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M', 'Newman RA', 'Andreeff M']","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA. smk@odin.mdacc.tmc.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Recurrence']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):1796-802. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1796.,,,5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1796 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-one patients with t(15;17)(q22;q11-12) enrolled onto Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocol 8461, a prospective study of cytogenetics in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), were studied. Eighty of these 161 patients were treated solely with chemotherapy and evaluated for response to treatment and survival. PML-RAR alpha mRNA type was determined using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 56 patients. RESULTS: The incidence of secondary cytogenetic abnormalities was 32%. Among 80 patients treated with chemotherapy, the presence of a secondary chromosome abnormality was associated with longer complete remission (CR) duration (median, 29.9 v 15.7 months; P = .03) and longer event-free survival (EFS) duration (median, 17.0 v 12.2 months; P = .03). There was no difference in overall survival (P = .28). In a separate group of 56 patients with both cytogenetic and molecular data, 32 had the type L PML-RAR alpha transcript (intron 6 PML breakpoint). Of these 32 patients, four (12.5%) had chromosome changes in addition to t(15;17), whereas 12 of 20 patients (60%) with the type 5 PML-RAR alpha transcript (intron 3 PML breakpoint) had secondary cytogenetic changes (P < .001). CONCLUSION: (1) Secondary cytogenetic changes do not confer a poor prognosis in APL patients treated with anthracycline/cytarabine (Ara-C)-based chemotherapy; and (2) A highly significant relationship exists between the PML-RAR alpha 5 isoform (intron 3 PML genomic breakpoint) and secondary cytogenetic changes in APL.","['Slack, J L', 'Arthur, D C', 'Lawrence, D', 'Mrozek, K', 'Mayer, R J', 'Davey, F R', 'Tantravahi, R', 'Pettenati, M J', 'Bigner, S', 'Carroll, A J', 'Rao, K W', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Slack JL', 'Arthur DC', 'Lawrence D', 'Mrozek K', 'Mayer RJ', 'Davey FR', 'Tantravahi R', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Bigner S', 'Carroll AJ', 'Rao KW', 'Schiffer CA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. slack@dm3100.med.buffalo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):1786-95. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1786.,,"['CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59518/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1786 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peripheral-blood samples from 114 patients with ATL were examined by Southern blot analysis. In five chronic-type patients who showed disease progression to acute type, serial samples also were examined. RESULTS: Among 114 patients, 28 (24.6%) showed the deletions of p15 and/or p16 genes. The results were well correlated with the clinical subtypes. Patients with deleted p15 and/or p16 genes had significantly shorter survival times than the patients in whom both genes were preserved (P < .0001). A similar decline in survival time was observed in the analyses within the same subtypes. In multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model, the deletions of p15 and/or p16 genes emerged as an independent prognostic indicator. Moreover, three of the five chronic-type patients who progressed to acute type lost the p16 gene alone or both the p15 and p16 genes at their exacerbation phase. CONCLUSION: The results suggest the following: (1) that the deletions of p15 and/or p16 genes play a key role in the progression of ATL; and (2) that these deletions are reliable prognostic factors that predict shortened survival times.","['Yamada, Y', 'Hatta, Y', 'Murata, K', 'Sugawara, K', 'Ikeda, S', 'Mine, M', 'Maeda, T', 'Hirakata, Y', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Ogawa, S', 'Hirai, H', 'Koeffler, H P', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Yamada Y', 'Hatta Y', 'Murata K', 'Sugawara K', 'Ikeda S', 'Mine M', 'Maeda T', 'Hirakata Y', 'Kamihira S', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Ogawa S', 'Hirai H', 'Koeffler HP', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Count', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):1778-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1778.,,,5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1778 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: A total of 2,055 recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were entered onto the study. Transplants were performed between 1985 and 1991 and reported to the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry (IBMTR). Donors were HLA-identical siblings (n = 1,224); haploidentical relatives mismatched for one (n = 238) or two (n = 102) HLA-A, -B, or -DR antigens; or unrelated persons who were HLA-matched (n = 383) or mismatched for one HLA-A, -B, or -DR antigen (n = 108). HLA typing was performed using serologic techniques. RESULTS: Transplant-related mortality was significantly higher after alternative donor transplants than after HLA-identical sibling transplants. Among patients with early leukemia (CML in chronic phase or acute leukemia in first remission), 3-year transplant-related mortality (+/-SE) was 21% +/- 2% after HLA-identical sibling transplants and greater than 50% after all types of alternative donor transplants studied. Among patients with early leukemia, relative risks of treatment failure (inverse of leukemia-free survival), using HLA-identical sibling transplants as the reference group, were 2.43 (P < .0001) with 1-HLA-antigen-mismatched related donors, 3.79 (P < .0001) with 2-HLA-antigen-mismatched related donors, 2.11 (P < .0001) with HLA-matched unrelated donors, and 3.33 (P < .0001) with 1-HLA-antigen-mismatched unrelated donors. For patients with more advanced leukemia, differences in treatment failure were less striking: 1-HLA-antigen-mismatched relatives, 1.22 (P = not significant [NS]); 2-HLA-antigen-mismatched relatives, 1.81 (P < .0001); HLA-matched unrelated donors, 1.39 (P = .002); and 1-HLA-antigen-mismatched unrelated donors, 1.63 (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Although transplants from alternative donors are effective in some patients with leukemia, treatment failure is higher than after HLA-identical sibling transplants. Outcome depends on leukemia state, donor-recipient relationship, and degree of HLA matching. In early leukemia, alternative donor transplants have a more than twofold increased risk of treatment failure compared with HLA-identical sibling transplants. This difference is less in advanced leukemia.","['Szydlo, R', 'Goldman, J M', 'Klein, J P', 'Gale, R P', 'Ash, R C', 'Bach, F H', 'Bradley, B A', 'Casper, J T', 'Flomenberg, N', 'Gajewski, J L', 'Gluckman, E', 'Henslee-Downey, P J', 'Hows, J M', 'Jacobsen, N', 'Kolb, H J', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Masaoka, T', 'Rowlings, P A', 'Sondel, P M', 'van Bekkum, D W', 'van Rood, J J', 'Vowels, M R', 'Zhang, M J', 'Horowitz, M M']","['Szydlo R', 'Goldman JM', 'Klein JP', 'Gale RP', 'Ash RC', 'Bach FH', 'Bradley BA', 'Casper JT', 'Flomenberg N', 'Gajewski JL', 'Gluckman E', 'Henslee-Downey PJ', 'Hows JM', 'Jacobsen N', 'Kolb HJ', 'Lowenberg B', 'Masaoka T', 'Rowlings PA', 'Sondel PM', 'van Bekkum DW', 'van Rood JJ', 'Vowels MR', 'Zhang MJ', 'Horowitz MM']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Health Policy Institute, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', '*Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1997 May;15(5):1767-77. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1767.,,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],5,['10.1200/JCO.1997.15.5.1767 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four daunorubicin-resistant sublines, AML-2/D100, /D250, /D500, and /D1,000 were isolated. The values of relative resistance of each daunorubicin-resistant AML subline were about 3, 6, 18, and 23-fold, respectively, as compared to the AML-2 line with an IC50 of 5 nM. The daunorubicin-resistant AML-2 sublines also showed cross resistance to various anticancer drugs including another anthracycline doxorubicin, a Vinca alkaloid vincristine, and an epipodophyllotoxin etoposide. A functional assay using flow cytometry showed decreased accumulation of daunorubicin in these sublines as compared to that of AML-2, which was reversed by cyclosporin A or cyanide. The development of the ATP-dependent multidrug resistant phenotype was due to low to high levels of expression of P-glycoprotein (PGP). The major mechanisms of increased PGP appears to be associated with gene amplification. In addition, other mechanisms such as increased stability of protein or mRNA might be involved depending on the concentration of daunorubicin used for selection. However, a multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) was not involved in these resistant sublines. These daunorubicin-resistant AML-2 sublines could provide a useful model for the study of multidrug resistance mediated by PGP.","['Choi, C H', 'Ling, V']","['Choi CH', 'Ling V']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chosun University Medical School, Kwangju, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Cyanides)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Separation', 'Cyanides/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/04/30 00:00,1997/04/30 00:01,['1997/04/30 00:00'],"['1997/04/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/30 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cells. 1997 Apr 30;7(2):170-7.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared with the control group, administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) at 0.3% of the diet to male p53-deficient mice extended their lifespan by delaying death due to neoplasms (from 105 to 166 days on study, P = 0.002), primarily by suppressing lymphoblastic lymphoma (from 45 to 6% of neoplastic deaths, P = 0.010). Treatment with a synthetic DHEA analog, 16alpha-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one (compound 8354), at 0.15% of the diet also increased lifespan, to 140 days for mice that developed tumors (P = 0.037). The effects of these steroids on lifespan and tumor development did not appear to be strongly related to inhibition of food consumption and weight gain, in that a group pair-fed with control diet to the reduced food consumption of the DHEA-treated group developed and died of the same types of neoplasms at the same rate as the controls fed ad libitum. The chemopreventive effect of these steroids has been proposed to be due to suppression of DNA synthesis by inhibition of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway. Although DHEA and its analog are strong non-competitive inhibitors of this enzyme in vitro, treatment with DHEA did not deplete cellular nucleotide pools in the liver, as would have been predicted. The chemopreventive effect of DHEA in this model may be due to steroid-induced thymic atrophy and suppression of T cell lymphoma, permitting these mice to survive long enough to develop tumors with longer latency.","['Perkins, S N', 'Hursting, S D', 'Haines, D C', 'James, S J', 'Miller, B J', 'Phang, J M']","['Perkins SN', 'Hursting SD', 'Haines DC', 'James SJ', 'Miller BJ', 'Phang JM']","['Laboratory of Nutritional and Molecular Regulation, SAIC, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Androstenes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nucleotides)', '112859-71-9 (16-fluoro-5-androsten-17-one)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)']",IM,"['Androstenes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/*pharmacology', '*Genes, p53', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Longevity/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/etiology', 'Survival Analysis']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1997 May;18(5):989-94. doi: 10.1093/carcin/18.5.989.,,,5,['10.1093/carcin/18.5.989 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifteen patients with advanced CLL who received allogeneic transplantation were prospectively analysed. All patients had previously received chemotherapy with fludarabine for 3-15 courses; 12 were refractory. The median number of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes at the time of transplant was 0.49 x 10(9)/l and 0.23 x 10(9)/l, respectively. One patient was transplanted from a one HLA-antigen mismatched unrelated donor. Three others received a one or two antigen mismatched graft and 11 had HLA-identical sibling donors. Patients received cyclosporine or tacrolimus in addition to methotrexate or methylprednisolone for prophylaxis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Fourteen patients engrafted; one patient had graft failure, but recovered after therapy with intravenous immunoglobulin. 13 (87%) achieved complete remission (CR). Nine (53%) remain alive and in CR with a median follow-up of 36 (range 3-60) months. None developed visceral graft-versus-host disease. These data compared favourably to published reports in other leukaemia patients and for patients with CLL who received a comparable immunosuppressive therapy but without prior fludarabine exposure. This data indicates that allogeneic haemopoietic transplantation can induce durable remission in patients with CLL refractory to fludarabine and that it is reasonable to delay transplantation until failure of fludarabine therapy. It also suggests that prior exposure to fludarabine may decrease the incidence of severe aGVHD, possibly through its immunosuppressive effects.

Aberrant signalling through the CD40 and CD95 antigens could thus participate in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies. The expression and function of CD40 and CD95 on neoplastic B cells from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) were examined. CD40 was expressed by all 30 B-cell tumours, whereas CD95 was detected on neoplastic B cells in only one of 10 cases of ALL, two of 10 cases of CLL, and three of 10 cases of NHL. Incubation with an agonistic CD95 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) did not augment apoptosis in any of the unstimulated B-cell neoplasms. CD40 triggering did not consistently inhibit spontaneous apoptosis, but ultimately stimulated the growth of neoplastic B cells in most cases. Furthermore, CD40 activation led to up-regulation of the CD95 antigen in all 30 B-cell neoplasms. Ligation of CD95 on CD40-activated tumour cells augmented apoptosis in five of 10 ALL, three of 10 CLL, and nine of 10 NHL cases. The degree of apoptosis induced by CD95 triggering was greater for NHL cells than for ALL cells or CLL cells. Bcl-2 expression by ALL and NHL cells was substantially decreased after in vitro culture, whereas Bcl-2 expression by CLL cells was not significantly changed. However, there was no correlation between the level of Bcl-2 expression and sensitivity to CD95-mediated apoptosis. Thus, factors other than levels of CD95 and Bcl-2 determine susceptibility of malignant B cells to apoptosis after CD95 triggering. CD40-activated lymphoma cells appear to be very sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis, suggesting potential strategies for treatment of NHL. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying resistance of ALL and CLL cells to CD95 triggering may facilitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches to these diseases as well.","['Wang, D', 'Freeman, G J', 'Levine, H', 'Ritz, J', 'Robertson, M J']","['Wang D', 'Freeman GJ', 'Levine H', 'Ritz J', 'Robertson MJ']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 May;97(2):409-17. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.422688.x.,,"['CA01730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",2,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.422688.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases were subclassified as morphologically typical and atypical CLL according to the criteria of the FAB proposal. Typical CLL cases were mostly diagnosed at a low-risk stage (Binet A/Rai 0), required no immediate treatment and expected a long survival; atypical CLL cases mostly presented at a more advanced risk stage (Binet B/Rai I-II), usually required immediate treatment and their survival was shorter. Moreover, clinical staging was of prognostic significance in typical but not in atypical cases. In typical CLL, del(11q) was the most common chromosomal abnormality (21%) whereas in atypical CLL trisomy 12 was found in about 65% of the cases documented with an abnormal karyotype. Although chromosomal abnormalities were associated with a poor survival in typical CLL, they are of no prognostic significance in atypical CLL. Based on these data, we conclude that subtyping CLL by morphology enables the identification of two groups of cases, each characterized by a specific clinical presentation, different cytogenetic abnormalities and prognostic parameters.

German Multicentre ALL Study Group (GMALL).,372-82,"We evaluated the morphological findings in 150 consecutive cases of T-lineage acute lymphocytic leukaemia (T-ALL). Cytochemistry including PAS staining and acid phosphatase reaction proved of limited value for the diagnosis of ALL. The diagnosis of acute leukaemia was easy to establish in most instances. However, in a few cases the leukaemic cells were difficult to recognize as blasts. The nuclei of such cells showed condensed chromatin and nucleoli were lacking, and was encountered particularly in thymic ALL. Basophilic cytoplasm combined with prominent vacuolization suggestive of mature B-ALL (ALL-L3 type), was observed in 16 cases. Other features, however, such as cell size, polymorphism, chromatin structure, sparse cytoplasm or focal positivity for acid phosphatase, excluded a diagnosis of ALL-L3 in those cases. Distinction from hybrid leukaemia was difficult in 20 cases, because of a low percentage of peroxidase-positive blasts or other features which suggested a separate myeloid leukaemia component. In nine of these the hybrid nature of the leukaemia was considered as certain on the basis of morphology. Seven cases had been diagnosed as biphenotypic with coexpression of myeloid and lymphoid markers by immunological techniques. In conclusion, our analysis showed some serious pitfalls of the morphology in T-ALL, clearly indicating the need for immunological analysis of the leukaemic cells. However, morphology remains an essential component of the diagnostic repertoire, especially when the marrow is difficult to aspirate and in cases with equivocal immunological findings. Furthermore, recognition of a separate myeloid leukaemic component in addition to the lymphatic one requires a morphological analysis.","['Gassmann, W', 'Loffler, H', 'Thiel, E', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Schwartz, S', 'Haferlach, T', 'Maurer, J', 'Rieder, H', 'Fonatsch, C', 'Gokbuget, N', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Gassmann W', 'Loffler H', 'Thiel E', 'Ludwig WD', 'Schwartz S', 'Haferlach T', 'Maurer J', 'Rieder H', 'Fonatsch C', 'Gokbuget N', 'Hoelzer D']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Cytoplasm/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1997 May;97(2):372-82. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2171.x.,,,2,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1997.d01-2171.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that ATRA (10-200 microM) dose-dependently stimulated superoxide (O2-) generation in intact neutrophils. The maximal activity of ATRA-stimulated O2- generation was 3.0 nmol/min/10(6) cells. Adding EGTA to the assay mixture did not affect the activity nor was the intracellular free calcium concentration changed upon stimulation. The treatment of neutrophils with 0.1 microM staurosporine, an antagonist of protein kinase C, for 10 min, enhanced the activity of ATRA-stimulated O2- generation up to 186% of that for control samples. Wortmannin (1 microM), an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), reduced this stimulatory activity by 67%. These results suggest that ATRA activates the signalling pathway related to PI 3-kinase rather than that utilizing calcium and protein kinase C. ATRA enhanced the O2- generated in a sodium-dodecyl-sulphate (SDS) cell-free system, resulting in rates up to 288% higher than that seen with SDS alone. This enhancement was not affected by pretreatment with staurosporine or wortmannin.

Antigen was prepared from a human promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL-60) infected with a tick-derived isolate of the HGE agent (USG3). Suitable antigen presentation and preservation of cellular morphology were obtained when infected cells were applied and cultured on the slide, excess medium was removed, and cells were fixed with acetone. Use of a buffer containing bovine serum albumin and goat serum reduced background fluorescence, and use of an immunoglobulin G (gamma-specific) conjugate reduced nonspecific binding. The assay readily detected specific antibody from HGE patients and did not detect antibody from healthy individuals. No significant reactivity was noted in sera from patients with high titers of antibodies to other rickettsial species. We were able to identify antibodies reactive to USG3 antigen in samples from areas where HGE is endemic that had tested negative to other rickettsial agents. Animal sera reactive against Ehrlichia equi or Ehrlichia phagocytophila bound to the HGE antigen, indicating that the assay may be useful for veterinary use. Comparability between two different laboratories was assessed by using coded human sera exchanged between laboratories. Results from the two laboratories were similar, indicating that the assay can be easily integrated into use for routine testing for HGE. The assay was then compared to an assay using horse neutrophils infected with ehrlichiae. The two assays gave comparable results, indicating that the cell culture-derived antigen can be used for testing samples that have been previously tested with E. equi as an antigen. The new assay offers several advantages over other immunofluorescence methods that use animal-derived antigen and is suitable for use in testing for human antibodies to the HGE agent.","['Nicholson, W L', 'Comer, J A', 'Sumner, J W', 'Gingrich-Baker, C', 'Coughlin, R T', 'Magnarelli, L A', 'Olson, J G', 'Childs, J E']","['Nicholson WL', 'Comer JA', 'Sumner JW', 'Gingrich-Baker C', 'Coughlin RT', 'Magnarelli LA', 'Olson JG', 'Childs JE']","['Viral and Rickettsial Zoonoses Branch, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA. wan6@ciddvd1.em.cdc.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Immune Sera)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/*blood', '*Antigens, Bacterial', 'Dogs', 'Ehrlichia/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Ehrlichiosis/*diagnosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect/*methods', 'Granulocytes', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Species Specificity']",1997/06/01 00:00,1997/06/01 00:01,['1997/06/01 00:00'],"['1997/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1997 Jun;35(6):1510-6. doi: 10.1128/jcm.35.6.1510-1516.1997.,,,6,['10.1128/jcm.35.6.1510-1516.1997 [doi]'],,PMC229776,,['GENBANK/U02521'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nested PCR has been described as a sensitive and specific tool for detecting P. carinii DNA in clinical specimens. Little is known about the correlation of positive PCR results and clinical evidence of PCP in patients with different forms of immunosuppression. One hundred and thirty-six sputum samples, 26 tracheal-bronchial aspirate samples, 35 bronchoalveolar lavage samples, and 11 lung biopsy samples from (i) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with AIDS, (ii) immunocompromised patients with leukemia or lymphoma, and (iii) immunocompetent control patients were investigated by a nested PCR amplifying DNA from the mitochondrial large subunit of P. carinii. All patients suffered from acute episodes of respiratory disease. The resulting data were correlated with clinical evidence of PCP. A high degree of association of positive P. carinii PCR results and clinical evidence of PCP in HIV-infected patients with AIDS was found. When calculated for bronchoalveolar lavage and lung biopsy samples, the positive and the negative predictive values of P. carinii PCR for PCP diagnosis in HIV-infected patients with AIDS were 1 and the specificity and the sensitivity were 100%.

The precursor, gp160, is cleaved post-translationally into gp120 and gp41 which remain non-covalently associated. Binding to both CD4 and a co-receptor leads to the conformational changes in gp120/gp41 needed for membrane fusion. We used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the protease-resistant part of a gp41 ectodomain solubilized with a trimeric GCN4 coiled coil in place of the amino-terminal fusion peptide. The core of the molecule is found to be an extended, triple-stranded alpha-helical coiled coil with the amino terminus at its tip. A carboxy-terminal alpha-helix packs in the reverse direction against the outside of the coiled coil, placing the amino and carboxy termini near each other at one end of the long rod. These features, and the existence of a similar reversal of chain direction in the fusion pH-induced conformation of influenza virus HA2 and in the transmembrane subunit of Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Fig. 1a-d), suggest a common mechanism for initiating fusion.","['Weissenhorn, W', 'Dessen, A', 'Harrison, S C', 'Skehel, J J', 'Wiley, D C']","['Weissenhorn W', 'Dessen A', 'Harrison SC', 'Skehel JJ', 'Wiley DC']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, The Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02215, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (HIV Envelope Protein gp41)', '0 (Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fungal Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'HIV Envelope Protein gp41/*chemistry/genetics', 'HIV-1/*chemistry', 'Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus/chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinases/chemistry/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",1997/05/22 00:00,1997/05/22 00:01,['1997/05/22 00:00'],"['1997/05/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/22 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1997 May 22;387(6631):426-30. doi: 10.1038/387426a0.,,,6631,['10.1038/387426a0 [doi]'],['Nature. 1997 May 22;387(6631):346-8.

The results indicate that methylglyoxal strongly inhibits mitochondrial respiration in leukaemic leucocytes, whereas, at a much higher concentration, methylglyoxal fails to inhibit mitochondrial respiration in normal leucocytes. Methylglyoxal strongly inhibits ADP-stimulated alpha-oxoglutarate and malate plus NAD+-dependent respiration, whereas, at a higher concentration, methylglyoxal fails to inhibit succinate and alpha-glycerophosphate-dependent respiration. Methylglyoxal also fails to inhibit respiration which is initiated by duroquinone and cannot inhibit oxygen consumption when the N,N,N', N'-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine by-pass is used. NADH oxidation by sub-mitochondrial particles of leukaemic leucocytes is also inhibited by methylglyoxal. Lactaldehyde, a catabolite of methylglyoxal, can exert a protective effect on the inhibition of leukaemic leucocyte mitochondrial respiration by methylglyoxal. Methylglyoxal also inhibits l-lactic acid formation by intact leukaemic leucocytes and critically reduces the ATP level of these cells, whereas methylglyoxal has no effect on normal leucocytes. We conclude that methylglyoxal inhibits glycolysis and the electron flow through mitochondrial complex I of leukaemic leucocytes. This is strikingly similar to our previous studies on mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis and ATP levels in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma cells [Ray, Dutta, Halder and Ray (1994) Biochem. J. 303, 69-72; Halder, Ray and Ray (1993) Int. J.

Activation of these cells through the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fcepsilon-RI) results in degranulation and the extracellular release of mediators. There is good evidence of a role for GTPases in mast cell degranulation, and a number of studies with peptides derived from the Rab3a effector domain have suggested that Rab3a may function in this process. However, in neuroendocrine cells, overexpression of Rab3a can act as a negative regulator of stimulated exocytosis [Holz, Brondyk, Senter, Kuizon and Macara (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 10229-10234; Johanes, Lledo, Roa, Vincent, Henry and Darchen (1994) EMBO J. 13, 2029-2037]. In order to study the function of Rab3a in RBL degranulation, we have generated clones of RBL cells stably expressing Rab3a, and show that in these haematopoietic cells Rab3a can also function as a negative regulator of exocytosis. Overexpression of a mutant form of Rab3a (Asn-135 to Ile), which is predicted to be predominantly GTP-bound, also inhibited degranulation. However, overexpression of a mutant form of Rab3a that was truncated at the C-terminus to remove the sites for geranylgeranylation failed to inhibit degranulation. The effect of Rab3a is specific to secretion, and we observe no effect of Rab3a on receptor-mediated endocytosis. The Rab3a-induced block in degranulation can be bypassed by stimulation of streptolysin-O-permeabilized cells with guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate. We conclude from these studies that Rab3a is implicated in an early stage of granule targeting, whereas fusion of granules with the plasma membrane is regulated by a distinct downstream GTP-binding protein or proteins.","['Smith, J', 'Thompson, N', 'Thompson, J', 'Armstrong, J', 'Hayes, B', 'Crofts, A', 'Squire, J', 'Teahan, C', 'Upton, L', 'Solari, R']","['Smith J', 'Thompson N', 'Thompson J', 'Armstrong J', 'Hayes B', 'Crofts A', 'Squire J', 'Teahan C', 'Upton L', 'Solari R']","['Cell Biology Unit, GlaxoWellcome Research and Development Ltd., Medicines Research Centre, Gunnels Wood Road, Stevenage, Herts.

The pattern of p53 mutation in CML shows some peculiarities as compared with the majority of other neoplasias. In particular, the substitutions at codon 273, one of the most common p53 alteration in various tumors, are not characteristic of CML. To test whether distinction in the pattern of p53 mutation are associated with certain peculiarities of biological effects of different mutant proteins in myeloid cells, we obtained and analysed a panel of human K562 cell sublines expressing various exogenous p53: human Pro156, His175, His194, Trp248 and His 273, or murine temperature-sensitive (ts) Val135 that has properties of mutant protein at 37 degrees C, but shows activities of wild-type (wt) p53 at 32 degrees C. We have found that expression of wt-p53 enhanced the dependence of cells on growth/survival factors, incubation of sparse (< 10(5) cells per/ml) K562/Val135 cultures at 32 degrees C caused apoptosis. In media conditioned by cells of different origin (K562, colorectal carcinoma LIM 1215, Rat1 fibroblast) the p53-dependent apoptosis was inhibited. In conditions that do not lead to apoptosis, the expression of ts-wt-p53 was accompanied by dramatic increase in the number of cells containing glycophorin A (GlycPhA) and ""antigen of erythroblasts""--specific markers of erythroid differentiation. Unlike the wt-p53, the majority of tumor-derived mutant p53 (Pro156, His175, His194, Trp248) increased cells survival in media with low serum content and decreased the number of cell expressing GlycPhA, CD9, CD15 and CD71 differentiation antigens. On the other hand, expression of His273-p53 caused a significant augmentation in the number of CD9-positive cells and enhanced the dependence on growth/survival factors that are present in serum or conditioned media. The data obtained are consistent with the idea that unusual pattern of p53 mutations in CML can reflect the peculiarities of the effects of some mutant proteins on differentiation and/or viability of leukemic cells.","['Kremenetskaia, O S', 'Logacheva, N P', 'Baryshnikov, A Iu', 'Chumakov, P M', 'Kopnin, B P']","['Kremenetskaia OS', 'Logacheva NP', 'Baryshnikov AIu', 'Chumakov PM', 'Kopnin BP']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Russia (Federation),Tsitologiia,Tsitologiia,0417363,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,"['Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Mutation/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tsitologiia. 1996;38(12):1280-93.,,,12,,,,Vliianie opukholevogo supressora p53 i ego mutantnykh form na differentsirovku i zhiznesposobnost' leikoznykh kletok K562.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These in vivo results indicated that IL-6 has a major role in the regulation of its own receptors, IL-6R (gp80), and gp130, and the onset of acute phase response. We found that the maximum IL-6R (gp80), gp130 and LIF-R mRNA levels peaked at different times depending on the type of acute inflammation induced in the rat. It seems that various combinations of cytokines and hormones are released depending on the type of acute inflammation, and these in turn regulate the expression of diverse receptors on the hepatocyte, resulting in different acute phase kinetics in the various models of inflammation.","['Geisterfer, M', 'Gauldie, J']","['Geisterfer M', 'Gauldie J']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', ""9007-81-2 (Freund's Adjuvant)"", 'XJ6RUH0O4G (Turpentine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', ""Freund's Adjuvant"", '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Inflammation/drug therapy/*physiopathology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', '*Lymphokines', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/*physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Turpentine']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1996 Apr;8(4):283-7. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1996.0037.,,,4,"['S104346669690037X [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1996.0037 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present a strategy for the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with chromosome-specific probes to detect hyperdiploidy in interphase cells and to assign cases to a ploidy subgroup. By using a model population of 252 cases, it was seen that ten chromosomes (X, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 21) used in particular combinations and applied in a step-wise manner enabled the detection of 94% of hyperdiploid cases and gave an accurate prediction of ploidy subgroup in 96% of these cases. The detection and classification of each case required the use of four to six probes over two or three steps. Confirmation that this strategy will achieve this level of detection in other hyperdiploid populations was demonstrated by using 250 published karyotypes. This strategy has an application in detecting missing or hidden hyperdiploid cases among cases with failed or normal cytogenetics.","['Moorman, A V', 'Clark, R', 'Farrell, D M', 'Hawkins, J M', 'Martineau, M', 'Secker-Walker, L M']","['Moorman AV', 'Clark R', 'Farrell DM', 'Hawkins JM', 'Martineau M', 'Secker-Walker LM']","['Haematology Department, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Diploidy', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1996 May;16(1):40-5. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199605)16:1<40::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-3.,,,1,"['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199605)16:1<40::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-3 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2264(199605)16:1<40::AID-GCC6>3.0.CO;2-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The whole-cell recording mode of the patch-clamp technique was used to study the effect of extracellular K+ and Rb+ on membrane currents in human osteoblasts, in a human osteoblast-like cell line, and in the Jurkat human leukaemic T cell line. 2. Increasing the extracellular concentration of K+ increased the membrane conductance of the cells in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase in membrane conductance was due to the activation of a Cl- conductance. Rb+ also induced this conductance, but conductance was less than half that seen in K+. 3. The Cl- channel blockers 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulphonic acid (DIDS) and 4-acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene 2,2'-disulphonic acid (SITS) blocked the K(+)-induced Cl- current in a voltage-dependent manner. The degree of blockade increased with membrane depolarization to a maximum level at 40 mV. At potentials above this value the block appeared to decrease. 4. Both tonicity and K+ were required for maximal activation of the Cl- conductance since the K(+)-induced Cl- conductance could be inhibited by hypertonic solutions and the activation of a volume-sensitive Cl- conductance by hypotonic solutions could be enhanced by extracellular K+. 5. We conclude that an outwardly rectifying Cl- conductance can be activated either upon osmotic swelling or by an increase in extracellular K+. Both activation pathways may be involved in cell volume regulation and seem to apply to volume-sensitive Cl- channels in general since we observe this phenomenon in two different cell types, in human osteoblasts as well as in human leukaemic T lymphocytes.","['Steinert, M', 'Grissmer, S']","['Steinert M', 'Grissmer S']","['Department of Applied Physiology, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Physiol,The Journal of physiology,0266262,"['0 (Chloride Channels)', ""27816-59-7 (4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid)"", 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)', ""Q1O6DSW23R (4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid)"", 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"[""4,4'-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-Disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", ""4-Acetamido-4'-isothiocyanatostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic Acid/pharmacology"", 'Cell Line', 'Chloride Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Electrophysiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Osteoblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Potassium/*pharmacology', 'Rubidium/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Physiol. 1997 May 1;500 ( Pt 3):653-60. doi: 10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp022050.,,,,['10.1113/jphysiol.1997.sp022050 [doi]'],,PMC1159416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The possibility of correlations existing between variation in water quality and variation in the incidence of haematological malignancies was examined. Haematological incidence data, taken from the Leukaemia Research Fund's Data Collection Study, were mapped into 46 geographical areas of differing water supply. The distribution of the mapped cases was then tested for homogeneity using the Potthoff and Whittinghill (1966) test score. The age-adjusted incidence ratios calculated during the heterogeneity testing were examined for correlations with water quality indicators using correlation and stepwise regression. Significant heterogeneity in the incidence rates among water supply areas was observed for two groups of disease-acute leukaemias and myeloproliferative disorders. Three water quality indicators-pH, nitrate concentration and aluminium concentration-varied considerably over the study period. Significant correlations were observed between the standardized incidence ratios of five disease categories and some water quality indicators, especially aluminium and trihalomethane concentrations. The standardized incidence ratios of some haematological malignancies differed between geographical areas of water supply in South West England, and the evidence suggests that this variation may be associated with variation in water quality indicators. Although this lends support to similar findings in the United States of America, the pattern of correlations are affected by disease latency and statistical methodology.","['Foster, A M', 'Prentice, A G', 'Copplestone, J A', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Ricketts, C']","['Foster AM', 'Prentice AG', 'Copplestone JA', 'Cartwright RA', 'Ricketts C']","['Department of Haematology, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, Devon, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,,IM,"['England/epidemiology', 'Fresh Water/analysis/chemistry', 'Guidelines as Topic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Water Pollution, Chemical/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Water Supply/*standards', 'World Health Organization']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 1997 Feb;6(1):11-9. doi: 10.1097/00008469-199702000-00003.,,,1,['10.1097/00008469-199702000-00003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has regained much interest through the success of treating recurrent leukemia after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with the transfusion of donor lymphocytes. Chimerism and transplantation tolerance toward the donor offer the possibility of adoptive immunotherapy using donor lymphocytes. In animal studies, donor lymphocytes could be transfused into the chimeric animal, if the transfusion was delayed after marrow transplantation. Transfused lymphocytes exhibit a graft-versus-leukemia effect and increase chimerism. Immunity could be transferred and immune reactivity toward new antigens improved. In human patients transfusion of donor lymphocytes was studied in leukemia recurring after marrow transplantation. It was very effective in the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia recurring after marrow transplantation. It was also effective in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and myeloma; in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma responses were rare. Responses in solid tumors as breast cancer have been described. Major complications are graft-versus-host disease and myelosuppression. Myelosuppression could be compensated by the transfusion of marrow. Graft-versus-host disease can be modified by the depletion of CD8-positive T cells from the lymphocyte concentrate or by transfusing very low numbers of cells and increasing doses in a stepwise fashion.

However, relatively small numbers of patients with low grade lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia have been treated using this approach. There is reluctance to perform potentially lethal treatment procedures for diseases with relatively long natural histories that tend to occur in more elderly patients. Although these diseases are characterized by initial chemotherapy responsiveness, many of these patients are heavily pretreated and have acquired chemotherapy resistance and decreased marrow reserve by the time of consideration of bone marrow transplantation as a treatment option. The very high incidence of bone marrow infiltration in these diseases has made it difficult to use autologous stem cells for rescue after high dose myeloablative therapy. However, because these diseases are incurable using conventional therapy, there has been increased interest recently in the use of high dose ablative therapy and stem cell support.

These mean that two promoter regions play an important role in regulating the induced expression of ferrochelatase.","['Furukawa, T', 'Tokunaga, R', 'Taketani, S']","['Furukawa T', 'Tokunaga R', 'Taketani S']","['Department of Hygiene, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Mol Biol Int,Biochemistry and molecular biology international,9306673,"['EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ferrochelatase/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Mol Biol Int. 1997 May;41(6):1161-70. doi: 10.1080/15216549700202251.,,,6,['10.1080/15216549700202251 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1980-1996), a CANCERLIT search (1983-1996), and a CURRENT CONTENTS search (1980-1996) using the terms pegaspargase, PEG-asparaginase, PEG-L-asparaginase, polyethylene glycol L-asparaginase, polyethylene glycol conjugated L-asparaginase, and Oncaspar were conducted. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles were considered for possible inclusion in this review. Abstracts were included only when they were judged to add critical information not otherwise available in the medical literature. DATA SYNTHESIS: L-Asparaginase has been a main component of treatment regimens for acute lymphocytic leukemia. A key limiting factor of L-asparaginase use has been the development of hypersensitivity to the drug. Recently, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) conjugated form of L-asparaginase, pegaspargase, has been made available. PEG modification of L-asparaginase has been shown to alter the tendency of the enzyme to induce an immune response and to extend the half-life of the drug. The majority of patients with hypersensitivity to the native enzyme preparations tolerate pegaspargase without further clinical hypersensitivity. The adverse effect profile of pegaspargase is similar to that of the native forms of L-asparaginase. The recommended dosage of pegaspargase is 2500 IU/m2 administered by intramuscular or intravenous injection every 2 weeks in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. CONCLUSIONS: Pegaspargase is a safe, effective alternative to L-asparaginase in patients who have had clinical hypersensitivity reactions to both Escherichia coli- and Erwinia carotovora-derived L-asparaginase. However, pegaspargase should not be routinely substituted for L-asparaginase.","['Holle, L M']",['Holle LM'],"['Baptist Medical Center, San Antonio, TX 78205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Ann Pharmacother,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,9203131,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/economics/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Pharmacother. 1997 May;31(5):616-24. doi: 10.1177/106002809703100517.,30,,5,['10.1177/106002809703100517 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because little is known about the function of this cytokine in proliferative phase of cycle and because LIF is found to regulate the cellular growth we evaluated the possible relationship between endometrial LIF secretion and endometrial growth. METHOD: The present is prospective, blinded study with clinical and immunobiochemical correlation between endometrial LIF concentration and endometrial ultrasound pattern. Twenty-four patients who were candidates for IVF and oocyte donation are included in this study. At day 10 of their cycle the endometrial biopsy was performed, followed by vaginal sonographic measurements of endometrial thickness and pattern. Endometrial LIF concentration was measured by ELISA in supernatants taken from cultured explants. RESULTS: Endometrial LIF production significantly negatively correlated with endometrial thicknesses (P < 0.05). There was a 4-fold elevation in LIF production when the endometrial thickness was below 5 mm. Strong correlation was found also between endometrial LIF production and sonographic endometrial pattern (P < 0.05). The most significant amount of LIF was found in nonfavorable endometria. CONCLUSION: In the proliferative phase of cycle there is a dynamic relationship between endometrial sonographic appearance and local LIF secretion. Specifically LIF production is negatively correlated with endometrial thickness and pattern. The low amount of cytokine is a normal uteral environment for endometrial development, whereas deregulation of cytokine production toward its overexpression may lead to a strong inhibitory effect on endometrial growth. This finding might have an important clinical implication.","['Hambartsoumian, E']",['Hambartsoumian E'],"['Department of OB/GYN, Hospital Antoine Beclere, Clamart, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Am J Reprod Immunol,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",8912860,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrium/*diagnostic imaging/growth & development/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Growth Inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Menstrual Cycle/immunology', 'Pregnancy Rate', 'Prospective Studies', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Ultrasonography']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Reprod Immunol. 1997 Apr;37(4):320-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0897.1997.tb00237.x.,,,4,['10.1111/j.1600-0897.1997.tb00237.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, MGUS evolved into 35 cases of multiple myeloma, two of solitary plasmacytoma of the bone, four of macroglobulinemia, three of malignant lymphoma, two of amyloidosis, one of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and one of plasma cell leukemia.

Therefore, patients with MGUS present an increased risk of developing a malignant lymphoproliferative or plasma cell proliferative disease, and MGUS could be considered a pre-neoplastic condition.

In this review, two phenotypes have been described in detail: that of normal sympathetic neurons and that of axotomized neurons. Two factors produced by nonneuronal cells, LIF and NGF, determine which of these phenotypes is expressed. Under normal conditions, the neurons receive NGF primarily, if not exclusively, from the target tissues they innervate. Prior to surgery, the nonneuronal cells within the ganglion and nerve tract express little, if any, LIF. This milieu favors the expression of NPY and suppresses the expression of VIP, galanin, and substance P (Fig. 6). After axotomy, however, this situation is reversed. The neuronal cell bodies are deprived of target-derived NGF and are exposed to LIF both within the ganglion and at the site of the injury (Fig 6). Both the removal of NGF and the exposure to LIF inhibit NPY expression, while promoting the expression of VIP and galanin. Expression of substance P after axotomy occurs primarily, if not entirely, because of the effects of LIF, with the removal of NGF playing no obvious role in the regulation of this peptide.","['Zigmond, R E', 'Sun, Y']","['Zigmond RE', 'Sun Y']","['Department of Neurosciences, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4975, USA.

These responses were blocked by protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor but not by other kinase inhibitors, suggesting an important role of PKC in decidual LIF production mediated by cytokines and estradiol. We also showed that stimulating decidual cells with LIF failed to stimulate DNA synthesis and prolactin production in these cells.

At early gestational stages, stromal, decidual, and glandular cell development were deficient in Hoxa-11 null uteri in comparison to wild-type as assessed by histology and immunohistochemical localization of the decidual cell marker epitope, stage-specific embryonic antigen-3 (SSEA-3). Both steroid-induced uterine stromal and glandular cell proliferation as well as oil-induced stromal decidualization after induction of pseudopregnancy were deficient in mutant uteri. Moreover, both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the burst of glandular leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) found in normal pregnant uteri at Day 4.5 of gestation was absent in Hoxa-11-deficient uteri. The LIF burst was also not observed in the uteri of bilaterally ovariectomized, hormonally stimulated Hoxa-11 mutants. These results demonstrate that the Hoxa-11 gene is required for normal uterine stromal cell and glandular differentiation during pregnancy, as is the presence of the steroid-induced glandular LIF burst initiating embryo implantation.","['Gendron, R L', 'Paradis, H', 'Hsieh-Li, H M', 'Lee, D W', 'Potter, S S', 'Markoff, E']","['Gendron RL', 'Paradis H', 'Hsieh-Li HM', 'Lee DW', 'Potter SS', 'Markoff E']","[""Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Hospital Research Foundation, Cincinnati, Ohio 45229-3039, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,"['0 (Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxa11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens)', '0 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Tumor-Associated, Carbohydrate', 'Decidua/pathology/physiopathology', 'Female', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Glycosphingolipids/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Ovary/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pseudopregnancy/genetics/physiopathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reproduction/*genetics/physiology', 'Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens', 'Uterus/*abnormalities/*physiopathology']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 1997 May;56(5):1097-105. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod56.5.1097.,,['HD29599/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],5,['10.1095/biolreprod56.5.1097 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NG2 has been found to be expressed on human leukemic blasts but not on other hematopoietic cells. In childhood AML, NG2 cell surface expression correlated with poor outcome and with some but not all 11q23 rearrangements. In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, NG2 expression correlated with poor outcome and with balanced 11q23 translocations.

We have devised a noninvasive analytical method to estimate the percentage of apoptotic lymphoblasts in doxorubicin-treated Jurkat T-cell ALL cultures, using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR). We have found that the ratio of the methylene (CH2) resonance (at 1.3 ppm) to the methyl (CH3) resonance (at 0.9 ppm) signal intensity, as observed by 1H NMR, is directly proportional to the percentage of apoptotic lymphoblasts in vitro. The correlation between the CH2/CH3 signal intensity ratio and the percentage of apoptotic lymphoblasts was optimal 24 to 28 hours after doxorubicin treatment (r2 = .947, N = 27 samples). There was also a direct temporal relationship between an increase in the CH2/CH3 signal intensity ratio and the onset of apoptosis as detected by nuclear morphologic analysis, fluorescein-annexin V flow cytometry, and DNA gel electrophoresis. Thin-layer chromatography confirmed that a dynamic and/or compositional change of the plasma membrane, rather than increases in lipase activity or fatty acid production, appears to account for the increase in the CH2/CH3 signal intensity ratio during apoptosis. 1H NMR may have clinical utility for the early noninvasive assessment of chemotherapeutic efficacy in patients with ALL.","['Blankenberg, F G', 'Katsikis, P D', 'Storrs, R W', 'Beaulieu, C', 'Spielman, D', 'Chen, J Y', 'Naumovski, L', 'Tait, J F']","['Blankenberg FG', 'Katsikis PD', 'Storrs RW', 'Beaulieu C', 'Spielman D', 'Chen JY', 'Naumovski L', 'Tait JF']","['Department of Radiology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (annexin V receptor)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Annexin A5/metabolism', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Choline/*analysis', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Membrane Lipids/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Phosphatidylserines/*analysis', 'Receptors, Peptide/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 15;89(10):3778-86.,,,10,['S0006-4971(20)58297-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acidic nature of this compartment was confirmed by vital staining with a pH sensitive dye, LysoSensor yellow/blue DND-160. Identification of the vesicular compartment was performed by immunofluorescence analysis. Staining for the LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 antigens showed that the vesicles are enlarged lysosomes that are eccentrically placed near the nucleus of U-A10 cells. By contrast, the expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein and the P-glycoprotein was observed predominately on the plasma membrane of the drug-resistant cells. The accumulation of daunorubicin into cellular compartments was quantified using radiolabeled drug. Exposing cells to 3[H]-daunorubicin and then isolating intact nuclei showed that nuclei from U-A10 cells accumulated twofold to threefold less anthracycline than nuclei from U-937 cells. However, when nuclei were isolated first and then exposed to 3[H]-daunorubicin, little difference in net nuclear drug accumulation was detected. Cytoplasts prepared from U-A10 and U-937 cells were exposed to 3[H]-daunorubicin to measure cytoplasmic drug accumulation. At external daunorubicin concentrations of 100 ng/mL or higher, cytoplasts from U-A10 cells accumulated significantly more daunorubicin than cytoplasts from U-937 cells. Moreover, studies with the lysosomotropic agent chloroquine showed that U-A10 cells accumulated twofold more chloroquine and showed twofold enhanced sensitivity to this agent as compared with parental U-937 cells. Fluorescence microscopy showed that chloroquine affects vesicular anthracycline sequestration in U-A10 cells with an associated increase in daunorubicin nuclear fluorescence. Although chloroquine did not alter anthracycline cytotoxicity in parental cells, it restored daunorubicin and doxorubicin sensitivity to U-A10 cells. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that U-A10 cells exhibit a redistribution of the lysosomal compartment. The trapping of drug into an expanded acidic vesicular compartment results in decreased nuclear drug accumulation and decreased cytotoxicity. Lysosomotropic agents, such as chloroquine, warrant further study as modulators of this acquired drug-resistance phenotype.","['Hurwitz, S J', 'Terashima, M', 'Mizunuma, N', 'Slapak, C A']","['Hurwitz SJ', 'Terashima M', 'Mizunuma N', 'Slapak CA']","['Division of Cancer Pharmacology, The Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and The Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Biomarkers', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Lysosomes/chemistry/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 15;89(10):3745-54.,,,10,['S0006-4971(20)58293-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immunophenotypes and genetic features of cells recovered from these cultures were identical to those noted before culture. All cells maintained their stroma dependency and self-renewal capacity. Leukemic clones derived from single cells contained approximately 10(3) to 10(6) cells after 1 month of culture; other clones became detectable only after prolonged culture. Cell growth in stroma-coated wells correlated with the number of initially seeded cells (1 or 10; r = .87). However, the observed percentages of positive wells seeded with 10 cells always exceeded values predicted from results with single-cell-initiated cultures (P < .003 by paired t-test), suggesting stimulation of leukemic cell growth by paracrine factors. In conclusion, the proportion of ALL cells with clonogenic potential may be considerably higher than previously thought.","['Nishigaki, H', 'Ito, C', 'Manabe, A', 'Kumagai, M', 'Coustan-Smith, E', 'Yanishevski, Y', 'Behm, F G', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Pui, C H', 'Campana, D']","['Nishigaki H', 'Ito C', 'Manabe A', 'Kumagai M', 'Coustan-Smith E', 'Yanishevski Y', 'Behm FG', 'Raimondi SC', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, University of Tennessee College of Medicine, Memphis 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)']",IM,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Connective Tissue/metabolism', 'Connective Tissue Cells', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 15;89(10):3735-44.,,,10,['S0006-4971(20)58292-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Freshly isolated DC or DC precursors may be preferable for studies of antigen uptake and the potential control of APC costimulator activity. In this report, we report that the monoclonal antibody CMRF-44 can be used to detect early DC differentiation. The majority of DC circulating in blood do not express any known DC lineage specific markers, but can be identified by CMRF-44 labeling after a brief period of in vitro culture. The sequential acquisition of DC activation antigens allows the identification of two stages of DC maturation/activation. Cytokines, especially granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, enhance both phases of this process, whereas CD40-ligand trimer preferentially enhances the final DC maturation to a fully mature, activated phenotype. DC positively selected using CMRF-44 possess potent allostimulatory activity and are efficient at the uptake, processing, and presentation of soluble antigens for both primary and secondary immune responses. CMRF-44+ DC are also more potent than other APC types at restimulation of a chronic myeloid leukemia peptide specific T-cell clone. The use of a purified population of freshly isolated DC may be advantageous in attempts to initiate, maintain, and direct immune responses for immunotherapeutic applications.","['Fearnley, D B', 'McLellan, A D', 'Mannering, S I', 'Hock, B D', 'Hart, D N']","['Fearnley DB', 'McLellan AD', 'Mannering SI', 'Hock BD', 'Hart DN']","['Haematology/Immunology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD83 antigen)', '0 (CMRF-44 monoclonal antibody)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blood Cells/classification', 'Cattle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', '*Immunotherapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 15;89(10):3708-16.,,,10,['S0006-4971(20)58289-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we demonstrate the nature of retinoid receptors involved in retinoic acid-induced expression of CD38 protein in the human myeloblastic leukemia cell line HL-60. We used a variant HL-60 cell line, HL-60R, in which retinoid receptor function has been abrogated by a trans-dominant negative mutation. We introduced the normal retinoic acid receptors (RAR)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma or retinoid X receptor (RXR)-alpha into HL-60R cells by retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer. Based on experiments using these cell lines and receptor-specific synthetic retinoids that preferentially bind to one of the RARs or RXRs, we conclude that RAR-alpha is involved in retinoid-induced CD38 expression in HL-60 cells. Further evidence included our demonstration that blocking of RAR-alpha with the antagonist Ro 41-5253 completely suppressed the retinoid-induced expression of CD38 mRNA transcript and the production of CD38 protein in HL-60 cells. Various tissues from transgenic mice that expressed an antisense construct of RAR-alpha lacked or produced very low levels of CD38. As expected, the tissues from transgenic mice contained 50% to 80% reduced levels of RAR-alpha. These results suggest that regulation of CD38 expression, both in vitro and in vivo, is under the direct control of RAR-alpha retinoid receptors.","['Mehta, K', 'McQueen, T', 'Manshouri, T', 'Andreeff, M', 'Collins, S', 'Albitar, M']","['Mehta K', 'McQueen T', 'Manshouri T', 'Andreeff M', 'Collins S', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Rara protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor beta)', '0 (retinoic acid receptor gamma)', '144092-31-9 (Ro 41-5253)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (Cd38 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Benzoates/pharmacology', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 15;89(10):3607-14.,,,10,['S0006-4971(20)58278-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the potential for both stimulatory and inhibitory factors to act through the MAP kinase signaling pathway by studying the effects of growth factors and chemokines on MAP kinase activation. Also, because activation of kinase signaling pathways and stimulation of protein synthesis by peptide growth factors are associated with increased phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (elF-4E) and the translational repressor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in some target cells, we investigated whether growth factor treatment could alter eIF-4E or 4E-BP1 phosphorylation state in MO7e cells. We report that treatment of MO7e cells with GM-CSF and SLF stimulated significant, greater-than-additive increases in MAP kinase activity and the phosphorylation of both eIF-4E and 4E-BP1. Increased 4E-BP1 phosphorylation correlated with a decrease in the association of 4E-BP1 with eIF-4E. Growth factor-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF-4E was blocked in cells treated with rapamycin, wortmannin, or PD098059. Treatment of cells with IP-10 or MIP-1alpha blocked the stimulatory effects of GM-CSF and SLF, resulting in suppression of MAP kinase activity, eIF-4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, and eIF-4E/4E-BP1 dissociation. Our results suggest that GM-CSF and SLF exert part of their combined growth-promoting effects on MO7e cells through activation of MAP kinase and enhancement of eIF-4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation and dissociation and that suppression of growth factor-induced protein synthesis by MIP-1alpha and IP-10 involves translational repression at the level of eIF-4E.","['Aronica, S M', 'Gingras, A C', 'Sonenberg, N', 'Cooper, S', 'Hague, N', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Aronica SM', 'Gingras AC', 'Sonenberg N', 'Cooper S', 'Hague N', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chemokine CCL3)', '0 (Chemokine CCL4)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (EIF4EBP1 protein, human)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Initiation Factors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chemokine CCL3', 'Chemokine CCL4', 'Chemokine CXCL10', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophage Inflammatory Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptide Initiation Factors/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stem Cell Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1997 May 15;89(10):3582-95.,,,10,['S0006-4971(20)58276-1 [pii]'],['NIH Guide Grants Contracts. 2006 Apr 7;:NOT-OD-06-057.

European Working Group on Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Childhood (EWOG-MDS),3534-43,"Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is a rare hematopoietic malignancy of childhood. To define the clinical and hematologic characteristics of the disease, we performed a retrospective analysis of 110 children given the diagnosis CMML irrespective of karyotype. Median age at diagnosis was 1.8 years. Neurofibromatosis type 1 was known in 14% and other clinical abnormalities in 7% of the children. At presentation, the medium white blood count was 35 x 10(9)/L, with a median monocyte count of 7 x 10(9)/L. Karyotypic abnormalities in bone marrow cells were noted in 36% of the patients, whereas 26% of the children had monosomy 7. Children with monosomy 7 did not differ from those with normal karyotype with respect to their clinical presentation. However, they did display some characteristic hematologic features. Of 110 children, 38 received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT). The probability of survival at 10 years was 0.39 (standard error [SE] = 0.10) for the BMT group and 0.06 (SE = 0.4) for the 72 patients of the non-BMT group. Platelet count, age, and hemoglobin F at diagnosis were the main predicting factors for the length of survival in the non-BMT group. There is a strong need for a broad agreement on nomenclature in children with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

Proposal for a treatment strategy of spinal disorders by local gene therapy.,1092-7,"STUDY DESIGN: In the current study, chondrocytic cells from bovine intervertebral end plates were cultivated in vitro and modified genetically. OBJECTIVE: The authors intended to perform isolation and cultivation of cells from bovine end plates of the spine. They also intended to show, in principle, the feasibility of introducing exogenous genes into chondrocytic cells from bovine intervertebral end plates by way of retroviral vectors. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The involvement of cytokines in the destruction of articular cartilage is established. It appears possible that similar mechanisms may play a role in intervertebral disc degeneration and other spinal disorders. Conventional medication and surgery of intervertebral disc degeneration addresses neither the pathophysiology nor the chronicity of the disease. Therapeutic proteins carry great potential as locally produced drugs after transfer of their cognate genes to the sites of interest. METHODS: Vertebral end plate tissue was obtained from bovine os coccygis. Chondrocytic cells were isolated and cultured in vitro. The bacterial beta-galactosidase (LacZ) gene and, alternatively, the complementary DNA (DNA copy of the mRNA) of the human interleukin-1 receptor antagonist were introduced into the isolated cells by retrovirus mediated gene transfer. beta-galactosidase activity was determined by staining, and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein was quantitated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Isolation and cultivation of chondrocytic end plate cells is possible. Native cells continue to grow in culture for more than 2 months. Transfer of the beta-galactosidase gene to cultured cells resulted in approximately 1% beta-galactosidase positive cells. Transfer of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist complementary DNA resulted in the production of 24 ng/ml/10(6) cells interleukin-1 receptor antagonist protein in 48 hours. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of exogenous therapeutic genes into cells from the intervertebral end plate opens the possibility for a local gene-based treatment of intervertebral disc degeneration. This approach avoids some of the shortcomings of conventional drug- and surgery-based treatments and has the potential to be specific, effective, and appropriate to the chronicity of the disease.","['Wehling, P', 'Schulitz, K P', 'Robbins, P D', 'Evans, C H', 'Reinecke, J A']","['Wehling P', 'Schulitz KP', 'Robbins PD', 'Evans CH', 'Reinecke JA']","['Praxis und Klinik fur Orthopadie und Neurochirurgie, Dusseldorf, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Spine (Phila Pa 1976),Spine,7610646,"['0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cartilage/*cytology', 'Cattle', 'Female', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Intervertebral Disc/*cytology', 'Intervertebral Disc Displacement/*therapy', 'Lumbar Vertebrae/*cytology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Plasmids', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1997/05/15 00:00,1997/05/15 00:01,['1997/05/15 00:00'],"['1997/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Spine (Phila Pa 1976). 1997 May 15;22(10):1092-7. doi: 10.1097/00007632-199705150-00008.,,,10,['10.1097/00007632-199705150-00008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This can be especially important for the detection of clonal malignant cells in locations other than bone marrow or peripheral blood. We describe a case in which central nervous system involvement, a very rare complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, was confirmed by PCR analysis for IgH genes rearrangement of the lymphocytes found in cerebrospinal fluid. The cerebrospinal fluid and the peripheral blood lymphocytes (obtained from archival cytospins stored at the time of diagnosis, 5 years before) presented an identical IgH gene rearrangement, as shown by sequence analysis. Thus, the use of PCR for IgH genes rearrangement can be very useful in the detection of monoclonality in samples with a small number of cells and in the confirmation of the common origin of B cells in different specimens of the same patient.","['Garicochea, B', 'Cliquet, M G', 'Melo, N', 'del Giglio, A', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer, P E', 'Chamone, D A']","['Garicochea B', 'Cliquet MG', 'Melo N', 'del Giglio A', 'Dorlhiac-Llacer PE', 'Chamone DA']","['Fundacao Pro-Sangue Hemocentro de Sao Paulo, Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Arachnoid/*pathology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*cerebrospinal fluid/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Retrospective Studies']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 1997 May;10(5):500-3.,,,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They activate their partner-dependent kinases (CDKs) and target them to respective substrate proteins within the cell. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of specific sets of proteins drives the cell through particular phases or checkpoints of the cell cycle. During unperturbed growth of normal cells, the timing of expression of several cyclins is discontinuous, occurring at discrete and well-defined periods of the cell cycle. Immunocytochemical detection of cyclins in relation to cell cycle position (DNA content) by multiparameter flow cytometric techniques has provided a new approach to cell cycle studies. This approach, like no other method, can be used to detect the ""unscheduled"" expression of cyclins, namely, the presentation of G1 cyclins by cells in G2/M and of G2/M cyclins by G1 cells, without the need for cell synchronization. By use of multiparameter flow cytometric and laser scanning cytometric analysis, we correlated the expression of cyclin B1 with cell cycle position in normal lymphocytes stimulated to proliferate by the mitogen phytohemagglutinin and in 28 primary human tumors of different organ and type. Eighteen of the 28 tumors expressed the cyclin B1 in more than 5% of cells (B1 positive), and the rest showed cyclin expression from 2.1 to 5% (B1 negative).

However, the biological efficacy of tretinoin is greatly impaired by (presumably) an induced hypercatabolism of the drug leading to reduced tretinoin sensitivity and resistance. Several pharmacokinetic studies have shown that plasma drug exposure [as measured by the plasma area under the concentration-time curve (AUC infinity)] declines substantially and rapidly when the drug is administered in a long term daily tretinoin regimen. These observations led to the hypothesis that the rapid development of acquired clinical resistance to tretinoin may have a pharmacological basis and result from an inability to present an effective drug concentration to the leukaemic cells during continuous treatment. The principal mechanisms proposed to explain the increased disappearance of tretinoin from plasma include: (i) decreased intestinal absorption; (ii) enhanced enzymatic catabolism; and (iii) the induction of cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding proteins (CRABP), which leads to increased drug sequestration. The most favoured explanation is that continuous tretinoin treatment acts to induce drug catabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Several strategies aimed at preventing or overcoming induced tretinoin resistance have been, and are being, planned. These strategies include intermittent dose administration, administration of pharmacological inhibitors of CYP oxidative enzymes, combination with interferon-alpha and intravenous administration of liposome-encapsulated tretinoin. As these strategies are now under investigation and the number of patients enrolled is small, further studies are needed to determine the efficacy and toxicity of these new schedules of drug administration. In this article we provide an overview of the relevant aspects of tretinoin physiology and pharmacokinetics, and summarise the current status of knowledge to help in the better optimisation of tretinoin administration.","['Regazzi, M B', 'Iacona, I', 'Gervasutti, C', 'Lazzarino, M', 'Toma, S']","['Regazzi MB', 'Iacona I', 'Gervasutti C', 'Lazzarino M', 'Toma S']","['Department of Pharmacology, IRCCS-S, Matteo Hospital, Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Drug Carriers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents/analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Liposomes', 'Tretinoin/analysis/*pharmacokinetics']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 1997 May;32(5):382-402. doi: 10.2165/00003088-199732050-00004.,111,,5,['10.2165/00003088-199732050-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their mechanisms of migration, the distribution of immature and mature cells and their interaction with other inflammatory cells are largely unclarified. Possibly, beta 2-integrins play an important role in these processes. In the present investigation, the authors studied the expression and regulation of the beta 2-integrins LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), p150,95 (CD11c/CD18) and of the LFA-1/Mac-1 counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1; CD54) on leukaemic (HMC-1 cell subclone 5C6) and on normal mature human skin mast cells. The HMC-1 cells clearly expressed CD11a, CD18 and CD54, while expression of CD11b and CD11c was low. The apparent molecular weights were 180 kDa (CD11a), 95 kDa (CD18) and 90 kDa (CD54) as determined by Western blot analysis. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induced a time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, CD18 and CD54 that was inhibited by cycloheximide, suggesting a dependence on de novo protein synthesis. Enhanced expression of CD11a, CD11b, CD11c and CD18 could also be confirmed at the gene level as demonstrated by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Increased expression of LFA-1/ICAM-1 in response to PMA was accompanied by strong enhancement of homotypic cell aggregation, suggesting that newly synthesized LFA-1/ICAM-1 is functionally active. In order to determine a physiologically relevant way of mast cell beta 2-integrin modulation, several cytokines and chemotactic mediators (interleukin-4, IL-4; nerve growth factor beta, NGF beta; C5a; and leukotriene B4, LTB4) were tested for their influence on adhesion molecule cell surface density. Only LTB4 was shown specifically to up-regulate CD11a and CD18, but not CD11b or CD11c. The presence of CD11a, CD11c and CD18 could be confirmed on a low percentage of normal skin mast cells by immunofluorescence, using a double staining technique. In comparison to normal skin, a significantly higher percentage of CD18+ mast cells was found in inflammatory dermatoses such as psoriasis vulgaris, atopic dermatitis and lichen planus. Therefore, mast cell beta 2-integrins possibly play an important role during homing of immature mast cells as well as during the interaction of activated mast cells with other inflammatory cells.","['Weber, S', 'Babina, M', 'Feller, G', 'Henz, B M']","['Weber S', 'Babina M', 'Feller G', 'Henz BM']","['Department of Dermatology, Virchow-Klinikum, Humboldt-Universitat zu Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Integrin alphaXbeta2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CD18 Antigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Integrin alphaXbeta2/genetics/metabolism', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukotriene B4/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/genetics/metabolism', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Skin/cytology/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1997 May;45(5):471-81. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1997.d01-420.x.,,,5,['10.1046/j.1365-3083.1997.d01-420.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these cases tenderness in the mental foramen, percussion pain of the teeth, loosening and extrusion of the teeth, and radiographic abnormalities were also, if not always, observed in association with mental neuropathy. The radiographic abnormalities included a disappearance of the mandibular canals, an enlarged periodontal ligament space, a loss or thinning of the lamina dura, and a destruction of the alveolar crestal bone. This report indicates that oral manifestations can therefore occasionally play an extremely important role in the early recognition of acute lymphocytic leukemia.

Conditioned media were harvested after BRL cells were cultured until confluency (CON), or for an additional 2 d with the same cells but new medium (CON-N) or the same medium (CON-S). Glucose in TCM-199 was depleted by BRL cells to different concentrations depending on coculture procedures: CON = 3.94 mM, CON-N = 1.67 mM, and CON-S = 1.11 mM glucose. In Exp. 1, development of bovine zygotes in CON-S resulted in fewer blastocysts than development in CON (10 vs 28%, P < .05); CON-N was not different from CON (26% blastocysts). Experiment 2 examined effects of moving embryos to a fresh drop of different or identical conditioned medium after culture for 3 d. Initial culture in CON-N and final culture in CON resulted in a greater (P < .01) number of blastocysts compared with the control of CON followed by CON (32 vs 19% blastocysts). This was not entirely due to changing from low to high glucose because adding glucose to CON-N after 3 d yielded only 18% blastocysts. To test the hypothesis that beneficial effects of BRL cell-conditioned media may be due to secretion of leukemia inhibiting factor (LIF), LIF was added to B2, a more appropriate medium than Medium-199 for culturing bovine embryos without conditioning or coculture with BRL cells. In the absence of serum, the percentage of blastocysts per cleaved embryo (17 to 28%) was not improved with LIF; however, the mean number of cells per blastocyst was higher (P < .05) in treatments with LIF (65 to 74 cells) than without LIF (47 cells). In B2 medium + 10% fetal calf serum, LIF was of no benefit; development to blastocysts was good with or without LIF (43% of cleaved).","['Funston, R N', 'Nauta, W J', 'Seidel, G E Jr']","['Funston RN', 'Nauta WJ', 'Seidel GE Jr']","['Animal Reproduction and Biotechnology Laboratory, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Anim Sci,Journal of animal science,8003002,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blastocyst/cytology/drug effects', 'Blood Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cattle/*embryology', 'Coculture Techniques/methods/veterinary', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/analysis/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/drug effects', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/drug effects/physiology', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/*cytology/drug effects', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BUF']",1997/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Anim Sci. 1997 May;75(5):1332-6. doi: 10.2527/1997.7551332x.,,['HD-07031/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],5,['10.2527/1997.7551332x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earlier studies showed that CLL cells produce and are usually growth inhibited by transforming growth factor beta type 1 (TGF-beta1), suggesting a mechanism for the clinically indolent course of most CLL. Here we studied the mechanism by which CLL cells from about one-third of the patients are insensitive to TGF-beta1. Of the 13 patients studied, CLL cells isolated from the peripheral blood of 8 patients were sensitive to growth inhibition by TGF-beta1, as determined by incorporation of tritiated thymidine, whereas those from 5 patients were completely resistant to TGF-beta1. As judged by binding of radiolabeled TGF-beta1 followed by cross-linking and immunoprecipitation with anti-receptor antisera, CLL cells sensitive to TGF-beta1 exhibited normal cell surface expression of both types 1 and 2 TGF-beta receptors. In contrast, all CLL cells resistant to TGF-beta1 exhibited no detectable surface type I receptors able to bind TGF-beta1, but normal expression of type II receptors. Both TGF-beta1-sensitive and TGF-beta1-resistant CLL cells contained normal amounts of both type 1 and type 2 receptor mRNAs.

The hybridization of specific DNA or RNA probes to the cellular targets attached to the microscopic slides is widely used for the identification of chromosomal translocations, deletions, amplifications of specific genes, and chromosome number changes in mitotic and/or interphase cells. The use of FISH with the modifications of the basic method meant a breakthrough in detection and diagnosis of human malignancies. During the last tow years FISH was used in our laboratory for: (a) identification of constitutive and acquired numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities; (b) detection of minimal residual disease or early relapse in patients treated for leukemia by bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and/or chemotherapy; (c) determination of the cytogenetic pattern of non-dividing or terminally differentiated cells. To confirm the structural rearrangements found by the classical G-banding technique, the whole chromosome painting probes which hybridize to multiple chromosomal sequences were used. The alpha-satellite DNA probes which detect centromeric repetitive sequences were utilized for determining the numerical and sex chromosome changes. Specific unique chromosomal sequences which can confirm all chromosomal rearrangements, i.e., deletions, translocations or inversions with the corresponding breakpoints were introduced for specific cases. Recently, every chromosomal translocation, deletion and any other structural or numerical change found by conventional cytogenetic analysis in the bone marrow cells of the patients with leukemia has been verified in our laboratory by FISH. The results of this study showed that FISH is more efficient than conventional cytogenetics in detecting residual malignant cells. For chromosomal rearrangements FISH is an extremely sensitive method which not only verifies but also interprets with more precision the findings of classical cytogenetics.","['Michalova, K']",['Michalova K'],"['3rd Medical Department, General Faculty Hospital, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Satellite)', '0 (RNA Probes)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetics/methods', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Satellite/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA Probes']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 1996;42(6):311-4.,13,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cells play a key role in both the primary and secondary immune responses. Several studies indicate that these cells participate in antitumor immunity, tumor surveillance, graft-versus-host disease, and in the pathogenesis of clinical syndromes of unknown origin or those induced by viruses, such as the human immunodeficiency virus. Different disorders are characterized by an abnormal proliferation and accumulation of dendritic cells; for example, the Langerhans' histiocytes, which accumulate in Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. In this review the immunophenotypic, morphological, and functional characteristics of the dendritic cell family is described. The clinical and laboratory studies suggesting a unique role for these cells in various syndromes and diseases are reviewed.

We found significantly higher -7 frequencies in metaphase than in interphase cells irrespective of diagnosis and presence or absence of additional chromosome aberrations. Further, we found a significant correlation between the -7 percentages in resting and dividing cells. Finally, as our material showed a clear male preponderance, Mitelman's Catalog of Chromosome Aberrations in Cancer was searched for -7. Of 815 cases with AML or MDS, 491 (60.3%) were found to be men. To our knowledge, this is the first observation of a clear deviation from the 1:1 sex ratio in -7 patients.","['Pedersen, B', 'Koch, J', 'Bendix Hansen, K', 'Hindkjaer, J', 'Lindbjerg Andersen, C']","['Pedersen B', 'Koch J', 'Bendix Hansen K', 'Hindkjaer J', 'Lindbjerg Andersen C']","['Danish Cancer Society Department of Cytogenetics, Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Clone Cells/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Interphase', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Middle Aged', '*Monosomy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/pathology', 'Sex Distribution']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1997;97(4):216-21. doi: 10.1159/000203686.,,,4,['10.1159/000203686 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 40 patients with multiple myeloma (MM), 5 patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), 3 patients with solitary plasmacytoma (SPC), 1 patient with chronic myelogenous leukaemia and multiple myeloma (CML/MM), and 1 patient with plasma cell leukaemia (PCL). We found that serum sIL-6R concentrations were higher in MM patients (62.53 +/- 38.85 ng/ml) than in 20 normal volunteers studied (36.75 +/- 13.79 ng/ml) (p < 0.01). The cut-off value of 65 ng/ml seen in 2 of our controls was arbitrarily taken as the upper limit of the control range for serum sIL-6R; according to this criterion, 14 patients with MM (35%), 1 patient with SPC, the unique patient with CML + MM, and the unique patient with PCL had elevated concentrations of the receptor. Patients with MGUS had normal sIL-6R values. In MM patients, serum sIL-6R levels correlated with the clinical phase of the disease: they were elevated in patients with early or late active disease and ranged within normal limits in patients with plateau-phase disease (p < 0.001). Thirteen of 27 patients with active MM had elevated serum sIL-6R values, i.e. 48.1%, but only 1 out of 13 patients with disease in the plateau phase, i.e. 7.7% (p < 0.05). Furthermore, in the entire group of MM patients, serum sIL-6R levels correlated with the concentrations of serum beta 2-microglobulin, (p < 0.02), CRP (p < 0.01), ferritin (p < 0.01) and LDH (p < 0.01), while they did not correlate with disease stage, haemoglobin levels, proportion of marrow myeloma cells, the values of serum IL-6, the levels of serum albumin, or the grade of bone lesions. We conclude that elevated serum sIL-6R levels should be related to the growth of myeloma cells and suggest that serum sIL-6R concentrations may be used as an indicator of disease activity.","['Papadaki, H', 'Kyriakou, D', 'Foudoulakis, A', 'Markidou, F', 'Alexandrakis, M', 'Eliopoulos, G D']","['Papadaki H', 'Kyriakou D', 'Foudoulakis A', 'Markidou F', 'Alexandrakis M', 'Eliopoulos GD']","['Division of Haematology, University of Crete School of Medicine, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Ferritins/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/complications/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/blood', 'Osteolysis/blood/etiology', 'Paraproteinemias/blood', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*blood', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/analysis']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1997;97(4):191-5. doi: 10.1159/000203682.,,,4,['10.1159/000203682 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mast cells and basophils also produce IL-4 or IL-13 and express CD40L after immunologic or pharmacologic stimulation, although it is unknown whether these cells express FasL. This study investigated the capacity of KU812 cells, a human basophilic cell line, to produce IL-4 and IL-13, to express CD40L and FasL, and to induce IgE and IgG4 synthesis in human normal B cells. Upon stimulation of KU812 cells with either phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) or ionomycin (Iono), IL-4, but not IL-13, was produced in response to Iono, while IL-13, but not IL-4, was inducible by PMA. Moreover, both the time courses of IL-4 and IL-13 production and their amounts secreted were different; IL-4 production was transient, IL-13 production gradually increased, and IL-13 was heavily secreted as compared with IL-4. The combination of PMA and Iono (PMA/Iono) induced higher production of IL-4 or IL-13 than did Iono or PMA alone. KU812 cell-derived IL-4 and IL-13 had the ability to cause CD23 expression on B cells. PMA/Iono also up-regulated CD40L expression and induced a very low level expression of FasL. KU812 cells that had been activated by PMA/Iono followed by fixation could induce IgE and IgG4 synthesis in B cells in the presence of recombinant IL-4 or IL-13. This contact-dependent induction of IgE was completely abrogated by adding anti-CD40L MoAb or soluble CD40, whereas anti-FasL antibody did not significantly affect IgE production. These results indicate that activated KU812 cells produce biologically active IL-4 and IL-13, express functional CD40L, and exhibit weak induction of FasL, thereby supporting sufficient IgE production by B cells.","['Yanagihara, Y', 'Kajiwara, K', 'Basaki, Y', 'Ikizawa, K', 'Akiyama, K', 'Saito, H']","['Yanagihara Y', 'Kajiwara K', 'Basaki Y', 'Ikizawa K', 'Akiyama K', 'Saito H']","['Clinical Research Centre for Allergy, National Sagamihara Hospital, Sagamihara City, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*metabolism', 'CD40 Antigens/biosynthesis', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-13/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/biosynthesis']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1997 May;108(2):295-301. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2249.1997.d01-1001.x.,,,2,['10.1046/j.1365-2249.1997.d01-1001.x [doi]'],,PMC1904657,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antisera against two different epitopes of the human ALL-1 protein (anti-ALL1-N and anti-ALL1-C) were produced. Both sera revealed indistinguishable patterns of antigen localization in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In resting PBMCs, the antigen was distributed in a speckled pattern across the nuclei, with an increased density at the nuclear envelope and the nuclear indentation. In mitotically stimulated PBMCs, the antigen surrounded the condensing chromosomes but did not colocalize with chromatin or the nuclear scaffold. The antigen is considered a marker for a novel nuclear subcompartment, a perichromosomal area termed the ""chromosomal envelope."" In Western blot experiments, the anti-ALL1-N serum reacted with a polypeptide corresponding to the expected full-length 430-kDa ALL-1 protein. Recombinant proteins representing the AT-hook and zinc binding subdomains of the ALL-1 protein interacted in vitro with a degenerate mixture of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides.

Overexpression of PML inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we further explored the possibility of applying PML as a potential agent for developing prostate cancer gene therapy using an adenovirus delivery system. We have constructed and produced the recombinant PML-adenovirus, Ad-PML, in which the full-length PML cDNA is driven by the strong cytomegalovirus promoter. In LNCaP, DU145, and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines, an infection efficiency of 90% can be achieved at a concentration of 2, 10, and 100 multiplicity of infection (MOI), respectively. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that the AD-PML-infected cells expressed a high level of PML protein. The protein expression peaked at days 3-4 postinfection, and a detectable level of PML was found at day 18 after viral infection. To test the effect of Ad-PML on the growth of prostate cancer cells, the DU145 and LNCaP cells were infected with 10 and 2 MOI of Ad-PML. We found that the growth rate of the Ad-PML-infected DU145 and LNCaP cells were significantly inhibited. A tumorigenicity test in nude mice showed that the Ad-PML-treated DU145 cells failed to form tumors. Most importantly, direct injection of Ad-PML into DU145-induced tumors was able to repress tumor growth in nude mice by 64%.

The anti-12-LOX immunoprecipitates from the patient's platelet homogenates showed a deficiency of 12-LOX activity, but contained normal amount of 12-LOX protein. There was no difference in subcellular localization of the enzyme between the patient's platelets and normal ones.

However, we could not detect any genetic mutation causing such abnormalities in all exons of 12-LOX gene by sequencing the patient's PCR-amplified DNA. Thus, our results indicate that the deficient activity of this abnormal 12-LOX protein is probably due to a posttranslational modification, and the possibility that platelets of some MPD patients have qualitative abnormality of the 12-LOX enzyme besides quantitative ones.","['Tomo, K', 'Takayama, H', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Fujita, J', 'Nakamura, M', 'Ueda, N', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Okuma, M']","['Tomo K', 'Takayama H', 'Kaneko Y', 'Fujita J', 'Nakamura M', 'Ueda N', 'Yamamoto S', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '59985-28-3 (12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid/biosynthesis', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/*blood/deficiency', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Polycythemia Vera/enzymology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*enzymology']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 1997 Feb;77(2):294-7.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identify for the first time functional receptors for ciliary neurotrophic factor and growth promoting activity on cultured ciliary ganglion neurons. [(125)I]Rat ciliary neurotrophic factor binding studies indicate that rat ciliary neurotrophic factor and growth promoting activity bind to these receptors with a single affinity, while human ciliary neurotrophic factor recognizes both a high- and low-affinity site. Comparison of the relative potency of human ciliary neurotrophic factor and avian growth promoting activity in biological assays indicates that growth promoting activity is three to five times more active in promoting survival and in regulating acetylcholine receptors. The binding of ciliary neurotrophic factor is specific, sensitive to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and partially inhibited by leukemia inhibitory factor, but not inhibited by other members of the human neurokine family, including interleukin-6, interleukin-22 and oncostatin M. Cross-linking of [(125)I]rat ciliary neurotrophic factor to ciliary neurons results in the specific labeling of three proteins with estimated molecular masses of 153,000, 81,000 and 72,000. Only the 81,000 molecular weight component is released from the cells after treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, suggesting a membrane attachment via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. Stimulation with ciliary neurotrophic factor or growth promoting activity, but not by other neurokines, results in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a 90,000 molecular weight protein that is inhibited by pretreatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. In conclusion, we report here the pharmacological and functional properties of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptors on embryonic ciliary ganglion neurons. These results provide the means for elaborating the molecular mechanisms of ciliary neurotrophic factor action and understanding its physiological role in a defined neuronal population.","['Koshlukova, S', 'Finn, T P', 'Nishi, R', 'Halvorsen, S W']","['Koshlukova S', 'Finn TP', 'Nishi R', 'Halvorsen SW']","['Department of Biochemical Pharmacology, State University of New York at Buffalo, Buffalo, NY 14260, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Chick Embryo', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Ganglia/*drug effects', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Neurons/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/*drug effects']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 1996 Jun;72(3):821-32. doi: 10.1016/0306-4522(95)00560-9.,,"['R01 NS025767/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-25767/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-30232/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",3,"['0306-4522(95)00560-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-4522(95)00560-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To find optimal combinations, further in vitro and in vivo studies of antitumor activity and toxicity appear to be warranted.","['Takagi, T', 'Yazawa, Y', 'Suzuki, K', 'Yamauchi, Y', 'Kano, Y']","['Takagi T', 'Yazawa Y', 'Suzuki K', 'Yamauchi Y', 'Kano Y']","['Division of Orthopedic Oncology, Tochigi Cancer Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '93N13LB4Z2 (amrubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthracyclines/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cattle', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;14(4):357-63. doi: 10.1007/BF00180811.,,,4,['10.1007/BF00180811 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of its extensive tissue distribution in animals and its favorable activity against multidrug resistant (MDR)-cells compared with other mitotic inhibitors, such as vincristine, we examined the membrane transport properties of CI-980. CI-980 accumulated rapidly in L1210 and CHO/K1 cells, reaching intracellular levels 40- and 8-fold higher, respectively, than those in the extracellular medium. Efflux was also quite rapid, but a small fraction of drug remained associated with the cells in drug-free medium. The uptake of CI-980 was not temperature or energy dependent, nor was it saturable up to an extracellular concentration of 100 microM. Inhibitors of nucleoside transport had no effect on CI-980 uptake. A cell line deficient in the transport of reduced folate was not resistant to CI-980, nor did it exhibit reduced CI-980 uptake. A 100-fold excess of the R-enantiomer inhibited CI-980 uptake by only 50%. These results are consistent with a model of CI-980 uptake involving passive diffusion followed by significant but largely reversible binding to intracellular or membrane components.","['Hook, K E', 'Przybranowski, S A', 'Leopold, W R']","['Hook KE', 'Przybranowski SA', 'Leopold WR']","['Parke-Davis Pharmaceutical Research, Division of Warner-Lambert Company, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', 'ICJ93X8X90 (canertinib dihydrochloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport', 'CHO Cells/metabolism', 'Carbamates/*pharmacokinetics', 'Carrier Proteins/physiology', 'Cattle', 'Cricetinae', 'Dipyridamole/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyridines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Stereoisomerism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1996;14(4):341-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00180809.,,,4,['10.1007/BF00180809 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This motivates interest in the in vivo localization of the endogenous RB protein as its phosphorylation state changes during the cell cycle and cell differentiation. It is known that in proliferating HL-60 cells all the RB protein is phosphorylated, but the extent of phosphorylation increases with progression from G1 to S to G2 + M. It has also been previously shown that retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3 shift the RB protein to the unphosphorylated state with cell differentiation (Yen, A., S. Varvayanis, Exp. Cell Res. 214, 250-257 (1994)). The dependence of cell cycle progression and differentiation on RB nuclear versus cytoplasmic localization, as well as the dependence of RB localization on phosphorylation state can thus be tested. Confocal image analysis of the RB protein in vivo shows that the ratio of the concentration of the RB tumor suppressor gene protein in the nucleus versus the cytoplasm remains stable as the RB protein undergoes either phosphorylation during cell cycle progression or dephosphorylation during cell differentiation induced by retinoic acid or 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3. For the cell cycle analysis, HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were fluorescently stained for DNA and for the RB protein. G1, S, and G2 + M subpopulations were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. For each subpopulation, the relative concentration of RB protein in the nucleus and the cytoplasm was measured by laser confocal image analysis. To determine the effect of retinoic acid-induced myeloid differentiation or 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D3-induced monocytic differentiation, the same cell sorting and image analysis was performed on cells treated with these inducers. In all cases the concentration of the RB protein in the nucleus was approximately 2 times that in the cytoplasm. Thus, the ratio of nuclear versus cytoplasmic RB protein concentration is stable and independent of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of RB during both the cell cycle and cell differentiation.","['Yen, A', 'Coder, D', 'Varvayanis, S']","['Yen A', 'Coder D', 'Varvayanis S']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-6401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/chemistry/*metabolism']",1997/02/01 00:00,1997/02/01 00:01,['1997/02/01 00:00'],"['1997/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1997 Feb;72(2):159-65.,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have measured levels of circulating IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a and soluble CD23 (sCD23) in 8 patients with Binet stage A B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) receiving IFN therapy, and compared these with changes in the lymphocyte count following IFN therapy.

In one patient there was significant correlation with levels of IL-1b. One patient, who stopped and restarted IFN therapy, demonstrated correlation between lymphocyte count and levels of IL-6 and sCD23. In a further two patients, there was correlation with levels of sCD23 alone, while the remaining three patients showed no correlation between lymphocyte count and the serum cytokines measured.

Using quantitative flow cytometry and expressing bcl-2 levels as the number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome (MESF) per cell, we have shown that bcl-2 protein expression in the blast cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) is heterogeneous, but not related to FAB type. The blast cells from AML patients with the capacity to grow and survive autonomously in vitro were found to have higher bcl-2 MESF values than those that were dependent upon exogenous growth factors. We have previously reported that the blast cells from 70% of AML patients exhibit autonomous growth and autocrine growth factor production in vitro and that this has been shown to be an important indicator of poor prognosis in AML. High bcl-2 expression has also been associated with a low complete remission rate and poor survival in AML. In the patients whose blast cells exhibited autonomous growth, neutralisation of endogenous GM-CSF resulted in down-regulation of bcl-2 protein, whereas in blast cells from patients whose cells proliferated only in the presence of added growth factors, incorporation of recombinant human (rh) GM-CSF in the culture media resulted in up-regulation of bcl-2. Because CD34 positivity has been reported as another indicator of poor prognosis in AML, we compared bcl-2 expression in cases of CD34 positive AML, CD34 negative AML and CD34 positive normal bone marrow cells. Bcl-2 was found to be strongly expressed on the CD34+ normal bone marrow cells. The blast cells from CD34+ AML patients expressed significantly higher bcl-2 levels than CD34- AML patients. In five cases of CD34+ AML, the bcl-2 levels were determined on purified CD34+ and CD34- blast cell populations. The CD34+ blast cells were found to express significantly higher bcl-2 levels compared with the CD34-blast cells. Our data would suggest that quantification of bcl-2 in AML blast cell may be useful as a prognostic indicator in AML.","['Bradbury, D A', 'Zhu, Y M', 'Russell, N H']","['Bradbury DA', 'Zhu YM', 'Russell NH']","['Department of Haematology, City Hospital Nottingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Jan;24(3-4):221-8. doi: 10.3109/10428199709039010.,48,,3-4,['10.3109/10428199709039010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, focal hypermethylation and generalised genomic demethylation are features of many different types of neoplasms. It is thought that tumorigenesis and tumour progression may be caused by hypermethylation induced mutational events and silencing of genes which control cellular proliferation and/or demethylation induced reactivation of genes which may only be required during embryological development. Consequently, we have begun to investigate the role of DNA methylation and developmental genes in malignant lymphoproliferative diseases. Previously, in all cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma and leukemia studied, we have shown that the myogenic developmental gene Myf-3 is abnormally hypermethylated. In this review we discuss the possible significance of these findings since in vitro studies suggest that Myf-3 may play an important role in control of the cell cycle and therefore lymphomagenesis. In vitro and in vivo evidence suggests that PAX genes may also have oncogenic potential. The PAX family of developmental genes are involved in cellular differentiation, proliferation and cell migration. Expression of PAX3 in particular is associated with cellular mobility. Our previous studies have indicated that alternate regional expression of PAX genes may be controlled by DNA methylation. Therefore, we have proposed that abnormal methylation profiles of PAX3 may be associated with neoplastic transformation and/or metastatic potential. Results thus far reveal that the paired box of PAX3 is abnormally hypermethylated and the homeobox abnormally hypomethylated in lymphomas and leukemias. These new findings are consistent with our postulate and support the idea that inappropriate methylation induced activation or inactivation of developmental genes such as Myf-3 and PAX3 play an important role in lymphomagenesis and disease progression and that inspection of the methylation status of other developmental genes is warranted.","['Kay, P H', 'Spagnolo, D V', 'Taylor, J', 'Ziman, M']","['Kay PH', 'Spagnolo DV', 'Taylor J', 'Ziman M']","['Department of Pathology, University of Western Australia, Nedlands, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MyoD Protein)', '0 (MyoD1 myogenic differentiation protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PAX3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX3 protein, human)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '138016-91-8 (Pax3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'MyoD Protein/*physiology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'PAX3 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', '*Transcription Factors']",1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['1997/01/01 00:00'],"['1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1997 Jan;24(3-4):211-20. doi: 10.3109/10428199709039009.,58,,3-4,['10.3109/10428199709039009 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After discontinuation of immunosuppression for chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) involving skin, gastrointestinal tract and lacrimal glands, the patient developed severe, progressive dysphagia initially attributed to esophageal candidiasis. With the development of muscle weakness, ptosis, and dysphonia the diagnosis of generalized myasthenia gravis was suspected, and confirmed by elevated anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titer and a positive edrophonium challenge. Prednisone and pyridostigmine produced improvement, and thymectomy was performed without pathologic evidence of thymoma. Recurrent post-operative respiratory distress required transient mechanical ventilation. Twenty-seven months after diagnosis, the patient requires maintenance prednisone to control symptoms of myasthenia gravis. The clinical features of all reported cases of MG post-allogeneic BMT are reviewed, and universal features include an association with decreasing immunosuppression, the presence of other manifestations of chronic GVHD, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, and the absence of an associated thymoma. HLA Cw1, Cw7 and DR2 were identified at frequencies significantly above that expected from HLA antigen prevalance studies, and may be markers for increased risk of developing MG post-allogeneic BMT. No statistically significant associations with HLA A2, B7, B35 or donor-recipient sex mismatch were present.

The longest patient is now 6 years post-DLI, Ph negative, BCR-ABL negative. The actuarial 3 year survival is 38% in group A and 86% in group B (P = 0.06). The study confirms that DLI post-BMT is not innocuous and that there is a definite long-lasting antileukemic effect in patients with CML. It also suggests that: (1) the risk of developing GVHD correlates with the number of infused cells; (2) that significant elevations of serum GPT levels are associated with GVHD; and (3) that the use of escalating doses of cells may allow the identification of side-effects and discontinuation of infusions before life-threatening GVHD has developed.","['Bacigalupo, A', 'Soracco, M', 'Vassallo, F', 'Abate, M', 'Van Lint, M T', 'Gualandi, F', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Occhini, D', 'Mordini, N', 'Bregante, S', 'Figari, O', 'Benvenuto, F', 'Sessarego, M', 'Fugazza, G', 'Carlier, P', 'Valbonesi, M']","['Bacigalupo A', 'Soracco M', 'Vassallo F', 'Abate M', 'Van Lint MT', 'Gualandi F', 'Lamparelli T', 'Occhini D', 'Mordini N', 'Bregante S', 'Figari O', 'Benvenuto F', 'Sessarego M', 'Fugazza G', 'Carlier P', 'Valbonesi M']","['Divisione Ematologia II, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 May;19(9):927-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700762.,,,9,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700762 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to generate 122 recipient-reactive T cell clones from a closely HLA-matched sibling responder. Clones were tested for their proliferative response to stimulator CML cells or PHA-transformed (non-leukemic) lymphoblasts. Of 78 clones tested, 32 recognized both leukemia cells and PHA blasts, 19 only CML and four only PHA blasts. The remainder were non-specific responders. This functional specificity corresponded to distinct patterns of T cell receptor (TCR) V beta usage: clones recognizing CML cells preferentially used V beta 5, V beta 6/7 while clones recognizing both CML and PHA blasts or only PHA blasts preferentially used V beta 3 and V beta 8. It may therefore be possible to identify in vitro-generated myeloid leukemia-restricted donor T cells by their pattern of V beta usage. TCR V beta antibodies could thus be used to select and expand leukemia-restricted donor T cells for transfusion after BMT to specifically enhance the GVL response.","['Jiang, Y Z', 'Mavroudis, D A', 'Dermime, S', 'Molldrem, J', 'Hensel, N F', 'Barrett, A J']","['Jiang YZ', 'Mavroudis DA', 'Dermime S', 'Molldrem J', 'Hensel NF', 'Barrett AJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Reaction/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 May;19(9):899-903. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700769.,,,9,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700769 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report a study in three recipients of autologous bone marrow transplantation done as part of the treatment for acute leukaemia, in whom we were able to detect innate specific anti-leukaemia activity post-transplant. One patient maintained selective cell-mediated cytolytic activity against her autologous leukaemic cells in the absence of cytolysis of her normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC). She remains in complete remission 3 years after ABMT for acute myeloid leukaemia (M5). A second patient was transplanted for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and had detectable anti-leukaemia activity up to 20 weeks post-ABMT. At this point anti-leukaemia activity could no longer be demonstrated and the patient suffered a relapse 2 weeks later. A third patient was transplanted for AML (M4 Eo) and lacked detectable leukaemia-specific immune reactivity at 1, 3 and 6 months post-ABMT. She relapsed 6 months after her ABMT and returned to complete remission after further chemotherapy. She commenced treatment with alpha interferon and regained NK function. Furthermore, she developed high level cytolytic activity against her autologous leukaemic cells in the absence of activity against her remission bone marrow samples. She remains in complete remission 17 months after her initial relapse. This is the first report of an apparent association between in vitro leukaemia-specific cytolytic activity in individual patients after ABMT and clinical outcome. It encourages the theory that autologous immunomodulation may be useful in the future treatment of leukaemia.","['Lowdell, M W', 'Ray, N', 'Craston, R', 'Corbett, T', 'Deane, M', 'Prentice, H G']","['Lowdell MW', 'Ray N', 'Craston R', 'Corbett T', 'Deane M', 'Prentice HG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital and School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 May;19(9):891-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700756.,,,9,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700756 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Societe Francaise de Greffe de Moelle (SFGM).,875-81,"Allogeneic BMT for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is presently a reference therapy. The indications for this therapy mainly rely upon prognostic factors, and their importance is constantly reassessed. To examine the impact of time from diagnosis to transplant on survival and leukemia-free survival (LFS), we analyzed 109 patients from the database of the SFGM comprising patients who had all received an HLA-identical allogeneic BMT for a diagnosis of AML in first complete remission (CR1) between January 1987 and December 1992. All patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation (TBI) (CYTBI), and methotrexate (MTX) + cyclosporin A (CsA) were used as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patient characteristics were: age = 33 +/- 9, M/F = 64/45, white blood cell count (WBC) at diagnosis = 27 +/- 42 x 10(9)/l, FAB distribution: M1 and M2 = 55; M3 = 15, M4 and M5 = 33, M0, M6 and M7 = 6. Karyotyping was carried out for 64 patients: 32 had a normal karyotype, 16 had good prognosis abnormalities (t(8;21), t(15;17), inv 16) and 16 patients had other abnormalities. Eleven patients needed two courses of induction to achieve CR. Time between diagnosis and BMT was 120 (64-287) days. Forty-nine patients developed grade > or = 2 acute GVHD (actuarial probability = 46%). With a median follow-up of 50 months (27-100), the 5-year probabilities for transplant-related mortality (TRM), relapse, overall survival and LFS are respectively 25%, 26%, 59% and 55%. A multivariate analysis showed that survival is adversely influenced by three independent factors: time to transplant (> 120 days vs < or = 120 days), acute GVHD (grade 2-4 vs grade 0-1) and age (> 33 vs < or = 33). LFS is only influenced by the first two of these factors. The favorable impact of a shorter time from diagnosis to transplant should lead to performing the transplant as early as possible. Practically speaking, this means that when such therapy is chosen for a patient with CR1 AML, the search for an allogeneic donor should begin immediately and transplant be performed as soon as possible.","['Jourdan, E', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Reiffers, J', 'Gluckman, E', 'Rio, B', 'Jouet, J P', 'Michallet, M', 'Molina, L', 'Archimbaud, E', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Ifrah, N', 'Attal, M', 'Guilhot, F', 'Kuentz, M', 'Guyotat, D', 'Pico, J L', 'Dauriac, C', 'Legros, M', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Leblond, V', 'Gratecos, N', 'Varet, B', 'Auzanneau, C', 'Blaise, D']","['Jourdan E', 'Maraninchi D', 'Reiffers J', 'Gluckman E', 'Rio B', 'Jouet JP', 'Michallet M', 'Molina L', 'Archimbaud E', 'Harousseau JL', 'Ifrah N', 'Attal M', 'Guilhot F', 'Kuentz M', 'Guyotat D', 'Pico JL', 'Dauriac C', 'Legros M', 'Dreyfus F', 'Bordigoni P', 'Leblond V', 'Gratecos N', 'Varet B', 'Auzanneau C', 'Blaise D', 'et al.']","['Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/05/01 00:00,1997/05/01 00:01,['1997/05/01 00:00'],"['1997/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 May;19(9):875-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700761.,,,9,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700761 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, all patients in good condition were eligible for second transplants except for post-allograft relapses from 1993-1994 onwards who received cytokine- or cell-mediated immunotherapy. The major reason for patients not progressing to second graft was death from progressive disease or toxicity of salvage chemotherapy. Seventeen of 231 patients (7%) were alive at the last follow-up. Six of 14 post-autograft relapses treated with second transplants were alive and well, compared with five of 103 not undergoing second grafts (P < 0.0001). One of 23 post-allograft recipients treated with second allografts was alive with an extramedullary relapse, compared with five of 13 receiving immunotherapy and none of 78 receiving standard-dose or palliative therapy (P < 0.0001). We conclude that only a small proportion of highly selected acute leukemia patients relapsing after a transplant reach the stage of a conventional second transplant. In our experience, second allografts after myeloablative therapy in patients relapsing after one allograft are associated with very poor results, and immunotherapy may be a better approach in such cases. Selected patients relapsing after an autograft may become long-term survivors following a second autograft or an allograft.","['Mehta, J', 'Powles, R', 'Treleaven, J', 'Horton, C', 'Meller, S', 'Pinkerton, C R', 'Singhal, S']","['Mehta J', 'Powles R', 'Treleaven J', 'Horton C', 'Meller S', 'Pinkerton CR', 'Singhal S']","['Leukaemia Unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia/pathology/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Apr;19(7):709-19. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700720.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700720 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have analyzed by PCR amplification of several VNTR regions, sequential bone marrow and peripheral blood DNA samples in four patients who received DLT for CML relapse after bone marrow transplantation. Prior to DLT, all patients showed mixed chimerism in peripheral blood cells while two had mixed chimerism and two no chimerism in the BM. None of these four patients showed evidence of chimerism at the cytogenetic level (all had 100% +ve metaphases). After DLT, a complete hematologic and molecular remission (ie disappearance of the BCR/ABL fusion transcript) was obtained in the two patients who had bone marrow mixed chimerism prior to DLT. The two patients without evidence of marrow chimerism prior to DLT converted to a pattern of mixed chimerism after DLT, but both developed a severe bone marrow aplasia occurring at day 56 and 36, respectively. With regard to the sequential analysis of bone marrow chimerism after DLT we observed that: (1) the disappearance of BCR/ABL +ve cells paralleled the conversion to a pattern of full donor chimerism; and (2) the time interval to achieve CR was inversely correlated with the percentage of donor DNA in bone marrow. In conclusion, we have shown here that the assessment of bone marrow pre-DLT chimerism by PCR analysis might predict the response in patients with favorable characteristics, and also might identify patients at high risk of developing severe myelosuppression.","['Rapanotti, M C', 'Arcese, W', 'Buffolino, S', 'Iori, A P', 'Mengarelli, A', 'De Cuia, M R', 'Cardillo, A', 'Cimino, G']","['Rapanotti MC', 'Arcese W', 'Buffolino S', 'Iori AP', 'Mengarelli A', 'De Cuia MR', 'Cardillo A', 'Cimino G']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza of Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transplantation Chimera/*genetics']",1997/04/01 00:00,1997/04/01 00:01,['1997/04/01 00:00'],"['1997/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1997/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1997 Apr;19(7):703-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1700723.,,,7,['10.1038/sj.bmt.1700723 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
